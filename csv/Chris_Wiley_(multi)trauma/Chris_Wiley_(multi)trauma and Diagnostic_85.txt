AB  - Abstract Azygos vein aneurysm is a rare disease. Surgical resection is usually performed when it ruptures. To avoid the thromboembolism, procedures that do not touch or push the aneurysm are recommended. Herein, we report a case of idiopathic azygos vein aneurysm. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for right lateral chest pain. Chest enhanced multi-detector CT revealed an azygos vein aneurysm in the posterior mediastinal space. No thrombus in the aneurysm was detected before surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed to treat the aneurysm. The patient was discharged from the hospital 4?days after surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was a good option to treat an azygos vein aneurysm, and an enhanced multi-detector CT was useful for performing surgery safely.

AB  - SUMMARY With the advent of standard flow cytometric methods using two-colour fluorescence on samples of whole blood, it is possible to establish the ranges of CD3. CD 4 and CDS T lymphocyte subsets in the routine laboratory, and also to assist the definition of HIV-1-related deviations from these normal values. In 676 HIV-1-seronegative individuals the lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts were determined. The samples taken mostly in the morning. The groups included heterosexual controls, people with various clotting disorders but without lymphocyte abnormalities as well as seronegative homosexual men as the appropriate controls for the HIV-1-infected groups. The stability of CD4% and CD8% values was demonstrated throughout life, and in children CD4 values < 25% could be regarded as abnormal. The absolute counts of all T cell subsets decreased from birth until the age of 10 years. In adolescents and adults the absolute numbers (mean±s.d.) of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells were 1·90±0·55, 1·45±0·46, 0·83±0·29 and 0·56± 0·23 ± 109/l, respectively. In patients with haemophilia A and B the mean values did not differ significantly. In homosexual men higher CD8 levels were seen compared with heterosexual men and 27% had an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio but mostly without CD4 lymphopenia (CD4<0·4 ± 109/l). However, some healthy uninfected people were?physiologically? lymphopenic without having inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. When the variations?within persons? were studied longitudinally over a 5-year period, the absolute CD4 counts tended to be fixed at different levels. As a marked contrast, over 60% of asymptomatic HIV-1+ patients exhibited low CD4 counts <0·4 ± 109/l together with inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. Such combined changes among the heterosexual and HIV-1-seronegative homosexual groups were as rare as 1·4% and 3%, respectively. For this reason, when the lymphocyte tests show <0·4 ± 109/l CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than unity, the individuals need to be investigated further for chronicity of this disorder, the signs of viral infections such as HIV-1 and other causes of immunodeficiency.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Detailed oral and dental examination is best performed under general anaesthesia. This allows tests such as pocket depth assessment and intra-oral radiography to be optimally performed. A dental chart is used as a tool to allow efficient recording of information for diagnostic, monitoring and medico-legal purposes. Quantitative measurements and indices are used to score pathology where possible. This information is used in parallel with additional tests, both systemic and local, e.g. blood biochemistry and histopathology respectively, in order to reach a diagnosis and prognosis for the individual's oral status and specific dentition where appropriate. It is vital to thoroughly examine both extra-oral and intra-oral areas and soft and hard tissues alike.

AB  - Purpose To implement and optimize a new approach for susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) generation from multi-echo multi-channel image data and compare its performance against optimized traditional SWI pipelines. Materials and Methods Five healthy volunteers were imaged at 7 Tesla. The inter-echo-variance (IEV) channel combination, which uses the variance of the local frequency shift at multiple echo times as a weighting factor during channel combination, was used to calculate multi-echo local phase shift maps. Linear phase masks were combined with the magnitude to generate IEV-SWI. The performance of the IEV-SWI pipeline was compared with that of two accepted SWI pipelines?channel combination followed by (i) Homodyne filtering (HPH-SWI) and (ii) unwrapping and high-pass filtering (SVD-SWI). The filtering steps of each pipeline were optimized. Contrast-to-noise ratio was used as the comparison metric. Qualitative assessment of artifact and vessel conspicuity was performed and processing time of pipelines was evaluated. Results The optimized IEV-SWI pipeline (σ?=?7?mm) resulted in continuous vessel visibility throughout the brain. IEV-SWI had significantly higher contrast compared with HPH-SWI and SVD-SWI (P?<?0.001, Friedman nonparametric test). Residual background fields and phase wraps in HPH-SWI and SVD-SWI corrupted the vessel signal and/or generated vessel-mimicking artifact. Optimized implementation of the IEV-SWI pipeline processed a six-echo 16-channel dataset in under 10?min. Conclusion IEV-SWI benefits from channel-by-channel processing of phase data and results in high contrast images with an optimal balance between contrast and background noise removal, thereby presenting evidence of importance of the order in which postprocessing techniques are applied for multi-channel SWI generation.

AB  - Classification of dementia involves the recognition of its presence, followed by the differential diagnosis of its cause. Informant-based methods for dementia detection can be highly sensitive, even when cognitive impairment is mild. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is by far the leading cause of dementia; standardized clinical criteria result in high diagnostic accuracy rates. Classification of other dementing disorders is less satisfactory, particularly because there is frequent clinical and pathological overlap with AD. After AD, the most common causes of dementia are vascular dementia and dementia in persons with Parkinson's disease. Less common dementias include progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and inherited metabolic disorders, most of which are extremely rare. Identifying the cause of dementia is important because some forms can be treated with currently available therapies. In instances involving genetically transmitted disease, genetic testing and counseling of family members may be advisable.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - Summary Pituitary apoplexy is a rare clinical syndrome comprising sudden-onset severe headache accompanied by visual deficit, or extraocular muscle nerve palsy, or reduced conscious level. It may be misdiagnosed as meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Pituitary apoplexy results from haemorrhage into or infarction of a pre-existing pituitary tumour, and is almost invariably associated with hypopituitarism. A prior diagnosis of pituitary tumour is usually absent, with the apoplexy representing the first presentation of a previously unrecognized tumour in 80% of cases. Patients with pituitary apoplexy should, once stabilized, be transferred to a neurosurgical centre for the multidisciplinary management of an experienced pituitary surgeon, neuro-ophthalmologist and endocrinologist. Apoplexy may be precipitated by many factors; hypertension is the commonest. Conditions causing wide variations of blood pressure, including major surgery, are frequently implicated. Other known risk factors include head trauma, anticoagulant therapy or clotting disorders and pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract Aim Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, poor function and predisposing to cancer recurrence. Earlier diagnosis and intervention can minimize systemic complications but is hindered by current diagnostic methods that are non-specific and often uninformative. The purpose of this paper is to review current developments in the field and to identify strategies for early detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage. Method A systematic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included ?anastomosis? and ?leak? and ?diagnosis? or ?detection? and ?gastrointestinal? or ?colorectal?. Papers concentrating on the diagnosis of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak were identified and further searches were performed by cross-referencing. Results Computerized tomography CT scanning and water-soluble contrast studies are the current preferred techniques for diagnosing anastomotic leakage but suffer from variable sensitivity and specificity, have logistical constraints and may delay timely intervention. Intra-operative endoscopy and imaging may offer certain advantages, but the ability to predict anastomotic leakage is unproven. Newer techniques involve measurement of biomarkers for anastomotic leakage and have the potential advantage of providing cheap real-time monitoring for postoperative complications. Conclusion Current diagnostic tests often fail to diagnose anastomotic leak at an early stage that enables timely intervention and minimizes serious morbidity and mortality. Emerging technologies, based on detection of local biomarkers, have achieved proof of concept status but require further evaluation to determine whether they translate into improved patient outcomes. Further research is needed to address this important, yet relatively unrecognized, area of unmet clinical need.

AB  - Inconsistencies and inadequacies in both the approach to post-mortem examination of the heart and the subsequent reporting of findings have been blamed for a lack of progression of understanding about great ape cardiovascular disease. In order to minimize and confront these issues in the United States, Association of Zoos and Aquariums-member zoos have necropsy data collated by the Great Ape Heart Project using a protocol developed by their pathology advisors. In Europe, however, there does not appear to be in existence any standardization or process for consistent cardiac post-mortem examination, data collection and/or relevant research. This article provides those readers working within/for European collections with a suggested protocol for the initial post-mortem inspection and sampling of the hearts of great apes. This article also outlines the detailed macroscopic and histopathologic examination that is currently carried out at The University of Nottingham, UK, as part of an ongoing prospective, multi-centre study into great ape cardiovascular disease aetiopathogenesis. Finally, readers are offered guidance on the reporting and description specifically of idiopathic myocardial fibrosis (also referred to elsewhere as fibrosing cardiomyopathy). The standardized post-mortem examination of the great ape heart across European zoological collections will ensure a more uniform sampling procedure resulting in the availability of consistent good-quality data. It is hoped that this will, in turn, inform diagnostic pathology and research in this area, and enhance understanding about the aetiopathogenesis of great ape cardiovascular lesions.

AB  - Objective? To review the gross, microscopic, and functional anatomy of the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) in dogs. Study Design? Literature review. Methods? Reports of the anatomy and function of the cruciate ligaments in dogs were retrieved by search of the 1975?2005 PubMed database. Results? The CCL has an important biomechanical function resisting cranial drawer, hyperextension, and internal rotation and acts to fine tune and guide the stifle through its rolling and sliding motion. It has a complex architecture, and distinct geographic regions within the ligament have different functional roles depending on the angle and loading conditions. Collagen type I is the main component of the extracellular matrix; the fibrils have a crimped structure. The cruciate ligaments are almost completely covered by synovium, protecting them from synovial fluid. Cruciate blood supply is mainly of soft tissue origin. The intraligamentous network is relatively limited whereas the core of the middle third of the CCL is even less well vascularized. Neurohistologic studies are very limited in the dog. Various mechanoreceptors and proprioceptive receptors have been identified within the substance of the cruciate ligaments. Conclusions? CCL structural characteristics play an important part in its complex behaviour with the crimped pattern of the collagen fibrils being an important determinant of its biomechanical properties. In contrast to reports of managing CCL rupture, there are few reports describing the microanatomy and neurovascular morphology of the cruciate ligaments. Clinical Relevance? Cruciate disease is likely multi-factorial. Improved understanding of CCL degradation leading to CCL rupture is critical to development of new diagnostic tests for cruciate disease in dogs. Appropriate intervention during the early stages of disease process might preserve CCL structural properties by preventing further collagen degradation. Accurate knowledge of functional and fiber bundle anatomy is imperative for reconstruction and restoration of normal stifle joint physiology. Reconstructive goals should alleviate existing instability and mimic normal kinematics. Knowledge of the exact function of the CCL in the neuromuscular control around the stifle joint could possibly explain osteoarthritis progression after CCL damage.

AB  - Objective To (1) describe minimally invasive transurethral antegrade and retrograde techniques for the placement of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) to reestablish urethral patency in cats with non-urolith urethral obstructions and (2) to report the procedural complications, incontinence rates, and long-term effectiveness in maintaining a patent urethra. Study Design Case series. Animals Cats (n?=?8). Methods Signalment, history, clinical signs, physical examination, severity of stranguria and incontinence, clinicopathologic data, diagnostic procedures performed, diagnosis, interventional technique, type and dimensions of stent placed, complications and final outcome of 8 cats treated with SEMS for the management of urethral strictures or masses are presented. Each cat was followed for ≥12 months. Follow-up information was obtained from the medical record or by telephone interview of the owner and/or referring veterinarian. Results Four cats were continent after stent placement, 2 were moderately incontinent, and 2 were severely incontinent. Long-term follow-up (median, 462 days) was available. At follow-up, 5 cats were alive and 3 had been euthanatized at 88, 233, and 305 days. Long-term outcome, as assessed by the authors, was good (1) to excellent (3) in 4 cats, and fair (2) to poor (2) in 4 cats. Owner reported outcomes were excellent in 3/8, good to excellent in 1/8, good in 2/8, and poor in 2/8. Conclusion Palliative stenting of urethral obstructions is a minimally invasive method to re-establish urethral patency in cats.

AB  - Objective To provide (1) a comprehensive description of hemipelvectomy; and (2) report clinical application and outcome of hemipelvectomy in dogs and cats. Study Design Descriptive report and retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?4) and 5 cats. Methods Cadaveric dissection was performed for imaging purposes using 4 mixed breed dogs euthanatized for reasons unrelated to this study. Medical records (2005?2012) were reviewed for dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy. Data collected included signalment, body weight, body condition score, clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging findings, location and extent of tumor, definitive diagnosis, use of adjuvant therapy, ability to ambulate postoperatively, complications, and survival. Results The most common indication for hemipelvectomy in cats was injection site sarcoma (ISS) and in dogs, osteosarcoma or peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST). Complete tumor excision was achieved in 6 (67%) cases. Incomplete excision occurred in 2 dogs with lumbosacral PNST and 1 cat having a 2nd surgery for ISS. Complications included intraoperative hemorrhage (n?=?2), postoperative soft tissue infection (2), and discharge from the incision site (1). All but 1 animal were ambulatory at the time of discharge. Hospitalization ranged from 1?10 days (median, 4 days). Survival after surgery was individually assessed. Conclusion With in-depth anatomic familiarity, hemipelvectomy can be successful for excision of neoplastic lesions of the proximal aspect of the pelvic limb, with only minor complications.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that extracellular ubiquitin has pleiotropic effects on host defence mechanisms, but its cellular mechanism of action is not yet understood. Using fluorescence and in vivo confocal microscopy, we observed uptake of N-terminal fluorescein-labelled ubiquitin into human PBMC and MonoMac 6 cells. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that extracellular ubiquitin is then rapidly conjugated to a multitude of intracellular proteins. LPS and lipoteichoic acid significantly increased uptake and subsequent conjugation to intracellular proteins dose dependently. This mechanism showed saturation kinetics with a K d value for ubiquitin in the low nanomolar range (<10 nmol/L) and a B max value of 0.14?0.27 ?mol ubiquitin/mg protein. These results suggest that the monocytic ubiquitin system can be targeted with physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular ubiquitin during inflammation. This concept could provide a simple explanation for a multitude of extracellular ubiquitin's actions and open up new strategies to influence ubiquitin-dependent intracellular processes.
