AB  - Aim Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported to predict survival in several types of malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate their predictive value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We retrospectively analyzed plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer levels from 252 subjects: control (n?=?20), hepatitis (n?=?20), cirrhosis (n?=?20), and HCC (n?=?192) subjects. The clinical involvement and prognostic value of fibrinogen and D-dimer was analyzed in HCC subjects. To confirm the effects of tumor on hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured in nude mice following HCC inoculation. Results Fibrinogen decreased and D-dimer increased in cirrhosis subjects relative to other groups. In HCC subjects, elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were significantly associated with adverse tumor features (increased size, stage, and grade) and systemic inflammation. Patients with HCC with either elevated fibrinogen or D-dimer levels had significantly higher 3-year tumor recurrence rates (65% vs. 41%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 67% vs. 40%, P?=?0.011 for D-dimer) and significantly lower 3-year overall survival rates (57% vs. 79%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 56% vs. 80%, P?=?0.001 for D-dimer). After multivariate analysis, elevated fibrinogen levels remained an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Finally, elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were confirmed in nude mice following tumor inoculation. Conclusion The fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, elevating after carcinogenesis, may serve as simple but effective predictors of adverse tumor profiles and outcomes in HCC.

AB  - Objective To (1) describe minimally invasive transurethral antegrade and retrograde techniques for the placement of self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) to reestablish urethral patency in cats with non-urolith urethral obstructions and (2) to report the procedural complications, incontinence rates, and long-term effectiveness in maintaining a patent urethra. Study Design Case series. Animals Cats (n?=?8). Methods Signalment, history, clinical signs, physical examination, severity of stranguria and incontinence, clinicopathologic data, diagnostic procedures performed, diagnosis, interventional technique, type and dimensions of stent placed, complications and final outcome of 8 cats treated with SEMS for the management of urethral strictures or masses are presented. Each cat was followed for ≥12 months. Follow-up information was obtained from the medical record or by telephone interview of the owner and/or referring veterinarian. Results Four cats were continent after stent placement, 2 were moderately incontinent, and 2 were severely incontinent. Long-term follow-up (median, 462 days) was available. At follow-up, 5 cats were alive and 3 had been euthanatized at 88, 233, and 305 days. Long-term outcome, as assessed by the authors, was good (1) to excellent (3) in 4 cats, and fair (2) to poor (2) in 4 cats. Owner reported outcomes were excellent in 3/8, good to excellent in 1/8, good in 2/8, and poor in 2/8. Conclusion Palliative stenting of urethral obstructions is a minimally invasive method to re-establish urethral patency in cats.

AB  - Abstract There has been tremendous change in young children's mental health over the past 20 years. Early childhood (0?5 years) is now recognized as a crucial period for the development of self-regulation, a critical set of competencies that have implications for adaptive functioning in school and through the life span. As the field presses forward to address the mental health needs of young children, success will be optimized by a well-informed assessment approach. This chapter reviews important issues for consideration when planning assessments with young children: (1) contextual factors, including the caregiving environments (e.g., home, child care, early education environments), caregiver influences on social-emotional functioning and assessment, recent changes in family structure or contextual stressors, and sociocultural factors; (2) children's functioning in other developmental domains, including language, cognition, adaptive functioning, health, and sensory; (3) the goals and purposes of the assessment and evaluation setting; (4) psychometric issues, including reliability, validity, developmental sensitivity, and cultural validity; and (5) interpretation of the whole child in relation to contextual and developmental factors and evaluation of impairment. A primary goal is to help clinicians and researchers determine the most suitable measures from a wide array of parent and other caregiver reports and observational and direct assessment measures. A variety of assessments that have demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity in young children, including screening instruments, comprehensive dimensional assessments, and psychiatric diagnostic interviews, are reviewed. Finally, ongoing challenges, future directions, and exciting opportunities in research and clinical applications in early childhood assessment are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: To review aetiology, clinical signs and outcome of cats surgically treated for septic peritonitis (2000-2007). Methods: A retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were the identification of intracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils and/or a positive culture from abdominal fluid and exploratory coeliotomy. Aetiology, clinical signs, haematological and biochemical parameters, surgical treatment and outcome were recorded and analysed. Results: Twenty-six cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Abdominal pain was reported in 10 (38 per cent) and vomiting was reported in 11 (42 per cent) of the cats. The most common aetiology was trauma (31 per cent). The principal source of contamination was the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperlactataemia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperglycaemia were reported in 9, 13 and 14 of the 26 cases, respectively. Non-survivors had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations than survivors (P=0·02). Nineteen cats were managed with primary closure, two with closed suction drains and three with open peritoneal drainage. Twelve (46 per cent) cats survived to discharge. Clinical Significance: In cats, lethargy, depression and anorexia were more common clinical signs than abdominal pain. Lactate level at the time of diagnosis may be a useful prognostic indicator in cats. The proportion of cats that survived was lower than previously reported and owners should be given a guarded prognosis.

AB  - Background: A therapeutic model for supporting families of children with a chronic illness or disability is described. The model presupposes that the chronic illness and/or disability of a child constitutes a trauma for the entire family. Method: This paper describes a therapeutic model currently in practice and links it back to psychological dynamics addressed through the clinical interventions and the principles that underlie the model of service. Results: Service delivery comprises the interventions; counselling, psychological first aid, projects, peer groups, parent mentoring, social events and community education. The model is family centred, non-illness specific, preventative, non-linear and flexible. Conclusions: The interventions offered in the model aim to address the psychological dynamics of hope, empowerment, reconnection, coping/resilience and reframing.

AB  - Abstract Acoustic schwannomas (AS) are a treatable cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Currently, the gold standard magnetic resonance (MR) examination for exclusion of acoustic schwannoma is gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images of the cerebropontine angles (CPA). The FIESTA (fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition) sequence is a true-FISP (free induction steady-state precession) sequence that provides high-resolution fluid-bright images of the CPAs and basal cisterns. The T1-weighted sequence adds cost and time to the examination, and possibility of contrast medium reaction exists. This study of 50 patients compared the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images and FIESTA images. The hypothesis was that the FIESTA sequence could repIACe the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images for the diagnosis of AS. The results showed that in 98% of cases, this was possible. The conclusion was that when the FIESTA sequence does not demonstrate AS, this sequence may be employed in isolation. However, gadolinium-enhanced images should be employed when pathology is seen and to follow-up post-surgical patients.

AB  - Abstract A three-group quasi-experimental design contrasted the responses of rescue workers to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Interstate 880 freeway collapse (n = 198) with responses to critical incident exposure of Bay Area Controls (n = 140) and San Diego Controls (n = 101). The three groups were strikingly similar with respect to demographics and years of emergency service. The I-880 group reported higher exposure, greater immediate threat appraisal, and more sick days. The three groups did not differ on current symptoms. For the sample as a whole EMT/ Paramedics reported higher peritraumatic dissociation compared with Police. EMT/ Paramedics and California road workers reported higher symptoms compared with Police and Fire personnel. Nine percent of the sample were characterized as having symptom levels typical of psychiatric outpatients. Compared with lower distress responders, those with greater distress reported greater exposure, greater peritraumatic emotional distress, greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater perceived threat, and less preparation for the critical incident.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate the feasibility of placing bi-cortical cortex (B-cort) or mono-cortical locking screws (M-lock) in a plate-rod construct applied to the feline tibia in combination with different intramedullary (IM) pins. Methods Twenty-four feline tibiae of cats were divided into 4 groups, corresponding to IM pin sizes filling approximately 30% (1.0 mm), 40% (1.4 mm), 45% (1.6 mm), and 50% (1.8 mm) of the medullary canal. Computed tomography (CT) was performed to trace potential screw trajectories in each group. A 12-hole, 2.4 mm locking compression plate was then applied on the medial aspect of the tibia. M-lock and B-cort screws were inserted subsequently in each plate hole. Success rates of screw insertion based on CT analysis and cadaveric simulation were compared with screw type, IM pin diameter, and anatomic location as variables. Results Screw insertion rates were underestimated on CT compared to cadaveric specimens. During cadaveric simulation, B-cort screws could be inserted in all specimens in the 3 most proximal plate holes and in at least 1 of the 3 distal plate holes. The smallest pin size (30%) allowed placement of a greater number of B-cort screws (P?<?.05) compared to other pins. Fewer B-cort screws could be inserted in the distal diaphyseal region (P?<?.05) compared to other regions. A total of 99.3% of M-lock screws could be inserted regardless of IMP size. Clinical significance Plate rod constructs can include bicortical screws in the proximal and distal metaphysis, and monocortical screws in the diaphysis, combined with an IM pin filling up to 50% of the medullary canal.

AB  - Summary Forelimb lameness is a common clinical sign in companion animal practice. It may result from primary musculoskeletal or neurological disease. It may also be secondary to systemic pathology, as from metastatic cancer. Lists of differential diagnoses for this clinical sign are extensive, and no one summary of forelimb lameness can be exhaustive. The goal of this chapter is not to summarize all of forelimb lameness in one sitting. Rather? the emphasis is on the most common presentations that are seen in cats and dogs. This chapter will provide an overview as to how these common clinical complaints present and how they may manifest on physical examination. In addition, this chapter will introduce the concept of a diagnostic plan for the work-up of forelimb lameness. Imaging studies are valuable diagnostic tools when it comes to the skeletal system of both dogs and cats because their small and compact size may make it challenging to identify fractures and other injuries based upon palpation alone. Because there are so many causes of forelimb lameness, it is critical that clinicians take a step back to evaluate the entire clinical picture. Patients may present for forelimb lameness; however, this clinical sign does not necessary occur in a vacuum. Signalment and history taking guide the clinician's journey to unearth clinical answers by prioritizing those causes that are most likely.

AB  - Abstract In Australia, oral cancer accounts for approximately 2?3 per cent of all cancers, and approximately 1 per cent of deaths from cancer. The incidence of intra-oral cancer is gradually increasing. It is now well established that early detection of potentially malignant disease can improve the clinical outcome for patients, and as such it is the responsibility of dentists to identify such lesions early. To facilitate early detection of suspicious oral lesions several clinical methods of detection can be used. In addition to conventional visual screening of oral tissues with the naked eye under projected incandescent or halogen illumination, there are many clinical diagnostic aids that can be undertaken to help detect oral cancer. In this article we explore clinically available modalities that may be used by the general dental practitioner, and highlight their inherent strengths and weaknesses.

AB  - Abstract Alterations of blood rheology (hemorheology) are important for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention of many diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, sickle cell anemia, thromboembolism, trauma, inflammation, and malignancy. However, real-time in vivo assessment of multiple hemorheological parameters over long periods of time has not been reported. Here, we review the capabilities of label-free photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal (PT) flow cytometry for dynamic monitoring of hemorhelogical parameters in vivo which we refer to as photoacoustic and photothermal blood rheology. Using phenomenological models, we analyze correlations between both PT and PA signal characteristics in the dynamic modes and following determinants of blood rheology: red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, deformability, shape (e.g., as in sickle cells), intracellular hemoglobin distribution, individual cell velocity, hematocrit, and likely shear rate. We present ex vivo and in vivo experimental verifications involving high-speed PT imaging of RBCs, identification of sickle cells in a mouse model of human sickle cell disease and in vivo monitoring of complex hemorheological changes (e.g., RBC deformability, hematocrit and RBC aggregation). The multi-parameter platform that integrates PT, PA, and conventional optical techniques has potential for translation to clinical applications using safe, portable, laser-based medical devices for point-of-care screening of disease progression and therapy efficiency. ? 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Abstract Urinary diversion techniques are commonly required in the emergency room to correct life-threatening electrolyte and metabolic derangements resulting from urinary tract obstruction or leakage. These techniques may be permanent or temporary; temporary techniques are most often utilized in the ER to avoid long periods of anesthesia or sedation in critically ill animals as part of damage control surgical techniques. The most commonly used diversion technique is urethral catheterization. However, depending on the location of obstruction or trauma, other techniques such as cystostomy tubes or abdominal drainage catheters may be indicated. The implementation of interventional radiology in veterinary patients has also provided many alternative techniques within this setting.

AB  - A case report of stage IV neuroblastoma which presented with periorbital swelling and ecchymosis originally misdiagnosed as facial trauma. The child soon developed a sinister pancytopenia, which following extensive investigations was revealed to be due to an underlying neuroblastoma. Periorbital ecchymosis associated with neuroblastoma is termed ?raccoon eyes? and is a diagnostic trap for the unwary.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Atrial fibrillation is a common equine arrhythmia. Quinidine alone, or with digoxin are common treatments. Studies on outcome in Warmblood populations in which duration of the AF is often unknown are limited. Objectives To identify the factors that are associated with the success of full treatment cardioversion with oral medication, and establish whether there are differences in these factors between institutions. Study design Retrospective case series using patient records of Equine University Clinic of Utrecht University and Rossdales Equine Hospital, Newmarket. Methods Forty-nine horses treated with quinidine were identified (29 Warmbloods, 20 Thorougbreds, 1 Anglo-Arabian). Details of signalment, history, duration physical examination and echocardiography including left atrial size and presence of mitral regurgitation were retrieved. Clinical details including mean weight, age and left atrial size were compared between clinics using independent samples t test. Association between variables and cardioconversion were evaluated in a backwards logistic regression using Akaike's information criterium (AIC) and odds ratios were calculated. Factors were sex, clinic, breed, mitral regurgitation, duration and poor performance. Covariates were age, weight and the size of the left atrium. Significance was set at 0.05. Results Fifty-one horses (mean age 8.8?s.d. 4.5 years) were treated with quinidine sulfate, 18 also received digoxin. Eighty per cent converted to sinus rhythm. In 8 horses the known duration was less than 3 months. The only factor associated with successful treatment was the use of digoxin in combination with quinidine sulfate (odds ratio 12.4; 95% CI 2.61 and 91.85 according to AIC analysis). Conclusions In this retrospective case series, there is much potential for bias in the data; however, the use of digoxin in addition to quinidine was associated with improved conversion rates regardless of breed even though AF duration was unknown in most horses.

AB  - Abstract ???Crown fractures account for the highest percentage of all traumatic injuries in the permanent dentition. This review paper will discuss the different types of crown fracture, from the uncomplicated to complicated, including crown-root fractures. It will focus on two different aspects: the pulp, with an attempt to correlate epidemiological, experimental, histopathological and clinical studies, so that the clinician can better understand the underlying processes accounting for success or failure to maintain pulp vitality. Also, we will consider the restoration: knowledge about bonding to dentin and new material is evolving extremely quickly making it difficult for the clinician to keep up with the developments. If handled properly, prognosis of the pulp, after traumatic crown fracture, is good. Prognosis of the restoration has also improved considerably over the last few years, and it appears that this trend will continue in the future.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the Leipzig Stifle Distractor (LSD) for arthroscopic evaluation of the medial meniscus. Study Design Prospective clinical multi-center study. Animals 64 stifles of 64 dogs (mean body weight 35 kg) with suspected cranial cruciate ligament rupture. Methods The LSD was used to distract the medial compartment and to evaluate the medial meniscus. The degree of exposure of the caudal pole of the medial meniscus (CMM) and ease of diagnosis was quantified after either distraction with the LSD or manipulation of the stifle with valgus stress and external rotation. Time for pin placement, level of difficulty and associated complications with LSD application were recorded. Medial collateral ligament integrity was tested by stress radiographs. Results The mean time for applying the LSD was 1.4 minutes (range 0.5?3.0). Application was considered easy in 90% and moderate in 10% of joints, with no complications recorded. LSD application increased exposure (P?<?.001) and facilitated probing of the CMM (P?<?.001), allowing for the diagnosis of 10 meniscal tears missed without the LSD. The use of LSD increased the likelihood of diagnosing a meniscal tear by 1.9 times. Based on the stress radiographs, medial collateral ligament integrity was maintained in all tested stifles. Conclusion Diagnosis of medial meniscal tears was improved using LSD. The LSD provided a safe and effective method for improved visualization and access to the caudal portion of the medial meniscus, which may allow for better arthroscopic assessment of meniscal pathology in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Objective Investigations examining psychosocial adjustment among childhood cancer survivors have focused primarily on negative effects and psychopathology. Emergent literature suggests the existence of positive impact or adjustment experienced after cancer, as well. The purpose of this study is to examine the distribution of Perceived Positive Impact (PPI) and its correlates in young adult survivors of childhood cancer. Methods 6425 survivors and 360 siblings completed a comprehensive health survey, inclusive of a modified version of the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as a measure of PPI. Linear regression models were used to examine demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with PPI. Results Survivors were significantly more likely than siblings to report PPI. Endorsement of PPI was significantly greater among female and non-white survivors, and among survivors exposed to at least one intense therapy, a second malignancy or cancer recurrence. Survivors diagnosed at older ages and fewer years since diagnosis were more likely to report PPI. Income, education and marital/relationship status appeared to have varied relationships to PPI depending upon the subscale being evaluated. Conclusions The existence and variability of PPI in survivors in this study suggest that individual characteristics, inclusive of race, gender, cancer type, intensity of treatment, age at diagnosis and time since diagnosis, have unique and specific associations with different aspects of perceived positive outcomes of childhood cancer.
