AB  - Abstract:? Imaging is an integral diagnostic tool in mass fatality investigations undertaken traditionally by plain X-rays, fluoroscopy, and dental radiography. However, little attention has been given to appropriate image reporting, secure data transfer and storage particularly in relation to the need to meet stringent judicial requirements. Notwithstanding these limitations, it is the risk associated with the safe handling and investigation of contaminated fatalities which is providing new challenges for mass fatality radiological imaging. Mobile multi-slice computed tomography is an alternative to these traditional modalities as it provides a greater diagnostic yield and an opportunity to address the requirements of the criminal justice system. We present a new national disaster victim/forensic identification imaging system?Fimag?which is applicable for both contaminated and non-contaminated mass fatality imaging and addresses the issues of judicial reporting. We suggest this system opens a new era in radiological diagnostics for mass fatalities.

AB  - Background. There is little information about oncotherapy-related dental development in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Objective.? The objective of this study was to compare bone age (BA) and dental age (DA) to chronological age (CA) in childhood ALL survivors. Methods.? We retrospectively reviewed hand?wrist and panoramic radiographs of patients treated on contemporary single institution protocols for ALL between 1991 and 2004. We recorded patient demographics, therapeutic protocol, CA, DA, and BA. The cohort was divided into three categories based on age at diagnosis (< 6 years, 6?9 years, > 9 years). Results.? Of 73 patients, 39 (53.4%) were boys; 55 (75.3%) were Caucasian. Median CA at diagnosis was 4.5 years (range: 0.1?11.0 years); time to study was 4.1 years (range: 0.3?11.4 years). BA was normal in 61 (83.6%), delayed in 10 (13.7%), and advanced in 2 (2.7%). DA was normal in 41 (56.9%), delayed in 8 (11.1%), and advanced in 23 (31.9%). Abnormal BA, abnormal DA, and discrepancy between BA and DA are not statistically significantly associated with investigated patient or treatment factors. Conclusions.? DA may be altered in 43.1% of patients treated for ALL. A large prospective study is warranted to better define our observations and to determine their impact on dental and orthodontic management.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the Leipzig Stifle Distractor (LSD) for arthroscopic evaluation of the medial meniscus. Study Design Prospective clinical multi-center study. Animals 64 stifles of 64 dogs (mean body weight 35 kg) with suspected cranial cruciate ligament rupture. Methods The LSD was used to distract the medial compartment and to evaluate the medial meniscus. The degree of exposure of the caudal pole of the medial meniscus (CMM) and ease of diagnosis was quantified after either distraction with the LSD or manipulation of the stifle with valgus stress and external rotation. Time for pin placement, level of difficulty and associated complications with LSD application were recorded. Medial collateral ligament integrity was tested by stress radiographs. Results The mean time for applying the LSD was 1.4 minutes (range 0.5?3.0). Application was considered easy in 90% and moderate in 10% of joints, with no complications recorded. LSD application increased exposure (P?<?.001) and facilitated probing of the CMM (P?<?.001), allowing for the diagnosis of 10 meniscal tears missed without the LSD. The use of LSD increased the likelihood of diagnosing a meniscal tear by 1.9 times. Based on the stress radiographs, medial collateral ligament integrity was maintained in all tested stifles. Conclusion Diagnosis of medial meniscal tears was improved using LSD. The LSD provided a safe and effective method for improved visualization and access to the caudal portion of the medial meniscus, which may allow for better arthroscopic assessment of meniscal pathology in dogs.

AB  - This case series describes four cases of concomitant dermoid sinus and spina bifida in a Chinese crested dog, two Swedish vallhunds and a Burmese cat. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography, computed tomography fistulography and pathology. Two dogs that showed abnormalities during neurological examination underwent magnetic resonance imaging. One of them had imaging findings interpreted as syringohydromyelia. All the dogs underwent surgery and the outcome was considered good in all the cases. Based on clinical and pathological examination as well as diagnostic imaging findings, two of the dermoid sinuses were classified as type IV, and two of them showed a previously unreported type of dermoid sinus. This new type is suggested here as type VI.

AB  - Inguinal hernia was associated with trauma in five dogs and was considered nontraumatic in 30 dogs. There were 11 males, 13 intact females, and six spayed females with nontraumatic inguinal hernia. Six dogs had bilateral hernias. Five dogs were younger than 4 months at the time of diagnosis. In 11 older dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia, the hernias were identified less than 7 days before surgical repair; in 14 older dogs, the hernias had been recognized for 1 to 60 months. Clinical signs in dogs without small intestinal incarceration were usually limited to a visible or palpable mass without pain or systemic illness. Hemiorrhaphy approaches included inguinal, midline with contralateral ring evaluation, and celiotomy with or without inguinal exposure. Fat and omentum were the most common hernial contents. Small intestine was within the hernias of 12 dogs. Six dogs had nonviable small intestine. Postoperative complications included two incisional infections, one incisional dehiscence, two cases of peritonitis and sepsis associated with bowel leakage after intestinal resection and anastomosis, and one hernia recurrence. The overall prevalence of postoperative complications was 17%, and the mortality rate was 3%. Vomiting for 2 to 6 days was predictive of nonviable small intestine. Dogs younger than 2 years were at 11 times greater risk for nonviable small intestine than dogs older than 2 years. Four of five dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia and nonviable small intestine were intact males, whereas none of 13 intact females were affected. Only one of 14 dogs with longstanding hernias had nonviable small intestine.

AB  - ABSTRACT A two-year-old spayed female shih-tzu was referred with a 10-month history of lethargy, chronic diarrhoea and weight loss. On presentation, a partial response to antibiotics was noted. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass, and serum biochemistry and haematology revealed a mature neutrophilia, hypoalbuminaemia and a non-regenerative anaemia. Contrast radiography and abdominal ultrasound were suggestive of an intraluminal foreign body. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a surgical swab in the lumen of the jejunum that was associated with severe adhesions. Histopathology showed evidence of transmural migration of the swab from the peritoneal cavity to the lumen of the jejunum.

AB  - Abstract Background: The value of the radionuclide blood pool venogram in detecting deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has to date been inadequately evaluated. This is despite its lower complication rate than the gold standard of contrast X-ray venography. Aims: To compare the relative accuracy and inter observer variability of radionuclide blood pool and X-ray contrast venography as well as evaluate previous literature on radionuclide venography. Methods: Prospective comparison of radionuclide and contrast venography was performed in 39 patients. Sensitivity and specificity of radionuclide venography were compared to contrast venography and confidence intervals were measured using standard error calculations. A meta-analysis of previous studies was also performed. Results: Significant inter observer variation in reports was present in both radionuclide (37%) and contrast (22%) venograms. Using consensus reports sensitivity of radionuclide venography was 87% compared to contrast venography and specificity was 83%. These results are similar to those obtained in previous studies. Furthermore, sensitivity in specificity in the proximal veins were 90% and 92% respectively which were superior to sensitivity and specificity in the distal veins where it was 74% and 90% respectively. Conclusion: The radionuclide venogram appears accurate in the proximal veins and in excluding but not diagnosing distal venous thrombosis. (Aust NZ J Med 1993; 23: 641?645.)

AB  - Objective To compare the long-term outcome of tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) and extracapsular repair (ECR) for treatment of a ruptured cranial cruciate ligament (RCCL). Study Design Prospective clinical trial. Animals Normal adult dogs (control, n = 79); dogs with unilateral CCL disease (n = 38). Methods Dogs had TPLO (n = 15) or ECR (n = 23) for treatment of RCCL. Force plate gait analysis was performed for the control group at one time point and for treatment groups at serial points: preoperatively, 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Symmetry indices (SIs) were calculated between operated and unoperated pelvic limb for ground reaction forces (GRFs), including peak vertical force (PVF), contact time (CT), and vertical impulse (VI). GRFs of the treatment groups and control group were compared using a general linear model and Kaplan?Meier survival analysis. Results At 8 weeks, for PVF and VI, the TPLO group had more symmetric limb loading than the ECR group at the walk and trot. SIs of the TPLO group were not different from the control group by 6 months to 1 year postoperatively. SIs for the ECR group were less symmetrical than the control group at all time periods. Using survival analysis, median time to normal function was no different at the walk between groups, but was shorter for the TPLO group for VI and PVF. Conclusions Dogs achieved normal limb loading faster after TPLO than ECR. TPLO resulted in operated limb function that was indistinguishable from the control population by 1 year postoperatively.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether a systematic stream-lined approach could be routinely used in the evaluation of the fetal intracranal anatomy, and which could be used to effectively and efficiently exclude all major intracranial malformation. Three planes were determined to be independent without overlay. Following the establishment of these three independent oblique planes across the intracranial anatomy, there were applied clinically to determine whether such planes would be sufficient to diagnose the major intracranial abnormalities. After retrospectively examining the various imaging levels taken, it was independently determined that three levels of intracranial imaging provided the greatest anatomic view of the entire fetal brain: the lateral ventricular level (Level I); the medial-thalamic level (Level II); and the inferior-posterior fossa view (Level III). We examined 131 cases of intracranial abnormalities that were prenatally diagnosed between 14 and 24?weeks gestation. One investigator was given the three-level view protocol to determine if the anomalies could be identified using this system. It was determined that, of the 131 abnormal cases, 126 (96.2%) were diagnosed using Levels I, II or III, independently or in combination. There were no false-positive test results. The present study investigated the efficacy of a three level view (TLV) imaging of the fetal brain representing a complete 2-D examination. We found this approach to be applicable throughout pregnancy and suitable for visualization of normal intracranial structures as well as the identification of abnormalities.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on acute occupational trauma in agriculture resulting from a wound or immediate damage by sudden one-time application of external force. It provides a general description of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries in agriculture and discusses the unique attributes of farm and agriculturally related trauma. Furthermore, the chapter provides: injury statistics and epidemiological data, rescue and medical treatment considerations, and illustrative injury descriptions. It helps to provide an understanding of how agricultural injuries occur and assisting in anticipating medical implications and prevention opportunities. The injury scenarios given in the chapter should enhance understanding of agents, events, causes, treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of acute traumatic injuries. These scenarios are augmented with special considerations for those who are first on the scene, first responders and rescue personnel, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and transport personnel, emergency medical treatment providers, primary care providers, secondary/tertiary care providers, and providers of rehabilitation services.

AB  - Abstract Abstract Recent advances in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery have changed the traditional therapeutic algorithms by altering indications, timing and patterns of referral for subsequent surgical treatment. The traditional longitudinal sternomy incision has been the surgical approach of choice for multi-vessel coronary revascularisation. Drawbacks of this incision include potential postoperative morbidity, which translates to a prolonged postoperative length of stay. The combination of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting (a hybrid approach) is an alternative therapeutic method for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Recent advances in percutaneous interventions have attempted to address the problem of re-stenosis, initially through the deployment of bare metal intra-coronary stents and, more recently, with drug-eluting stents. Developments in coronary revascularisation have focused on reducing both surgical invasiveness and trauma. Patients with significant co-morbid pathologies, the ones undergoing re-interventions, and especially the elderly may benefit from such hybrid procedures by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and midline sternotomy. Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized cardiothoracic surgery by increasing patient satisfaction and by reducing surgical trauma, hospital stay and consequently overall costs. There are however limitations. Robot assisted surgery endeavours to minimise these technical hindrances and so allow better and more accurate surgical practice whilst minimising surgical trauma.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents various eye diseases of the goat, such as blindness, cyclopia, tumours of the eyelids, and mycoplasma. There is strong evidence that Mycoplasma conjunctivae is a major causal agent of keratoconjunctivitis in the United Kingdom. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) can cause a mucopurulent conjunctivitis in goats. The cornea of goats is commonly traumatised, often by stalks of hay or straw; overlarge tags on the ears of Angora kids may irritate the eye and the eye will also be damaged when entropion is present. Treatment involves correcting or removing the cause of the trauma and then treating the resultant conjunctivitis or corneal damage. Photosensitisation from whatever cause will affect the head, resulting in swelling of unpigmented skin of the muzzle, drooping ears, and swollen eyelids. Affected animals should be removed from exposure to sunlight and any possible photosensitising substance.

AB  - Summary Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernails and/or toenails caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte moulds. The epidemiology of onychomycosis in Serbia is yet to be fully established. This epidemiological study was aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of onychomycosis in a sample of the Serbian patients at risk of onychomycosis, to determine the fungal aetiological agents and to identify the possible risk factors. The study population included 374 patients from six centres in Serbia with suspected onychomycosis. Demographic data, data about comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical aspects of onychomycosis, trauma, excessive perspiration and personal and family history of previous onychomycosis were studied. Laboratory confirmation of diagnosis was done by direct microscopy, fungal culture and PCR. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed in 50.8% of patients, who tested positive to at least one laboratory test (direct microscopy, fungal culture or PCR). Trichophyton rubrum was predominant both on toenails (85.98%) and on fingernails (38.46%). Independent risk factors for onychomycosis were: old age (OR = 2.285; P < 0.001), family history of previous onychomycosis and/or tinea pedis (OR = 2.452; P = 0.005), excessive perspiration (OR = 2.165; P = 0.002) and higher degree of hyperkeratosis (OR = 1.755; P = 0.020). This is a first epidemiological study of onychomycosis from Serbia.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Bipolar disorder is marked by progressive symptomatic changes, which have been linked with episode-related structural findings?particularly in the prefrontal cortex. However, few studies have examined neurofunctional and neurochemical effects of disease burden. In this study, we compared first- and multi-episode bipolar individuals. We hypothesized that the latter would demonstrate evidence of neurophysiological differences consistent with a model of progressive functional degradation of these networks. Methods First- and multi-episode manic bipolar subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) including a continuous performance task with emotional distractors, and in single-voxel (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A priori fMRI regions-of-interest (ROI) included structures comprising prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks; (1H)MRS voxels were placed within bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both ROI and voxel-based brain activation in response to emotional stimuli, and neurochemical concentrations derived from (1H)MRS were compared across bipolar groups. Results Multi-episode bipolar subjects showed relatively lower regional activation across prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks, including bilateral VLPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, putamen, caudate, and amygdala. Exploratory whole-brain, voxel-based analysis suggested additional areas of lower activation extending into Brodmann area 22, posterior parietal regions, and right thalamus. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations were also relatively lower in the ACC of multi-episode subjects. Conclusions Disease burden, exemplified by multiple affective episodes is associated with evidence of widespread decrements in affective network activity. Lower ACC NAA concentration is similarly consistent with a model of progressive functional deficits. These findings support the functional significance of previously observed progressive structural changes throughout these regions.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate adiabatic T1? and T2? of articular cartilage in symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) patients and asymptomatic volunteers, and to determine their association with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based structural abnormalities in cartilage and bone. Materials and Methods A total of 24 subjects (age range: 50?68 years; 12 female) were enrolled, including 12 early OA patients and 12 volunteers with normal joint function. Patients and volunteers underwent 3T MRI. T2, adiabatic T1?, and T2? relaxation times of knee articular cartilage were measured. Proton density (PD)- and T1-weighted MR image series were also obtained and separately evaluated for morphological changes using the MRI OA Knee Scoring (MOAKS) system. Comparisons using the Mann?Whitney nonparametric test were performed after dividing the study participants according to physical symptoms as determined by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) score or presence of cartilage lesions, bone marrow lesions, or osteophytes. Results Elevated adiabatic T1? and T2? relaxation times of articular cartilage were associated with cartilage loss (P?=?0.024?0.047), physical symptoms (0.0068?0.035), and osteophytes (0.0039?0.027). Elevated adiabatic T1? was also associated with bone marrow lesions (0.033). Conclusion Preliminary data suggest that elevated adiabatic T1? and T2? of cartilage are associated with morphological abnormalities of cartilage and bone, and thus may be applicable for in vivo OA research and diagnostics.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The finite element (FE) method is the most powerful modelling technique available to explicate the biomechanics of the digit. It has already proved to be of high value in human podiatry. However, accurate models of the complex anatomy of the horse and donkey digit are currently lacking. Objectives: To develop FE models of the horse and donkey digit from computed tomography data, including all functionally relevant anatomy, and to perform simulations to replicate prestrain in the flexor tendons and quasistatic weightbearing. Methods: Computed tomography data of the front right digits were obtained under general anaesthesia. The anatomy was rationalised into 32 functional components. The FE models were generated using a forward engineering technique. Linear or nonlinear material properties were applied according to published data. Prestraining of the flexor tendons was achieved by z-direction displacement, and loading by the application of 1 ? body mass. Results: The resultant FE models comprised over 106 elements. Z-direction displacement of the digital flexor tendons to compensate for general anaesthesia relaxation gave von Mises stress levels up to 1.34 MPa for the deep and 0.56 MPa for the superficial in the horse and 0.78 MPa and 0.27 MPa in the donkey, respectively. Weightbearing resulted in capsular deformation patterns consistent with in vivo observations, and maximum stress levels of 1.46 MPa for the horse and 0.89 MPa for the donkey. Conclusion: These high resolution FE models could give new insight into the biomechanics of the equid digit and provide new data regarding stress and strain levels within the tissues of the digit that are unobtainable by other means. Potential relevance: Application of the FE modelling technique could enable investigation of the biomechanics of orthopaedic problems and may provide a mechanistic basis for enhanced preventative and remedial management and treatment.

AB  - Summary The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the outcome of conservative methods and 3D-assisted surgery for treatment of type III fractures of the distal phalanx with regard to recovery time and the development of osteoarthritis (OA) in the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ). The medical records of all horses with type III fracture of the distal phalanx referred to the Equine Department, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, between 1992 and 2016 were reviewed. The severity of lameness at initial examination, radiographic evaluation, treatment (conservative, group A; 3D-assisted surgery, group B), complications, outcome and recovery time were determined. Follow-up examinations included clinical and radiographic examinations. Of 33 horses, 15 received conservative treatment and 18 underwent surgery. Eleven of the 15 (73.3%) horses in group A returned to their intended use and four were subjected to euthanasia or remained chronically lame. The median recovery time was 240 days (95% CI, 180?374). Thirteen of 15 (86.7%) horses developed OA of the DIPJ within 5 months of the fracture. In group B, 16 of 17 (94.1%) horses returned to their intended use, one horse remained chronically lame, and one horse was subjected to euthanasia because of unrelated reasons. The median recovery time was 139 days (95% CI, 120?270), and seven horses (38.9%) developed OA of the DIPJ within 5 months of the fracture. Overall, the screws had to be removed in five fluoroscopic-assisted surgery cases (three because of implant infection and two because of severe lameness), in one computer-assisted surgery case due to severe lameness and in one computed tomography-assisted surgery case because of implant infection. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in time for recovery of type III fractures of the distal phalanx between the two groups, but surgical treatment led to significantly fewer cases of OA in the DIPJ as determined by subjective radiographic evaluation (P = 0.015).
