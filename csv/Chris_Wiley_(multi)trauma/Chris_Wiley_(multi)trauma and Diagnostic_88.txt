AB  - Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic utility of electrocardiogram data obtained by a wireless sensor from 36 dogs and four cats with suspected arrhythmias caused by cardiac or systemic diseases. Materials and Methods Wireless electrocardiographic recordings were obtained via two precordial electrodes attached to an electrocardiogram sensor connected to a smart device via low-power Bluetooth technology. Cardiac rate, rhythm and duration of P-QRS-T waves were evaluated with VisECG? software. Fifteen- to 30-minute wireless recordings were compared to standard electrocardiograms. Furthermore, the wireless sensor was used in 10 dogs and four cats for 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram monitoring at home. Results When compared to standard electrocardiogram, equivalent results were obtained for heart rate and duration of different waves. Due to the longer recording time, more arrhythmias were diagnosed with the wireless device in 50% (15 of 30) of animals with arrhythmias. Satisfactory recordings were obtained when the dogs were resting, standing or walking but interpretation of the wireless electrocardiogram signal was not possible during strenuous physical activity. Clinical Significance Wireless electrocardiographic monitoring is a reliable and accurate method for identification of heart rate, arrhythmia and duration of electrocardiogram waves. A higher diagnostic yield of arrhythmias was documented with the wireless sensor due to prolonged monitoring. The device offers a good option for the long-term monitoring of canine and feline cardiac rhythm.

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the outcome and prognostic variables associated with long-term survival and complications in dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Sixty-one client-owned dogs with central division masses. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2015 were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, preoperative staging, preoperative cytology or biopsy results, date of procedure, location of mass, surgical technique, whether cholecystectomy or cholecystopexy was performed, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and margin evaluation, date of local recurrence or detection of metastatic disease, and survival. Results Hilar resection was associated with increased intraoperative and postoperative complications. Intraoperative complications occurred in 29 dogs, with 20 dogs experiencing intraoperative hemorrhage. Nineteen dogs required transfusions. Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 20 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 11%, and 2-week mortality rate was 14.7%. The median survival time for dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not reached. The 1- and 3-year censored survival rates for dogs with HCC was 82.1% and 82.1%, respectively. Margin status did not impact survival time. Conclusion Hepatic lobectomy of the central division was associated with hemorrhage in approximately 33% of dogs, but there was a relatively low perioperative mortality rate. Hepatic lobectomy for HCC resulted in long-term survival, regardless of margin status. Clinical significance Surgeons should anticipate the requirement for blood products in dogs that may require hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Long-term survival can be expected after surgical treatment of HCC, regardless of margin status.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the surgical technique and evaluate short-term outcome after minimally invasive small intestinal exploration and targeted organ biopsy with a wound retractor device (WRD) in cats. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Forty-two cats. Methods A wound retractor was inserted into the abdomen on the ventral midline through a 2-4 cm incision at the level of the umbilicus. Short segments (6-10 cm long) of intestinal tract were sequentially exteriorized and explored through the WRD. Full thickness, small intestinal biopsies were obtained extracorporeally via the WRD. A commercially available single-port device was inserted through the WRD for laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen. Results The majority of the small intestine could be exteriorized and explored through the WRD. In all cases, full thickness biopsies of the small intestine of diagnostic quality were obtained. The most common histological findings were inflammatory bowel disease (n?=?16), intestinal lymphoma (n?=?14), and eosinophilic enteritis (n?=?7). Two cases required conversion to a traditional open laparotomy due to abdominal pathology diagnosed after placement of the WRD (abdominal adhesions and need for a splenectomy). Postoperative complications occurred in 4 of 39 cats (10.3%), leading to 2 deaths after discharge from the hospital. Conclusions and clinical relevance MISIETB with a WRD alone or combined with laparoscopy is a safe technique for small intestinal exploration and targeted abdominal organ biopsy in cats. Single-port laparoscopy can effectively be performed through the WRD for complete abdominal exploration and biopsy of abdominal organs.

AB  - Abstract Aims To estimate the influence of non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) on heroin initiation among US veterans receiving medical care. Design Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we analyzed data from a prospective, multi-site, observational study of HIV-infected and an age/race/site-matched control group of HIV-uninfected veterans in care in the United States. Approximately annual behavioral assessments were conducted and contained self-reported measures of NMUPO and heroin use. Setting Veterans Health Administration (VHA) infectious disease and primary care clinics in Atlanta, Baltimore, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Washington, DC. Participants A total of 3396 HIV-infected and uninfected patients enrolled into the Veterans Aging Cohort Study who reported no life-time NMUPO or heroin use, had no opioid use disorder diagnoses at baseline and who were followed between 2002 and 2012. Measurements The primary outcome measure was self-reported incident heroin use and the primary exposure of interest was new-onset NMUPO. Our final model was adjusted for socio-demographics, pain interference, prior diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and/or depression and self-reported other substance use. Findings Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we found that non-medical use of prescription opioids NMUPO was associated positively and independently with heroin initiation [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 5.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.01, 7.35]. Conclusions New-onset non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) is a strong risk factor for heroin initiation among HIV-infected and uninfected veterans in the United States who reported no previous history of NMUPO or illicit opioid use.

Over a 5-year period, 64 consecutive patients with pyogenic liver abscess were treated with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin, cefuroxime, and metronidazole) and randomized into two percutaneous treatment groups: continuous catheter drainage (with an 8F multi-sidehole pigtail catheter); and intermittent needle aspiration (18G disposable trocar needle). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding patient demographics, underlying coexisting disease, abscess size, abscess number, number of loculation of abscess, the presenting clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and pretreatment liver function test. Although not statistically significant, the duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment before percutaneous treatment was longer with the catheter group, and the change of antibiotics after the sensitivity test was more frequent with the needle group. The needle group was associated with a higher treatment success rate, a shorter duration of hospital stay, and a lower mortality rate, although this did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, this study suggests that intermittent needle aspiration is probably as effective as continuous catheter drainage for the treatment of pyogenic liver abscess, although further proof with a large-scale study is necessary. Due to the additional advantages of procedure simplicity, patient comfort, and reduced price, needle aspiration deserves to be considered as a first-line drainage approach.

AB  - Abstract Background: The current effectiveness of preventative and therapeutic interventions for substance use disorders (SUDs) is less than satisfying. Progress in understanding the processes related to the onset, course, and cessation of SUDs merits top priority, given the high prevalence and the severe negative consequences. Aims: This position paper, after summarizing major factors related to onset and cessation processes, discusses the possible role of cognitive-control dysfunctions in the complex interaction between mechanisms of change (mediators) and risk factors (moderators). Findings: In past decades, research has expanded our knowledge about the impact of SUDs on human behaviour. Formal interventions are effective, but there is limited information about the mechanisms responsible for change during the onset and cessation of SUDs and for individual differences related to them. Preliminary results suggest that impairments in higher order control functions play a role in SUDs. Conclusions: Deficiencies in our understanding of behaviour-change processes during the onset and cessation of SUDs require that research have a different focus. A better understanding of the relevance of impairments in executive-control functions might help to improve formal preventative and therapeutic interventions and social conditions. Such interventions might reduce the chances that a SUD will develop or increase the likelihood of recovery from it. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe a case of an isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy in a patient with a spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD). This condition is a well-recognized cause of cerebral ischemic stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age. Isolated cranial nerve neuropathy is a rare presentation. More common manifestations include incomplete hemiparesis, hemicrania, Horner syndrome, cervical bruit, pulsatile tinnitus, and multiple cranial nerve palsies. Methods A comprehensive literature search (Ovid, MEDLINE) for the presentation, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and outcome of patients with internal carotid artery dissection was performed. Results A 43-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of mild dysarthria. There was no history of craniocervical trauma. The physical examination revealed an isolated left hypoglossal nerve paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography findings were consistent with a left skull base ICAD. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. The current rate of cranial nerve involvement is estimated at 10% of all ICADs. This is the second report of isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy without hemicrania in a case of atraumatic ICAD. Conclusions Patients with an ICAD infrequently present to the otolaryngologist because of its head and neck manifestations. It is crucial to recognize atypical findings and to perform an accurate and prompt diagnostic evaluation. The foundation of treatment is aggressive anticoagulation, with surgical or radiologic intervention reserved for cases demonstrating life-threatening progression.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of the current literature that examines impulsivity in individuals with eating disorders (ED). Studies were obtained from Embase, Pubmed and Psycinfo, and were included if they assessed impulsivity in individuals over 18 years of age with an ED diagnosis and published in the last 10 years. The methodological quality of the studies was rated. Twelve studies were included in this review, with methodological quality varying across studies. Findings suggest that impulsivity is best assessed multi-modally, with a combination of self-report, behavioural and physiological measures. In general, impulsivity was found to differentiate individuals with EDs from controls, as well as across diagnostic subtypes. The current findings have important clinical implications for our understanding and treatment of both impulsivity and eating disorders.

AB  - SUMMARY Esophageal perforation is uncommon and traditionally has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to perform a 13-year retrospective review of the cases managed in our district general hospital. Thirty-four cases of esophageal perforation diagnosed between 1995 and 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 20 males and 14 females with a median age of 64 (range 23?86) years. The etiology of the perforations were Boerhaave's syndrome (n= 19), therapeutic endoscopy (n= 9), diagnostic endoscopy (n= 2), gastric lavage injury (n= 1), foreign body (n= 1), blunt chest trauma (n= 1), and spontaneous tumor perforation (n= 1). Only 11 cases (32%) had evidence of surgical emphysema upon examination. In 50% of cases, another clinical diagnosis was initially suspected. Twenty-four were treated surgically and 10 cases managed non-operatively. Surgical treatment included thoracotomy with primary repair (n= 9), T-tube drainage (n= 7), emergency esophagectomy (n= 1), or intra-operative stent insertion (n= 1). Four cases had primary repair and fundal wrap via abdominal approach without thoracotomy. Two patients were treated with washout and drainage only. Eight patients died overall (in-hospital mortality 23.5%). Esophageal perforations are often initially misdiagnosed and the majority do not have surgical emphysema. There are a wide variety of methods to manage esophageal perforation. Management tailored to the location and size of perforation, degree of contamination, and underlying cause appears to result in a reasonable prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe demographic factors, treatments, and outcomes associated with shoulder instability in dogs. Study Design Multi-center, retrospective cohort study. Animals Dog (n?=?130) with shoulder instability. Methods Medical records (October 2007?2010) from 4 hospitals of dogs with shoulder instability were reviewed to document age, breed, weight, and gender, categorize them into diagnosis cohorts of medial (MSI), lateral (LSI), or multidirectional (MDI) instability, determine treatments, and document outcomes. Treatment cohorts were defined as nonsurgical management, radiofrequency-induced thermal capsulorrhaphy (RITC), or shoulder reconstruction. Outcomes based upon clinician reevaluation and owner input >1 year after diagnosis were used to determine success, failure, and complication rates. Results Most dogs were diagnosed with MSI, but 23% had LSI or MDI. Dogs with MSI treated by reconstruction were more likely than dogs treated without surgery to have a successful outcome (odd's ratio?=?3.0; P?=?.01). Similarly, treatment of MDI with reconstruction was more likely to be associated with a successful outcome than nonsurgical management (odd's ratio?=?5.0; P?=?.007). Success with surgical and nonsurgical management was equivocal between LSI treatment cohorts, but the number of dogs with LSI was small. Complication rates for all treatment cohorts were <10%. Conclusions In dogs with shoulder instability, LSI and MDI are less common than MSI. Surgical reconstruction for treatment of MSI and MDI appears to produce a higher likelihood of achieving successful outcomes than nonsurgical management and surgical complication rates were low but these conclusions are tempered by the limitations of the study.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a diverse pathologic process, defined as the formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Appropriate deliberate clinical inertia refers to the art of doing nothing as a positive clinical response. It includes shared decision-making to improve patient care with the use of clinical judgement. We discuss common clinical scenarios where the use of deliberate clinical inertia can occur. The insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulae, investigating patients with suspected renal colic and the investigation of low risk chest pain are all opportunities for the thoughtful clinician to ?stand there? and use effective patient communication to avoid low value tests and procedures. Awareness is key to identifying these opportunities to practice deliberate clinical inertia, as many of the situations may be so much a part of our environment that they are hidden in plain view.
