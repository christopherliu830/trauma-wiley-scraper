AB  - Abstract Appropriate deliberate clinical inertia refers to the art of doing nothing as a positive clinical response. It includes shared decision-making to improve patient care with the use of clinical judgement. We discuss common clinical scenarios where the use of deliberate clinical inertia can occur. The insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulae, investigating patients with suspected renal colic and the investigation of low risk chest pain are all opportunities for the thoughtful clinician to ?stand there? and use effective patient communication to avoid low value tests and procedures. Awareness is key to identifying these opportunities to practice deliberate clinical inertia, as many of the situations may be so much a part of our environment that they are hidden in plain view.

AB  - This revised Clinical Guideline in Paediatric Dentistry replaces the previously published ninth guideline (Shaw L, O?Sullivan E. Int J Paediatr Dent 2000; 10: 356?365). The process of guideline production began in 1994, resulting in first publication in 1997. Each guideline has been circulated widely for consultation to all UK consultants in paediatric dentistry, council members of the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry (BSPD), and to people of related specialities recognized to have expertise in the subject. The final version of this guideline is produced from a combination of this input and thorough review of the published literature. In the case of the present guideline, an internationally recognized expert in the field was invited to be a co-author (AM). The intention is to encourage improvement in clinical practice and to stimulate research and clinical audit in areas where scientific evidence is inadequate. Evidence underlying recommendations is scored according to the SIGN classification and guidelines should be read in this context. Further details regarding the process of paediatric dentistry guideline production in the UK is described in the Int J Paediatr Dent 1997; 7: 267?268.

AB  - Bone marrow is one of the largest organs in the human body, enclosing adipocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for blood cell production, and mesenchymal stem cells, which are responsible for the production of adipocytes and bone cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the ideal imaging modality to monitor bone marrow changes in healthy and pathological states, thanks to its inherent rich soft-tissue contrast. Quantitative bone marrow MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have been also developed in order to quantify changes in bone marrow water?fat composition, cellularity and perfusion in different pathologies, and to assist in understanding the role of bone marrow in the pathophysiology of systemic diseases (e.g. osteoporosis). The present review summarizes a large selection of studies published until March 2017 in proton-based quantitative MRI and MRS of bone marrow. Some basic knowledge about bone marrow anatomy and physiology is first reviewed. The most important technical aspects of quantitative MR methods measuring bone marrow water?fat composition, fatty acid composition, perfusion, and diffusion are then described. Finally, previous MR studies are reviewed on the application of quantitative MR techniques in both healthy aging and diseased bone marrow affected by osteoporosis, fractures, metabolic diseases, multiple myeloma, and bone metastases.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Dermatophytosis is a contagious and zoonotic skin disease that spreads easily between individuals of the same species and across species. This paper describes its pathogenesis, with specific reference to the host and environmental factors, which predispose cats to infections. The clinical signs in cats can mimic almost any dermatological disease and include alopecia, scaling, comedones, erythema, hyperpigmentation, follicular casts, lichenification, miliary dermatitis and eosinophilic granuloma complex. Sample taking and the range of diagnostic tests available to confirm the diagnosis are described. The paper also highlights the need for the treatment of the in-contact pets and the environment, as well as the affected animal.

AB  - Abstract Objective To define and compare clinical characteristics of canine primary appendicular hemangiosarcoma (HSA) and telangiectatic osteosarcoma (tOSA), including signalment, presentation, response to treatment, and prognosis. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Seventy dogs with primary appendicular HSA or tOSA. Methods Patient data were obtained from institutions' medical records. Immunohistochemistry was applied to archived tissues to establish tumor type. Patient characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes were described and compared by tumor type. Results Forty-one HSA and 29 tOSA were identified. Dogs with HSA were more likely than dogs with tOSA to be male and have hind limb tumors; 78% of HSA occurred in hind limbs, particularly the tibia. Dogs with tOSA weighed a median of 9.9?kg (95% CI 4.6-15.3) more than dogs with HSA. Most dogs received antineoplastic treatment, predominantly amputation with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall survival with local treatment and chemotherapy was 299 days (95% CI 123-750) for HSA and 213 days (95% CI 77-310) for tOSA. Younger age and more aggressive treatment were associated with longer survival in dogs with HSA but not tOSA. One-year survival rates did not differ between dogs with HSA (28%) and those with tOSA (7%). Conclusion Distinct clinical features were identified between HSA and tOSA in this population. Both tumors were aggressive, with a high incidence of pulmonary metastases. However, local treatment combined with chemotherapy led to an average survival 7 months for tOSA and 10 months for HSA. Clinical significance HSA should be considered as a differential in dogs with aggressive lytic bone lesions, particularly medium-sized dogs with tibial lesions. HSA has a unique clinical presentation but similar therapeutic response and outcome to OSA. Amputation and chemotherapy appear to prolong survival in some dogs with HSA and tOSA.

AB  - Objective To review the clinical features, treatments, complications, and outcomes of horses with traumatic orbital fractures. Study design Retrospective study. Sample Population Eighteen horses with confirmed orbital fractures. Procedures Medical records of horses presenting with orbital fractures between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Signalment, etiology of fracture, clinical signs, fracture descriptions, diagnostic imaging, treatments, complications, and outcomes were evaluated. Results Eighteen horses presented with orbital fractures resulting from rearing in a confined space (n = 5), being kicked (4), colliding with a stationary object (3), and unknown trauma (6). Radiography and computed tomography were effective at classifying fractures and evaluating sinus/nasal involvement. Epistaxis/sinusitis were associated with fractures of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (n = 3) and comminuted fractures of multiple bones (5). Seventeen fractures required treatment, with fifteen receiving a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Surgery included reduction of large bony fragments (n = 8), removal of small fragments (12), stabilization with a wire implant (1), and sinus trephination and lavage (5). Factors contributing to a favorable outcome included: globe retention (n = 16), vision (14), comfort (15), cosmesis (9), and return to previous function (13). Conclusions Horses sustaining orbital fractures treated promptly with medical and surgical therapy have a favorable prognosis for return to function and cosmesis. Fractures affecting the zygomatic process of the frontal bone are unlikely to involve the sinus/nasal cavities. Epistaxis and sinusitis warrant more aggressive therapy and decrease functional and cosmetic outcome.

AB  - Summary Diagnostic imaging safety has garnered considerable interest in medical literature because of concerns of health risks attributable to imaging investigation. Perhaps the greatest concern is the likelihood of cancer development, secondary to the use of increasing numbers and exposures of medical radiation, especially resulting from the increasing use of multislice CT scanners. Additional health concerns are the toxicity of iodine-based contrast agents (IBCAs) that are used in CT, and gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) that are used in MRI. The literature on the excretion of GBCAs and IBCAs into breast milk, and the gastro-intestinal absorption of these agents from breast milk is very limited. A review of the literature, however, reveals important facts: less than 1% of the administered maternal dose of contrast agent is excreted into breast milk; and less than 1% of the contrast medium in breast milk ingested by an infant is absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract.

AB  - The scarcity of available donor organs is the key challenge in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). A viable way of expanding the donor pool is the use of liver grafts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)?positive donors. The present study used the US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database (1987-2010), and each of the 78 patients who underwent OLT with HBsAg-positive grafts was matched with 4 patients who received HBsAg-negative grafts by urgent status, donor sex, recipient sex, donor age, recipient age, transplant date, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and warm ischemia time. The overall graft and patient survival rates were similar for recipients of HBsAg-positive grafts and matched controls: the 5-year graft survival rates were 66% and 64%, respectively (P?=?0.95), and the 5-year patient survival rates were 71% and 71%, respectively (P?=?0.87). A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis that was adjusted for other variables showed no impact of the donor HBsAg status on graft or patient survival. The use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) was independently associated with better posttransplant graft survival [hazard ratio (HR)?=?0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?0.06-0.81] and patient survival (HR?=?0.16, 95% CI?=?0.04-0.75) for recipients of HBsAg-positive grafts. In conclusion, the use of HBsAg-positive liver grafts did not reduce posttransplant graft or patient survival. Moreover, matching these donors to recipients treated with HBIG may improve safety.

Because of the sudden onset and severe degree of lameness, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed. All horses showed areas of increased signal intensity in short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images involving the central and/or third tarsal bones. These lesions involved both the subchondral bone and bone marrow and are currently defined as bone marrow lesions (BML). Two horses were treated with shockwave therapy, one received intra-articular medication. Two of the horses returned to previous athletic level and one is still in rehabilitation.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder most often diagnosed 10?years after its onset and development. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-? peptide (ABP) into amyloid plaques between nerve cells, which produces a massive local neurodegeneration. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging allows diagnosis of AD by showing ABP accumulation in the brain. The ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) derivatives proposed in the present work were functionalized with peptides that present an affinity for ABP, independently of its state of aggregation. Their nanomolar Kd* confirms the high affinity of our vectorized contrast agents (VCA) for ABP and therefore their high labeling potential, specificity and sensitivity. Their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated, both by in vitro studies using the MTT method on several cell types, and by in vivo investigations with assessment of renal and hepatic biomarkers and by histopathology evaluation. The results of biodistribution studies corroborated by MRI demonstrate that USPIO-PHO (USPIO coupled to peptide C-IPLPFYN-C) are able to cross the blood?brain barrier without any facilitating strategy, and accumulates in the brain 90?min after its injection in NMRI mice. None of the USPIO derivatives were found in any organs one week after administration. To conclude, USPIO-PHO seems to have a genuine potential for labeling amyloid plaques in the brain; it has a nanomolar binding affinity, no toxic effects, and its elimination half-life is about 3?h. Further tests will be made on transgenic mice, aimed at confirming the potential of early AD diagnosis using our VCA. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Nutrition support has become widely recognized as an essential component of optimal care for acutely ill patients. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral routes when possible. However, prescribed enteral nutritional regimens are sometimes met with side effects and even complications. These adverse events have been collectively termed ?intolerance,? and forms of intolerance occur in a spectrum from bothersome at least to life threatening when most severe. Here we discuss nutritional access and its maintenance, introduce and define intolerance, and then review the current literature with regard to principal forms of enteral nutrition intolerance.

Method A total of 29 participants were randomized to either to EMDR + SC (n = 15) or SC (n = 14). Participants completed measures on traumatic stress (PCL-C) and comorbid distress at baseline, 1 week post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results In the EMDR + SC group, 9 (60%) participants at post-treatment and 7 (47%) participants at 3-month follow-up were diagnosis free. In SC, 4 (27%) at post-treatment and follow-up were diagnosis free. At post-treatment, three participants (20%) dropped out from the EMDR + SC group, and 1 (7%) dropped out from the SC group. Conclusions It is feasible, acceptable and potentially effective to deliver EMDR in this population group.

AB  - Abstract Aims To measure the effectiveness of antidepressants for adolescents and young adults with co-occurring depression and substance use disorder. Design, Setting and Participants Meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science and PsychINFO was conducted (from 1970 to 2013). Prospective, parallel groups, double-blind, controlled trials with random assignment to an antidepressant or placebo on young patients (age?≤?25 years) who met diagnostic criteria of both substance use and unipolar depressive disorder were included. Five trials were selected for this analysis and included 290 patients. Measurements Our efficacy outcome measures were depression outcomes (dichotomous and continuous measures) and substance-use outcomes (change of frequency or quantity of substance-use). Secondary analysis was conducted to access the tolerability of antidepressant treatment. Findings For dichotomous depression outcome, antidepressants group was significantly more effective than placebo group [risk ratio (RR)?=?1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01?1.45], with low heterogeneity (I2?=?0%). Although no statistically significant effects for continuous depression outcome [standardized mean differences (SMD)?=??0.13; 95% CI, ?0.55 to 0.30] were found with moderate heterogeneity (I2?=?63%), subgroup analysis showed that the medicine group with a sample size of more than 50 showed statistically significant efficacy compared with the placebo group (SMD ?0.53, 95% CI ?0.82 to ?0.25). Moreover, there was no significant difference for substance-use outcomes and tolerability outcomes between the medication and placebo groups. Conclusions Antidepressant medication has a small overall effect in reducing depression in young patients with combined depressive and substance-use disorders, but does not appear to improve substance use outcomes.
