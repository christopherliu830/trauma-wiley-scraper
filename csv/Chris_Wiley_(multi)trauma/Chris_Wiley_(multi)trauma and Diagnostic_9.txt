AB  - Abstract Background and objective Infrared thermal imaging (IRTI) is a new technique for detecting deep vein thrombosis (DVT) based on DVT's infrared presentation and distribution characteristics (PDCs). A method that is singularly sensitive to DVT is needed. They, therefore, enrolled 157 subjects with suspected lower extremity DVT in a double-blind, controlled clinical trial using IRTI, and Doppler compression ultrasonography (CPUS) to verify the clinical value of IRTI. Methods An IRTI system could precisely measure and store real-time thermal images. A double-blind, controlled clinical study using IRTI and detection on 157 patients with suspected DVTs, evaluating the following parameters: sensitivity, specificity, positive prescreening, negative prescreening, false positivity, false negativity, and diagnostic accordance of IRTI with CPUS for detecting DVT were conducted. Results Of 140 subjects who underwent screening both IRTI and CPUS detect were included for analyses. According to their IRTI DVT's presentation and distribution characteristics, patients were divided into IRTI- negative (n?=?59) and IRTI-positive (including suspicious IRTI positive) (n?=?81) groups. CPUS identified 80 DVT-negative and 60 DVT-positive patients. The sensitivity of IRTI for detecting DVT was 88.33%, specificity 65.00%, false-positive diagnosis 11.67%, false-negative diagnosis 35.00%, positive prescreening 65.43%, negative prescreening 88.14%, diagnostic accordance rate 75.00%. IRTI results accorded with CPUS results (P = .001) except for the positivity incidence (?2?=?39.997, P?<?.001). Conclusions IRTI could be used to supplement CPUS detection for detecting DVTs and adjunctive diagnostic screening.

AB  - Background Death after injury with low energy has gained increasing focus lately, and seems to constitute a significant amount of trauma-related death. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of deaths from low-energy trauma in a rural Norwegian cohort. Methods All deaths from external causes in Finnmark County, Norway, from 1995 to 2004 were identified retrospectively through the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Deaths caused by hanging, drowning, suffocation, poisoning, and electrocution were excluded. Trauma was categorised as high energy or low energy based on mechanism of injury. All low-energy trauma deaths were then reviewed. Results There were 262 cases of trauma death during the period. Low-energy trauma counted for 43% of the trauma deaths, with an annual crude death rate of 13 per 100,000 inhabitants. Low falls accounted for 99% of the injuries. Fractures were sustained in 89% of cases and head injuries in 11%. Ninety per cent of patients had pre-existing medical conditions, and the median age was 82 years. Death was caused by a medical condition in 85% of cases. Fifty-two per cent of the patients died after discharge from the hospital. Conclusion In this cohort, low-energy trauma was a significant contributor to trauma related death, especially among elderly and patients with pre-existing medical conditions.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - Abstract ? Displacement injuries of permanent teeth are an increasing emergency in the dental office. Children and adolescents are particularly prone to dental trauma due to participation in risky activitiess. Repositioning or replantation with subsequent stabilization by a dental splint is the standard of care for most displaced or avulsed permanent teeth. Non-rigid fixation allowing physiologic tooth mobility has been shown to be desirable for periodontal healing. A flexible splint of short duration appears to reduce the risk of dentoalveolar ankylosis or external replacement resorption. Different splinting techniques are currently recommended for stabilization of repositioned or replanted teeth, including a wire-composite splint, an orthodontic bracket splint or a resin splint. Each splinting option has its specific advantages and shortcomings. This paper describes a new splinting technique which offers improved comfort and handling to the patient and dentist alike.

AB  - This is the first controlled study of an expressive arts group intervention with unaccompanied minor asylum seeking children. The aim of the study was to examine whether such an intervention may alleviate symptoms of trauma and enhance life satisfaction and hope. One hundred forty five unaccompanied minor refugee boys with their stated age between 15 and 18 were allocated into a 10 session 5 weeks manualized expressive arts intervention (EXIT) or a life as usual (LAU) control group. The participants were assessed at onset and 4 times over a period of 25 months with a battery of instruments measuring post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), general psychological distress (HSCL-25A), current life satisfaction (CLS) and expected life satisfaction (ELS). The instruments were presented in the participants? native languages, using touch-screen laptops and the computer program Multilingual Computer Assisted Interview (MultiCASI). There were significant time by group interactions in favor of the EXIT group for PTSS and CLS. At the end of the follow up the EXIT group had higher life satisfaction and hope for the future than the LAU group. A manualized EXIT group intervention can have a beneficial effect on helping minor refugee boys to cope with symptoms of trauma, strengthen their life satisfaction and develop hope for the future. Our findings support previous studies showing that the arts may help people in reconstructing meaning and connection with others by focusing on resources and creativity.

AB  - Abstract Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a relatively highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that is associated with very high personal and socioeconomic costs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the relationship between complex trauma and key features of BPD, with a focus on problems with self-coherence and self-continuity. We first review evidence for the high prevalence of complex trauma in BPD patients. This is followed by a discussion of emerging knowledge concerning the biobehavioral mechanisms involved in problems related to self and identity in BPD. We emphasize three biobehavioral systems that are affected by complex trauma and are centrally implicated in identify diffusion in BPD: the attachment system, mentalizing or social cognition, and the capacity for epistemic trust?that is, an openness to the reception of social communication that is personally relevant and of generalizable significance. We formulate a new approach to personality and severe personality disorders, and to problems with self and identity in these disorders, rooted in a social-communicative understanding of the foundations of selfhood. We also discuss how extant evidence-based treatments address the above-mentioned biobehavioral systems involved in identity diffusion in BPD and related disorders, and the supporting evidence. We close the paper with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Summary Treatment paradigms for bleeding and major vascular injury have evolved with the rise of endovascular surgery. Just over 2% of trauma patients suffer a vascular injury. The decision for endovascular or open intervention should be guided by the patient's clinical status, anatomy of the injury, and the resources available. Early endovascular procedures for solid organ injury are independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk after controlling for major confounders, including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival. In all-comers, the arterial injuries are transection (35%), occlusion (17%), partial transection/flow limiting defect (25%), pseudoaneurysm (9.0%), and other injuries including intimal defects (23%). Over half of the patients can be managed with non-operative management with a low 4% failure rate and conversion to intervention. Definitive endovascular and open repair were used in <10% and <25% of all patients, respectively, presenting to level 1 trauma centers.

AB  - ABSTRACT Systems orientated research offers the possibility of identifying novel therapeutic targets and relevant diagnostic markers for complex diseases such as osteoarthritis. This review demonstrates that the osteoarthritis research community has been slow to incorporate systems orientated approaches into research studies, although a number of key studies reveal novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms that contribute both to joint tissue homeostasis and its dysfunction. The review introduces both top-down and bottom-up approaches employed in the study of osteoarthritis. A holistic and multiscale approach, where clinical measurements may predict dysregulation and progression of joint degeneration, should be a key objective in future research. The review concludes with suggestions for further research and emerging trends not least of which is the coupled development of diagnostic tests and therapeutics as part of a concerted effort by the osteoarthritis research community to meet clinical needs. ? 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Objective To detail the 9-year experience of renal trauma at a modern Level 1 trauma centre and report on patterns of injury, management and complications. Patients and methods We analysed 338 patients with renal injuries who presented to our institution over a 9-year period. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, management and complications were recorded. Results Males comprised 74.9% of patients with renal injuries and the highest incidence was amongst those aged 20?24 years. Blunt injuries comprised 96.2% (n = 325) of all the renal injuries, with road trauma being the predominant mechanism accounting for 72.5% of injuries. The distribution of injury grade was; 21.6% grade 1 (n = 73), 24.3% grade 2 (n = 82), 24.9% grade 3 (n = 84), 16.6% grade 4 (n = 56), and 12.7% grade 5 (n = 43). Conservative management was successful in all grade 1 and 2 renal injuries, and 94.9%, 90.7% and 35.1% of grade 3, 4 and 5 injuries respectively. All but one of the 13 patients with penetrating injuries were successfully managed conservatively. Conclusions Road trauma is the greatest cause of renal injury. Most haemodynamically stable patients are successfully managed conservatively.

AB  - Symmetrical alopecia in dogs can be a clinical presentation that is frustrating to address in daily practice. A complete work-up should include evaluating the breed characteristics, taking a complete history and carrying out a complete physical and dermatological evaluation. A list of differential diagnoses should help to decide which diagnostic tests should be performed to rule out ectoparasites, infections, endocrine disorders and follicular disorders. The treatment options should be discussed with the owners because, for some alopecic conditions, e.g. follicular dysplasia, there may be no effective therapy and the alopecia may be just a cosmetic disorder.

This study assessed expert consensus on the traumatic potential of a broader range of adverse life events, and differences in symptom manifestation and behavioural symptom equivalents of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Method The present authors conducted a three-step Delphi survey using a mixed-methods design. Twenty-nine expert raters participated in the survey, and 16 persisted to the final round. Consensus was calculated using the interquartile range. Results Traumatic potential was attributed to adverse life events, particularly revolving around sexuality and autonomy. DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD were rated as partially adequate, with behavioural symptom expression being the main difference to the general population. Conclusion The range of traumatic events should be broadened for people with intellectual disabilities. A specific subset of events need to be defined in future research. Detection of PTSD depends upon determining specific symptom correlates of challenging behaviour.

AB  - Abstract? Background: Rupture of the innominate artery is the second most common intrathoracic arterial injury from blunt trauma. It is frequently accompanied by major trauma to other organs. The traditional management is expeditious surgical repair. Methods: Three patients presented to the Emergency Department after motor vehicle collisions with traumatic rupture of the innominate artery from 2001 to 2003. One patient presented with an isolated innominate artery injury. The other two patients presented with multi-system trauma. All patients underwent surgical repair; however, repair was individualized in each case. Results: Diagnosis was obtained via arteriography in all patients after the admission chest radiographs suggested mediastinal injury. In the patient with isolated traumatic innominate artery rupture, urgent repair was performed. In the remaining two, the repair was intentionally delayed (hospital day 4 and 19) until they stabilized or recovered from other injuries or complications. In one of these patients, repair was delayed after an endovascular repair failed. In both patients who underwent delayed repair, mean arterial pressure was maintained at <70 mmHg with beta-blockade. All patients underwent repair without cardiopulmonary bypass and were monitored for adequate cerebral perfusion pressures by measuring the right carotid artery stump pressure. Successful repair was achieved in all the three patients without postoperative complications or mortality. Conclusions: Rupture of the innominate artery from blunt trauma is an infrequent but life-threatening injury that mandates repair. In patients with isolated injuries, prompt intervention is warranted. However, intentional delayed repair may be a practical alternative for those patients with multi-system trauma.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Although individual HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) show good performance in evaluations conducted by WHO, reports from several African countries highlight potentially significant performance issues. Despite widespread use of RDTs for HIV diagnosis in resource-constrained settings, there has been no systematic, head-to-head evaluation of their accuracy with specimens from diverse settings across sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a standardized, centralized evaluation of eight HIV RDTs and two simple confirmatory assays at a WHO collaborating centre for evaluation of HIV diagnostics using specimens from six sites in five sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Specimens were transported to the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Antwerp, Belgium for testing. The tests were evaluated by comparing their results to a state-of-the-art reference algorithm to estimate sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Results: 2785 samples collected from August 2011 to January 2015 were tested at ITM. All RDTs showed very high sensitivity, from 98.8% for First Response HIV Card Test 1?2.0 to 100% for Determine HIV 1/2, Genie Fast, SD Bioline HIV 1/2 3.0 and INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Test kit. Specificity ranged from 90.4% for First Response to 99.7% for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK with wide variation based on the geographical origin of specimens. Multivariate analysis showed several factors were associated with false-positive results, including gender, provider-initiated testing and the geographical origin of specimens. For simple confirmatory assays, the total sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 98.8% for ImmunoComb II HIV 12 CombFirm (ImmunoComb) and 99.7% and 98.4% for Geenius HIV 1/2 with indeterminate rates of 8.9% and 9.4%. Conclusions: In this first systematic head-to-head evaluation of the most widely used RDTs, individual RDTs performed more poorly than in the WHO evaluations: only one test met the recommended thresholds for RDTs of â‰¥99% sensitivity and â‰¥98% specificity. By performing all tests in a centralized setting, we show that these differences in performance cannot be attributed to study procedure, end-user variation, storage conditions, or other methodological factors. These results highlight the existence of geographical and population differences in individual HIV RDT performance and underscore the challenges of designing locally validated algorithms that meet the latest WHO-recommended thresholds.

AB  - Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can be used to show brain function. Courts have admitted PET scan evidence in cases involving brain damage, injury, toxic exposure, or illness (?brain trauma?) and to support claims of diminished cognitive abilities and impulse control. Despite the limited data on the relationships between PET, brain trauma and behavior, many courts admit PET scan evidence without much critical analysis. This article examines the use of PET as proof of functional impairment and justification of abnormal behavior by explaining its diagnostic use and limitations, the limited support for claims of its relationship to behavior, and evidentiary considerations that should govern its admission into court as evidence. The authors urge courts to consider PET evidence, claims of experts, and the scope of the proposed testimony with greater deference to the clinical scope of PET, as outlined by the American College of Radiology's appropriateness criteria and the Working Group Report of the American Psychiatric Association.

AB  - Abstract Background There is limited evidence describing the long-term outcomes of severe pelvic ring fractures. The aim of this study was to describe the longer term independent living and return to work outcomes following severe pelvic ring fracture. Methods Adult survivors to discharge from two major trauma centres with AO/Tile type B and C fractures were followed up at 6, 12 and 24-months post-injury to capture functional (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOS-E]) and return to work data. Multivariable, mixed effects models were used to identify predictors of outcome. Results A total of 111 of 114 (97%) cases were followed up. The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.9 (18.9) years, 77% were male, 81% were transport-related and 90% were multi-trauma patients. Further, 11% were managed conservatively, 10% with external fixation and 79% with open reduction and internal fixation. At 24 months, 77% were living independently (GOS-E > 4) and 59% had returned to work. Higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were associated with lower risk-adjusted odds of return to work (P = 0.04) and independent living (P = 0.06). Post-operative infection was associated with living independently (P = 0.02). Conclusion Despite the severity of the injuries sustained, 77% of severe pelvic ring fracture patients were living independently and 59% had returned to work, 2-years post-injury. Fracture type and management were not key predictors of outcome. Large-scale multi-centre studies are needed to fully understand the burden of severe pelvic ring fractures and to guide clinical management.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of primary coronal caries should be seen as a complex process, comprising both detection and measurement phases, which enables clinicians, researchers and epidemiologists to make informed decisions about the management and prognosis of the disease process. The different diagnostic thresholds employed for measurements of caries experience can be viewed as an iceberg, a metaphor which demonstrates the ambiguity of the term ?caries free? and which can also represent the differing management options appropriate for the care of different types of active and inactive lesions: NAC (No Active Care), PCA (Preventive Care Advised) and OCA (Operative Care Advised). There are considerable methodological difficulties in drawing valid comparisons between studies using incompatible criteria and simulations. However, it is apparent that no caries diagnostic tool in current clinical use fulfils all of the ideal criteria for measurements needed to plan and monitor appropriate care. Systems providing reliable serial measurements with which to assess future caries risk and present caries activity are urgently required, as diagnostic tasks are becoming both more difficult and more important from the standpoint of long-term oral health. Existing diagnostic tools frequently rely on subjective judgements and provide only semi-quantitative measures insensitive to smaller lesions. In the future tools are needed which are objective, quantitative and which can provide acceptable compromises between sensitivity and specificity for a wide range of applications for individual patient care as well as for research and survey use. Key problem areas with existing tools include confusion in terminology and between caries assessments made by clinicians and epidemiologists as well as the lack of valid measurements relating to the activity of primary root caries and secondary caries. Deficiencies with current tools impact on the care of individuals by allowing false negative diagnoses of hidden occlusal dentine lesions and approximal cavities on the one hand, whilst generating some false positive diagnoses on sound surfaces leading to inappropriate decisions to restore on the other. At the population level, current conventional tools significantly underestimate overall caries experience. In future the adoption of more accurate and reliable methods would facilitate more effective preventive care and promote more appropriate restorative treatment decisions. Research in this area should focus for the next five years on diagnostic technologies which: 1) inform valid prospective caries risk assessments for different age groups, 2) can help to determine present caries activity and monitor lesion behaviour over time and 3) help identify methods which can implement existing and new research knowledge about diagnostic tools into clinical and research practice.
