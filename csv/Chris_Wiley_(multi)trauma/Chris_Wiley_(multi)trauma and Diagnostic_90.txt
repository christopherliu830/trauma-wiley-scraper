AB  - Summary This chapter begins with a summary of the recent and current diagnostic issues for depression, including a review of the changes for DSM-V. Current diagnostic systems are criticised because of their atheoretical consensus-driven approach, and some suggestions are made about possible theoretical systems that could be used for classification and diagnosis. A summary is presented of some of the epidemiological conundrums that studies of depression across the lifespan have presented. Further issues for the underlying theories and for the practical treatment of depression are presented.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome and owner satisfaction after planectomy for nasal planum neoplasia with cosmetic reconstruction with bilateral labial mucocutaneous rotation flaps in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Twenty-six client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records were searched for dogs that had undergone the procedure. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery, complications, requirement for revision surgery, recurrence, and survival information were recorded. Owners were contacted by telephone about their dog's quality of life after the procedure and their satisfaction with their dog's outcome. Results Twenty-five dogs underwent radical planectomy, and 1 dog underwent resection of the nasal planum. Twenty-four dogs had a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, 1 had a diagnosis of atypical adenocarcinoma, and 1 had a diagnosis of a mast cell tumor. Complications occurred in 19 (73%) dogs, with 9 dogs requiring revision surgery; 1 dog not surviving to discharge. Median survival time was 1542 days (range, 3-2010). Recurrence of the primary tumor was suspected in 2 (7.7%) dogs, both with narrow or incomplete excision. Among 11 owners interviewed, 10 were satisfied with their dog's appearance, and 8 reported they would consent to the procedure again. Conclusion Dehiscence was common after this procedure, but local tumor control and survival times were excellent. Owner satisfaction was high, although preoperative client education is vital. Clinical significance This technique should be considered as a viable option for dogs with nasal planum neoplasia given the high rate of recurrence with less aggressive treatment. Complications common following surgery, but do not persist long term and survival times were excellent.

AB  - Summary Evaluating the child with seizures is a complex process that often involves a variety of different care providers in several settings, including pediatricians, emergency room personnel, teachers, and parents along with the neurologist who may be ultimately responsible for the diagnosis and management of the patient. This chapter will attempt to discuss the tools and diagnostic tests involved in this process, and current practice parameters regarding emergent evaluation and initial assessment. We outline a strategy for evaluation of seizures that includes a discussion of accurate diagnosis, etiology, and assessment of recurrence risk in order to determine appropriate management and counseling. This covers history-taking, assessment of comorbidities, and physical examination. Additional neurodiagnostic assessments are also considered, including EEG, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) can be troublesome, but early recognition and knowledge of risk factors are primordial for prevention and control. Objectives 1) Improvement of early clinical recognition, and 2) identification of factors potentially of importance for spread. Study design Retrospective descriptive study of EHM cases and statistical comparison to acutely neurologically affected horses negative for EHM. Methods Files from a French epidemiosurveillance programme for equine infectious neurological diseases (2008?2011) were reviewed. Cases were considered EHM (n?=?26) based on presence of acute neurological signs and laboratory confirmation. Cases were considered control cases (n?=?29) when reported to be suffering from acute neurological diseases, but negative for EHM. A subgroup of controls was created that excluded cases with peripheral neuromuscular diseases (n?=?21). Univariate and multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree analysis between groups were performed to identify diagnostic markers and risk factors. Results EHM had a fatality rate of 46% and occurred often in isolated cases. They frequently showed ataxia, paresis and cauda equina affection, but the clinical picture was variable. Univariate analysis identified the following variables as more associated to EHM than to control groups: new horse introduced in herd, vaccination, cauda equina affection, larger herd size, and saddle horses. In the multivariate analysis, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection could be retained. CART analyses identified herd size, month of occurrence, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection as main predictors for EHM. Conclusions Isolated EHM cases occur frequently, accentuating the diagnostic difficulty. History and clinical examination of acutely neurologically affected horses can potentially improve early recognition of EHM. Risk factors were in accordance with other studies, although in a different geographic location and study setup, and therefore strengthen their importance for spread of EHM.

AB  - Screening mammography improved early detection of breast cancer and since then, the percentage of patients with node involvement is declining. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), although helpful in the diagnostic armamentarium of these patients, has consequential limitations. In these patients, moreover, lymphatic invasion (LI) is of utmost importance to determine the risk of local recurrence. To find an adjuvant histologic approach to assist in pre-operative analysis of the patient's risk for having LI and thus sentinel ± non-sentinel axillary lymph node metastasis, one hundred and twenty patients with early invasive duct carcinoma without axillary lymph node metastasis were evaluated. Logistic regression predictive models were built from 80 patients and validated in the remaining 40 patients. The final stepwise multi-regression analysis identified four sensitive models. In the validation group, model 1 [applicable to tumors grade 3 having micropapillary differentiation (MPD)] correctly identified 92.31% of patients with LI and confirmed LI [positive predictive value (PPV) = 83%], but with moderate sensitivity. Model 2 [applicable to tumors without MPD], model 3 [applicable to tumors grade 1/2], and model 4 [applicable to tumors grade 1/2 having no MPD] all had moderate PPV and a high negative predictive value (NPV) rendering these models reliable negative tests. However, as they had high sensitivity, positive results confirm the presence of LI. Patient with tumors grade 3 and MPD might need SLNB and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Patients having tumors grade 1/2, size <2 cm, and no MPD nor extensive retraction artifact, SLNB and/or ALND could be omitted. In tumors grade 1/2 (model 2) and those without MPD (model 3), the proposed models are reliable negative tests rather than a definitive positive one.

AB  - Abstract On January 5, 2019, the Associated Press reported that a woman thought to have been in the vegetative state for over a decade gave birth at a Hacienda HealthCare facility. Until she delivered, the staff at the Phoenix center had not noticed that their patient was pregnant. The patient was also misdiagnosed. Misdiagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness in institutional settings is more the norm than the exception. Misdiagnosis is also connected to a broad and extremely significant change in the understanding of the vegetative state?a change that the field of bioethics has not yet fully taken into account. In September 2018, the American Academy of Neurology, the American College of Rehabilitation Medicine, and the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research issued a comprehensive evidence-based review on disorders of consciousness and an associated practice guideline on the care of these patients. These landmark publications update the 1994 Multi-Society Task Force Report on the Vegetative State, which subcategorized the persistent vegetative state as either persistent (once the vegetative state lasted one month) or permanent (once the vegetative state lasted three months after anoxic injury or twelve months after traumatic injury). Noting that 20 percent of patients thought to be permanently unconscious might regain some level of consciousness, the new guideline has eliminated the permanent vegetative state as a diagnostic category, replacing it with the chronic vegetative state.

AB  - Abstract Background Whether the introduction of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has an effect on transplant outcome for different age categories remain unclear. Methods We analyzed 49,762 adult hepatitis C virus (HCV) candidates through 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2012 from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Patients were divided into four age categories (18?34, 35?49, 60?64, ≥65 years) in the pre-MELD era and MELD era, respectively. Results Waiting list dropouts have decreased in the MELD era for all categories. A reduced trend in survival was observed for 18?34 years patients in the MELD era compared with the pre-MELD era, with 5-year intention-to-treat, overall and graft survival of 56.5%, 57.9%, 56.3% vs. 56.4%, 69.7%, 64.4% (P = 0.604, 0.034, and 0.071, respectively). For other age categories, survival rates were all superior in the MELD era. Cox-regression analysis showed values of hazard ratio for age increased with advanced age (all >1) in the pre-MELD era compared with the reference group (18?34 years), while these hazard ratios were <1 for overall and graft survival in MELD era. Conclusions Our study provides useful evidence that the introduction of MELD for liver allocation may adversely affect survival of specific HCV patients.

AB  - New-onset diabetes after liver transplantation (NODALT) is a frequent complication with an unfavorable outcome. We previously demonstrated a crucial link between donor graft genetics and the risk of NODALT. We selected 15 matched pairs of NODALT and non-NODALT liver recipients using propensity score matching analysis. The donor liver tissues were tested for the expression of 10 microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating human hepatic glucose homeostasis. The biological functions of potential target genes were predicted using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Both miR-103 and miR-181a were significantly highly expressed in the NODALT group as compared to the non-NODALT group. The predicted target genes (e.g. Irs2, Pik3r1, Akt2, and Gsk3b) were involved in glucose import and the insulin signaling pathway. We also observed dysregulation of miRNAs (e.g. let-7, miR-26b, miR-145, and miR-183) in cultured human hepatocytes treated with tacrolimus or high glucose, the two independent risk factors of NODALT identified in this cohort. The hepatic miRNA profiles altered by tacrolimus or hyperglycemia were associated with insulin resistance and glucose homeostatic imbalance as revealed by enrichment analysis. The disease susceptibility miRNA expressive pattern could be imported directly from the donor and consolidated by the transplant factors.

Study Design Retrospective case series; multicenter study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n=17) and cats (n=10). Methods Signalment, clinical signs, side affected, surgical data, preoperative diagnostic tests (including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, cytologic diagnosis, chest radiographs, and computed tomography), histologic diagnosis, surgical complications, adjunctive therapy, and date and cause of death were collected from records of dogs and cats that underwent pneumonectomy. Survival estimates and complication were assessed. Results Seventeen animals had a left-sided pneumonectomy performed (12 dogs, 5 cats) and 10 animals had a right-sided pneumonectomy (5 dogs, 5 cats). Fourteen animals were diagnosed with neoplasia (52%). The overall incidence of complications for dogs and cats were 76 and 80%, respectively, with major complications in 41 and 50%, respectively. Respiratory complications (persistent pleural effusion, oxygen dependence, persistent increased respiratory rate, or coughing) were the most frequent complications. No animals died or were euthanatized intraoperative or within the first 24 hours postoperative. One dog (6%) and 2 cats (20%) died, or were euthanatized in the first 2 weeks postoperative. Conclusion Based on this case series, right and left pneumonectomy can be performed with low perioperative mortality in dogs and cats, with some animals experiencing prolonged survival.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The metabolic syndrome (MS), a cluster of central obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, conveys an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome traits (MST) in long-term survivors of pediatric sarcoma (SARC) who received multi-modality therapy (MMT). Methods Thirty-two SARC survivors (predominantly Ewings; median age 36.5; median age at MMT 15) underwent body composition, activity, and psychosocial analysis. Serum endocrine and inflammatory parameters and urine beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated. The prevalence of MST was compared to age- and gender-matched U.S. population data. Results SARC survivors were more likely to have two or more MST (OR 2.38 95% CI: [1.14, 5.04]). Analysis of individual MST demonstrated higher prevalence of hypertension (OR 2.61 95% CI: [1.20, 5.59]), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 3.63 95% CI: [1.75, 7.60]), and male visceral abdominal obesity (20?39 years old OR 4.63 95% CI: [0.91, 21.63], 40?59 years old OR infinity). Survivors 18?39 years old had a higher prevalence of the MS (OR 4.29 95% CI: [1.50, 11.21]), defined as three or more MST. Plasminogen activator inhibitory activity (P?=?0.016) and B2M (P?=?0.027) increased with increasing numbers of MST. In males, total testosterone declined (P?=?0.0027) as the number of MST increased. Average (P?=?0.014) and maximum (P?=?0.021) activity levels decreased as the number of MST increased. Conclusion After a median follow up of 17 years, adult SARC survivors of MMT had an increased prevalence of MST, especially those less than 40 years old. The development of MST in this population was associated with decreased testosterone and activity levels. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2008;50:341?346. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Stereological techniques have been increasingly employed for assessment and characterization of neuromuscular diseases in humans and animals. As an adjunct to histopathology, morphometrical algorithms provide quantitative evidence of the peripheral nerve composition, thereby shedding light on its fibre characteristics and basic electrophysiological properties. In the horse, stereological investigations already have focussed on the recurrent laryngeal, deep peroneal and lateral palmar nerves (LPN). Of these, only the latter is suitable for taking biopsies in clinical settings, however, it does not contain any motor fibres and Ia-afferents. On account of its virtually mixed fibre qualities, most researchers today recommend the cervical branch of the equine accessory nerve (AN) for harvesting diagnostic samples. Thus, the present study was carried out to gain morphometrical proof of the AN composition and to obtain stereological base values in healthy individuals using state-of-the-art technology. All parameters were compared to the common peroneal nerve (CPN), known to harbour all myelinated fibre classes. As this second biopsy site is located farther distally to the neuro-axis, attention was paid to possible length-dependent features. Taken together, digital image analysis could be accurately applied on all AN samples. Stereology supported the histological and clinical evidence that the AN contains all myelinated fibre types. The huge range and scatter of fibre counts and density (3351?17?812/mm²) per fascicle were comparable to that measured in the equine common peroneal, deep peroneal, lateral palmar and recurrent laryngeal nerves. Similar to those, fibre diameter distribution was bimodal with slow A?- and A?-mechanoceptor afferents outnumbering large myelinated Aα-fibres by a factor of about 1.5. With a g-ratio at 0.55?±?0.001, the overall degree of myelination in the AN is highly consistent and insignificantly ranges between that of the equine common peroneal and LPNs. Apart from this subtle deviation, a statistically relevant difference between the more proximal AN and the distal CPN could not be documented. By obtaining morphometrical standard parameters and even more sophisticated distribution indices, stereology is a valuable tool for detection of subtle changes that are likely to escape from the investigators? eyes. The AN serves as a reliable source for advanced peripheral nerve research and should be accompanied by farther distal nerve probes for assessment of neuropathies that present with a proximodistal gradient.

AB  - Background and purpose This study aimed to assess the predictive value of multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on survival in a large cohort of patients with motor neuron disease (MND), in combination with clinical and cognitive features. Methods Two hundred MND patients were followed up prospectively for a median of 4.13 years. At baseline, subjects underwent neurological examination, cognitive assessment and brain MRI. Grey matter volumes of cortical and subcortical structures and diffusion tensor MRI metrics of white matter tracts were obtained. A multivariable Royston?Parmar survival model was created using clinical and cognitive variables. The increase of survival prediction accuracy provided by MRI variables was assessed. Results The multivariable clinical model included predominant upper or lower motor neuron presentations and diagnostic delay as significant prognostic predictors, reaching an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of a 4-year survival prediction of 0.79. The combined clinical and MRI model including selected grey matter fronto-temporal volumes and diffusion tensor MRI metrics of the corticospinal and extra-motor tracts reached an AUC of 0.89. Considering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients only, the clinical model including diagnostic delay and semantic fluency scores provided an AUC of 0.62, whereas the combined clinical and MRI model reached an AUC of 0.77. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that brain MRI measures of motor and extra-motor structural damage, when combined with clinical and cognitive features, are useful predictors of survival in patients with MND, particularly when a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is made.

AB  - Abstract This article discusses several studies describing either the reevaluation and validation of existing scales for measuring anxiety (i.e., the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale for adults and for children and adolescents, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, the Self-Rating Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist), or the development and validation of new scales (i.e., the Social Thoughts and Beliefs Scale, the Social Phobia Diagnostic Questionnaire, the Aberdeen Trauma Screening Index and the Health Anxiety Inventory). As an increasing number of rating scales have been developed over the past several years, a critical review of their usefulness and psychometric properties seems pertinent and prudent.

AB  - The validity of a Dutch self-report inventory of dyslexia was ascertained in two samples of students. Six biographical questions, 20 general language statements and 56 specific language statements were based on dyslexia as a multi-dimensional deficit. Dyslexia and non-dyslexia were assessed with two criteria: identification with test results (Sample 1) and classification using biographical information (both samples). Using discriminant analyses, these criteria were predicted with various groups of statements. All together, 11 discriminant functions were used to estimate classification accuracy of the inventory. In Sample 1, 15 statements predicted the test criterion with classification accuracy of 98%, and 18 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 97%. In Sample 2, 16 statements predicted the biographical criterion with classification accuracy of 94%. Estimations of positive and negative predictive value were 89% and 99%. Items of various discriminant functions were factor analysed to find characteristic difficulties of students with dyslexia, resulting in a five-factor structure in Sample 1 and a four-factor structure in Sample 2. Answer bias was investigated with measures of internal consistency reliability. Less than 20 self-report items are sufficient to accurately classify students with and without dyslexia. This supports the usefulness of self-assessment of dyslexia as a valid alternative to diagnostic test batteries. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract? Sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) is the gold standard for assessing sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), but is considered a diagnostic sensitivity of 30?80% and associated with significant complications of pancreatitis. Electromyography (EMG) of sphincter of Oddi (SO) using a circular electrode (CE) may be useful in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing complications. To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the CE, we record myoelectric activity of SO in rabbits using the CE to compare with the traditional needle electrode (NE). The CE was prepared using a double-channel biogel catheter with two silver rings at the head of the catheter. The CE was then inserted into the lumen of the SO through the duodenal papilla, and myoelectric activity was recorded in the SO in 30 rabbits. An EMG recorded using an NE was performed at the same time, when the SO was in basal state, after injection of cholecystokinin and N-butylscopolamine bromide. Electromyographs recorded by the two methods were then evaluated. Satisfactory SO EMGs were acquired using the CE without any injury. Simultaneous recording revealed a very similar traces and one-to-one correspondence of SO spike bursts (SOSB). Linear regression analysis showed a significant direct correlation between the two methods for SOSB duration and amplitude. The results suggested that CE was comparable with NE in terms of recording efficacy. The CE also has advantages of easy fixation, accurate localisation, broad applicability and ease of achieving satisfactory outcomes without trauma, compared with the NE.

AB  - Background Disruptions in emotion regulation are a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology. However, scant research has examined whether emotion regulation strategies are related to the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among youths exposed to trauma. We investigated whether pretrauma emotion regulation strategies prospectively predicted PTSD symptom onset after the 2013 Boston Marathon terrorist attack among adolescents and whether these associations were moderated by the degree of exposure to media coverage of the attack. Methods A sample of 78 Boston-area adolescents (mean age = 16.72 years, 65% female) who previously participated in studies assessing emotion regulation and psychopathology were recruited following the terrorist attack. Within 4 weeks of the attack, we assessed self-reported PTSD symptoms and attack-related media exposure via an online survey. We examined the association of pretrauma emotion regulation strategies with PTSD symptom onset after adjustment for pretrauma internalizing symptoms and violence exposure. Results Greater pretrauma engagement in rumination predicted onset of PTSD symptoms following the attack. Adolescents who engaged in catastrophizing also had greater PTSD symptoms postattack, but only when exposed to high levels of media coverage of the attacks; the same pattern was observed for adolescents who engaged in low levels of cognitive reappraisal. Conclusions Engagement in specific emotion regulation strategies prior to a traumatic event predicts the onset of PTSD symptoms among youths exposed to trauma, extending transdiagnostic models of emotion regulation to encompass trauma-related psychopathology in children and adolescents.
