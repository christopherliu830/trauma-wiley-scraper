AB  - Background Disruptions in emotion regulation are a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology. However, scant research has examined whether emotion regulation strategies are related to the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among youths exposed to trauma. We investigated whether pretrauma emotion regulation strategies prospectively predicted PTSD symptom onset after the 2013 Boston Marathon terrorist attack among adolescents and whether these associations were moderated by the degree of exposure to media coverage of the attack. Methods A sample of 78 Boston-area adolescents (mean age = 16.72 years, 65% female) who previously participated in studies assessing emotion regulation and psychopathology were recruited following the terrorist attack. Within 4 weeks of the attack, we assessed self-reported PTSD symptoms and attack-related media exposure via an online survey. We examined the association of pretrauma emotion regulation strategies with PTSD symptom onset after adjustment for pretrauma internalizing symptoms and violence exposure. Results Greater pretrauma engagement in rumination predicted onset of PTSD symptoms following the attack. Adolescents who engaged in catastrophizing also had greater PTSD symptoms postattack, but only when exposed to high levels of media coverage of the attacks; the same pattern was observed for adolescents who engaged in low levels of cognitive reappraisal. Conclusions Engagement in specific emotion regulation strategies prior to a traumatic event predicts the onset of PTSD symptoms among youths exposed to trauma, extending transdiagnostic models of emotion regulation to encompass trauma-related psychopathology in children and adolescents.

AB  - The identification and interpretation of brain damage resulting from a non-missile head injury is often not easy with the result that the most obvious structural damage identified postmortem may not be the most important in trying to establish clinico-pathological correlations. For example patients with a fracture of the skull, quite severe cerebral contusions or a large intracranial haematoma that is successfully treated can make an uneventful and complete recovery if no other types of brain damage are present. However, not infrequently more subtle forms of pathology are present and ones that can only be identified microscopically. A systematic and pragmatic approach through the autopsy is therefore required and one that recognises the need for tissue to be retained in ways that are appropriate for cellular and molecular studies.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To explore father?child communication following the diagnosis of maternal breast cancer, examine disparities in their understandings of the impact of the illness, and identify gaps in their need for support and information. Methods: The design is the qualitative interview study with thematic analysis. The interviews were home-based with fathers and children in Oxfordshire, UK. The participants were 26 fathers whose partners had early breast cancer and 31 of their children aged between 6 and 18 years. Results: Fathers described graphically their reaction to news of their partner's breast cancer and their attempts to provide support for their partners and maintain normal family life for their children. Fathers were keen to reassure and protect children but often said that they lacked sufficient information about breast cancer?especially side effects of treatments. Fathers sometimes did not recognise the extent of their children's distress and some interpreted their children's reactions as ?bad behaviour? or ?rudeness?. Children were often acutely aware of the father's emotional state, and expressed a wish to protect him. Some fathers would have liked an opportunity to talk to a clinician directly about the children but did not want to claim clinical time for themselves or their children. Conclusion: This study suggests that clinicians could improve their care of breast cancer patients by being more family-centred. Fathers routinely need more information and preparation about the likely impact of the illness and its treatment (especially side effects) on the mother, and how children of different ages may react to the emotional strain. Clinicians need to be prepared to offer to talk to teenagers. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract? Sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) is the gold standard for assessing sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), but is considered a diagnostic sensitivity of 30?80% and associated with significant complications of pancreatitis. Electromyography (EMG) of sphincter of Oddi (SO) using a circular electrode (CE) may be useful in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing complications. To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the CE, we record myoelectric activity of SO in rabbits using the CE to compare with the traditional needle electrode (NE). The CE was prepared using a double-channel biogel catheter with two silver rings at the head of the catheter. The CE was then inserted into the lumen of the SO through the duodenal papilla, and myoelectric activity was recorded in the SO in 30 rabbits. An EMG recorded using an NE was performed at the same time, when the SO was in basal state, after injection of cholecystokinin and N-butylscopolamine bromide. Electromyographs recorded by the two methods were then evaluated. Satisfactory SO EMGs were acquired using the CE without any injury. Simultaneous recording revealed a very similar traces and one-to-one correspondence of SO spike bursts (SOSB). Linear regression analysis showed a significant direct correlation between the two methods for SOSB duration and amplitude. The results suggested that CE was comparable with NE in terms of recording efficacy. The CE also has advantages of easy fixation, accurate localisation, broad applicability and ease of achieving satisfactory outcomes without trauma, compared with the NE.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the abdominal and abdominal vascular injury. The presence of a seat belt sign (SBS) on the abdomen is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal injuries. In adult populations, the presence of an SBS increases the risk of intra-abdominal injury twofold to eightfold. An SBS may be even more concerning in pediatric patients where rates of intra-abdominal injury can be increased as much as twelvefold. Damage-control surgery (DCS) has been applied to many surgical conditions including nontraumatic abdominal surgery, vascular surgery, and orthopedic surgery. For the trauma patient in extremis with noncompressible abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is gaining popularity as an alternative to resuscitative thoracotomy and aortic clamping. Abdominal compartment syndrome can affect many body systems including neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and genitourinary.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is intended to rapidly assess patients when access to other diagnostic imaging modalities is limited. The advantage of POCUS is that clinicians can use real-time images rather than images recorded and reported by a sonographer or a radiologist, thus allowing immediate correlation of findings with signs and symptoms. Defining POCUS curricula appropriate to specific low resource settings will be important for targeted allocation of training resources. Bedside assessment of deep venous thrombosis is one of the most useful POCUS applications as it is easy to perform, and has immediate therapeutic consequences. As face-to-face POCUS training modules are by definition short and the trainer is usually only available for a short period of time, methods to ensure continuous support and quality assurance need to be considered when designing or implementing training. A POCUS protocol is therefore frequently used in trauma patients and is well established.

AB  - Abstract There is a critical and growing need for emergency physicians and emergency medicine resources worldwide. To meet this need, physicians must be trained to deliver time-sensitive interventions and life-saving emergency care. Currently, there is no internationally recognized, standard curriculum that defines the basic minimum standards for emergency medicine education. To address this lack, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) convened a committee of international physicians, health professionals and other experts in emergency medicine and international emergency medicine development, to outline a curriculum for foundation training of medical students in emergency medicine. This curriculum document represents the consensus of recommendations by this committee. The curriculum is designed with a focus on the basic minimum emergency medicine educational content that any medical school should be delivering to its students during their undergraduate years of training. It is designed, not to be prescriptive, but to assist educators and emergency medicine leadership in advancing physician education in basic emergency medicine content. The content would be relevant, not just for communities with mature emergency medicine systems, but also for developing nations or for nations seeking to expand emergency medicine within current educational structures. We anticipate that there will be wide variability in how this curriculum is implemented and taught, reflecting the existing educational milieu, the resources available, and the goals of the institutions' educational leadership.

AB  - A four-year-old, entire male domestic cat was referred for assessment of a large abdominal mass of three-weeks duration. Diagnostic imaging suggested the presence of either splenic neoplasia, an abdominal abscess or haematoma. A coeliotomy was performed and an enlarged, irregular mass, including the left kidney and adrenal gland, was identified. The mass was removed, requiring a left adrenalo-uretero-nephrectomy. The aorta was accidentally punctured during the procedure, resulting in paraplegia. Given a poor prognosis, the owners decided to have the cat euthanased. Histological examination of the mass was characteristic of a chronic expanding haematoma.

AB  - Abstract In an emergency department (ED), computed tomography (CT) is particularly beneficial in the investigation of high-speed trauma patients. With the advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) scanners, it is becoming faster and easier to conduct scans. In recent years, this has become evident with an increasing number of CT requests. Patients who have multiple CT scans during their hospital stay can receive radiation doses that have an increased theoretical risk of induction of cancer. It is essential that the clinical justification for each CT scan be considered on an individual basis and that due consideration is given to the radiation risk and possible diagnostic benefit. The current lack of a central State or Commonwealth data repository for medical images is a contributing factor to excessive radiation dosage to the population. The principles of justification and radiation risks are discussed in this study.

AB  - Summary Fusarium species are emerging causative agents of superficial, cutaneous and systemic human infections. In a study of the prevalence and genetic diversity of 464 fungal isolates from a dermatological ward in Thailand, 44 strains (9.5%) proved to belong to the genus Fusarium. Species identification was based on sequencing a portion of translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-Œ±), rDNA internal transcribed spacer and RNA-dependent polymerase subunit II (rpb2). Our results revealed that 37 isolates (84%) belonged to the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), one strain matched with Fusarium oxysporum (FOSC) complex 33, while six others belonged to the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex. Within the FSSC two predominant clusters represented Fusarium falciforme and recently described F.¬†keratoplasticum. No gender differences in susceptibility to Fusarium were noted, but infections on the right side of the body prevailed. Eighty-nine per cent of the Fusarium isolates were involved in onychomycosis, while the remaining ones caused paronychia or severe tinea pedis. Comparing literature data, superficial infections by FSSC appear to be prevalent in Asia and Latin America, whereas FOSC is more common in Europe. The available data suggest that Fusarium is a common opportunistic human pathogens in tropical areas and has significant genetic variation worldwide.

AB  - Objective:? Many anti-stigma programmes use the ?mental illness is an illness like any other? approach. This review evaluates the effectiveness of this approach in relation to schizophrenia. Method:? The academic literature was searched, via PsycINFO and MEDLINE, to identify peer-reviewed studies addressing whether public espousal of a biogenetic paradigm has increased over time, and whether biogenetic causal beliefs and diagnostic labelling are associated with less negative attitudes. Results:? The public, internationally, continues to prefer psychosocial to biogenetic explanations and treatments for schizophrenia. Biogenetic causal theories and diagnostic labelling as ?illness?, are both positively related to perceptions of dangerousness and unpredictability, and to fear and desire for social distance. Conclusion:? An evidence-based approach to reducing discrimination would seek a range of alternatives to the ?mental illness is an illness like any other? approach, based on enhanced understanding, from multi-disciplinary research, of the causes of prejudice.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate whether simulated learning programs can be expanded to include aspects of clinical education in medical radiation science (MRS) curricula. Methods: Information about the use and perceptions of simulation in MRS education was collected from academic, clinical and accrediting stakeholders using semi-structured telephone interviews, an online survey, invited comment and face to face consultative meetings. Participants represented the MRS sub-disciplines: Diagnostic Radiography, Radiation Therapy, Nuclear Medicine and Medical Sonography. The following themes were explored with regard to simulation programs: existing, potential expansion of, effectiveness of and implementation. Results: Currently, simulation is widely implemented across Australia to deliver MRS curricula. Areas for potential expansion include: authentic replication of the clinical environment with facilities for video recording, flexible multipurpose space, video demonstrations, online computer assisted tutorials, interactive programs, authentic scenarios using role play or live actors, virtual reality environments and comprehensive digital imaging libraries. The literature revealed no firm evidence that simulation training was more effective than clinical training. Participants in our project viewed simulation as complementary to clinical placement, but not as a replacement for the complexity of situations that clinical placement presents. Stakeholders cautioned for careful curriculum planning and evaluation when implementing simulation in MRS education. Conclusion: This consultative process provided a comprehensive summary of the current use of simulation in MRS and the potential for expansion with examples from the sub-disciplines. There is a need for further research to investigate the effectiveness of simulation in clinical skills development.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to identify the main biological, psychological and sociological problems and potential solutions for patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia by use of Group Problem-Solving Therapy. Background Group Problem-Solving Therapy is a technique for identifying and solving problems, increasing assertiveness, self-esteem and eliminating negative thoughts. Design Qualitative phenomenological interpretive design: Group Problem-Solving Therapy sessions conducted with patients suffering fibromyalgia were studied; participants recruited via the Rheumatology Department at a general hospital and associations in Catalonia, Spain with sessions conducted in nearby university setting. Methods The study included 44 people diagnosed with fibromyalgia (43 female, 1 male) from 6 Group Problem-Solving Therapy sessions. Data collected from March?June 2013. A total of 24 sessions were audio recorded, all with prior informed consent. Data were transcribed and then analysed in accordance with established methods of inductive thematic analysis, via a process of reduction to manage and classify data. Findings Five themes were identified: (1) Current problems are often related to historical trauma; (2) There are no ?one size fits all? solutions; (3) Fibromyalgia is life-changing; (4) Fibromyalgia is widely misunderstood; (5) Statistically Significant impacts on physical, psychological and social are described. Conclusion The majority of patients? problems were associated with their previous history and the onset of fibromyalgia; which may be related to trauma in adolescence, early adulthood or later. The solutions provided during the groups appeared to be accepted by the participants. These findings can improve the self-management of fibromyalgia patients by helping to enhance adaptive behaviours and incorporating the female gender approach.
