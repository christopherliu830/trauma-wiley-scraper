AB  - Abstract Clinical and empirical studies have documented significant alterations in self-related thought in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To our knowledge, however, few studies have examined self-referential cognition by analyzing survivors? written impact statements in individuals whose PTSD is due to interpersonal trauma. In the current study, we performed a linguistic analysis of impact statements (i.e., descriptions of how the trauma has affected the survivors? views of themselves, others, and the world) collected at the start of therapy from women with PTSD that was due to interpersonal trauma, with the goal of determining whether PTSD symptom clusters were associated with altered self-referential thought. We found that higher levels of PTSD-related hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with diminished self-related word use, after controlling for depression severity, f2 = .31. Similarly, diminished negative self-related word use was associated with higher levels of hyperarousal symptoms, f2 = .47. Our findings align with previous research that has provided evidence for a diminished sense of self in PTSD. These results may help inform targeted interventions aimed at improving social-affective functions in PTSD and other psychiatric conditions.

AB  - Abstract Objective To identify the CAMCOG sub-items that best contribute for the identification of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. Methods Cross-sectional assessment of 272 older adults (98 MCI, 82 AD, and 92 controls) with a standardized neuropsychological battery and the CAMCOG schedule. Backward logistic regression analysis with diagnosis (MCI and controls) as dependent variable and the sub-items of the CAMCOG as independent variable was carried out to determine the CAMCOG sub-items that predicted the diagnosis of MCI. Results Lower scores on Language, Memory, Praxis, and Calculation CAMCOG sub-items were significantly associated with the diagnosis of MCI. A composite score obtained by the sum of these scores significantly discriminated MCI patients from comparison groups. This reduced version of the CAMCOG showed similar diagnostic accuracy than the original schedule for the identification of patients with MCI as compared to controls (AUC?=?0.80?±?0.03 for the reduced CAMCOG; AUC?=?0.79?±?0.03 for the original CAMCOG). Conclusion This reduced version of the CAMCOG had similar diagnostic properties as the original CAMCOG and was faster and easier to administer, rendering it more suitable for the screening of subtle cognitive deficits in general clinical practice.

AB  - Summary Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects an estimated 98,400 individuals in the UK, including 21900 who are infected but remain undiagnosed (1). The prevalence of HIV is increasing worldwide, in part due to ongoing transmission and more widespread testing, but also as a consequence of the improved life expectancy which highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has brought. Despite the dramatic reduction in the overall incidence of opportunistic infections in the post-HAART era, there is still significant morbidity and mortality associated with late diagnosis. Late diagnosis (defined as CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 at diagnosis) accounts for approximately 50% of new diagnosis in UK and Europe (1). Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are extremely common amongst individuals living with HIV - the reasons for which are likely to be multi-factorial. Patients may experience GI side effects as a result of antiretroviral therapy or other drugs used to treat HIV-related complications. They may develop opportunistic infections affecting any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, related to their degree of immuno-compromise. Finally, their epidemiological risk group may place them at increased risk of certain diseases e.g. viral hepatitis in injecting drug users, lymphogranuloma venereum in men having sex with men (MSM). It is therefore important for GI physicians to have an awareness of the various manifestations of GI disease in HIV positive patients in order to help formulate a differential diagnosis and guide investigation in those with known infection (Table 1). Recognizing the association between specific conditions and HIV/AIDS may prompt testing by GI physicians and provide a valuable opportunity to diagnose HIV earlier resulting in better clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare but important liver disease that leads to cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation in a high proportion of cases. The disease occurs in approximately 1 per 100,000 population per year, usually presents in adulthood, and affects men more often than women. Typical serum biochemical results, autoantibodies and liver biopsy are suggestive but not diagnostic of PSC, the diagnosis requiring cholangiographic demonstration of stricturing and dilatation of the intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts. The natural history of PSC is variable, the average survival being 12 to 17 years. The cause of PSC is still unknown. Although considered an autoimmune disease, PSC has several atypical features and a strong genetic component. The therapy of PSC is unsatisfactory. Standard doses of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) lead to improvements in biochemical abnormalities but not in histology, cholangiographic appearance or survival. Several innovative therapies have been tried in PSC, but with scant evidence of benefit. For patients with high grade strictures, endoscopic dilatation is beneficial. Liver transplantation is successful for end-stage liver disease due to PSC and improves survival. PSC may recur after transplantation but is rarely progressive. The most dreaded complication of PSC is cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnosis of this highly malignant tumor is difficult, and there are no biomarkers for its early detection. Liver transplantation for cholangiocarcinoma has an exceedingly poor outcome, although transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoirradiation holds promise in selected patients. Thus, significant opportunities remain for basic and clinical research into the cause, natural history, and therapy of PSC. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:746?764.)

AB  - Abstract The main research goal has been to evaluate significant factors affecting the in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters T, T, T2, and 1H density. This approach differs significantly from other such projects in that the experimental data analysis is being performed while concurrently developing automated, computer-aided analysis software for such MRI tissue parameters. In the experimental portion of the project, statistical analyses, and a heuristic minimum/maximum discriminant analysis algorithm have been explored. Both methods have been used to classify tissue types from 1.5 Tesla transaxial MR images of the human brain. The developing program, written in the logic programming language Prolog, is similar in a number of ways to many existing expert systems now in use for other medical applications; inclusion of the underlying statistical data base and advanced statistical analyses is the main differentiating feature of the current approach. First results indicate promising classification accuracy of various brain tissues such as gray and white matter, as well as differentiation of different types of gray matter and white matter (e.g.: caudate-nucleus vs. thalamus, both representatives of gray matter; and, cortical white matter vs. internal capsule as representative of white matter). Taking all four tissue types together, the percentage of correct classifications ranges from 73 to 87%.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the interpretation of radiographs and blood tests from a rheumatological perspective. Multi-system disease implies concurrent signs and symptoms in multiple organ systems. Its identification is often followed by tests to exclude infections and malignancy since their treatment and prognosis varies. The diagnostic pathway then goes down the route of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). SARDs include conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and connective tissue diseases like systemic lupus erythematosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitides and so on. This diagnosis often involves treatment with potent immunosuppressive drugs which, if an infection has not been excluded can cause serious harm. Focusing on the bones, one will have to look for evidence of demineralisation, erosions, joint space narrowing and new bone formation, for example osteophytes.

AB  - Neuroethics and neurolaw are fields of study that involve the interface of neuroscience with clinical and legal decision-making. The past two decades have seen increasing attention being paid to both fields, in large part because of the advances in neuroimaging techniques and improved ability to visualize and measure brain structure and function. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), along with its acute and chronic sequelae, has emerged as a focus of neuroethical issues, such as informed consent for treatment and research, diagnostic and prognostic uncertainties, and the subjectivity of interpretation of data. The law has also more frequently considered TBI in criminal settings for exculpation, mitigation and sentencing purposes and in tort and administrative law for personal injury, disability and worker's compensation cases. This article provides an overview of these topics with an emphasis on the current challenges that the neuroscience of TBI faces in the medicolegal arena. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Background IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multi-systemic disorder. IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is the biliary manifestation of the disease, often in association with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Hepatic manifestations of IgG4-RD are less well described within the literature. Aim To examine and present an overview of IgG4-RD with a focus on the biliary and hepatic manifestations. Methods An electronic search using Medline was performed. Search items included ?IgG4 multi-system disease, IgG4 associated cholangitis, IgG4 associated liver disease and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)?. Results IgG4-RD is characterised by an IgG4-positive lymphoplasmacytic tissue infiltrate, storiform fibrosis and an obliterative phlebitis. The HISORt criteria may be used to establish the diagnosis and incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach involving histology, radiology, serum IgG4 levels and response to steroid therapy. IgG4-SC is the commonest extrapancreatic manifestation of type-1 AIP, while the hepatic manifestations remain poorly defined. Important differential diagnoses include primary sclerosing cholangitis, secondary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma. Current treatment regimens remain ill defined although steroid therapy is used first line unless contraindicated. Patients with relapsing disease or multifocal disease should be considered for azathioprine. Available data would also suggest a role for rituximab. Conclusions IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis is a common manifestation of IgG4-related disease which requires a multi-disciplinary approach to establish the diagnosis. Differentiating IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis from other conditions, both benign and malignant, is challenging, but vital. Steroids remain the mainstay of treatment. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of the hepatic manifestations of IgG4-related disease continues to evolve.

AB  - Summary The principal advantages of electronic radiography that have emerged in the course of early clinical experience may be summarised as follows: 1. Instantaneous availability of images for immediate and unhurried examination. 2. Greatly reduced radiation doses to patient and staff per recorded image. Reduced radiation exposure for given resolution and contrast required. Greater freedom to use x-ray examinations in pregnancy. 3. Increased spatial detail relative to standard spot-films and normal fluoroscopy. 4. Instantaneous production of arterial maps for selective catheterisation and interventional procedures. 5. Precise positioning of catheters and needles through the combination of live and stored reference images. 6. Reduced time for special procedures; reduced patient trauma; more efficient use of die radiologist's time. 7. Reduction in the total amount of contrast material needed in selective catheterisation, with reduction in the risk of contrast effects. 8. Replacement of life-sized images by smaller images, with reduction in film, display, filing and retrieval costs. Abstract New television techniques in diagnostic radiology have been developed as a result of the availability of high resolution imaging components. These electronic radiographic techniques record images with higher image quality than conventional films but with much less radiation dose to the patient and personnel. These methods are being developed for pelvimetry, intrauterine transfusion, gastrointestinal examinations, stereotaxic procedures, and selective catheterisation. Reduction in examination time, dosage of contrast media, and patient trauma can be effected, training can be facilitated, and substantial economies achieved.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: Idiopathic ulcerative laryngitis (IUL) is a distinct, clinical entity that presents after a prolonged upper respiratory infection with cough. It is characterized by the development of bilateral ulcerations of the mid-membranous vocal folds followed by a protracted course of healing. The purpose of this review was to characterize the typical patient presentation, clinical findings, and prognosis. Study Design: Multi-institutional retrospective review Methods: Retrospective review of charts and videostroboscopic exams from patients with IUL at eight institutions. Results: Fifteen cases met the criteria for IUL and were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 49 years, and 93% were female. All patients were nonsmokers. Multiple medical interventions were employed by the treating otolaryngologist during the course of the disease, none of which resulted in acute resolution of the ulcerations. The average time from initial presentation to resolution of the disease was 3.3 months. All of the patients reported that their voice was improved after resolution of the disease process. However, in the majority of the patients (60%) there were persistent vibratory abnormalities after resolution of the ulcerations. Conclusions: This is the first multi-institutional study to define the complete disease course of IUL and to establish diagnostic criteria. IUL is a rare yet well-recognized clinical entity; however, there is no established etiology for this condition and no definitive treatments have emerged. Further study is needed to establish the etiology/risk factors of this condition and to determine optimal medical management.

AB  - Abstract Background The use of grafts from donors with hypertension (HTN) in liver transplantation has grown rapidly recently, but whether HTN donors affect post-liver transplantation survival is unclear. Methods We used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database (2004?2008), and evaluated differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes between recipients of grafts from HTN and non-HTN donors. Kaplan?Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used in assessing patient survival. Results We identified 8,411 recipients of HTN donor grafts (33.2%) and 16,891 (66.8%) recipients of non-HTN donor grafts. Graft and patient survival rates were significantly lower in recipients of HTN donor grafts versus non-HTN donor grafts (1-year, 3-year, and 5-year graft survival rates of 75%, 64%, 50% vs. 80%, 72%, 62% [P < 0.001], respectively, and patient survival rates of 79%, 69%, 56% vs. 83%, 75%, 65% [P < 0.001], respectively). A history of HTN >5 years was also associated with lower rates of graft and patient survival (P < 0.001). A HTN donor was independently associated with a higher risk of graft loss (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.01?1.18). Conclusion The present study shows that graft and patient survivals were lower in recipients of hypertensive donor grafts, and highlights the importance of appropriately screening donors for HTN.
