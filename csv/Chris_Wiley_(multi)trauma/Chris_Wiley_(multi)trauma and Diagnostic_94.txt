Pregnancy-associated acquired haemophilia A: results from the European Acquired Haemophilia (EACH2) registry. BJOG 2012;119:1529?1537. Objective? The European Acquired Haemophilia registry (EACH2) collected data on the demographics, diagnosis, underlying disorders, bleeding characteristics, treatment, and outcome of women with acquired haemophilia A (AHA), a rare and often severe bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies directed against coagulation factor VIII. Design? Prospective, multi-centre, large-scale, pan-European registry. Setting? A total of 117 haemophilia centres in 13 European countries. Population? Pregnancy-associated AHA. Methods? Data were reported using a web-based electronic case report form. Diagnosis was based on the presence of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, reduced coagulation Factor VIII level and positive inhibitor assay. Main outcome measures? Presenting characteristics, time to diagnosis, haemostatic treatment and outcome, immunosuppressive treatment and outcome. Results? The EACH2 registry (n?=?501) documented 42 (8.4%) cases of AHA associated with the peripartum period, a median Factor VIII level at diagnosis of 2.5 (range 0?25)?IU/dl and inhibitor titre of 7.8 (range 0.7?348)?BU/ml. Antepartum inhibitors were evident in eight women. Time to diagnosis of AHA after delivery was 89 (range 21?120) days. First-line haemostatic treatment was successful in 20/23 (87%) women treated. Bleeding episodes resolved in 17/18 (94%) women treated with a bypassing agent and 29/39 (74%) women achieved complete remission with first-line immunosuppressive treatment. Two babies experienced postnatal bleeding, suggesting transplacental transfer of the antibody. All women were alive at last follow-up. Conclusions? Although rare, pregnancy-associated AHA may cause severe bleeding-related morbidity. Once diagnosed, women respond well to haemostatic treatment with bypassing agents and immunosuppression. Awareness of peripartum AHA requires improvement to facilitate rapid and appropriate management.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.

AB  - Abstract Because excitotoxicity may be involved in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, we investigated possible modifications of platelet glutamate uptake in AD patients. High-affinity glutamate uptake was studied in platelets from 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 multi-infarct dementia patients, and 35 age-matched normal controls; it was decreased by 40% in platelets from Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls and with multi-infarct dementia patients. Platelet glutamate uptake could be used as peripheral marker of glutamatergic involvement and as adjunctive diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. Ann Neurol 2000;47:641?643

AB  - Objectives To audit the accuracy of clinical coding in otolaryngology, assess the effectiveness of previously implemented interventions, and determine ways in which it can be further improved. Design Prospective clinician?auditor multidisciplinary audit of clinical coding accuracy. Participants Elective and emergency ENT admissions and day-case activity. Main outcome measures Concordance between initial coding and the clinician?auditor multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) coding in respect of primary and secondary diagnoses and procedures, health resource groupings health resource groupings (HRGs) and tariffs. Results The audit of 3131 randomly selected otolaryngology patients between 2010 and 2012 resulted in 420 instances of change to the primary diagnosis (13%) and 417 changes to the primary procedure (13%). In 1420 cases (44%), there was at least one change to the initial coding and 514 (16%) health resource groupings changed. There was an income variance of £343,169 or £109.46 per patient. The highest rates of health resource groupings change were observed in head and neck surgery and in particular skull-based surgery, laryngology and within that tracheostomy, and emergency admissions, and specially, epistaxis management. A randomly selected sample of 235 patients from the audit were subjected to a second audit by a second clinician?auditor multi-disciplinary team. There were 12 further health resource groupings changes (5%) and at least one further coding change occurred in 57 patients (24%). These changes were significantly lower than those observed in the pre-audit sample, but were also significantly greater than zero. Asking surgeons to ?code in theatre? and applying these codes without further quality assurance to activity resulted in an health resource groupings error rate of 45%. The full audit sample was regrouped under health resource groupings 3.5 and was compared with a previous audit of 1250 patients performed between 2007 and 2008. This comparison showed a reduction in the baseline rate of health resource groupings change from 16% during the first audit cycle to 9% in the current audit cycle (P < 0.001). Conclusions Otolaryngology coding is complex and susceptible to subjectivity, variability and error. Coding variability can be improved, but not eliminated through regular education supported by an audit programme.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) changed radically with the advent of Multi Slice CT (MSCT) which enabled necessary technical improvements for the study of blood vessels, particularly arteries. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has some advantages when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MSCT scanners are widely available in places such as emergency rooms and research centers for the diagnosis and research of stroke. Arterial venous malformations, blunt vascular trauma, aneurysms and several other diseases can also be studied with CTA. Since the early 1990's there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications regarding CTA and its widespread use makes it an essential tool in the radiologist's armamentarium.

AB  - Background: The economic, accurate, and rapid screening of foals for failure of transfer of passive immunity (FPT) is essential to ensure timely intervention. Hypothesis: Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of foal sera and pattern recognition may be used to diagnose FPT and quantify serum IgG. Samples: Sera from 194 foals (24?72 hours) with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations determined previously by radial immunodiffusion assay (RID) were used. Methods: IR spectra were recorded for the serum samples, and the data were randomly divided into training and independent test sets, each containing both FPT-positive (IgG <400 mg/dL) and non-FPT samples. A genetic optimal region selection algorithm and linear discriminant analysis were used to partition the training spectra, and the resulting classifier was then validated by comparing the IR-predicted FPT status for each of the test samples to that provided by the RID IgG assay. A quantitative IR-based assay for IgG was developed using partial least squares (PLS) and validated by testing its ability to predict IgG concentrations. Results: Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy for the combined data were 92.5, 96.8, and 95.9%, respectively. Corresponding positive (88.1%) and negative predictive (98.0%) values determined a success rate of 95?97% as compared to RID-based IgG concentrations. The IR-based quantitative assay yielded correlation coefficients for IR spectroscopy versus RID-based IgG concentrations of 0.90 and 0.86 for the training and test sets, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The overall performance of the IR-based test was similar to that of the colorimetric assay and was superior and more economic than other available tests.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: Children who exhibit the confusing symptom patterns associated with sensory processing deficits are often seen first by primary care providers, including family and pediatric nurse practitioners (NPs). The purpose of this article is to alert NPs to the state of the science for these disorders and to the roles NPs could play in filling the knowledge gaps in assessment, treatment, education, and research. Data sources: Literature searches using PubMed and MedLine databases and clinical practice observations. Conclusions: Sensory integration disorders have only begun to be defined during the past 35 years. They are not currently included in the DSM IV standard terminology, and are not yet substantively incorporated into most health disciplines? curricula or practice, including those of the NP. Implications for practice: NPs are in a unique position to test hypothesized terminology for Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) by contributing precise clinical descriptions of children who match as well as deviate from the criteria for three proposed diagnostic groups: Sensory Modulation Disorder (SMD), Sensory Discrimination Disorder (SDD), and Sensory-Based Motor Disorder (SBMD). Beyond the SPD diagnostic debate, for children with sensory deficit patterns the NP role can incorporate participating in interdisciplinary treatment plans, refining differential diagnoses, providing frontline referral and support for affected children and their families, and making both secondary prevention and critical causal research possible through validation of consistently accepted diagnostic criteria.

AB  - Summary Background Variation in equine caudal cervical spine morphology at C6 and C7 has high prevalence in Warmblood horses and is suspected to be associated with pain in a large mixed-breed group of horses. At present no data exist on the relationship between radiographic phenotype and clinical presentation in Warmblood horses in a case-control study. Objectives To establish the frequency of radiographically visible morphologic variation in a large group of Warmblood horses with clinical signs and compare this with a group without clinical signs. We hypothesised that occurrence of morphologic variation in the case group would not differ from the control group, indicating there is no association between clinical signs and morphologic variation. Study design Retrospective case-control. Methods Radiographic presence or absence of morphologic variation of cervical vertebrae C6 and C7 was recorded in case (n = 245) and control horses (n = 132). Case and control groups were compared by univariable Pearson?s Chi-square and multivariable logistic regression for measurement variables age, sex, breed, degenerative joint disease and morphologic variation at C6 and C7. Odds ratio and confidence intervals were obtained. A P≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Morphologic variation at C6 and C7 (n = 108/377 = 28.6%; Cases 58/245 = 23.7%; Control 50/132 = 38%) was less frequent in horses with clinical signs in univariable testing (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.3?0.8, P = 0.001). Age, sex, breed and degenerative joint disease were not retained in the final multivariable logistic regression step whereas morphologic variation remained significantly less present in horses with clinical signs. Main limitations Possible demographic differences between equine clinics. Conclusions Morphologic variation in the caudal cervical spine was detected more frequently in horses without clinical signs. Therefore, radiographic presence of such variation does not necessarily implicate the presence of clinical signs.

AB  - Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an invaluable diagnostic tool, particularly in patients with inadequate transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. In addition, continuous TEE has been used to monitor ventricular and valvular performance in the intensive care unit and the operating room. However, current generation transesophageal probes have limitations in the critical care setting due to their size. Recently, a prototype miniaturized transesophageal probe was developed to overcome these limitations. This probe was used by five medical centers for 194 examinations. A large proportion of these patients were in the intensive care unit (43%), as well as mechanically ventilated (39%). Seventy percent (70%) of the subjects in this study were intubated nasally with the prototype probe, with a success rate of 88.5%. Oral intubation was successful in every case. Subject tolerance was good, and 25% of the patients were intubated for > 1 h. Nasal intubation with the probe was more likely in intensive care patients, ventilated subjects, and patients who were intubated for > 1 hour. TEE with this miniaturized probe is feasible and safe even in multi-instrumented critical care patients. This probe provides adequate diagnostic imaging capabilities and may allow imaging over prolonged periods of time, making it suitable for the serial monitoring of ventricular performance.

AB  - We have reviewed fine needle aspirates from 11 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumours and evaluated the diagnostic criteria as well as those proposed in the literature in an attempt to formulate reliable criteria for the cytological diagnosis of these tumours. As expected, no single criterion was reliable for diagnosis: however, cells with rounded or polygonal rather than a columnar shape, cytoplasmic granularity, and eccentricity of round or oval nuclei with a finely stippled, evenly distributed chromatin pattern were features which taken together, usually enabled one to make a reliable diagnosis. A striking feature of the smears was the cellular monotony and absence of pleomorphism of the tumour cells. Immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy identified tumour products and confirmed the diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Forty-six patients with pyogenic liver abscess have been treated at Paul Brousse Hospital between 1966 and 1986. The overall mortality was 24 per cent, all 11 deaths occurring in 24 patients seen prior to 1978 when there was often a considerable delay in the diagnosis of liver abscess (mean 90 ± 71 days). In seven patients the diagnosis was not made until post-mortem examination. The mainstay of treatment was surgical drainage. Since 1978 high resolution imaging techniques for the liver, and in particular ultrasound, have been available. The diagnostic delay has been significantly reduced (mean 28±20 days, P<0.01). Patients are receiving definitive treatment at an earlier stage in the evolution of the disease process, with fewer established complications prior to treatment (P < 0.05). Percutaneous drainage under ultrasound control is the preferred initial drainage procedure in high-risk patients. There have been no deaths in 22 patients treated for pyogenic liver abscess since 1978 (P<0.001).

AB  - Objectives To describe the clinical presentation, MRI findings and outcome in dogs with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin. Materials and Methods Dogs were included in this retrospective study if they had complete medical records, complete neurological examination, MR imaging, cerebellomedullary cerebrospinal fluid sample consistent with eosinophilic pleocytosis and negative infectious disease testing. Results Eleven dogs were included with a median age of 22·0?months (range 7·6 to 92·0?months). Nine breeds were represented. Neurological abnormalities included obtundation (n=10), menace response deficits (n=9), proprioceptive deficits (n=7), ataxia (n=7) and seizures (n=2). Neuroanatomical localisation was multi-focal (n=4), central vestibular system (n=4), diffuse forebrain (n=2) or left trigeminal/facial nerves (n=1). Seven dogs had peripheral eosinophilia. Ten dogs had bilateral symmetrical lesions affecting the cortical grey matter, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuating inversion recovery images and iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images with associated meningeal contrast enhancement. MRI findings were consistent with diffuse meningitis and atrophy or necrosis of cortical grey matter. One dog had increased contrast uptake in the left trigeminal nerve. Ten dogs receiving corticosteroids survived to discharge, with seven also receiving cytarabine arabinoside. Median survival time was 762?days. Clinical Significance Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affects younger larger-breed dogs, with the majority having suspected diffuse cerebrocortical meningitis and cortical (polio)encephalitis, which can be identified on MRI. Response to immunosuppressive treatment is good in the medium to long term, although further studies are required in this area.

It is rare to find a Duret haemorrhage on imaging. This case has been presented to highlight the rarity of the condition and the unusual posterior location of the bleed and also the universally fatal nature of these haemorrhages.

AB  - Purpose The aims of this work were to (a) develop an approach for ex vivo MR volumetry of human brain hemispheres that does not contaminate the results of histopathological examination, (b) longitudinally assess regional brain volumes postmortem, and (c) investigate the relationship between MR volumetric measurements performed in vivo and ex vivo. Methods An approach for ex vivo MR volumetry of human brain hemispheres was developed. Five hemispheres from elderly subjects were imaged ex vivo longitudinally. All datasets were segmented. The longitudinal behavior of volumes measured ex vivo was assessed. The relationship between in vivo and ex vivo volumetric measurements was investigated in seven elderly subjects imaged both antemortem and postmortem. Results This approach for ex vivo MR volumetry did not contaminate the results of histopathological examination. For a period of 6 months postmortem, within-subject volume variation across time points was substantially smaller than intersubject volume variation. A close linear correspondence was detected between in vivo and ex vivo volumetric measurements. Conclusion Regional brain volumes measured with this approach for ex vivo MR volumetry remain relatively unchanged for a period of 6 months postmortem. Furthermore, the linear relationship between in vivo and ex vivo MR volumetric measurements suggests that this approach captures information linked to antemortem macrostructural brain characteristics.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Abstract Objective To document the outcome of dogs with appendicular primary bone tumors treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) and concurrent stabilization. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Eighteen dogs with presumptive or definitive diagnosis of appendicular osteosarcoma. Methods Medical records of dogs with appendicular primary bone tumors treated with SRT and stabilization were reviewed for signalment, preoperative staging and diagnostics, radiation dose, stabilization method, and outcome. Results The distal radius was affected in 13/18 cases. Osteosarcoma or sarcoma was confirmed cytologically or histologically in 15/18 cases. Seven dogs were diagnosed with a pathological fracture at the time of treatment, and 11 were considered at high risk for pathological fracture. Dogs received a single dose (n?=?5) or 3 doses (n?=?13) of SRT. Surgical stabilization was performed under the same anesthetic event as the final dose of SRT in 10 dogs. Stabilization was achieved with a bone plate (n?=?15) or interlocking nail (n?=?3). Seventeen dogs received adjuvant chemotherapy. Complications occurred in 16/17 dogs, 15/17 of those being considered major complications. Four dogs experienced more than one complication. Infection was the most common complication, diagnosed in 15/17 cases, and considered as a major complication in 13/15 cases. Postoperative fracture was recorded as a major complication in 3 cases. Nine dogs were amputated at a median of 152 days. The median survival time was 344 days. Conclusion Treatment of bone tumors with SRT and concurrent stabilization was associated with a prohibitively high complication rate in dogs. Alternative methods for limb salvage should be considered for dogs at risk for pathologic fracture.
