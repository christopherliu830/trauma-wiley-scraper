AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Abstract We present a case of 80-year-old man who had headache of 1?day duration and gross subdural haemorrhage in the absence of any history of noticeable trauma, leading to descending transtentorial herniation and secondary brain stem haemorrhages called Duret haemorrhages. It is rare to find a Duret haemorrhage on imaging. This case has been presented to highlight the rarity of the condition and the unusual posterior location of the bleed and also the universally fatal nature of these haemorrhages. Relevant literature is reviewed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To document the outcome of dogs with appendicular primary bone tumors treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) and concurrent stabilization. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Eighteen dogs with presumptive or definitive diagnosis of appendicular osteosarcoma. Methods Medical records of dogs with appendicular primary bone tumors treated with SRT and stabilization were reviewed for signalment, preoperative staging and diagnostics, radiation dose, stabilization method, and outcome. Results The distal radius was affected in 13/18 cases. Osteosarcoma or sarcoma was confirmed cytologically or histologically in 15/18 cases. Seven dogs were diagnosed with a pathological fracture at the time of treatment, and 11 were considered at high risk for pathological fracture. Dogs received a single dose (n?=?5) or 3 doses (n?=?13) of SRT. Surgical stabilization was performed under the same anesthetic event as the final dose of SRT in 10 dogs. Stabilization was achieved with a bone plate (n?=?15) or interlocking nail (n?=?3). Seventeen dogs received adjuvant chemotherapy. Complications occurred in 16/17 dogs, 15/17 of those being considered major complications. Four dogs experienced more than one complication. Infection was the most common complication, diagnosed in 15/17 cases, and considered as a major complication in 13/15 cases. Postoperative fracture was recorded as a major complication in 3 cases. Nine dogs were amputated at a median of 152 days. The median survival time was 344 days. Conclusion Treatment of bone tumors with SRT and concurrent stabilization was associated with a prohibitively high complication rate in dogs. Alternative methods for limb salvage should be considered for dogs at risk for pathologic fracture.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Leakage of serum proteins into the brain parenchyma has been repeatedly used as evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in experimental and human studies. However, there is no consensus in the literature concerning this phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have examined this question by comparing frontal lobe sections in seven groups of patients: Multi-infarct dementia (n= 6), AD with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, age-matched controls with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, controls with neurodegenerative diseases other than AD, and young controls (n= 10). An additional series compared prospectively followed patients with a diagnosis of either multi-infarct dementia (n= 5) or AD (n= 4). Albumin was detected in white-matter astrocytes in all cases, without significant variation in intensity. In addition, diverse combinations of neurons, astrocytes, and (in AD patients) senile plaques were present in the cerebral cortex in an inconsistent manner. Semiquantitative analysis showed no statistically significant differences among groups. Anti-IgG labeled astrocytes in infarcts only. Complement C3c component was detected in rare amyloid plaques in a minority (15%) of AD cases. Selective labeling of AD-specific lesions in a patchy manner was observed for serum amyloid P. We conclude that there is no immunohistochemical evidence of alteration of the BBB in Alzheimer's disease with or without vascular factors or in old age. Serum amyloid P binds avidly to AD lesions, but our findings are consistent with leakage through the BBB during the agonal or immediate postmortem period. Finally, no specific pattern of abnormality in the BBB was detected in multi-infarct dementia.

AB  - Abstract Background Psoriasis is a multi-systemic disease involving the skin and joints, but it is also characterized by endothelial dysfunction, which may cause sexual impotence and erectile dysfunction (ED), an embarrassing disease frequently neglected by dermatologists. Objective The principal objective was assessing the relationship between the severity of psoriasis and the severity of ED. We also investigated whether severity of psoriasis was related to International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score, whether genital lesions worsened the IIEF-5 score, whether ED was related to factors such as diabetes, smoking and hypertension, and finally the overall the psychological factors felt by the patient. Methods We administered two questionnaires (one of which was the IIEF-5, a validated score to assess erectile dysfunction) to three groups of patients: 60 with mild psoriasis, 60 with severe psoriasis (assessed by Psoriasis Area Severity Index, PASI) and a control group including 60 patients without the disease. Results In the group of mild psoriasis, the patients who suffered from ED were the 56.67%, while in the group of severe psoriasis, ED affected the 46.68% of subjects. In the control group, ED was reported by the 23.33% of patients. The average IIEF-5 score was 18.81 for patients with mild psoriasis and 20.31 for patients with severe form. The difference in the average IIEF-5 scores between psoriatic (mild and severe cases) and control group was not statistically significant. Most patients with sexual dysfunction had also genital lesions; diabetes, smoking and hypertension were not related to lower IIEF-5 scores. The overall psychological profile of psoriatic patients was worse than that of the controls. Conclusion We concluded that ED was related to psoriasis, in particular to mild forms. Moreover, since ED is a marker of cardiovascular events, also related to negative impact on the quality of life, physicians should always investigate the presence of ED in clinical practice.

AB  - Background The aim of this study is to identify predisposing factors, the clinical course and visual outcomes in patients with keratitis after intracorneal ring implantation. Methods In a retrospective study, 11 patients with documented keratitis after intracorneal ring implantation and 71 matched controls with uncomplicated surgery were enrolled. Patients were examined for slitlamp findings and corrected distance visual acuity at time of the initial presentation, one month later and six months later. Smears and cultures were provided in all cases. Relevant data in controls were extracted from their medical records, and statistical analysis was done. Results Keratitis onset time ranged from three to 56 days. The incidence was 2.7 per cent over two years. All pathogens were Gram-positive cocci, and the most frequent was Staphylococcus spp. No relationship was found between keratitis occurrence and the ring type or the femtosecond procedure, but the rate of keratitis was higher in patients with the horizontal position of intracorneal ring segments (p = 0.001; Fisher's exact test). All cases were treated with implant explantation and tunnel irrigation with antibiotics. In three cases, amniotic membrane transplantation was performed, and two cases finally underwent penetrating keratoplasty. The final six month corrected distance visual acuity was 0.68 Â± 0.35. Poor corrected distance visual acuity improvement was associated with the ulcer size at the first day of the diagnosis (p = 0.011; Spearman's rho). Conclusion The only predisposing factor was the horizontal position of the ring. A careful evaluation in the early post-operative period for any sign of the infiltration would be helpful. Early diagnosis with proper management including fortified antibiotic therapy specifically against Gram-positive cocci and removal of the intracorneal ring seems to result in acceptable visual outcomes in later follow-up. However, a corneal transplant may be the only choice in advanced infectious complications.

AB  - Summary Introduction Multidimensional optical scatter of sphered erythrocytes can identify and enumerate hyperchromic erythrocytes, which might be used for hereditary spherocytosis (HS) screening. The flow cytometric eosin-5?-maleimide test (EMA) is highly sensitive and specific for HS as a confirmatory method. The aims of this study were to assess the utility of hyperchromic erythrocytes in HS screening and to evaluate the EMA test performed on CELL-DYN Sapphire analyser compared with the reference method. Methods Blood from 740 paediatric patients presenting at our institution was analysed in reticulocyte mode of the CELL-DYN Sapphire haematology analyser (Abbott Diagnostics) to obtain hyperchromic erythrocyte counts. The EMA test was performed using a flow cytometer as a reference, as well as CELL-DYN Sapphire as an investigational method. Results Hyperchromic erythrocytes were the highest in patients with HS (median 11.5%; range 5.1?29.2%). Patients with autoimmune haemolytic disease had significantly less hyperchromic erythrocytes (median 4.9%; range 0.0?18.3%). Hyperchromic erythrocytes showed a high area under the ROC curve: 0.972. At 4.9% cut-off, hyperchromic erythrocytes detected HS with 96.4% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. The EMA test on CELL-DYN Sapphire correlated strongly with the reference test and had identical diagnostic power. Stability studies with blood from HS patients showed a significant decrease in hyperchromic erythrocytes after 6Â h storage. Conclusions Measurement of hyperchromic erythrocytes is highly sensitive and specific for detecting HS and can be used for rapid and inexpensive screening. If required, the EMA test can be performed on CELL-DYN Sapphire or a standard flow cytometer for confirmation of HS.

AB  - Objectives To report the clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Cases were solicited from the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Oncology Diplomate listserv. Medical records of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma diagnosed via a combination of histology and immunohistochemistry with or without analysis of polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic test results, chemotherapy protocol, response to treatment, date of first progression, rescue therapies and date and cause of death or last follow-up visit were collected. Results Twenty cases were included. Males and small breed dogs were over-represented. Frequent clinical signs included weight loss, vomiting and diarrhoea. Most lymphomas were T-cell phenotype (95%), and epitheliotropism was commonly described (60%). Immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement or both were frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Two dogs had resection of an intestinal mass, and all dogs were treated with chemotherapy; chlorambucil and prednisone were most commonly prescribed. Overall response rate was 70%, and median survival time was 424?days (95% confidence interval: 105 to 1206?days). Clinical Significance Low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma appears to be a rare condition in dogs, and treatment with chemotherapy results in a high response rate and favourable survival times. Further study is needed to determine its prevalence in dogs with chronic enteropathies.

AB  - Summary Abdominal pain is common in school-aged children and is rarely organic, but there is a diverse and extensive differential diagnosis. The Rome III criteria set out diagnostic features of the functional bowel disorders. Most cases require screening investigations, and ?reg flags? identify those more likely to have underlying pathology. Management is often multi-disciplinary, especially important when chronic pain is debilitating and responds poorly to drug or dietary intervention.

AB  - Summary Sketches provides, in more technical language, outlines of the various imaging modalities, and illustrates their roles in medical care with many clinical examples. After examining film-radiography and conventional fluoroscopy, in which images arise from differential attenuation of an X-ray beam by various tissues, it moves on to their twenty-first century computer-based descendants: computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), culminating in three-dimensional mapping of tissues with spiral, multi-slice CT. It then addresses nuclear medicine (NM), including single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), where contrast comes from the differential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by tissues. With diagnostic ultrasound (US), echoes are created at tissue interfaces where differences in tissue elasticity and density occur. The chapter concludes with an appendix on the selection of optimal imaging modalities for representative clinical problems.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate relationships between heart rate and clinical variables in healthy dogs and dogs examined at a referral hospital. Methods Clinical data were extracted from the electronic patient records of a first opinion group (5000 healthy dogs) and a referral hospital (5849 dogs). Univariable and multi-variable general linear models were used to assess associations between heart rate and clinical characteristics. Separate multi-variable models were constructed for first opinion and referral populations. Results In healthy dogs, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0Â·001) but was higher in Chihuahuas. The mean difference in heart rate between a 5 and 55?kg dog was 10Â·5 beats per minute. In dogs presenting to a referral hospital, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0Â·001) and the following breeds; border collie, golden retriever, Labrador retriever, springer spaniel and West Highland white terrier and positively associated with age, admitting service (emergency and critical care, emergency first opinion and cardiology) and the following breeds; Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier and Yorkshire terrier. Clinical Significance Bodyweight, age, breed and disease status all influence heart rate in dogs, although these factors account for a relatively small proportion of the overall variability in heart rate.

AB  - Objective To determine contamination rates of scrub suits worn by veterinary surgeons and nurses following a single shift. Materials and Methods Cross-sectional preliminary study at a UK small animal referral centre. Sterilised scrub suits were distributed to veterinary surgeons (nÂ =Â 9) and nurses (nÂ =Â 9) at the beginning of their clinical shift and worn for at least 8?hours. They were then analysed for bacterial contamination before and after home laundry at 30Â°C. A questionnaire was distributed to hospital clinical staff regarding workwear habits. Results Median bacterial counts were 47 (interquartile range: 14 to 162) and 7 (interquartile range: 0 to 27) colony forming units per cm2 before and after laundering scrub suits. Bacteria identified included Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli , Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Micrococcus sp., ?-haemolytic Streptococci and a Group G Streptococcus. From 101 staff surveyed, 64.0% reported wearing fresh, clean scrub tops and 58.4% fresh, clean trousers each day, while 64.4% left the workplace wearing the same clothing in which they undertook clinical work. Clinical Significance Workwear contamination risks spread of pathogens into the community and personnel compliance with workplace guidelines warrants further attention. Home laundry at 30Â°C significantly decreases, but does not eliminate, the bacterial burden after a single shift.

AB  - Summary Objective: To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of amikacin in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and to analyse whether these patients show different kinetic behaviour on the basis of their clinical diagnoses. Method: The patient population comprised 104 medical ICU patients on amikacin treatment for several presumed or documented Gram-negative infections. Four study groups were defined according to patients' clinical diagnosis: sepsis group (n= 39), trauma group (n= 20), pneumonia group (n= 21) and ?other diagnosis? group (n= 24). The pharmacokinetic parameters for amikacin in these patients were then compared. Results: The ICU patients were found to have increased values for the amikacin volume of distribution (0.52 Â± 0.21 litres/kg), whereas total amikacin clearance expressed as a linear function of creatinine clearance was Cl (ml/min/kg)= 0.13 Â± 0.86 ClCR which is not significantly different from other estimations reported in the literature. However, this relationship revealed statistically significant differences among the four groups of ICU patients. Moreover, the septic and trauma patients showed higher (but not statistically significant) values for the amikacin volume of distribution. Conclusion: The amikacin pharmacokinetic parameters obtained should allow Bayesian individualization of amikacin doses in patients admitted to medical ICUs, on the basis of their clinical diagnoses.

AB  - Jafarzadeh H, Abbott PV. Review of pulp sensibility tests. Part ?: general information and thermal tests. International Endodontic Journal, 43, 738?762, 2010. Abstract A major, and essential, part of the diagnostic process for pulp disease is the use of pulp sensibility tests. When diagnosing pulp pain, these tests can be used to reproduce the symptoms reported by the patient to diagnose the diseased tooth as well as the disease state. However, a major shortcoming with these tests is that they only indirectly provide an indication of the state of the pulp by measuring a neural response rather than the vascular supply, so both false positive and false negative results can occur. The relevant literature on pulp sensibility tests in the context of endodontics up to January 2009 was reviewed using PubMed and MEDLINE database searches. This search identified papers published between November 1964 and January 2009 in all languages. Thermal tests have been used as an integral part of dental examinations. Two types of thermal tests are available, one uses a cold stimulus and the other uses a hot stimulus, and each has various methods of delivery. If these tests are used properly, injury to the pulp is highly unlikely. A review of the literature regarding the rationale, indications, limitations, and interpretation of thermal tests, the value of these diagnostic tests, as well as a discussion of the important points about each of these tests is presented.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Presentation of a case of esophageal perforation caused by ingestion of a foreign body that was difficult to visualize endoscopically, and systematic review of the current literature with a focus on available diagnostic modalities and missed diagnoses. Data Sources MEDLINE (1946?2014) Review Methods We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE for cases and studies of esophageal perforation due to foreign bodies. Results A systematic review of esophageal perforations caused by foreign bodies revealed 40 studies that included 168 patients. Neck/chest pain, odynophagia, and dysphagia were the most common presenting symptoms?each occurring in the majority of patients. Where reported, diagnostic sensitivity of lateral neck X-rays was 56%, and computed tomography (CT) scan was 100%. Nine of 168 cases specifically mentioned a missed diagnosis. Very few studies reported a failure to visualize the foreign object at the time of primary rigid or flexible esophagoscopy. No studies reported nonvisualization of the foreign body at the time of open surgery. Conclusion Esophageal perforations due to foreign bodies are rare but carry potentially devastating complications. Delays in diagnosis are common, and no standard diagnostic algorithm exists. Lateral neck X-rays are an easy but insensitive screening test. Laryngoscopy is an excellent screening test but not always diagnostic. CT is a more sensitive diagnostic method, which can also help guide management based on the detection of complications. Although seldom described, if an object is not visualized at the time of endoscopic or surgical intervention, follow-up CT may be useful in determining the persistence of effects of the perforation or the foreign body.
