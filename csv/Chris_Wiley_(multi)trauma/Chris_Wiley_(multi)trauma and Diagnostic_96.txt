AB  - Summary Myxedema coma is a decompensated state of hypothyroidism resulting from severe and prolonged depletion of thyroid hormones, leading to altered mental status and other clinical features related to widespread multi-organ dysfunction. While this is a rare condition on the spectrum of thyroid disorders, myxedema coma is considered an endocrine emergency due to the danger of increased mortality with recent rates of 20?25% reported. Therefore, it is important to promptly recognize and treat myxedema coma in an attempt to improve outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated the specificity of autobiographical memories among depressed and non-depressed borderline patients, compared with depressed patients and controls. The influence of childhood trauma, intrusions of traumatic events, avoidance of intrusions, dissociation and depression on memory specificity was also studied. Method: The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), a trauma interview and self-report measures of intrusions, avoidance, depression and dissociation were administered to 83 borderline outpatients, 26 depressed outpatients and 30 controls. Results: Depressed borderline patients and depressed patients reported fewer specific memories than controls. Depressed patients generated fewer specific memories than non-depressed borderline patients. Neither trauma nor traumatic intrusions, avoidance of intrusions or dissociation were related to the specificity of memories. Level of depressive symptoms (BDI) was also not related, but the presence of a depression was. Conclusion: In this large sample of outpatients with borderline personality disorder, only the subgroup with a co-morbid diagnosis of depression had trouble remembering specific events from the past. Trauma, intrusions, avoidance of intrusions and dissociation seem to be unrelated to the specificity of autobiographical memories in borderline personality disorder.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the pathophysiology, history and signalment, physical examination, diagnostic findings, treatment and prognosis of vascular disorders in canine and feline patients. Systemic diseases that result in stasis of blood flow, hypercoagulability, and disruption of the endothelial layer in the vasculature can result in the secondary complication of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). PTE affects any age or breed of animal, because it is secondary to underlying disease processes which affect animals of different signalments. Development of PTE is associated with a guarded prognosis, and mortality is high. Because of poor success in the treatment of PTE, prophylactic anticoagulant therapy should be considered in animals with diseases that have been shown to predispose to the condition. Dogs with severe infections develop hemoptysis and signs of right-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or pulmonary embolization, including respiratory distress, abdominal distention, and syncope.

AB  - Abstract Scaffolds play a key role in the field of tissue engineering. Particularly for meniscus replacement, optimal scaffold properties are critical. The aim of our study was to develop a novel scaffold for replacement of meniscal tissue by means of tissue engineering. Emphasis was put on biomechanical properties comparable to native meniscus, nonimmunogenecity, and the possibility of seeding cells into and cultivating them within the scaffold (nontoxicity). For this purpose, native ovine menisci were treated in vitro in a self-developed enzymatic process. Complete cell removal was achieved and shown both histologically and electron microscopically (n?=?15). Immunohistochemical reaction (MHC 1/MHC 2) was positive for native ovine meniscus and negative for the scaffold. Compared to native meniscus (25.8 N/mm) stiffness of the scaffold was significantly increased (30.2 N/mm, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). We determined the compression (%) of the native meniscus and the scaffold under a load of 7 N. The compression was 23% for native meniscus and 29% for the scaffold (p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Residual force of the scaffold was significantly lower (5.2 N vs. 4.9 N, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Autologous fibrochondrocytes were needle injected and successfully cultivated within the scaffolds over a period of 4 weeks (n?=?10). To our knowledge, this study is the first to remove cells and immunogenetic proteins (MHC 1/MHC 2) completely out of native meniscus and preserve important biomechanical properties. Also, injected cells could be successfully cultivated within the scaffold. Further in vitro and in vivo animal studies are necessary to establish optimal cell sources, sterilization, and seeding techniques. Cell differentiation, matrix production, in vivo remodeling of the construct, and possible immunological reactions after implantation are subject of further studies. ? 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background The magnitude of the systemic response is proportional to the degree of surgical trauma. Much has been reported in the literature comparing metabolic and immune responses, analgesia use, or length of hospital stay between laparoscopic and open procedures. In particular, metabolic and immune responses are represented by measuring various chemical mediators as stress responses. Laparoscopic procedures are associated with reduced operative trauma compared with open procedures, resulting in lower systemic response. As a result, laparoscopic procedures are now well accepted for both benign and malignant processes. Laparoscopic liver resection, specifically, is employed for symptomatic and some malignant tumors, following improvements in diagnostic accuracy, laparoscopic devices, and techniques. However, laparoscopic liver resection is still controversial in malignant disease because of complex anatomy, the technical difficulty of the procedure, and questionable indications. There are few reports describing the stress responses associated with laparoscopic liver resection, even though many studies reviewing stress responses have been performed recently in both humans and animal models comparing laparoscopic to conventional open surgery. Although this review examines stress response after laparoscopic liver resection in both an animal and human clinical model, further controlled randomized studies with additional investigations of immunologic parameters are needed to demonstrate the consequences of either minimally invasive surgery or open procedures on perioperative or postoperative stress responses for laparoscopic liver resection.

AB  - Summary Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) is a disease of foals caused by the obligate intracellular organism Lawsonia intracellularis. This emerging disease affects mainly weanling foals and causes fever, lethargy, peripheral oedema, diarrhoea, colic and weight loss. The diagnosis of EPE may be challenging and relies on the presence of hypoproteinaemia, thickening of segments of the small intestinal wall observed upon abdominal ultrasonography, positive serology and molecular detection of L.?intracellularis in faeces. Although the clinical entity, diagnostic approach and treatment of EPE are well established and described, the epidemiology for this disease has remained largely unaddressed. This article focuses on new developments in the field of EPE, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

Based on ophthalmic examination and ultrasonography, a diagnosis of intraocular neoplasia was made. Enucleation of the affected eye was performed. The mass was histologically diagnosed as a primary malignant intraocular signet-ring cell melanoma. No signs of recurrence were detected, and the hamster remained clinically healthy until it died 6?months after surgery. This case report attempts to contribute to the limited body of knowledge available in the literature on primary intraocular neoplasms in hamsters.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012 and 2013, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) undertook fact-finding visits to several Asian countries, with a view to developing advice for small companion animal practitioners in Asia related to the administration of vaccines to dogs and cats. The VGG met with numerous first opinion practitioners, small animal association leaders, academic veterinarians, government regulators and industry representatives and gathered further information from a survey of almost 700 veterinarians in India, China, Japan and Thailand. Although there were substantial differences in the nature and magnitude of the challenges faced by veterinarians in each country, and also differences in the resources available to meet those challenges, overall, the VGG identified insufficient undergraduate and postgraduate training in small companion animal microbiology, immunology and vaccinology. In most of the countries, there has been little academic research into small animal infectious diseases. This, coupled with insufficient laboratory diagnostic support, has limited the growth of knowledge concerning the prevalence and circulating strains of key infectious agents in most of the countries visited. Asian practitioners continue to recognise clinical infections that are now considered uncommon or rare in western countries. In particular, canine rabies virus infection poses a continuing threat to animal and human health in this region. Both nationally manufactured and international dog and cat vaccines are variably available in the Asian countries, but the product ranges are small and dominated by multi-component vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of only 1 year, or no description of DOI. Asian practitioners are largely unaware of current global trends in small animal vaccinology or of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. Consequently, most practitioners continue to deliver annual revaccination with both core and non-core vaccines to adult animals, with little understanding that ?herd immunity? is more important than frequent revaccination of individual animals within the population. In this paper, the VGG presents the findings of this project and makes key recommendations for the Asian countries. The VGG recommends that (1) Asian veterinary schools review and increase as needed the amount of instruction in small animal vaccinology within their undergraduate curriculum and increase the availability of pertinent postgraduate education for practitioners; (2) national small animal veterinary associations, industry veterinarians and academic experts work together to improve the scientific evidence base concerning small animal infectious diseases and vaccination in their countries; (3) national small animal veterinary associations take leadership in providing advice to practitioners based on improved local knowledge and global vaccination guidelines; (4) licensing authorities use this enhanced evidence base to inform and support the registration of improved vaccine product ranges for use in their countries, ideally with DOI for core vaccines similar or equal to those of equivalent products available in western countries (i.e. 3 or 4 years). The VGG also endorses the efforts made by Asian governments, non-governmental organisations and veterinary practitioners in working towards the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection. In this paper, the VGG offers both a current pragmatic and future aspirational approach to small animal vaccination in Asia. As part of this project, the VGG delivered continuing education to over 800 Asian practitioners at seven events in four countries. Accompanying this document is a list of 80 frequently asked questions (with answers) that arose during these discussions. The VGG believes that this information will be of particular value to Asian veterinarians as they move towards implementing global trends in small companion animal vaccinology.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper argues for the use of benzodiazepines as a harm reduction strategy when combined with long-term psychotherapy for high-risk adults with personality disorders resulting from chronic exposure to trauma and current unstable living conditions. This prescribing practice is outlined based on a review of 185 cases in therapy at a community mental health clinic. The careful use of benzodiazepines can increase engagement in therapy in a population often resistant to outpatient treatment. The approach is clearly a harm reduction effort to prevent clients from cycling through the emergency room and county correctional facilities. The risks of benzodiazepine misuse are reviewed and procedures for monitoring risk are detailed. There is a prejudice identified in the use of benzodiazepines that is based on society's condemnation of euphoric experiences rather than on a medical basis alone. Benzodiazepines are suggested as a harm reduction strategy as well as an alternative in the control of serious mental health symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and panic.

AB  - Emesis is a common presenting sign in small animal practice. It requires a rational approach to management that is based upon a sound understanding of pathophysiology combined with logical decision making. This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.

AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate nursing home residents with psychiatric diagnoses who wander and who are not diagnosed with dementia. Method A national cross-sectional study was conducted in a male Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit population using a retrospective review of the MDS. Results Eleven thousand six hundred and nineteen residents were identified as having a psychiatric diagnosis without significant cognitive impairment; just under 1% (n?=?113) wandered. Using rare events logit regression, we determined that a diagnosis of schizophrenia/bipolar disorder or comorbid psychiatric conditions were associated with increased risk of wandering compared to residents diagnosed with anxiety/depression. Psychiatric wanderers were also more likely to, have symptoms of delirium, exhibit socially inappropriate behavior, manifest problems in decision-making, take anti-psychotic medications, and to be more independent in locomotion. Conclusions Psychiatric wanderers may be conceptualized better as exhibiting ambulatory concomitants of unremitted neurological/psychiatric symptoms or medication side effects of their treatment. Findings have implications for addressing treatable causes of wandering. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Innovations are necessary to accommodate the increasing demands on emergency departments whilst maintaining a high level of patient care and safety. Radiographer Preliminary Image Evaluation (PIE) is one such innovation. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of radiographer PIE in clinical practice within an emergency department over 12 months. Methods A total of 6290 radiographic examinations were reviewed from 15 January 2016 to 15 January 2017. The range of adult and paediatric examinations incorporated in the review included the appendicular and axial skeleton including the chest and abdomen. Each examination was compared to the radiologist's report this allowed calculated mean sensitivity and specificity values to indicate if the radiographer's PIE was of a true negative/positive or false negative/positive value. Cases of no PIE participation or series? marked as unsure for pathology by the radiographer were also recorded. This allowed mean sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy to be calculated. Results The study reported a mean ± 95% confidence level (standard deviation) for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, no participation and unsure of 71.1% ± 2.4% (6.1), 98.4% ± 0.04% (0.9), 92.0% ± 0.68% (1.9), 5.1% (1.6) and 3.6% (0.14) respectively. Conclusions This study has demonstrated that the participating radiographers provided a consistent PIE service while maintaining a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy. This form of image interpretation can complement an emergency referrer's diagnosis when a radiologist's report is unavailable at the time of patient treatment. PIE promotes a reliable enhancement of the radiographer's role with the multi-disciplinary team.

AB  - Abstract The human dimensions of medical care were highlighted by such pioneering figures as Cicely Saunders, Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, and Jimmie Holland and their tireless advocacy helped to build an evidence base for psychosocial and palliative interventions. In that spirit, we studied physical and psychological distress in advanced cancer and modeled pathways to distress in this population. We considered acute stress disorder as the prototype for psychological disturbances following the acute onset of life-threatening disorders, showing that it occurred in one-third of patients after the diagnosis of acute leukemia. To treat and prevent these symptoms, we developed Emotion and Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE), an integrated psychotherapeutic and early palliative intervention. We showed that EASE reduced both traumatic stress and physical suffering in these patients and a large multi-center trial is now underway. We also identified symptoms of depression and hopelessness n one quarter of patients with metastatic and advanced cancer, with worsening toward the end of life. To alleviate this distress, we developed a brief supportive-expressive therapy, referred to as Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM). We showed in a large RCT that CALM improves depression, distress related to dying and death, and preparation for the end of life. We have now launched a global initiative involving 20 sites to date across North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia to have CALM implemented routinely in cancer care. Such initiatives are needed to move psychosocial care in cancer from evidence to implementation and to fulfill the dream of Jimmie Holland that cancer care be as humanistic as it is effective.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the literature on quality of life (QoL) in patients with hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (HTAAD); including Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) and other HTAAD diagnoses, critically appraising and synthesizing the relevant literature. A systematic review was performed by searching the published literature using available medical, physical, psychological, social databases and other sources. Studies addressing QoL in persons with an HTAAD diagnosis, published in peer-reviewed journals were assessed. Of 227 search results, 20 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. No studies of QoL in LDS, vEDS, or other HTAAD were found, only on MFS. Most studies had been published in the last 3 years. All were cross-sectional quantitative studies besides one pilot intervention study. Most studies were of small sample size, had low response rate or participants without verified diagnosis. Despite these limitations, most studies indicate that having an HTAAD diagnosis as MFS may negatively impact QoL, but few studies found any associations between the biomedical symptoms and decreased QoL. More research is needed on QoL in samples with verified HTAAD diagnosis to develop evidence-based knowledge and appropriate guidelines for these diagnoses.

AB  - Abstract Background. Proliferative myositis is a rare, benign, reactive intramuscular lesion of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic origin; an identical lesion in a subcutaneous or fascial location is referred to as proliferative fasciitis. The rapid growth rate and unusual histopathologic features have frequently been mistaken for a malignant process and have promoted unnecessary invasive procedures. Here we present only the third oral case of proliferative myositis, arising from the tongue of a 65-year-old man. Methods and Results. Histologically, the resected lesion was composed of numerous fibroblastic or myofibroblastic spindle cells and variable numbers of large ganglion-like cells infiltrating between and around muscle fascicles, resembling a ?checkerboard? configuration. A demographic profile of proliferative myositis of the head and neck is also provided, compiled from 19 patients culled from an English-language literature review and this report. Conclusions. Incisional biopsy or fine-needle aspiration biopsy of proliferative myositis of the head and neck should lead to spontaneous resolution and is, therefore, sufficient to render the diagnosis and to provide conservative treatment. Recurrence is extremely rare. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2007
