AB  - Summary The normal control of water and electrolyte balance is discussed and an attempt is made to relate the volumes of water and electrolyte involved to an animal as large as a 500Kg horse. The imbalance that may be expected in a case of bowel obstruction is assessed related to the pathological processes involved. Diagnosis of the imbalance present and the clinical and laboratory investigations that may be carried out are described and some guidance on the management of a clinical case referred for surgery is given. Résumé Le controle normal de l'équilibre hydrique et des électrolytes est exposé et l'on tente d'estimer les quantités d'eau et d'électrolytes nécessaires pour un animal de 500 kilos. Le déséquilibre qu'on peut attendre lors d'obstruction intestinale dépend a priori des processus pathologiques en cours. Le diagnostic du déséquilibre et les éléments du diagnostic clinique et de laboratoire sont décrits. Quelques indications sur la manière de procéder lors d'intervention sont données. Zusammenfassung Eine Besprechung der normalen Kontrolle des Wasser-und Elektrolytgleichgewichts wird gefolgt vom Versuch, die Volumina von Wasser und Elektrolyten bei einem 500 kg wiegenden Pferd zu bestimmen. Die Gleichgewichtsstörungen, die bei einem Fall von Darmverschluss zu erwarten sind, werden in Abhängigkeit von den pathologischen Veränderungen abgeschätzt. Die Diagnose einer Störung durch klinische Untersuchungen und Laborbefunde wird besprochen und Richtlinien für die Pflege entsprechender Fälle werden angegeben. Sumario Sev trata el control normal del balance hídrico y electrólitico como intento de relacionar el volumen de agua y electrolitos comptendidos en grandes animales como un caballo de 500 kilos. La falta de equilibrio puede sospecharse en casos de obstrucciones intestinales o cambios patológicos. Se da el diagnóstico en los casos de falta de equilibrio presentados en casos clínicos e investigaciones de laboratorio que pueden llevar a guiar l manejo de ciertos casos clínicos referidos para cirugía.

AB  - Abstract Background. Proliferative myositis is a rare, benign, reactive intramuscular lesion of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic origin; an identical lesion in a subcutaneous or fascial location is referred to as proliferative fasciitis. The rapid growth rate and unusual histopathologic features have frequently been mistaken for a malignant process and have promoted unnecessary invasive procedures. Here we present only the third oral case of proliferative myositis, arising from the tongue of a 65-year-old man. Methods and Results. Histologically, the resected lesion was composed of numerous fibroblastic or myofibroblastic spindle cells and variable numbers of large ganglion-like cells infiltrating between and around muscle fascicles, resembling a ?checkerboard? configuration. A demographic profile of proliferative myositis of the head and neck is also provided, compiled from 19 patients culled from an English-language literature review and this report. Conclusions. Incisional biopsy or fine-needle aspiration biopsy of proliferative myositis of the head and neck should lead to spontaneous resolution and is, therefore, sufficient to render the diagnosis and to provide conservative treatment. Recurrence is extremely rare. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2007

AB  - Summary The veterinary practice may develop a practice business plan for next five or ten years, following trends in the cattle production sector and society. This chapter highlights the development phases of Veterinary Advisory Services and provides examples of implementation. Through the diagnostic herd evaluation (DHE), the veterinarian identifies risk factors and risk areas, where the threat of potential future economic losses exists on the farm. Herd Health and Production Management advisory Service (HHPMS) encompass all farm domains relevant to an individual farmer. Quality risk management program (QRM) based on the principles of hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) would be the best option to serve both tactical goal of safeguarding the consumer and the quality of product, as well as the operational management goals of the individual dairy farmer. Sustainability in the dairy sector can be addressed at three levels: the structural level, the technological level and the managerial level.

AB  - Background:? Although research suggests that witnessed violence is linked to adverse mental health outcomes among adolescents, little is known about its prevalence or its significance in predicting psychiatric symptoms beyond the contribution of co-occurring risk factors. The purpose of this study was to identify the national prevalence of witnessed parental and community violence and to examine these life stressors as independent risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive episode (MDE) among adolescents. A secondary aim was to determine which characteristics of witnessed violence were associated with mental health outcomes. Method:? Participants were 3,614 adolescents recruited from a 2005 US national household probability sample who completed structured telephone interviews assessing witnessed violence and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for PTSD and MDE. Results:? National prevalence of witnessed parental violence and witnessed community violence was estimated to be 9% and 38%, respectively. Both forms of witnessed violence predicted PTSD and MDE beyond variance accounted for by age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and other traumatic event history. Perceptions of threat, repeated violence exposure, location of the violence, and relationship to the victim were associated with psychiatric diagnoses. Conclusions:? Findings suggest that witnessed violence represents a significant public health burden with implications for psychological assessment and prevention efforts.

AB  - Abstract Epistaxis or nosebleed refers to bleeding from the nostrils, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx. Occasional cases may present with torrential lethal hemorrhage. Three cases are reported to demonstrate particular features: Case 1: A 51-year-old woman with lethal epistaxis with no obvious bleeding source; Case 2: A 77-year-old man with treated nasopharyngeal carcinoma who died from epistaxis arising from a markedly neovascularized tumor bed; Case 3: A 2-year-old boy with hemophilia B who died from epistaxis with airway obstruction in addition to gastrointestinal bleeding. Epistaxis may be associated with trauma, tumors, vascular malformations, bleeding diatheses, infections, pregnancy, endometriosis, and a variety of different drugs. Careful dissection of the nasal cavity is required to locate the site of hemorrhage and to identify any predisposing conditions. This may be guided by postmortem computerized tomographic angiography (PCTA). Despite careful dissection, however, a source of bleeding may never be identified.

AB  - Abstract Aim Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a rare, fibrosing disorder of skin and subcutaneous tissue. This study was undertaken to describe its clinical and laboratory features and identify prognostic factors associated with outcome. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of all EF patients evaluated at our institution from 1 January1997 to 30 December 2016. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine treatment response rates over time. Potential associations between baseline characteristics and complete response were examined using Cox models adjusted for age and sex. Time-dependent covariates were used to examine treatment effects. Results We identified 89 EF patients, with a female-to-male ratio of 1:1. Clinical features included groove sign in 26 (29%), peau d'orange/dimpling in 22 (25%), inflammatory arthritis in 9 (10%) and muscle weakness in 9 (10%). Aldolase was elevated in 11/36 (31%). Complete response rate was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35-75) at 3 years. Diagnostic delay was inversely associated with treatment response (hazards ratio: 0.84 per 1 month increase; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98). No baseline characteristics correlated with treatment response, but a trend toward positive association of elevated aldolase, hypergammaglobulinemia and presence of hematologic disorders was noted. Methotrexate was the most commonly used immunosuppressant in 79%, hydroxychloroquine in 45%, mycophenolate mofetil in 18% and azathioprine in 8%. No single immunosuppressant agent was associated with a superior response during treatment. Conclusions EF is characterized by relatively high response rates. Consensus diagnostic criteria, standardized management algorithms, and large prospective multi-center cohorts are needed to develop an evidence-directed approach to this challenging condition.

AB  - Abstract The smile is both an action coordinated by the facial muscles and the ultimate smiling pose. Facial analysis has been largely standardized in the fields of dentistry, cosmetic facial surgery, and corrective jaw surgery on the basis of the principle of symmetry, observations on common facial proportions, cephalometric research, and quantitative norms for facial structures and relationships. Achieving ideal smile aesthetics relies on accurate diagnosis. Careful analysis of the static and active relationships of the lips, dentition, and periodontium is required. Dentofacial deformities must be accounted for and the surgery should be designed to best address each issue identified. Case examples are shown depicting various smile types before and after intervention. The majority of cases entailed orthognathic surgery for correction, often comprehensive, multi-jaw surgery, with adjunctive management of the lips and muscles when indicated. The smile should be enhanced in almost every successful orthognathic intervention, but certainly is not always perfect.

AB  - Abstract This cross-sectional study explored age-related differences in the frequency of diagnosis of personality disorder (PD) among 790 veterans admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit across three age groups: 20?39, 40?59, and 60+. Older adults obtained a lower frequency (55.4%) of PD diagnosis than middle-aged adults (69.0%), who in turn obtained a lower frequency of PD diagnosis than young adults (75.9%). Older adults and middle-aged adults were less likely to receive a diagnosis of Borderline PD than young adults. Older adults were also less likely to receive a diagnosis of Mixed PD than young adults, but received significantly more diagnoses of Narcissistic PD than young adults. Patients diagnosed with PD had higher rates of psychiatric hospitalization than those with no diagnosis of PD. Older adults and middle-aged adults with PD had significantly fewer psychiatric hospitalizations than young adults with PD, whereas there were no age-related differences in the frequency of medical hospitalizations. These findings are consistent with research suggesting an overall softening of PD features with age, particularly those characteristic of the ?dramatic-erratic?, Cluster B types.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aims: Clinical pathways to guide the investigation of suspected pulmonary embolism have been increasingly adopted by emergency departments worldwide. This study evaluated the compliance with a clinical pathway that combines risk assessment (Wells score) with d-dimer, ventilation?perfusion scanning or computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The aims of this study were to identify factors that contribute to compliance and to assess patient outcomes and resource utilization. Methods: Repeated retrospective chart reviews of 239 patients who underwent investigation for pulmonary embolism through our emergency department extracted patient demographics, pathway parameters and patient outcomes. A phone interview at 3-month follow up was carried out. Results: Incidence of pulmonary embolism was 8.4% (n= 20). Compliance to the clinical pathway occurred in 120 subjects (50.2%). Non-compliance occurred in 71 subjects (29.7%). Forty-eight subjects (20.1%) underwent risk assessments, but subsequent diagnostic tests did not conform to the stated pathway (partial compliance). Compliance was poor in subjects assessed by non-emergency department doctors (?2= 27.95, P≤ 0.001). Compliance occurred less in pregnant subjects (?2= 7.27, P= 0.007) and those with chronic respiratory disease (?2= 5.31, P= 0.021). Subjects in the compliant group were less likely to undergo CTPA (odds ratio 2.07 (1.16?3.70), P= 0.012). Conclusions: Compliance with this clinical pathway allowed emergency department doctors in an Australian university teaching hospital to complete diagnostic testing for suspected pulmonary embolism appropriately unless non-emergency department doctors became involved. Compliance with this pathway altered the distribution of diagnostic tests performed with less reliance on CTPA, but was not associated with better patient outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To determine age-related changes in MR properties as T2 and T2* relaxation times, fat content, and magnetization transfer in the human calf, and comparison of these effects in different muscle groups. Materials and Methods Studies were performed on 12 ?younger? (mean, 31.2 ± 6.1 years) and 11 ?older? healthy adult individuals (mean, 66.1 ± 7.8 years). The tibialis anterior muscle, the soleus muscle and the gastrocnemius muscle were examined at rest in a 3 Tesla whole-body MR unit. T2 and T2*, muscular fat content and magnetization transfer ratios (MTR) were determined. Results of the two age groups were compared, and differences between the muscle groups were investigated. Results Increase of T2 and muscular fat was detected with age with significant difference between the age groups. The extent of fatty infiltration was much more variable for the ?older? group. For both age groups, the tibialis anterior muscle showed the lowest fat content with 1.2 ± 0.4% in the ?young? group and 2.3 ± 0.7% in the ?older? group. A strong correlation between fat content and T2 was found, while the groups did not significantly differ regarding T2*. Decrease in the MTR could only be shown for the tibialis anterior muscle with age. Conclusion Age-related changes in healthy human calf musculature were found. Further studies might show possible correlations of age-dependent changes with physical efficiency and susceptibility to diseases like type 2 diabetes. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Background General practitioners' (GP) views about orthopaedic clinical assessment services (OCAS) managed by physiotherapists in the NHS have seldom been sought, yet GPs are likely to be key referrers to such a service. Aim This study aims to review GP views about an OCAS and how they believed the service could be improved. Design of the Study Fifteen consenting GPs were interviewed utilizing semi-structured interviews and a standardized topic guide. Method Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed for emergent themes. Interviews were analysed sequentially by date performed until saturation. Themes were discussed, and disagreements evaluated until agreement was found between the two main authors. The third author then analysed randomly selected interview transcripts and found no additional themes. Results The study found GPs refer to specialist services, including this OCAS, because of wait times, locality, patient experience, GP experience and knowledge of available services. No GP identified they knew all possible orthopaedic referral routes. Conclusion GPs saw OCAS as another referral choice for patients suffering orthopaedic pathologies. GPs identified some difficulty in understanding the different services including the various professional roles involved. To assist with their understanding, they described requesting advertising of the different services and the clinicians involved or streamlining of services by provider services. Further detailed research addressing the limitations in this research design is indicated to investigate GP's thoughts and behaviours in relation to referral patterns especially as GPs in the UK took on commissioning for services from April 2013.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate risk factors associated with cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs. Methods: Retrospective case-control study: medical records of a first-opinion veterinary practice were searched for dogs diagnosed with cranial cruciate ligament rupture (1995 to 2007). For each case, six unaffected dogs were randomly selected from all dogs presenting that day for comparison. Multi-variable binary logistic regression was performed to assess the association of variables on likelihood of cruciate rupture. Results: Frequency of cranial cruciate ligament rupture was 1·19% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·02 to 1.36%]. West Highland white terriers (n=17), Yorkshire terriers (n=14) and Rottweilers (n=11) were at significantly increased risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (P≤0·002). Rottweilers were at five times greater risk compared with other pure breeds (OR 5·12, 95% CI 2·281 to 11·494, P<0·001), obesity quadrupled the risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (OR 3·756, 95% CI 1·659 to 8·502, P=0·001) and females were twice as likely to suffer cranial cruciate ligament failure compared to males (OR 2·054, 95% CI 1·467 to 2·877, P<0·001). Dogs less than two years old were statistically less likely to sustain cranial cruciate ligament rupture than dogs older than eight years (OR 0·246, 95% CI 0·127 to 0·477, P<0·001). There was no significant difference in median weights (in kilograms) of neutered dogs, compared to their entire counterparts in either the case group (P=0·994) or in the control group (P=0·630). There was also no significant difference in body condition (-underweight/normal weight/overweight/obese) of neutered versus entire dogs among the cases (P=0·243), or the controls (P=0·211). Clinical Significance: Cranial cruciate ligament rupture is more likely in Rottweilers and in female dogs, older dogs and obese dogs. Following multi-variable analysis, it was established that neutering was not associated with increased risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the outcome of dogs with central nervous system lymphoma. Materials and Methods A multi-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted by reviewing medical records of 18 cases of central nervous system lymphoma from seven institutions. Results Diagnosis of lymphoma was made through cerebrospinal fluid analysis, histopathology, flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid, and cytology of cerebrospinal fluid, lymph node or spleen with correlated imaging. A total of 15 of 18 dogs received specific treatment other than prednisone. Three dogs underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgical decompression, five dogs underwent chemotherapy, two dogs underwent radiation therapy after surgical decompression, three dogs underwent chemotherapy after surgical decompression and two dogs underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Only one dog received prednisone, and two dogs did not receive any treatment. Overall, the median survival time was 171?days (range 1 to 1942?days). Clinical Significance Dogs receiving any type of treatment for central nervous system lymphoma lived longer than cases described in previous historical reports. Further studies are needed to elucidate the importance of specific treatment modalities.

AB  - Summary This study reports the use of parathyroid hormone fragment peptide 1-34 (PTH1-34) cross-linked to a hydrogel in a fibrin base for the treatment of subchondral cyst-like lesions (SCLs). The objectives were to determine the clinical and radiographic outcome of 28 horses with lameness attributable to one or two SCLs treated locally with one of three different concentrations of PTH1-34 and to identify which concentration produces the best results. Twenty-eight horses (34 SCLs) were treated surgically by debriding the content of the SCL and injecting different concentrations (0.1, 0.4, or 1 mg/mL) of PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel into the cavity. Treatment was considered successful if the horse was sound 12 months after treatment. The mean age of the horses was 7.2 years. Treatment was successful in 22 (78.6%) horses and improved the radiographic appearance of 27 (79.4%) SCLs. The outcome was not affected by age of the horse or by the number of SCLs (1 or 2) per horse. PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel administered into the SCL after surgical debridement of the lesion appears to be an effective treatment for horses with one or two SCLs. A PTH1-34 concentration of 0.4 mg/mL may be slightly superior to concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/mL in resolving SCLs.

AB  - ABSTRACT I've argued that a version of Pascal's Wager applies to PVS so forcefully that no one who declines continued life without considering it makes a reasoned and informed decision. Thomas Mappes objects that my argument is much more limited than I realize. Of special interest is his appeal to an emerging diagnostic category, the ?minimally conscious state?, to argue that there is much to lose in gambling on life. I will defend the Wager. Along the way I maintain that the chance of recovery from long-term PVS is much better than represented (as is the prospect of regaining independence if one recovers consciousness), and that the 1994 Multi-Society Task Force definitions of ?permanent? PVS are confused in ways that make crafting advance directives dangerously difficult. Valid advance directives require informed consent, I argue; the Wager needs to be part of the process. A consequence of my argument is that withdrawing medically-delivered nutrition and hydration from PVS patients is much harder to justify.
