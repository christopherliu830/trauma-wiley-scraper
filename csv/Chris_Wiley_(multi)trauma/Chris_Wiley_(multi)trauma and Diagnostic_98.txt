AB  - ABSTRACT I've argued that a version of Pascal's Wager applies to PVS so forcefully that no one who declines continued life without considering it makes a reasoned and informed decision. Thomas Mappes objects that my argument is much more limited than I realize. Of special interest is his appeal to an emerging diagnostic category, the ?minimally conscious state?, to argue that there is much to lose in gambling on life. I will defend the Wager. Along the way I maintain that the chance of recovery from long-term PVS is much better than represented (as is the prospect of regaining independence if one recovers consciousness), and that the 1994 Multi-Society Task Force definitions of ?permanent? PVS are confused in ways that make crafting advance directives dangerously difficult. Valid advance directives require informed consent, I argue; the Wager needs to be part of the process. A consequence of my argument is that withdrawing medically-delivered nutrition and hydration from PVS patients is much harder to justify.

AB  - Abstract Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a systemic disorder affecting elastic tissues most markedly in skin, retina, and blood vessels. It is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. In 1994 a new classification system for PXE was published as the result of a consensus conference. Since then the ABCC6 gene has been discovered. We propose that there is a need for a classification system incorporating all relevant systemic symptoms and signs, based on standardized clinical, histological, and molecular biological examination techniques. We re-evaluated the histopathologic PXE signs and propose a classification system with unambiguous criteria leading to a consistent diagnosis of definitive, probable, or possible PXE world-wide. We put this proposed classification forward to encourage further debate on the diagnosis of this multi-organ disorder. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Background Decline in high speed treadmill (HSTM) exercise testing may be attributed to the rise of over-ground endoscopy and telemetric electrocardiography, in addition to concerns of adverse events during treadmill exercise resulting in injury or inadequate testing. Objectives To describe adverse events occurring during HSTM exercise tests at a single institution and determine their effect on likelihood of completing diagnostic HSTM exercise testing. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Pearson?s chi-square test was used to determine if a significant difference in frequencies of adverse events existed between complete and incomplete HSTM exercise tests. Two Firth logistic regression models were used to determine likelihood of exercise test completion given the presence of any adverse event, and the likelihood of exercise test completion for each type of adverse event. Results The majority of horses presenting for HSTM evaluation underwent exercise testing (900/1003; 90%). Eight-hundred and seven (90%) exercise tests were completed. Adverse events occurred in 136 (15%) HSTM exercise tests of which 97 (71%) did not impact ability to complete HSTM testing. Adverse events significantly but variably decreased the likelihood of HSTM exercise test completion. Sixty-six percent of incomplete exercise tests were prematurely terminated due to poor performance abnormalities during which diagnosis of poor performance cause(s) was still achieved. Main limitations Variable personnel recorded data over the study period. Per-test rather than per-horse evaluation does not account for the effect of multiple training and testing episodes performed in the same horse. Conclusions This study supports the continued usage of HSTM exercise testing for examination of horses with poor performance, with adverse events occurring infrequently. Adverse events reduced the likelihood of completing HSTM exercise testing although not all adverse events affected likelihood of completion similarly. In many cases, a performance limiting problem was identified for horses in which an exercise test was considered incomplete. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting information

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Contamination and infection of synovial cavities are a common occurrence in clinical practice and, if inadequately treated, may have career or life threatening consequences for affected horses. Hypothesis: The objectives in treating contamination and infection of joints, tendon sheaths and bursae are most effectively met by endoscopic surgery. Methods: Over a 6 year period, cases of synovial contamination and infection admitted to a referral clinic were evaluated and treated endoscopically. The horses received local and systemic antimicrobial drugs with minimal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication but no other medical or surgical treatment. All arthroscope and instrument portals and, when ever possible, all traumatic wounds were closed. Diagnostic information, endoscopic observations and results of treatment were evaluated retrospectively. Results: A total of 140 affected animals were referred and 121 cases were treated endoscopically. These involved 70 joints, 29 tendon sheaths, 10 bursae and in 12 cases a combination of synovial cavities. The most common aetiologies were open wounds (n = 54) and self-sealing punctures (n = 41). Foreign material was identified endoscopically in 41 but predicted prior to surgery in only 6 cases. Osteochondral lesions were evident at surgery in 51 and recognised before surgery in 25 cases; 32 horses had intrathecal tendon or ligament defects. Follow-up information was obtained for 118 animals; 106 (90%) survived and 96 (81%) returned to their preoperative level of performance. The presence of osteitis/osteomyelitis, other osteochondral lesions and marked deposits of pannus were associated with nonsurvival. For those animals which survived, non-Thoroughbred horses, a combination of synovial structure involvement and regional i.v. antimicrobial administration were associated with reduced post operative performance. Marked pannus, regional i.v. antimicrobial administration and duration of systemic antimicrobial administration were associated with a group combining nonsurviving animals and those with reduced post operative performance. Conclusions: Endoscopic surgery makes a valuable contribution to the management of synovial contamination and infection. Potential relevance: The information obtained from and therapeutic options offered by endoscopy justify its early use in cases of synovial contamination and infection.

AB  - Deep learning is one of the most exciting new areas in medical imaging. This review article provides a summary of the current clinical applications of deep learning for lesion detection, progression, and prediction of musculoskeletal disease on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine. Deep-learning methods have shown success for estimating pediatric bone age, detecting fractures, and assessing the severity of osteoarthritis on radiographs. In particular, the high diagnostic performance of deep-learning approaches for estimating pediatric bone age and detecting fractures suggests that the new technology may soon become available for use in clinical practice. Recent studies have also documented the feasibility of using deep-learning methods for identifying a wide variety of pathologic abnormalities on CT and MRI including internal derangement, metastatic disease, infection, fractures, and joint degeneration. However, the detection of musculoskeletal disease on CT and especially MRI is challenging, as it often requires analyzing complex abnormalities on multiple slices of image datasets with different tissue contrasts. Thus, additional technical development is needed to create deep-learning methods for reliable and repeatable interpretation of musculoskeletal CT and MRI examinations. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of all deep-learning methods for detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal disease must be evaluated in prospective studies using large image datasets acquired at different institutions with different imaging parameters and different imaging hardware before they can be implemented in clinical practice.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the acid-base, fluid, and electrolytes. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a failure of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary gland. Central DI manifests as polyuria with dilute urine in setting of hypertonic plasma. Failure of the urine osmolarity to increase after fluid restriction is diagnostic confirmation. Treatment is aimed at replacing free water deficits and vasopressin, an ADH analogue. Acidosis is from the loss of bicarbonate and not the addition of an acid, a normal anion gap is expected. A widened anion gap would be expected from an etiology that caused the addition of an acid. The loss of bicarbonate causes a gain of chloride ions to maintain electrical neutrality. Because of this, normal gap metabolic acidosis has also been referenced as ?hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis?. The treatment in this setting would be to replace fluids and electrolytes.

AB  - This report details two cases of adverse drug reactions to amlodipine. The first case presented with diffuse peripheral oedema and a history of amlodipine therapy. Haematology, clinical chemistry, endocrine testing, thoracic, abdominal and cardiac imaging revealed no cause for oedema. Amlodipine therapy was discontinued and oedema diminished markedly within 72 hours. The second case presented for bilateral retinal detachments secondary to systemic hypertension. Haematology, clinical chemistry, thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable and amlodipine therapy was begun. Within 72 hours, diffuse peripheral oedema developed that was unresponsive to therapy and the dog was euthanised. Veterinarians should be aware of the potential serious adverse events associated with commonly used drugs; severe, diffuse oedema is a possible adverse drug event in dogs treated with amlodipine.

AB  - Objective To report prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes for presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnosed among an emergency-care population of UK dogs. Methods The study used a cross-sectional design using emergency-care veterinary clinical records from the VetCompass Programme spanning September 1, 2012 to February 28, 2014 and risk factor analysis using multivariable logistic regression modelling. Results The study population comprised 77,088 dogs attending 50 Vets Now clinics. Overall, 492 dogs had presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus diagnoses, giving a prevalence of 0·64% (95% Confidence interval: 0·58 to 0·70%). Compared with cross-bred dogs, breeds with the highest odds ratios for the diagnosis of presumptive gastric dilation-volvulus were the great Dane (odds ratio: 114·3, 95% Confidence interval 55·1 to 237·1, P<0·001), akita (odds ratio: 84·4, 95% Confidence interval 33·6 to 211·9, P<0·001) and dogue de Bordeaux (odds ratio: 82·9, 95% Confidence interval 39·0 to 176·3, P<0·001). Odds increased as dogs aged up to 12 years and neutered male dogs had 1·3 (95% Confidence interval 1·0 to 1·8, P=0·041) times the odds compared with entire females. Of the cases that were presented alive, 49·7% survived to discharge overall, but 79·3% of surgical cases survived to discharge. Clinical Significance Approximately 80% of surgically managed cases survived to discharge. Certain large breeds were highly predisposed.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about hearing impairment in patients after organ transplantation. We conducted a single-center study to evaluate hearing impairment in patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). A questionnaire was sent to 695 adult patients after OLT to assess characteristics and course of auditory impairment. Risk factors such as ototoxic drugs were taken into consideration. Clinical follow-up, including immunosuppressive therapy, was analyzed in detail. The questionnaire was completed by 521 patients (75%). Hearing impairment was reported by 184 patients (35%). A total of 43 patients (8%) suffered from hearing abnormalities prior to OLT. The remaining 141 patients (27%) developed hearing impairment after transplantation. Main problems were hearing loss (52%), tinnitus (38%), and otalgia (30%). There was no association of post-OLT hearing disorders with age or known risk factors. In 43% of patients, onset of hearing impairment was within 2 yr post-OLT. Hearing loss was positively associated with tacrolimus immunosuppression in univariate (P < 0.05) and multivariate analysis (P < 0.02). Patients using a hearing aid received tacrolimus more frequently than cyclosporine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, subjective hearing impairment is frequent in patients after OLT and contributes to post-OLT morbidity. Calcineurin inhibitor-related neurotoxicity appears as a possible mechanism. Further prospective investigations with objective hearing tests are necessary to confirm these results and to evaluate the role of immunosuppression. Liver Transpl, 2006. ? 2006 AASLD.

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - Young onset dementia (YOD), where symptoms of dementia have an onset before the age of 65, has become more prominent due to the population increase from the Baby Boomer generation. This clinical perspective examines key issues in the assessment, diagnosis and management of YOD. Challenges in the assessment and diagnosis of YOD are partly due to the diverse range of types of YOD, where degenerative dementias are less common and secondary dementias more common than in late onset dementia. Early symptoms are broad and include depression, behavioural change, neurological disorders, systemic disorders and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Perceived diagnostic delay may result in frustration and distress in people with YOD and their families. Chronic depression and MCI are associated with longer time to diagnosis, and in these situations, clinicians need to establish appropriate review processes and communicate clearly. A diagnosis of YOD may have marked consequences for a younger person, including early retirement, financial impacts and the psychological challenge of coming to grips with cognitive decline. Partners, children and other supporters often have unmet needs, feel burdened by care and are at high risk of physical and emotional consequences. Concerns about the heritability of dementia may add to family distress. Recent community service developments in Australia for YOD are outlined and the challenges of residential care described.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dilated cardiomyopathy is the usual cause of congestive heart failure in the dobermann pinscher and was the presumptive diagnosis in an eight-year-old female dobermann pinscher presented for dyspnoea and syncope. This was supported by thoracic radiography and electrocardiographic evidence of ventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram revealed a left atrial tumour as the principal cause of cardiac failure. Pathological examination confirmed that the tumour was a large aortic body carcinoma in an unusual location. Multifocal myocardial infarctions were also found. This unusual case demonstrates the importance of a complete cardiological examination as part of a diagnostic work up and confirms the necessity of echocardiography as one of the examination methods.

AB  - Summary The use of contrast media in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing in horses. These contrast-enhanced imaging techniques provide improved tissue delineation and evaluation, thereby expanding diagnostic capabilities. While generally considered safe, not all contrast media exhibit the same safety profiles. The safety of contrast media use and descriptions of adverse events occurring in horses are sparsely reported. This review summarises the reported evidence of contrast media use and adverse events that occur in horses, with added contribution from other veterinary species and studies in man for comparison. This comprehensive data set empowers equine clinicians to develop use and monitoring strategies when working with contrast media. Finally, it summarises the current state-of-the-art and highlights the potential applications of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for assessment of diseased or injured equine tissues, as well as (patho)physiological processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the prescribing and use of anti-epileptic drug (AED) therapy in nursing facility residents. DESIGN: A retrospective, multicenter drug use evaluation. SETTING: A total of 85 nursing facilities (average size, 119 beds) in five states. PARTICIPANTS: 1132 residents of the total 10,168 residents screened were prescribed at least one AED MEASURES: Demographic information, primary indication for AED, comorbid conditions, prescribing physician's specialty, concomitant medications, and AED dosage regimen information were collected. Laboratory tests obtained in the most recent 6 months and seizure occurrence and seizure-related diagnostic assessments made in the most recent 3 months were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 1132 residents receiving AED therapy, 892 (78.8%) were prescribed AED therapy for a seizure-related diagnosis although 86% of seizure types were unspecified. Another 215 residents (19.0%) were prescribed AEDs for nonseizure diagnoses, and 25 (2.2%) had no indication for AED therapy. AEDs most frequently prescribed were phenytoin (56.8%), carbamazepine (23.0%), phenobarbital (15.6%), and valproic acid (13.1%). For residents with a seizure diagnosis, the most frequently prescribed monotherapy agents were phenytoin (52.0%), carbamazepine (12.2%), and phenobarbitol (7.1%). Almost 25% of residents with a seizure diagnosis took a combination of AEDs; more than 50% of all combinations included phenobarbital. About 9% of residents with a seizure diagnosis had one or more documented seizures during a 3-month review period. CONCLUSION: Among the substantial percentage of residents treated with AEDs, the lack of diagnosis of seizure type has serious implications for the choice of AED therapy. Opportunities exist for prescribing physicians, consultant pharmacists, and nursing staff to improve the medical management of nursing facility residents with seizures and of others receiving AEDs.

AB  - Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive breakdown of striatal neurons. Standard white matter integrity measures like fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging were analyzed in prodromal-HD subjects; however, they studied either a whole brain or specific subcortical white matter structures with connections to cortical motor areas. In this work, we propose a novel analysis of a longitudinal cohort of 243 prodromal-HD individuals and 88 healthy controls who underwent two or more diffusion MRI scans as part of the PREDICT-HD study. We separately trace specific white matter fiber tracts connecting the striatum (caudate and putamen) with four cortical regions corresponding to the hand, face, trunk, and leg motor areas. A multi-tensor tractography algorithm with an isotropic volume fraction compartment allows estimating diffusion of fast-moving extra-cellular water in regions containing crossing fibers and provides quantification of a microstructural property related to tissue atrophy. The tissue atrophy rate is separately analyzed in eight cortico-striatal pathways as a function of CAG-repeats (genetic load) by statistically regressing out age effect from our cohort. The results demonstrate a statistically significant increase in isotropic volume fraction (atrophy) bilaterally in hand fiber connections to the putamen with increasing CAG-repeats, which connects the genetic abnormality (CAG-repeats) to an imaging-based microstructural marker of tissue integrity in specific white matter pathways in HD. Isotropic volume fraction measures in eight cortico-striatal pathways are also correlated significantly with total motor scores and diagnostic confidence levels, providing evidence of their relevance to HD clinical presentation.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. We report a case of temporal arteritis with a sympathetic component in the orofacial region, which responded to stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs). Case. An 81-year-old woman with limited mouth opening and pain upon chewing was referred to the Orofacial Pain Clinic at Nihon University Dental Hospital. The patient also presented with blurred vision and a burning sensation on the right side of her face. On clinical examination, the temporal artery was tender to palpation, and there was increased sensitivity in the temporal region bilaterally. The patient reported jaw pain and limited mouth opening. Laboratory examination showed elevations in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The burning sensation was due to a sympathetic component, and SGBs substantially reduced both the burning sensation and right temporal pain. Blocking the sympathetic chain on the ipsilateral side also improved jaw movement. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist, after which she was admitted to hospital with a tentative diagnosis of temporal arteritis. Treatment with oral prednisone 30?mg daily was initiated, and the dose was tapered as her symptoms resolved. Discussion. The reason for the gradual pain relief after SGB is unclear, but we believe it was effective for ischemia in temporal arteritis because it led to dilation of affected arteries or suppression of inflammation/edema of the vascular wall. Conclusion. This case demonstrates that SGB may relieve pain related to temporal arteritis and sympathetically maintained headache and orofacial pain by reducing noxious stimulation peripherally and decreasing central pain transmission centrally.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical findings, laboratory data, ultrastructure, and autopsy findings are reported for four Greyhounds with a myeloproliferative disorder. In all dogs abnormalities were found in the granulocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines, resulting in granulocytic leukaemia, impaired erythropoiesis and megakaryocytic dysplasia. The presence in blood of many small platelet producing cells (micromegakaryocytes) led to initial diagnostic confusion in three dogs with two of them suspected of having lymphatic leukaemia. An approach to the diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease, including the awareness of other clinical possibilities, is presented. The significance of the presence of micromegakaryocytes in the peripheral blood stream is discussed with reference to other veterinary reports and similar findings in man.
