AB  - Summary Myxedema coma is a decompensated state of hypothyroidism resulting from severe and prolonged depletion of thyroid hormones, leading to altered mental status and other clinical features related to widespread multi-organ dysfunction. While this is a rare condition on the spectrum of thyroid disorders, myxedema coma is considered an endocrine emergency due to the danger of increased mortality with recent rates of 20?25% reported. Therefore, it is important to promptly recognize and treat myxedema coma in an attempt to improve outcomes.

AB  - The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often considered to be a contraindication to organ donation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of DIC+ donors on kidney recipient (KR) evolution. We identified 169 KRs with DIC+ donation after brain death donors between January 1996 and December 2012 in 6 French transplant centers. Individuals were matched using propensity scores to 338 recipients with DIC? donors according to donor age and sex, whether expanded criteria for the donor existed, graft year, and transplantation center. After kidney transplantation, delayed graft function was observed in 28.1% of DIC+ KRs and in 22.8% of DIC? KRs (NS). Renal allograft survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 94.5%, 89.3%, and 73.9% and 96.2%, 90.8%, and 81.3% in DIC+ KRs and DIC? KRs, respectively (NS). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was similar between DIC+ and DIC? KRs at 3 months, 1 year, and 10 years: 45.9 vs 48.1 mL/min, 42.1 vs 43.1 mL/min, and 33.9 vs 38.1 mL/min, respectively. Delayed calcineurin inhibitor introduction or induction had no impact on delayed graft function rate or eGFR evolution at 10 years after transplantation in DIC+ KRs. Donor DIC did not seem to affect initial outcome, long-term graft function, or allograft survival.

AB  - Objectives To assess the benefit of selective arterial clamping (SAC) as an alternative to main renal artery clamping (MAC) during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in patients without underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients and Methods Our study cohort comprised 665 patients without impaired renal function undergoing MAC (n = 589) or SAC (n = 76) during RAPN from four medical institutions in the period 2008?2015. We compared complication rates, positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, and peri-operative and intermediate-term renal functional outcome between 132 patients undergoing MAC and 66 undergoing SAC after 2-to-1 nearest-neighbour propensity-score matching for age, sex, body mass index, RENAL nephrometry score, tumour size, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and warm ischaemia time (WIT). Results In propensity-score-matched patients, PSM (5.7 vs 3.0%; P = 0.407) and complication rates (13.8 vs 10.6%; P = 0.727) did not differ between the MAC and SAC groups. The incidence of acute kidney injury for MAC vs SAC (25.0 vs 32.0%; P = 0.315) within the first 30 days was similar. At a median follow-up of 7.5 months, the percentage reduction in eGFR (?9.3 vs ?10.4%; P = 0.518) and progression to CKD ≥ stage 3 (7.2 vs 8.5%; P = 0.792) showed no difference. Conclusions Our study findings show no difference in PSM rates, complication rates or intermediate-term renal functional outcomes between patients with unimpaired renal function who underwent SAC vs those who underwent MAC. When expected WIT is low, the routine use of SAC may not be necessary. Further studies will need to determine the role of SAC in patients with a solitary kidney or with significantly impaired renal function.

AB  - Background:?? With the use of the three-point lap-diagonal seat belt restraint there has been a reduction in the number of deaths caused by automobile trauma. However, with the use of a restraint, a new pattern of injuries has emerged. The ?seat-belt syndrome? comprises a constellation of injuries including soft tissue injury to the breast. Given that seat-belt legislation is becoming more widespread, it is likely that the incidence and reporting of these injuries will become more common. In this paper, we provide an overview of the reported literature regarding three-point lap-diagonal seat belt injury to the female breast. We then discuss the previously unreported area of breast reconstruction in a breast deformed as a result of blunt trauma, using a specific case as an example. Methods:?? A Medline search was undertaken and all available reported literature, related to seat-belt associated breast trauma, reviewed. Results:?? A concise summary of the varied clinical and radiological presentations is given, as is their suggested management. Subsequently highlighted is the paucity of literature discussing the breast reconstruction options for a breast deformed by blunt trauma and thus, this issue is discussed using a specific case as an example. Conclusions:?? Blunt breast trauma secondary to seat-belt restraint is not only likely to become more common, but can be severe in its functional, psycho-social and aesthetic impact. This paper provides a new adjunct to the currently reported literature, especially in the area of plastic surgical reconstruction of a breast deformed by blunt trauma.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this study was to identify abnormalities in bladder and renal function in men with urinary retention presumed to be due to BPH. Methods In this retrospective analysis, urodynamic studies (UDS) and renal function were evaluated. Bladder contractility and compliance and the severity of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) were determined from urodynamics. Renal function (BUN, creatine, eGFR) was assessed prior to retention, at the time of presentation and after urodynamic evaluation. Results Of 87 patients with evaluable UDS, 48% did not demonstrate detrusor activity during testing while 52% showed some detrusor contractile activity. Of these, 23% did not have BOO. Diminished bladder compliance was detected in 56%. In the entire cohort, BUN, serum creatinine, and eGFR were significantly changed during retention but were restored after catheterization. In older patients (>75 years), BUN and creatinine during retention were significantly higher, and eGFR was significantly lower compared to younger patients, but renal function after catheterization was not different between age groups. No significant correlations were found between renal function measurements and bladder compliance or age. Conclusion The urodynamic spectrum in men with urinary retention ranged from detrusor acontractility to varied degrees of contractility associated with outlet obstruction spanning from equivocal to severe. Moreover, prompt relief of retention restores renal function to baseline levels, regardless of age. This study indicates that prostatic obstruction may not be the only cause of urinary retention in adult men presumed to have BPH and illustrates the value of urodynamic assessment prior to potentially failure-prone surgical interventions.

AB  - Abstract Introduction We describe and provide follow-up for a novel simplified technique permitting dual en bloc (DEB) transplantation of adult organs using single in situ arterial and venous anastomoses. Methods Twenty-two adult DEB transplants were performed at our center between 2001 and 2012, utilizing 44 kidneys en bloc. Results were compared with 20 solitary transplants from expanded criteria donors (ECD) associated with lower terminal serum creatinines and Remuzzi biopsy scores vs DEB group. Adult DEB implants had donor inferior vena cava connected to recipient external iliac vein and ?Y? arterial interposition graft anastomosed to the recipient iliac artery. Ureters were conjoined prior to implantation as a single patch into the recipient bladder. Results Mean operative time was 206±57 minutes in DEB vs 180±30 minutes in single transplants (P<.05). Delayed graft function rate was 23% vs 25% in both groups. At 12-month follow-up, mean serum creatinine was 152±66 ?mol/L vs in 154±52 ?mol/L DEB and single kidney transplant recipients, respectively (P=NS). Three-year overall and graft specific survival were 86% and 84% in the DEB group, respectively (P=NS). Complication rates were similar between groups. Conclusions This DEB renal transplantation technique is safe and effective in adults. By employing techniques used to conjoin organ vasculature ex vivo, the number of in situ anastomoses is reduced, thereby minimizing operative ischemic time and potential for complications associated with extensive vascular dissection.

AB  - Demyelination and Schwann cell (SC) proliferation are hallmarks of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies, of which Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 A (CMT1A) neuropathy is the typical example. In CMT1A, an altered dosage of the PMP22 gene determines a defect of myelination and an abnormal SC phenotype, characterized by hyperplasia and abnormal differentiation. The Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) family of proteins, including EGF and neuregulins, and their receptors, namely EGFr and the erbB family, control growth and development of SC. Their expression in mature SC is down-regulated but, during Wallerian degeneration or chemical myelinolysis, these receptors are transiently over-expressed, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. On the other hand, neuregulin 1 inhibits SC myelination and induces demyelination and SC dedifferentiation and proliferation. These effects might play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic demyelinating neuropathies. We have therefore immunolocalized EGF, EGFr and the erbB receptors (erbB 2, 3 and 4) in sural nerve biopsies from patients with CMT1A as compared to chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) nerve biopsies and to normal nerves, in order to evaluate if the expression of these molecules is up- or down-regulated in these disorders. Among CMT1A nerves, immunoreactivity for EGF, EGFr, erbB2 and erbB3 was moderately to markedly increased in SC, particularly in onion bulbs, in most cases, while a mild to moderate expression of erbB 4 in SC cytoplasm was observed in a few cases. On the other hand in CIDP, which shares with CMT1A histopathological features such as de-remyelination and SC hyperplasia, only the expression of erbB 3 was up-regulated in a minority of cases. Since in SC the functional neuregulin receptor is a heterodimer, composed by erbB2 and erbB3, the parallel up-regulation of these two molecules in CMT1A may bear a functional significance. This would be confirmed if an overexpression of neuregulins could be demonstrated, along with our finding of an increased expression of EGF and its receptor. In conclusion, it can be hypothesized that, in CMT1A, a persistent activation of neuregulin signaling pathways not only is indicative of SC dedifferentiation but also may contribute to demyelination and onion bulb formation or maintenance.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.

AB  - Abstract Kidneys from pDDs are increasingly used to narrow the huge gap between incremental demand and static supply. However, there is still controversy on the clinical outcome of SKT from pDDs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 452 adult recipients in our center between March 2012 and February 2017. Outcomes of 3 groups, transplants with organs from pDDs (n=50), aDDs (n=207), and LDs (n=195), were compared. The mean age and weight of pDDs were 8.98 years (range 8 months-17 years) and 30.05 kg (range 8.2-55 kg), respectively. There was no difference in 1-year (96.0%, 98.1%, and 99.0%, respectively, P=.277) and 3-year patient survival (96.0%, 98.1%, and 99.0%, respectively, P=.277) or in 1-year (96.0%, 96.6%, and 98.5%, P=.307) and 3-year (96.0%, 96.6% and 97.9%, P=.437) graft survival. SCr, eGFR, and allograft size were similar among the 3 groups at 6th month post-transplant and thereafter. Incidence of DGF was higher in patients of the aDD group than those in the pDD group (22.7% vs 10.0%, P<.001), but there was no difference in AR and infection. SKT from pDDs to adult recipients is effective and safe with acceptable outcomes, and it will be a promising expansion to the donor pool.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Abstract During liver transplantation, the patient is at risk of developing progressive lactic acidosis. Following reperfusion, correction of acidosis may occur. In some patients, acidosis will worsen, a phenomenon referred to as persistent acidosis after reperfusion (PAAR). We compared postoperative outcomes in patients who manifested PAAR vs those that did not. All adult patients undergoing liver transplantation from 2002 to 2015 were included. PAAR is defined by the presence of a significant negative slope coefficient for base excess values measured after hepatic artery anastomosis through 72 hours postoperatively. Primary outcome was a composite of 30-day and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included: ICU LOS, total hospital LOS, and re-transplantation rate within 7 days. PAAR occurred in 10% of the transplant recipients. Patients with PAAR had higher MELD, BMI, and eGFR and demonstrated a longer median ICU LOS and hospital median LOS with a trend toward mortality difference. But, after propensity matching, the mortality rate difference became significantly higher in patients with PAAR compared with matched controls while the ICU LOS differences disappeared. The re-transplantation rates were similar also between the PAAR and no PAAR groups. The cohort with PAAR had a significant 30-day and in-hospital increase in mortality after propensity score matching.

AB  - Abstract Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults and carry a dismal prognosis. Despite aggressive therapy with maximal safe surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy, these tumors invariably are refractory to or become resistant to treatment and recur. Gliomas are highly infiltrative cancers and display remarkable genetic heterogeneity making them challenging to treat. Recent progress has been made in understanding the molecular and genetic composition of these tumors and from this, promising new targets for therapy have emerged. In particular, anti-angiogenesis therapies have led to modest success in disease control. In addition, the growing body of research in cancer immunology as well as cancer stem cells has made inroads in our understanding of tumorgenesis. Translational research has been particularly crucial to the development of these therapies as much preclinical and clinical work is needed to develop the rationale for treatments, to develop biomarkers of drug activity and to elucidate mechanisms of resistance. This brief overview will discuss some of the pivotal advances made in the pursuit of improved outcomes and survival for patients with this devastating disease.

AB  - Abstract The first full year of data after implementation of the new kidney allocation system reveals an increase in deceased donor kidney transplants among black candidates and those with calculated panel-reactive antibodies 98%?100%, but a decrease among candidates aged 65 years or older. Data from 2015 also demonstrate ongoing positive trends in graft and patient survival for both deceased and living donor kidney transplants, but the challenges of a limited supply of kidneys in the setting of increasing demand remain evident. While the total number of patients on the waiting list decreased for the first time in a decade, this was due to a combination of a decrease in the number of candidates added to the list and an increase in the number of candidates removed from the list due to deteriorating medical condition, as well as an increase in total transplants. Deaths on the waiting list remained flat, but this was likely because of an increasing trend toward removing inactive candidates too sick to undergo transplant.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective The paper describes novel real-time ?in situ mapping? and ?sequential occlusion angiography? to facilitate selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) using intraoperative contrast enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS). Materials and methods Data were collected and assessed for 60 patients (61 tumours) between 2009 and 2013. 31 (50.8%) tumours underwent ?Global Ischaemia?, 27 (44.3%) underwent ?Selective Ischaemia? and 3 (4.9%) were removed ?Off Clamp Zero Ischaemia?. Demographics, operative variables, complications, renal pathology and outcomes were assessed. Results Median PADUA score was 9 (range 7?10). The mean warm ischaemia time in selective ischaemia was less and statistically significant than in global ischaemia (17.1 and 21.4, respectively). Mean operative time was 163?min. Postoperative complications (n?=?10) included three (5%) Clavien grade 3 or above. Malignancy was demonstrated in 47 (77%) with negative margin in 43 (91.5%) and positive margin in four (8.5%). Long-term decrease in eGFR post selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy was less compared with global ischaemia (four and eight, respectively) but not statistically significant. Conclusions This technique is safe, feasible and cost-effective with comparable perioperative outcomes. The technical aspects elucidate the role of intraoperative CEUS to facilitate and ascertain selective ischaemia. Further work is required to demonstrate long-term oncological outcomes. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (cohort) Level of Evidence?2b What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Tumour in a solitary functioning kidney represents an absolute indication for nephron-sparing surgery whenever technically feasible. We report the longest follow-up data comparing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and laparoscopic cryoablation in patients with solitary kidney with oncological follow-up to five years. OBJECTIVES ??We compare perioperative, functional and intermediate-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) vs laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) for small renal tumour in patients with a solitary kidney. ??A treatment algorithm is also proposed. PATIENT AND METHODS ??Over a 10-year period (02/1998-09/2008), 78 patients with a small tumour in a functionally solitary kidney underwent LPN (n= 48) or LCA (n= 30). ??Baseline, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS ??Demographic data were similar between the LPN and LCA groups. Tumours were somewhat larger (3.2 vs 2.6?cm) in the LPN group. LPN was associated with greater blood loss (391 vs 162?mL; P= 0.003), and trended towards more post-operative complications (22.9% vs 6.7%; P= 0.07). ??By 3 months post-operative, eGFR decreased by 14.5% and 7.3% after LPN and LCA, respectively (P= 0.02). Post-operative temporary dialysis was required after 3 LPN (6.2% vs 0%, P= 0.16). ??Median follow-up time for LPN and LCA was 42.7 and 60.2 months, respectively. ??Local recurrence was detected in 4 (13.3%) LCA patients only (P= 0.02). ??Overall survival was comparable between LPN and LCA at 3 and 5 years, respectively (P= 0.74). The LPN group had superior cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival at 3 and 5 years compared to the LCA group (P < 0.05, for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS ??Given adequate technical expertise, both LPN and LCA are viable nephron-sparing options for patients with tumour in a solitary kidney. ??Although LCA is technically easier and has superior functional outcomes, oncologic outcomes are superior after LPN.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common monogenic disorder causing hypophosphatemia. This case-note review documents the clinical features and the complications of treatment in 59 adults (19 male, 40 female) with XLH. XLH is associated with a large number of private mutations; 37 different mutations in the PHEX gene were identified in this cohort, 14 of which have not been previously reported. Orthopaedic involvement requiring surgical intervention (osteotomy) was frequent. Joint replacement and decompressive laminectomy were observed in those older than 40 years. Dental disease (63%), nephrocalcinosis (42%), and hearing impairment (14%) were also common. The rarity of the disease and the large number of variants make it difficult to discern specific genotype-phenotype relationships. A new treatment, an anti-FGF23 antibody, that may affect the natural history of the disease is currently being investigated in clinical trials.
