AB  - Advances in our understanding of desmosomal diseases have provided a clear demonstration of the key role played by desmosomes in tissue and organ physiology, highlighting the importance of their dynamic and finely regulated structure. In this context, non-desmosomal regulatory molecules have acquired increasing relevance in the study of this organelle resulting in extending the desmosomal interactome, named the ?desmo-adhesome.? Spatiotemporal changes in the expression and regulation of the desmo-adhesome underlie a number of genetic, infectious, autoimmune, and malignant conditions. The aim of the present article was to examine the structural and functional relationship of the desmosome, by providing a comprehensive, yet focused overview of the constituents targeted in human disease. The inclusion of the novel regulatory network in the desmo-adhesome pathophysiology opens new avenues to a deeper understanding of desmosomal diseases, potentially unveiling pathogenic mechanisms waiting to be explored.

AB  - Abstract Background Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is commonly used to deploy new bioprosthetic valves inside degenerated surgically implanted aortic valves in high risk patients. The three scoring systems used to assess risk of postprocedural mortality are: Logistic EuroSCORE (LES), EuroSCORE II (ES II), and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS). Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze the accuracy of LES, ES II, and STS in estimating all-cause mortality after transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve (ViV) implantations, which was not assessed before. Methods Using the Valve-in-Valve International Data (VIVID) registry, a total of 1,550 patients from 110 centers were included. The study compared the observed 30-day overall mortality vs. the respective predicted mortalities calculated by risk scores. The accuracy of prediction models was assessed based on calibration and discrimination. Results Observed mortality at 30 days was 5.3%, while average expected mortalities by LES, ES II and STS were 29.49 (± 17.2), 14.59 (± 8.6), and 9.61 (± 8.51), respectively. All three risk scores overestimated 30-day mortality with ratios of 0.176 (95% CI 0.138?0.214), 0.342 (95% CI 0.264?0.419), and 0.536 (95% CI 0.421?0.651), respectively. 30-day mortality ROC curves demonstrated that ES II had the largest AUC at 0.722, followed by STS at 0.704, and LES at 0.698. Conclusions All three scores overestimated mortality at 30 days with ES II showing the highest predictability compared to LES and STS; and therefore, should be recommended for ViV procedures. There is a need for a dedicated scoring system for patients undergoing ViV interventions.

AB  - Summary Quality of life is one of the highest priorities in neuro-oncological care and should be heavily weighted in finalizing the best treatment option. Brain and spine tumors can be primary or metastatic. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies primary brain tumors into grades depending on their histologic features. In the vast majority of primary tumors, the pathogenesis revolves around alterations of signaling pathways. De novo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and occurs in older patients. Family history is important to rule out genetic syndromes. The treatment plans for CNS tumors requires a multidisciplinary approach combining neurology, neurosurgery, oncology, and radiation oncology expertise. Brain and spinal tumors in pregnancy are rare, except for enlargement of pituitary tumors and meningiomas. Gliomas are infiltrative tumors and tend to recur after surgical resection and adjuvant therapy is necessary. The best prognosis is associated with upfront aggressive surgical resection for high-grade gliomas.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Clinical research in head and neck cancer traditionally focused on tumor control. As survival improves, it is increasingly recognized that the side-effects of multimodality treatment can be profound and enduring. Thus, clinical trials require patient-reported and functional outcomes. Methods A subcommittee of the Previously Untreated, Locally Advanced (PULA) Task Force of the Head and Neck Steering Committee of the Coordinating Centre for Clinical Trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was convened to identify a set of instruments suitable for widespread application in the conduct of clinical trials for head and neck cancer. Results Based on existing literature and expert opinion, 18 main areas of concern were identified. For each, measures suitable for use in multicenter clinical trials were recommended on the basis of validity, feasibility, and clinical acceptance. Conclusion Suitable instruments exist for most head and neck cancer concerns, but gaps require further development. Future efforts should be made to harmonize measurement across trials. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 37: 425?439, 2015

AB  - Since the introduction of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV has become a chronic disease, with infected people in high-income countries approaching similar life expectancy to the general population. As this population ages, an increasing number of people with HIV are living with age-, treatment-, and disease-related comorbidities. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol abuse, and substance misuse have a role in age-related comorbidity. Some degree of immune dysfunction is suggested by the presence of markers of immune activation/inflammation despite effective suppression of HIV replication. Cumulative exposure to some antiretroviral drugs contributes to HIV-associated comorbidities, with risk increasing with age. Specifically, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir are associated with renal impairment, and TDF is known to cause loss of bone mineral density. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) was developed to improve on the safety profile of TDF, while maintaining its efficacy. TAF has better stability in plasma, and higher intracellular accumulation of tenofovir diphosphate in target cells, which has resulted in improved antiviral activity at lower doses with improved renal and bone safety. TAF has been studied extensively in randomized clinical trials and real-world studies. TAF-based regimens are recommended over TDF-containing regimens for the improved safety profile.

AB  - Abstract Background Numerous oncology patients who receive targeted therapy suffer from the skin adverse effects induced. Novel agents, that is tyrosine kinase inhibitors and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, have given good results in patient survival while decreasing the systemic toxicities in comparison to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, but are also related to skin adverse effects. Aims In this article, we highlighted the importance of specific pharmaceutical and dermocosmetic management of the untoward events of targeted therapy. Conclusion The combination of Oncodermatology, Psychodermatology, Cosmetic Dermatology, Cosmetic Science, Dermatopharmacology and Aesthetic Science can offer a lot for the prevention or early relief of the cutaneous adverse effects in oncology patients receiving targeted therapy.
