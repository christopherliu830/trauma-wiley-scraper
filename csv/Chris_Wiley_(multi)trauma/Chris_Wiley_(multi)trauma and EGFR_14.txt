AB  - Abstract Beta-thalassaemia is characterised by progressive anaemia necessitating regular blood transfusions to sustain life. With the advent of effective chelating agents that can reduce the iron burden and extend patients' survival, renal disease, as in other ageing populations, has become more prevalent. In recent years, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become overwhelming; indeed, approximately 8% or 6 million people of the UK population has evidence of CKD. Several factors, which occur in patients with thalassaemia, account for the relative explosion of renal disease in the general population including increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and the advent of novel measures of renal function facilitating early detection of kidney disease. In addition, some patients with thalassaemia develop renal tubular dysfunction related to the disease itself, the effects of iron overload and the effects of chelator therapy, while other patients have an increased creatinine clearance leading to hyperfiltration. More recently, there is a noticeable increasing prevalence of impaired renal function and proteinuria because of several putative factors including chelators. We review current data on the potential mechanisms leading to renal abnormalities seen in patients with thalassaemia, the potential effects of iron loading within the kidney and the potential renal effects of chelator therapy. This article gives a speculative account of possible mechanisms and theories to consider providing pause for thought and direct future research in this area.

AB  - Abstract Dendrimers have emerged as a powerful class of nanomaterials in the nanomedicine field due to their unique structural features: globular, well-defined, highly branched and controllable structure, nanosize-scale, low polydispersity, and the presence of several terminal groups that can be functionalized with different ligands simulating the multivalency present in different biological systems. Although in its infancy, the application of dendrimers as therapeutics or theranostic tools in central nervous system (CNS) disorders is already significant and has opened promising avenues in the treatment of many conditions where the inherent ?smartness? of the dendritic structures is being explored to effectively target the CNS. Here we present an overview of the past and future challenges of the use of dendrimers to respond to one of the ultimate challenges in the (nano)medicine field: to attain CNS repair and regeneration.

AB  - Abstract In this editor's review, articles published in 2012 are organized by category and briefly summarized. We aim to provide a brief reflection of the currently available worldwide knowledge that is intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of technologies and methods of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration. As the official journal of the International Federation for Artificial Organs, the International Faculty for Artificial Organs, and the International Society for Rotary Blood Pumps, Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration from all over the world. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide such meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected, and especially to those whose native tongue is not English. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers, the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our publisher, Wiley Periodicals, for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to recording further advances in the coming years.
