AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Most transplant centres harvest living donor kidneys via a conventional laparoscopic surgical approach. Laparoendoscopic single-site donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN) is a relatively novel minimally invasive approach that allows the surgery to be performed via a single incision. This technique may be advantageous in decreasing surgical morbidity and improving cosmetic outcomes, thus plausibly reducing the barriers to kidney donation. The study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of LESS-DN in a large consecutive series of kidney donors. Comparative analysis between LDN and LESS-DN showed that there was a significant decrease in intra-operative blood loss and allograft warm ischaemia time in the LESS-DN group, but also a significant increase in operating time. Other peri-operative outcomes were similar between the two approaches. Evaluation of the LESS-DN cases alone revealed that, the operating times did not significantly change through the course of the series. Using this outcome as a surrogate for technical difficulty suggests a relatively shallow learning curve for LESS-DN. Objective To present a comparative analysis of peri-operative outcomes for >200 cases of conventional laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) and laparoendoscopic single site donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN). Patients and Methods From 2006 to 2011, 213 donor nephrectomies were performed by two surgeons (R.E.L and W.A.M.) at a tertiary transplant centre. The approach changed from conventional LDN to LESS-DN over the course of the series. The two approaches were compared retrospectively and evaluated for differences in peri-operative outcomes. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t-test and chi-squared analysis. Results A total of 111 patients underwent LDN and 102 patients underwent LESS-DN. Total operating time was significantly longer in the LESS-DN group (206.1 vs 181.9?min, P < 0.001), but LESS-DN resulted in less intra-operative blood loss (61.5?mL vs 85.9?mL, P < 0.001) and shorter warm ischaemia times (4.4 vs 5.0?min, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in analgesic requirements, subjective pain scores, length of hospital stay, postoperative graft function, or donor's postoperative glomerular filtration rate between the two approaches. Complication rates were low regardless of the approach, and there were no major complications (>grade II) in the LESS-DN group. Conclusions In experienced hands, LESS-DN results in peri-operative outcomes similar to those of conventional LDN without compromising donor safety, while providing a desirable cosmetic result. For surgeons familiar with LDN, transitioning to the LESS approach using this technique appears to have a relatively short learning curve.

AB  - Summary Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30?40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury. It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal surgery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modifiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic lead toxicity is a worldwide public health problem. Lead possesses deleterious effects on many organ systems. However, little is known regarding its clinical and biophysical effects on the skin. Objective To investigate mucocutaneous signs and biophysical property changes in skin after chronic lead toxicity. Methods One hundred and eighty-seven patients who were car battery workers participated in the study. Complete history and physical examination were performed. Blood was collected for laboratory analyses. Thorough skin examination by dermatologists was carried out in 134 subjects. Additionally, 96 patients with blood lead levels (BLL) >70 ?g/dL were further evaluated for skin elasticity, sebum content, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), hydration, pH and pigmentation. An equal number of age-, sex- and skin-type-matched subjects were recruited as controls. Results The mean BLL of all subjects was 74.15 ± 11.58 ?g/dL. The most frequently observed signs were gingival brown pigmentation in 112 (83.6%), gingivitis in 111 (82.8%) and lead line in 66 (49.3%) patients. The lead line was found in subjects with significantly higher BLLs (adjusted mean difference 6.45, 95% CI 2.30?10.60 ?g/dL, P = 0.003) and in association with gingivitis (adjusted OR 7.32, 95% CI 2.08?25.74, P = 0.002). Mean BLL of the patients who underwent biophysical assessment was 82.77 ± 9.80 ?g/dL. Patients exhibited a statistically significant lower skin hydration observed by corneometer as well as elasticity. The adjusted ORs of having dry skin and lower elasticity were 15.32 (95% CI 4.41?53.24), P < 0.001) and 1.96 (95% CI 1.06?3.60), P = 0.031), respectively. These differences were not significant for sebum content, TEWL, pH and pigmentation. Conclusion Importantly, even in normal-appearing skin, level of hydration and elasticity decreased in lead-intoxicated patients. These results suggest that lead might possess harmful effects on the skin at measurable levels.
