AB  - Perforator flaps such as the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) perforator flap is used increasingly for breast reconstruction. This is often preferred to traditional transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps where sparing of muscle significantly reduces the risk of abdominal wall weakness. Perforators however are often small (diameter of less than 1?mm) and travel substantial longitudinal and transverse distances within the rectus abdominus muscle. Some surgeons therefore, may find the DIEA perforator flap technically more difficult to dissect than the traditional TRAM flap. Pre-operative CT angiography (CTA) plays an integral part in mapping the size and location of these perforators. We describe a simple intra-operative technique, commonly used in plastic and ophthalmic surgery, which is invaluable in assisting the surgeon in the dissection of these perforators. This technique has been performed successfully on over 12 patients in the last 2?years.

AB  - Purpose:?? Perineal and posterior vaginal wall reconstruction following abdominoperineal and local cancer resection requires replacement of dead space and restoration of function. Ideal reconstructive options include those which avoid muscle sacrifice, do not interfere with colostomy formation, and avoid the use of irradiated tissue. Methodology:?? We present our experience with a new technique for perineal and vaginal reconstruction: superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP or IGAP) flaps. We describe the operative technique and outcome in 14 consecutive patients. Six cases were performed as primary reconstruction and 8 cases were delayed, with all receiving preoperative radiotherapy. Results:?? Immediate reconstructions underwent preoperative imaging with ultrasound only, while delayed reconstructions underwent preoperative CTA. Postoperatively, patients were ambulated immediately, with all bed rest and sitting performed on the contralateral buttock or side for 4?weeks. There were no flap failures or partial flap losses, and no postoperative hernias. Four patients developed early minor wound dehiscence that was resutured in three cases. Revisional surgery was performed for reduction of three bulky flaps. All female patients reported resumption of sexual intercourse following this procedure. Conclusion:?? Gluteal artery perforator flaps are good options for perineal reconstruction, avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with rectus abdominis or gluteus maximus muscle harvest.

AB  - There has been anecdotal evidence that patients undergoing abdominoplasty have had improvements in their voiding dysfunction postoperatively. To date, there have been three case reports in which correction of urinary incontinence (UI) following abdominoplasty has been described (Widgerow 1992, Mast 1999 & Guneren 1999). However no study has evaluated the influence of abdominoplasty on voiding dysfunction. This prospective study aimed to confirm the anecdotal reports, objectively substantiate the subjective improvements and attempt to explain why abdominoplasty may result in resolution of UI. Methodology:?? Twenty consecutive abdominoplasty patients were assessed by a standardised questionnaire pre and postoperatively. Pelvic floor measurements (resting tone & maximal strength) were also obtained. Procedures included either radical or sub-umbilical abdominoplasty. Results:?? The study involved 20 patients aged between 25 and 62?years. 14 were found to have stress urinary incontinence. Postoperatively 10 patients described improvement in their symptoms, 3 had no change, whilst 1 patient had worsening of her symptoms. 16 patients were found to have improved pelvic floor strength, 2 remained unchanged and 2 had reduced pelvic floor strength. Conclusion:?? Improvement in UI following abdominoplasty was clearly demonstrated. We suggest that this may be attributable to a better bladder neck and urethral angle position, as well as increased pelvic floor tone secondary to reflex contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. Patients reporting UI should be carefully assessed preoperatively. Aim for the future is to predict who simply requires an abdominoplasty to solve the problem and who requires a combined procedure with a urologist.

AB  - Background:?? While autologous breast reconstruction is frequently sought, donor sites providing versatility in volume with low donor site morbidity other than the abdominal wall are limited. Gluteal artery perforator flaps have been described in this role, however variations in individual vascular anatomy have resulted in the difficult planning of flaps, and particularly selection of whether superior or inferior gluteal artery perforators should be utilized. Methods:?? Five consecutive patients underwent a gluteal artery perforator flap for breast reconstruction. Preoperative imaging of the gluteal artery vasculature was undertaken with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Both superior and inferior gluteal artery perforators were mapped on imaging, and the dominant system selected preoperatively. The anatomical basis, operative technique and outcomes are discussed. Results:?? In all cases, CTA was able to demonstrate individual vascular anatomy, and select the optimal perforators supplying the gluteal integument. Either a superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) or inferior gluteal artery perforator (IGAP) flap was planned, and undertaken successfully in each case. There was a 100% flap survival, with low donor site morbidity. Conclusion:?? With the use of preoperative planning, selection of either an SGAP or IGAP flap can be reliably made based on individual vascular anatomy. With low donor site morbidity and good aesthetic outcomes, gluteal artery perforator flaps are a good option in cases where the abdominal wall is not appropriate.

AB  - Purpose:?? To (1) assess the accuracy with which acute plastic surgical caseload is predicted; (2) identify key factors which influence operating times; and (3) determine whether services are delivered in a timely manner. Methodology:?? Data was collected prospectively for 200 patients presenting acutely to the Auckland Regional Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery Unit between 26 November and 22 December 2008. Recorded variables included procedure type, predicted and actual theatre time, level of surgeon and anaesthetist experience and triage category. Results:?? Of the 200 patients enrolled in the study, 9 were excluded due to incomplete data. Average time spent in the operating theatre was 81?minutes. This was over-estimated on the pre-operative booking form by 17% (R = 0.65, p < 0.001). The intra-operative time was significantly longer when the procedure was performed by a consultant surgeon compared to a trainee (mean = 115?min versus 76?min, p < 0.001) or when regional anaesthesia was used (median = 116?min versus 72?min, p = 0.02). Intra-operative time was not affected by anaesthetist seniority (p = 0.18). The procedure was correctly identified on the pre-operative booking form in 75% of cases. Only 59% of cases were performed within their allotted triage time. Conclusion:?? Acute Plastic Surgical Services were not delivered in a timely manner for a significant number of patients. This occurred despite a consistent over-estimation of theatre time requirements. Methods for improving service efficiency need to be investigated, with a view to reducing the social and economic cost of delays.

AB  - Purpose:?? Orbital floor blow out fractures can produce diplopia and enophthalmos that require correction by reconstituting the orbital floor defect with implants. The type of implant used has evolved from bone to various synthetic materials. The choice of implant depends upon surgeon, the institution and experience. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the evidence for the implants available for orbital floor reconstitution. Methodology:?? This study is a literature review of the available evidence for use of implants in orbital floor reconstruction. An evidence based medicine, Cochrane database and Medline search was performed specifically at articles dealing with orbital floor fractures and the type of implant used. The outcomes included diplopia, enophthalmos, re-operation, infection and imaging. Results:?? There were a total of 19 articles specifically looking at orbital floor fractures and type of implant. Only two of which were comparative trials comparing bone with biodegradable mesh and titanium (Al-Sukhun and Lindqvist 2006 and Ellis and Tan 2003, respectively). These studies suggested not using bone due to operative duration and bone resorption seen on scanning. The remaining articles were case series on outcomes of specifically used implants such as titanium, bone, silicone, and polyethylene. These articles demonstrated that either of the implants is safe and effective to use in orbital floor fractures with the exception of silicone where Laxenaire et al., (1997) demonstrated a 20% extrusion rate. Conclusions:?? It is safe to use either bone autograft or the various available synthetic materials such as titanium or polyethylene in orbital floor reconstitution.

AB  - Aims:?? The mainstay treatment for problematic proliferating haemangioma is pharmacologic with high dose steroid being the first line treatment. A dramatic response occurs in 30% of cases, equivocal in 40% and continued growth is observed in the remainder cases. Steroid therapy is associated with significant side effects. We report our experience in treating proliferating haemangioma with Propranolol, discovered serendipitously by Léauté-Labràze et al recently. Methodology:?? A 9-week old boy was referred with a steroid-resistant proliferating haemangioma involving the upper lip and nose causing feeding and breathing difficulties. The patient was commenced on Propranolol at 0.5?mg/kg twice daily for 24?hours increasing to 1?mg/kg twice daily. The treatment was administered as an inpatient with 4-hourly heart rate and blood pressure and postprandial (30?minutes) blood glucose level monitoring, for the first 48?hours. The second patient was a 3-month old boy with a similar rapidly proliferating lesion on the upper lip and nose. He was commenced on similar Propranolol regimen. Both patients were maintained on the original total daily dose of Propranolol. Results:?? In both cases rapid reduction of the size and softening of the lesion was noted within 48?hours of treatment with on going accelerated regression observed during the follow-up period of 4 and 2?months respectively. No cardiovascular or metabolic side effects were observed in both patients. Conclusion:?? Accelerated regression is observed in 2 infants with problematic haemangioma following Propranolol therapy with no observed side effect. The possible mechanism of action of beta-blocker on cell proliferation is discussed.

AB  - Purpose:?? To demonstrate chronological changes of spring expansion in the treatment of scaphocephaly and brachycephaly. Spring-assisted cranioplasty has become the first-line treatment option for patients less than one year-old with scaphocephaly and in some cases with brachycephaly. The speed of spring expansion and its in-situ expansile behaviour has not been previously demonstrated in humans. Methodology:?? From January 2008 to December 2008, five patients underwent spring-assisted Cranioplasty (4 scaphocephaly, 1 brachycephaly). The cephalic index, head circumference was measured chronologically until 3-month postoperatively. Postoperative intracranial volume was calculated in one centre with post-spring removal head CT. Prospective review of patient's operative time and blood loss, hospital time, changes in cephalic index (CI) and intracranial volume. Results:?? The average age of the patients were 5.2?months, operative time was averaged 70?minutes, operative blood loss was less than 50?ml, however three of five cases required blood transfusion day 1 postoperatively. Average hospital stay was 3?days, the preoperative CI was 70% for scaphocephalic patients and 83% for the brachycephalic patient. The 3-month postoperative CI was 76% and 79%, respectively, the changes in intracranial volume was 356?ml. Conclusion:?? 30% of its total expansion occurs during the operation. The remaining spring's expansion capacity takes place in the first postoperative month as the skull lengthening occurs. Spring-assisted cranioplasty is useful in increasing intracranial volume in patients with craniocerebral disproportion and high risk of developing increased intracranial pressure.

AB  - Purpose:?? Currently there are no standards for testing efficacy of medical device cleaners. With fears of prion transmission, reliable protein on medical devices needs to be minimised. Aim:?? To develop a reliable test to detect efficacy of biofilm removal which can be used as an industry standard. Methodology:?? A bioreactor model was used to grow a characterised Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain on Teflon coupons. The coupons were subjected to various cleaners. Residual biofilm was detected by either a crystal violet assay (CV) or protein assay (PA). The % reduction of biofilm was compared to controls including analysis of variance and student t-tests. Each experiment was repeated three times. Inter and intra-experimental comparisons were made. Visual confirmation of the results was by confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Results:?? NaOH 1% 40C for 30?min: CV 87.3% ± 5.4, PA 92.0% ± 2.3; NaOH 0.01N 70C for 5?min: PA 28.4% ± 2.7; Tween20 40C for 30?min: CV 25.1 ± 2.7, PA 14.5 ± 5.7 (not significant). Some representative commercial cleaners were tested. Matrix: CV 10.5% ± 3.7, PA 27.9% ± 3.0; RMEC 70500: CV 69.0% ± 4.5, PA 85.9% ± 2.9; Zen: PA 105.8% ± 1.5 (i.e. treatment coupons were cleaner than background coupons). All treatments were significant p < 0.05 except for Tween20, which was not consistently significant. There was no significant inter-experimental difference for % reduction. Conclusions:?? We have developed a reproducible method for testing efficacy of cleaning products against biofilm incorporating the use of crystal violet or protein assay to measure residual biofilm protein.

AB  - Background:?? Cadaveric research has widely influenced our understanding of clinical anatomy. However, while many soft-tissue structures remain quiescent after death, other tissues undergo structural and functional changes that may influence their use in predicting living anatomy. In particular, our understanding of vascular anatomy has been based upon cadaveric studies in which vascular tone and flow do not match the living situation. Methods:?? An angiographic analysis of the abdominal wall vasculature was performed using plain-film and computed tomography (CT) angiography in 60 cadaveric and 140 living (70 patients) hemi-abdominal walls The deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) and all of its perforating branches larger than 0.5?mm were analysed for number, calibre and location. Results:?? Both large, named vessels and small calibre vessels show marked differences between living anatomy and cadaveric specimens. The DIEA was of larger diameter (4.2?mm vs. 3.1?mm, p < 0.01) and had more detectable branches in the cadaveric specimens. Perforators were of greater calibre (diameter 1.5?mm vs. 0.8?mm, p < 0.01) and were more plentiful (16 vs. 6, p < 0.01) in cadaveric specimens. However, the location of individual vessels was similar. Conclusions:?? Cadaveric anatomy displays marked differences to in-vivo anatomy, with the absence of living vascular dynamics affecting vessel diameters in cadaveric specimens. Blood vessels are of greater measurable calibre in cadaveric specimens than in the living. Consequently, cadaveric anatomy should be interpreted with consideration of post-mortem changes, while living anatomical studies, particularly with the use of imaging technologies, should be embraced in anatomical research.

AB  - The main indication for free flap reconstruction in the head and neck is malignancy. As the world's population ages, we will be presented with more elderly patients with head and neck cancers requiring free flap reconstruction. However, the older population does have a significantly higher incidence of multisystem disease which can cause some concern when considering a potentially long and complex surgical procedure. Do these co-morbidities translate into actual risk regarding flap success and post-operative mortality? This presentation reviews our ten year experience with microvascular reconstruction in the elderly at Waikato Hospital, New Zealand. A synopsis of key considerations in improving success rates in this type of surgery will also be offered.
