AB  - Purpose:?? Perineal and posterior vaginal wall reconstruction following abdominoperineal and local cancer resection requires replacement of dead space and restoration of function. Ideal reconstructive options include those which avoid muscle sacrifice, do not interfere with colostomy formation, and avoid the use of irradiated tissue. Methodology:?? We present our experience with a new technique for perineal and vaginal reconstruction: superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP or IGAP) flaps. We describe the operative technique and outcome in 14 consecutive patients. Six cases were performed as primary reconstruction and 8 cases were delayed, with all receiving preoperative radiotherapy. Results:?? Immediate reconstructions underwent preoperative imaging with ultrasound only, while delayed reconstructions underwent preoperative CTA. Postoperatively, patients were ambulated immediately, with all bed rest and sitting performed on the contralateral buttock or side for 4?weeks. There were no flap failures or partial flap losses, and no postoperative hernias. Four patients developed early minor wound dehiscence that was resutured in three cases. Revisional surgery was performed for reduction of three bulky flaps. All female patients reported resumption of sexual intercourse following this procedure. Conclusion:?? Gluteal artery perforator flaps are good options for perineal reconstruction, avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with rectus abdominis or gluteus maximus muscle harvest.

AB  - There has been anecdotal evidence that patients undergoing abdominoplasty have had improvements in their voiding dysfunction postoperatively. To date, there have been three case reports in which correction of urinary incontinence (UI) following abdominoplasty has been described (Widgerow 1992, Mast 1999 & Guneren 1999). However no study has evaluated the influence of abdominoplasty on voiding dysfunction. This prospective study aimed to confirm the anecdotal reports, objectively substantiate the subjective improvements and attempt to explain why abdominoplasty may result in resolution of UI. Methodology:?? Twenty consecutive abdominoplasty patients were assessed by a standardised questionnaire pre and postoperatively. Pelvic floor measurements (resting tone & maximal strength) were also obtained. Procedures included either radical or sub-umbilical abdominoplasty. Results:?? The study involved 20 patients aged between 25 and 62?years. 14 were found to have stress urinary incontinence. Postoperatively 10 patients described improvement in their symptoms, 3 had no change, whilst 1 patient had worsening of her symptoms. 16 patients were found to have improved pelvic floor strength, 2 remained unchanged and 2 had reduced pelvic floor strength. Conclusion:?? Improvement in UI following abdominoplasty was clearly demonstrated. We suggest that this may be attributable to a better bladder neck and urethral angle position, as well as increased pelvic floor tone secondary to reflex contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. Patients reporting UI should be carefully assessed preoperatively. Aim for the future is to predict who simply requires an abdominoplasty to solve the problem and who requires a combined procedure with a urologist.

AB  - Background:?? While autologous breast reconstruction is frequently sought, donor sites providing versatility in volume with low donor site morbidity other than the abdominal wall are limited. Gluteal artery perforator flaps have been described in this role, however variations in individual vascular anatomy have resulted in the difficult planning of flaps, and particularly selection of whether superior or inferior gluteal artery perforators should be utilized. Methods:?? Five consecutive patients underwent a gluteal artery perforator flap for breast reconstruction. Preoperative imaging of the gluteal artery vasculature was undertaken with computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Both superior and inferior gluteal artery perforators were mapped on imaging, and the dominant system selected preoperatively. The anatomical basis, operative technique and outcomes are discussed. Results:?? In all cases, CTA was able to demonstrate individual vascular anatomy, and select the optimal perforators supplying the gluteal integument. Either a superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) or inferior gluteal artery perforator (IGAP) flap was planned, and undertaken successfully in each case. There was a 100% flap survival, with low donor site morbidity. Conclusion:?? With the use of preoperative planning, selection of either an SGAP or IGAP flap can be reliably made based on individual vascular anatomy. With low donor site morbidity and good aesthetic outcomes, gluteal artery perforator flaps are a good option in cases where the abdominal wall is not appropriate.

AB  - Purpose:?? To (1) assess the accuracy with which acute plastic surgical caseload is predicted; (2) identify key factors which influence operating times; and (3) determine whether services are delivered in a timely manner. Methodology:?? Data was collected prospectively for 200 patients presenting acutely to the Auckland Regional Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery Unit between 26 November and 22 December 2008. Recorded variables included procedure type, predicted and actual theatre time, level of surgeon and anaesthetist experience and triage category. Results:?? Of the 200 patients enrolled in the study, 9 were excluded due to incomplete data. Average time spent in the operating theatre was 81?minutes. This was over-estimated on the pre-operative booking form by 17% (R = 0.65, p < 0.001). The intra-operative time was significantly longer when the procedure was performed by a consultant surgeon compared to a trainee (mean = 115?min versus 76?min, p < 0.001) or when regional anaesthesia was used (median = 116?min versus 72?min, p = 0.02). Intra-operative time was not affected by anaesthetist seniority (p = 0.18). The procedure was correctly identified on the pre-operative booking form in 75% of cases. Only 59% of cases were performed within their allotted triage time. Conclusion:?? Acute Plastic Surgical Services were not delivered in a timely manner for a significant number of patients. This occurred despite a consistent over-estimation of theatre time requirements. Methods for improving service efficiency need to be investigated, with a view to reducing the social and economic cost of delays.

AB  - Purpose:?? Orbital floor blow out fractures can produce diplopia and enophthalmos that require correction by reconstituting the orbital floor defect with implants. The type of implant used has evolved from bone to various synthetic materials. The choice of implant depends upon surgeon, the institution and experience. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the evidence for the implants available for orbital floor reconstitution. Methodology:?? This study is a literature review of the available evidence for use of implants in orbital floor reconstruction. An evidence based medicine, Cochrane database and Medline search was performed specifically at articles dealing with orbital floor fractures and the type of implant used. The outcomes included diplopia, enophthalmos, re-operation, infection and imaging. Results:?? There were a total of 19 articles specifically looking at orbital floor fractures and type of implant. Only two of which were comparative trials comparing bone with biodegradable mesh and titanium (Al-Sukhun and Lindqvist 2006 and Ellis and Tan 2003, respectively). These studies suggested not using bone due to operative duration and bone resorption seen on scanning. The remaining articles were case series on outcomes of specifically used implants such as titanium, bone, silicone, and polyethylene. These articles demonstrated that either of the implants is safe and effective to use in orbital floor fractures with the exception of silicone where Laxenaire et al., (1997) demonstrated a 20% extrusion rate. Conclusions:?? It is safe to use either bone autograft or the various available synthetic materials such as titanium or polyethylene in orbital floor reconstitution.

AB  - Aims:?? The mainstay treatment for problematic proliferating haemangioma is pharmacologic with high dose steroid being the first line treatment. A dramatic response occurs in 30% of cases, equivocal in 40% and continued growth is observed in the remainder cases. Steroid therapy is associated with significant side effects. We report our experience in treating proliferating haemangioma with Propranolol, discovered serendipitously by Léauté-Labràze et al recently. Methodology:?? A 9-week old boy was referred with a steroid-resistant proliferating haemangioma involving the upper lip and nose causing feeding and breathing difficulties. The patient was commenced on Propranolol at 0.5?mg/kg twice daily for 24?hours increasing to 1?mg/kg twice daily. The treatment was administered as an inpatient with 4-hourly heart rate and blood pressure and postprandial (30?minutes) blood glucose level monitoring, for the first 48?hours. The second patient was a 3-month old boy with a similar rapidly proliferating lesion on the upper lip and nose. He was commenced on similar Propranolol regimen. Both patients were maintained on the original total daily dose of Propranolol. Results:?? In both cases rapid reduction of the size and softening of the lesion was noted within 48?hours of treatment with on going accelerated regression observed during the follow-up period of 4 and 2?months respectively. No cardiovascular or metabolic side effects were observed in both patients. Conclusion:?? Accelerated regression is observed in 2 infants with problematic haemangioma following Propranolol therapy with no observed side effect. The possible mechanism of action of beta-blocker on cell proliferation is discussed.

AB  - Aim:?? To identify the experience, expectations and accessibility of breast reduction and otoplasty for current trainees and how this compares to the experiences and expectations of current practising Plastic Surgeons. Methods:?? All New Zealand advanced Plastic Surgery trainees and vocationally registered Plastic Surgeons in New Zealand were emailed or posted a questionnaire regarding their experience performing otoplasty and breast reduction surgery. Trainee questionnaires were repeated at an interval of three years. Participants were asked to quantify the number of procedures trainees should perform to become proficient and their view as to whether conditions exist at present to achieve this. A review of the number of cases performed within the four Plastic Surgery units was also undertaken. Results and Conclusions:?? Training in Plastic Surgery has no quotas for any procedures as exists in other specialty programs. This means that with changes in waiting list pressures and health priorities there is no safeguarding of procedures for trainees or the community alike. The results of these questionnaires will be presented in an attempt to formalise current opinion on these important issues. The Plastic Surgery community has an obligation to provide a service to the community and also to train its future providers and hence has a responsibility to be actively involved in addressing these topical and important issues.

AB  - Background:?? The middle-third of the patellar tendon (PT) is well-established as a potential graft for cruciate ligament reconstruction, but there is little anatomical basis for its use. While studies on PT vascular anatomy have focussed on risk to tendon pedicles from surgical approaches and knee pathophysiology, the significance of its blood supply to grafting has not been adequately explored. This investigation explores both the intrinsic and extrinsic arterial anatomy of the PT, as relevant to the PT graft. Methods:?? Ten fresh cadaveric lower limbs underwent angiographic injection of the common femoral artery with radio-opaque lead oxide. Each tendon was carefully dissected, underwent plain radiography and subsequently schematically reconstructed. Results:?? The PT demonstrated a well-developed, consistent vascularity from three sources: antero-proximally, mainly by the inferior-lateral genicular artery; antero-distally via a choke-anastomotic arch between the anterior tibial recurrent and inferior medial genicular arteries; and posteriorly via the retro-patellar anastomotic arch in Hoffa's fat pad. Two patterns of pedicles formed this arch: inferior-lateral and descending genicular arteries (Type-I); superior-lateral, inferior-lateral and superior-medial genicular arteries (Type-II). Both types supplied the posterior PT, with vessels descending to its middle-third. Conclusion:?? The middle-third PT has a richer intrinsic vascularity, which may enhance its ingrowth as a graft, and supports its conventional use in cruciate ligament reconstruction. The pedicles supplying the PT are endangered during procedures where Hoffa's fat pad is removed including certain techniques of PT harvest and total knee arthroplasty.

AB  - The two World Wars left in their wake a generation of disfigured former soldiers- playing a key role in the evolution of both plastic and maxillofacial surgery during the first half of the 20th century. Sir Henry Simpson Newland and Sir Benjamin Rank are widely considered to be the talented surgeons who helped pioneer plastic and reconstructive surgery to ?combat? the horrifying wounds. Sir Henry Newland was a surgeon in the heroic tradition. As with many other surgeons, his skills were enhanced by World War I during which he did remarkable work in transforming battered faces. He served with the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt, Lemnos, Gallipoli and France, gaining experience of military surgery at Ypres and Passchendaele. He was lieutenant-colonel commanding the Australian section of Queen Mary Hospital, Sidcup, where pioneer work in plastic surgery was carried out. Reconstructive surgery of the skull and the face had its foundations at Sidcup. Sir Benjamin Rank's life was transformed as a young surgeon in uniform during World War 2. He was only 30 when he found himself heading a new maxillofacial and plastic surgery unit established to reconstruct the limbs, faces and bodies of wounded sailors, soldiers and airmen in Egypt. He spent time overseas and then returned to Australia in 1942 to set up the plastic and facio-maxillary unit at Heidelberg Military Hospital in Victoria. He spent much time overseas teaching and demonstrating his skills and was instrumental in the establishment of plastic surgery as a speciality in India for which he received the Commander of St Michael and St George.

AB  - Purpose:?? The nerve to masseter has long been used as a recipient to innervate free muscle flaps for facial nerve reconstruction in adults and children alike. This presentation demonstrates the effectiveness and utility of the masseter nerve to directly re-innervate the native muscles forming a natural smile in an elderly population. Methodology:?? Twelve patients aged 40 to 92?years underwent facial nerve resection for malignant disease. There were 11 immediate and one delayed reconstructions utilising the masseter nerve for reconstruction of the smile. The nerve to masseter was dissected and transposed to achieve a direct neurorrhaphy to the nerve to zygomaticus major without the necessity of a nerve graft. Results:?? The earliest movement of the commissure of the mouth was detected at 10?weeks postoperatively. All patients reviewed at 6?months showed dynamic movement and were graded cosmetically as either good or excellent. Conclusion:?? This is a fast, simple and reliable technique which achieves good cosmetic outcomes for facial reanimation in an elderly population and dispels the myth that dynamic reanimation of the smile is not achievable in patients over 50?years old.

AB  - Acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure is a known complication of patients undergoing burns resuscitation. It can progress rapidly in the absence of primary abdominal pathology, causing multiple organ dysfunction. This is known as secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Intravascular fluid replacement and decompressive laparotomy form the standard management practices for ACS. Despite these measures, survival rates of secondary ACS in burns patients remain extremely poor. The medical records of four severely burnt patients are reviewed. All four patients underwent decompressive laparotomy. Three patients had either vacuum-assisted closure therapy or a Silastic bowel bag inserted and temporary abdominal wound closure was gained using an absorbable synthetic mesh. There was one survivor. Early recognition and alternatives to standard therapy may result in possible decrease in mortality figures. However, the poor outcome may be intrinsic to the severe burn injuries rather than a reflection of current practices. Patients that survive open laparotomy face a new set of complications on road to recovery that are often ignored.

AB  - Purpose:?? The reported rates of incomplete excision of non-melanoma skin cancers varies widely (5?25%) among published literature. This study aims to compare the rate of incomplete excision of non-melanoma skin cancers performed by a plastic surgeon, skin cancer clinic and general surgery department in Toowoomba, Queensland. It also evaluates factors that affect the rate of incomplete excision. Methodology:?? Consecutive primary excisions of non-melanoma skin cancers were analysed for a six month period between 1 January 2008 and 30 June 2008 for three separate groups: plastic surgeon, skin cancer clinic and the general surgery department. The variables studied were age and gender of patients, histology, tumour site and size, adequacy of excision and method of repair. Results:?? A total of 663 skin cancers were excised between the three groups consisting of 392 basal cell carcinomas and 271 squamous cell carcinomas. The incomplete excision rates for the three groups were: plastic surgeon (6.1%), skin cancer clinic (5.2%) and general surgery department (12.9%). The incomplete excision rate between the general surgery department and other two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.03). Conclusions:?? Although the rate of incomplete excision was higher in the general surgery department, all three groups compare favourably with reported figures in the literature. Given that Queensland has one of the highest incidences of skin cancer in the world, the disparity between the groups could be examined further, with consideration given to the complexity of excisions being performed in the hospital setting.

Case Report:?? An eight year old boy was referred with a six month history of nodular mass in the right palm. On examination, there was a 7?mm mid-palmar mass adherent to the overlying skin. Finger range of movement was preserved. Surgical excision was performed and histology confirmed palmar fibromatosis. Post-operative course was unremarkable. Methodology:?? Six cases of histologically proven Dupuytren's Disease have been reported world-wide in children under ten years of age. Publishing clinicians were contacted to obtain current data for these patients. Results:?? The mean age at presentation was 4.8?years in the above group (range = 6?months to 9?years). Most commonly involved sites were the palm or little finger. Fixed flexion deformities were present at the proximal interphalangeal joint in 66% and the distal interphalangeal joint in 16%. All cases were treated surgically. Follow-up data revealed three recurrences in one patient over a 5?year period. No other recurrences were reported with follow-up ranging from 18?months to 5?years. Conclusion:?? Although this paper collates the most complete data to date, information is still limited owing to the rarity of paediatric disease. Long-term outcomes remain to be seen as these patients progress through to adulthood.

AB  - Purpose:?? We have recently shown mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from haemangioma stained strongly for OPG. Vimentin immunoreactivity (IR) is an established marker for immature cells of mesenchymal origin. This study characterises haemangioma biopsies at different phases of progression to identify the presence of progenitor cells. Methods:?? Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin sections of haemangioma at different phases of progression for vimentin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), von Willebrand factor and glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1). Results:?? Positive staining for OPG and vimentin was observed on progenitor cells in the proliferating and early involuting phases of haemangioma. Strong Glut-1 staining of mature capillaries of the involuted phase was inversely related to the degree of OPG and vimentin IR. Positive vimentin staining of cells in the interstitium of involuted heamangioma and weak vimentin IR of blood vessels was found suggesting that these vimentin-positive cells may be MSCs that eventually differentiate into adipocytes that characterise involuted lesions. OPG IR diminished as haemangioma involuted, with little staining seen in involuted lesions. Conclusions:?? OPG and vimentin IR are early progenitor cell markers that stain immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma. In involuted haemangioma OPG IR is scant whereas vimentin-positive cells are present in the interstitium. This finding supports our hypothesis that OPG IR is a marker for progenitor cells present in immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma that is lost as the lesions involute.

AB  - Introduction:?? Leg defects are a real burden as regards to both, morbidity and hospital stay for the patients. Flaps based on the superficial sural system are good options and would substitute complex free flaps. Methodology:?? The study was undertaken over a period of 1?yr (May2007?Apr2008).We studied 17 patients with defects resulting after excision of SCCs, melanomas etc form the age group of 28?70?yrs. They were reconstructed with a proximally or a distally based sural artery flap. The right/left leg ratio was 1:0.7. Results:?? There was no flap loss and the average hospital stay was 8?days. (6?14?days) The average operative time was 2?hrs 20?min (1.5?3?hrs).Minor complications occurred in 2 patients. Conclusions:?? Sural artery flaps are reliable and can be safely used for variety of defects ranging from knee to the foot. They have a very low risk of complications and are easy and quick to do.

AB  - Introduction:?? S epidermidis is a recognised major biofilm pathogen and has been implicated in medical device contamination ranging from artificial hip prostheses to breast implants. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a known pathogen in chronic wounds. Within biofilms, bacteria are enclosed in a polymeric matrix or EPS which cements the bacteria to each other and to the surface. Biofilms act to protect the bacteria from the environment increasing resistance to host immunity, antibiotics and biocides. More recently, we have shown that biofilm occurs on the surface of chronic wounds and that this may have aetiological implications. Method:?? Staph spp and pseudomonas spp biofilm were grown on glass coupons using the CDC biofilm reactor for 48?hrs and the coupons randomly inserted into the wound model and for 24?hrs subjected to: 1 No instillation plus TNP 2 0.1% w/v formulated hypocholorous acid instillation plus TNP 3 Saline instillation (no biocide) plus TNP 4 Betadine instillation plus TNP Betadine and saline instillations were for 30?minutes every 8, 4 and 2?hours per day in separate experiments. NVC instillation was for 3?minutes, every 8, 4 and 2?hours per day in separate experiments. Following treatment, the coupons were carefully extracted to avoid damaging the biofilms. The effect of TNP on the biofilms was then assessed by colony forming units and electron microscopy. Results:?? The results show that lower frequency of instillation did not have significant effect on bacterial load for both types of bacteria. Increase in frequency of instillations resulted in no growth of pseudomonas while increase in frequency of instillations resulted in a significant decrease in staph spp.
