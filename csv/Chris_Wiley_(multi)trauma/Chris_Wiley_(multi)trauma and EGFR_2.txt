AB  - Glioblastomas frequently carry mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene on 10q23.3. The tumor suppressor properties of Pten are closely related to its inhibitory effect on the phosphatidyl-inositol-3?-kinase (Pi3k)-dependent activation of protein kinase B (Akt) signalling. Here, we report on the analysis of 17 genes related to the Pi3k/Akt signalling pathway for genetic alteration and aberrant expression in a series of 103 glioblastomas. Mutation, homozygous deletion or loss of expression of PTEN was detected in 32% of the tumors. In contrast, we did not find any aberrations in the inositol polyphosphate phosphatase like-1 gene (INPPL1), whose gene product may also counteract Pi3k-dependent Akt activation. Analysis of genes encoding proteins that may activate the pathway upstream of Pi3k revealed variable fractions of tumors with EGFR amplification (31%), PDGFRA amplification (8%), and IRS2 amplification (2%). The protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2/FAK1) gene was neither amplified nor over-expressed at the mRNA level. Investigation of three genes encoding catalytic subunits of Pi3k (PIK3CA, PIK3CD, and PIK3C2B) revealed amplification of PIK3C2B (1q32) in 6 tumors (6%). Overexpression of PIK3C2B mRNA was detected in 4 of these cases. PIK3CD (1p36.2) and PIK3CA (3q26.3) were not amplified but PIK3CD mRNA was overexpressed in 6 tumors (6%). Amplification and overexpression of AKT1 was detected in a single case of gliosarcoma. The IRS1, PIK3R1, PIK3R2, AKT2, AKT3, FRAP1, and RPS6KB1 genes were neither amplified nor overexpressed in any of the tumors. Taken together, our data indicate that different genes related to the Pi3k/Akt signalling pathway may be aberrant in glioblastomas.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently encountered in hospitalized patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. AKI and CKD are important risk factors for hypoglycemia, if these patients are treated with sulfonylureas and/or insulin. Common reasons include decreased insulin clearance, reduced gluconeogenesis, gastroparesis, hypoglycemic unawareness, and decreased food intake due to poor appetite or lack of timely access to food. Current guidelines generally recommend avoiding certain non-insulin agents in the inpatient setting, and using intravenous insulin (± subcutaneous [SC] basal insulin); or SC basal insulin (± nutritional/correction insulin). Patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency are known to have decreased insulin requirements and a specific approach for insulin dosing in this population of hospitalized patients is needed to minimize the incidence of hypoglycemia. In addition, knowledge of which non-insulin glucose-lowering agents can be used safely and effectively for this population in the in-hospital setting is also considered.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of sepsis, a pro-inflammatory state that alters tubular handling of filtered albumin. We hypothesized that dipstick albuminuria (DA) is associated with a lower rate of AKI recovery in septic patients. Methods This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study of adults with sepsis-associated AKI in an urban academic intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with unknown baseline serum creatinine (SCr), absent urinalysis, and those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min per 1.73m2 or receiving chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. The independent variable was DA (negative or trace, 30 mg/dL, and ≥100 mg/dL) within the first 72 h of ICU stay. The outcome variable was AKI recovery at 30 days following hospital discharge, defined as the last SCr returning to a level less than 1.5 times the baseline SCr level and independence of RRT. Results A total of 988 patients were included in the study. The median length of hospitalization was 11 days. The patients with higher degree of DA had worse critical illness scores. After adjustment for several confounders, DA ≥30 mg/dL was independently associated with ?no AKI recovery? at 30 days post-discharge (adjusted OR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.01?1.95 for DA =30 mg/dL and 1.67, 1.15?2.42 for DA ≥100 mg/dL, P =?0.02). Other independent predictors of ?no AKI recovery? were cumulative fluid balance, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, exposure to diuretics, and the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusion Dipstick albuminuria ≥30 mg/dL is independently associated with lower rate of AKI recovery at 30 days post-discharge. Our findings emphasize the potential utility of a simple routine test of DA in the risk-stratification of AKI recovery in ICU septic patients.

AB  - Summary Persons with diabetes require surgical procedures at a higher rate and have longer hospital stays than those without diabetes. Approximately 5% of persons with diabetes will require emergency surgery over their lifetime. The actual perioperative glycemic treatment recommendations for a given patient should be individualized, based on factors such as current glycemic control, type of diabetes, nature and extent of surgical procedure, and antecedent diabetes therapy. The management goal is to optimize metabolic control through close monitoring, adequate fluid and caloric repletion, and judicious use of insulin. Other endocrine and metabolic derangements (e.g., adrenal insufficiency; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism; carcinoid crisis; hyponatremia; and hypercalcemia) are also common in the emergency perioperative setting and warrant prompt review and management.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Recipients with failing kidney transplants (RFKTs) may receive sub-optimal care compared with patients with native kidney disease. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of RFKTs managed in a dedicated low clearance transplant clinic (LCTC) compared with those attending a general transplant clinic. Methods We undertook a retrospective analysis of patients with failing kidney transplants comparing two clinics?a LCTC versus a general transplant clinic. Kidney transplant recipients with an eGFR?<?20?ml/min were included. A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken of all patients with two consecutive follow-up visits between the dates of January and July 2016 in either clinic, with follow-up to event or December 2017. Results Data were analysed for 141 kidney transplant recipients; 60 in the LCTC and 81 in the general transplant clinic. More patients in the LCTC cohort were non-white and early transplant recipients. A significantly greater proportion of LCTC versus general transplant patients had received documented discussions regarding their hepatitis vaccine status (63.3% vs. 17.3%, p?<?0.001), counselled regarding dialysis modality (98.3% vs. 55.6%, p?<?0.001) and had documented decision regarding re-transplantation (80.0% vs. 58.0%, p?=?0.006). No difference was noted in the comparison of any clinical or biochemical parameters. More patients seen in the LCTC lost their kidney allograft (HR: 2.09, 95%CI: 1.17?3.72, p?=?0.013) but patient survival was equivalent (p?=?0.343). Conclusion Our data suggest the management of RFKTs within LCTCs can focus attention on renal replacement therapy planning and counselling, but further work is warranted to investigate for any benefit in hard outcomes such as survival.

AB  - Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic renal disease in adults, affecting one in every 1000 Australians. It is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 , which encode the proteins, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 respectively. The disease hallmark is the development of hundreds of microscopic fluid-filled cysts in the kidney during early childhood, which grow exponentially and continuously through life at varying rates (between 2% and 10% per year), causing loss of normal renal tissue and up to a 50% lifetime risk of dialysis-dependent kidney failure. Other systemic complications include hypertensive cardiac disease, hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysms, diverticular disease and hernias. Over the last two decades, advances in the genetics and pathogenesis of this disease have led to novel treatments that reduce the rate of renal cyst growth and may potentially delay the onset of kidney failure. New evidence indicates that conventional therapies (such as angiotensin inhibitors and statins) have mild attenuating effects on renal cyst growth and that systemic levels of vasopressin are critical for promoting renal cyst growth in the postnatal period. Identifying and integrating patient-centred perspectives in clinical trials is also being advocated. This review will provide an update on recent advances in the clinical management of ADPKD.

AB  - Abstract Many positive trends in kidney transplantation were notable in 2017. Deceased donor kidney transplant rates and counts continued to rise, the kidney transplant waiting list declined for the third year in a row after decades of growth, and both short- and long-term allograft survival continued to improve year over year. In total, more than 220,000 patients were living in the United States with a functioning allograft. With 3 years of data available since implementation of the new kidney allocation system, better prediction of longer-term results of the allocation policy changes became possible. The data also reveal several areas in need of improvement and attention. Overall, the challenge of providing adequate access to kidney transplant persisted nationally, with additional dramatic regional variation. The proportion of living donor kidney transplants in both adults and children continued to fall, and racial disparities in living donor kidney transplant grew in the past decade.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.

AB  - Aims Type 1 diabetes can be complicated with neuropathy that involves immune-mediated and inflammatory pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, have shown anti-inflammatory properties, and thus we hypothesized that long-term treatment with liraglutide induced diminished inflammation and thus improved neuronal function. Methods The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Titration was 6 weeks to 1.2?1.8 mg/d, continuing for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in latency of early brain evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints were changes in proinflammatory cytokines, cortical evoked potential, autonomic function and peripheral neurophysiological testing. Results Thirty-nine patients completed the study, of whom 19 received liraglutide. In comparison to placebo, liraglutide reduced interleukin-6 (?22.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?38.1, ?3.2; P = .025) with concomitant numerical reductions in other proinflammatory cytokines. However neuronal function was unaltered at the central, autonomic or peripheral level. Treatment was associated with ?3.38 kg (95% CI: ?5.29, ?1.48; P < .001] weight loss and a decrease in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (?40.2%; 95% CI: ?60.6, ?9.5; P = .02). Conclusion Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Kidney transplant provides significant survival, cost, and quality-of-life benefits over dialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease, but the number of kidney transplant candidates on the waiting list continues to grow annually. By the end of 2014, nearly 100,000 adult candidates and 1500 pediatric candidates were waiting for kidney transplant. Not surprisingly, waiting times also continued to increase, along with the number of adult candidates removed from the list due to death or deteriorating medical condition. Death censored graft survival has increased after both living and deceased donor transplants over the past decade in adult recipients. The majority of the trends seen over the past 5 years continued in 2014. However, the new allocation system was implemented in late 2014, providing an opportunity to assess changes in these trends in the coming years.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? This study explored decision-making experiences of patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease when opting for conservative management of their renal failure. Background.? Dialysis is an invasive treatment, and for some older patients, there is an associated treatment burden of dialysis-related symptoms. An alternative choice is conservative management, but little is known about those who make this decision and how they are supported through the process. Design.? Qualitative practitioner research study. Method.? Data were generated from nine patients? naturally occurring clinic consultations with a renal clinical nurse specialist between May 2010 ? July 2010. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and findings fed back at three multi-disciplinary meetings to check for relevance and resonance. Common themes were identified and codes applied. Results.? Patients reported age and having to travel three times a week to hospital for dialysis as reasons not to opt for treatment. Others felt well without dialysis not wanting to upset the ?status quo? or to burden loved ones. Most felt equipped to make the decision following explanation and discussion with the clinical nurse specialist in the renal clinic. Conclusions.? Patients opting for conservative management give numerous reasons for this including old age, travel limitations, feeling well without dialysis and not wanting to be a burden, but appear content with their decision. One-to-one discussions with the clinical nurse specialist appear helpful during the decision-making process presenting an opportunity for advancing nursing roles in the chronic kidney disease service. Relevance to clinical practice.? Understanding patients? reasons for refusing dialysis assists in supporting until death. There is an opportunity for developing nursing practice to meet the multi-faceted needs of this group.

AB  - Aim:?? The aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of Mandibular fractures in the indigenous Australians and define any commonly occurring patterns. Patients and Methods:?? A retrospective series of 485 patients with Mandibular fractures admitted to the maxillofacial unit during the period January 1999 to June 2003 were analysed. Demographic data on patient's age, sex, aetiology, alcohol consumption at the time of injury, urban/rural status were recorded and assessed. Results:?? The epidemiology of an unselected series of Mandibular fractures is defined in this study. The overall incidence of Mandibular fractures was 54.5 cases per 100,000 populations per year. The incidence in indigenous Australians was 155 cases per 100,000 populations per year (2nd highest in the world). 72% of the patients were Aboriginal. 72% of the patients were male and 28% female. 90% of the females were indigenous. Most fractures were caused by assault (82.5%). 92% of the aboriginal women with mandibular fractures were assaulted. 69.9% of the patients were under the influence of alcohol at the time of injury. 6.18% of patients in this series had a recurrent mandibular fracture. In 5% of the patients the presenting symptom was an abscess from the mandibular fracture. Conclusions:?? The incidence and causes of mandibular fractures reflect trauma patterns (assaults and domestic violence) with in the aboriginal community in Northern Territory. Strategies to identify risk factors linked to Assaults and Domestic Violence and to help families to reduce the incidence of violence and alcoholism are integral to addressing this problem.

AB  - Abstract In a phase 2 multi-center open label randomized trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) recipients were randomized to a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based immunosuppressive regimen (tacrolimus) (n=21) or an investigational arm using low-dose CNI plus co-stimulation blockade (belatacept) with intended CNI withdrawal (n=22). Both arms included induction therapy with rabbit ATG, mycophenolate sodium or mycophenolate mofetil, and rapid withdrawal of steroids. Enrollment and CNI withdrawal were stopped after 43/60 planned subjects had been enrolled. At that time the rate of biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR) of the pancreas was low in both groups until CNI was withdrawn, with four of the five pancreas rejections occurring during or after CNI withdrawal. The rate of BPAR of kidney allografts was low in both control (9.5%) and investigational (9.1%) arms. Pancreas graft survival at 52 weeks, defined by insulin independence, was 21 (100%) in the control group and 19 (86%) in the investigational arm. One subject in the investigational arm died with functioning pancreas and kidney grafts. Renal function at week 52 was similar in both arms. Costimulation blockade with belatacept did not provide sufficient immunosuppression to reliably prevent pancreas rejection in SPK transplants undergoing CNI withdrawal.

AB  - Abstract Background? Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the repair and regeneration of the endothelium and may represent a novel cardiovascular risk factor. South Asian subjects have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which is not fully explained by known risk factors. This study examined associations of EPCs with atherosclerosis and possible ethnic differences in EPCs. Materials and methods? A population sample of 58 European and South Asian adult men was enriched with the recruitment of an additional 59 European and South Asian men with known coronary disease. The coronary artery calcification score was measured by multi-slice computerized tomography (CT), carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT), and femoral plaques were measured by ultrasound. The subjects were further subdivided into three categories of coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary artery calcification score and clinical history. Total EPCs and non-senescent EPCs (ns-EPCs) were quantified after 5 days cell culture and the number of late outgrowth colonies was measured over a 6-week test period. Circulating CD34+ haematopoietic precursor cells were measured by flow cytometry. Results? Individuals with femoral plaques had reduced total and ns-EPCs. The number of ns-EPCs were reduced in individuals with the most coronary atheroma and were inversely related to the coronary calcification score and femoral IMT. These relationships persisted after multivariate adjustment for other risk factors. The numbers of late outgrowth colonies or circulating CD34+ cells were unrelated to the presence of atherosclerosis. There were no differences in the number of EPCs between European and South Asian subjects. Conclusion? The number of EPCs are reduced in subjects with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors. Reduction in EPC numbers may be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis but does not explain ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.
