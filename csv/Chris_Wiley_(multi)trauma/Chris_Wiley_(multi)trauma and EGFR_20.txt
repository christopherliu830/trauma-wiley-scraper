AB  - Background:?? Autologous reconstruction with the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) perforator (DIEP) flap is increasingly utilized for breast reconstruction. However, situations arise in which the DIEP flap is not an appropriate option, including the presence of a midline abdominal scar or an inadequate volume of abdominal tissue. While other donor sites may be considered, the stacked DIEP flap, in which the perforators of both hemi-abdominal walls are utilized in a single vascular pedicle, provides a safe technique to utilize the integument of both hemi-abdominal walls. Methods:?? Five consecutive patients underwent a stacked DIEP flap for breast reconstruction. Preoperative imaging with computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of the abdominal wall was undertaken, with each DIEA, its branching pattern, and all musculocutaneous perforating branches mapped using three-dimensional software reconstructions. The anatomical basis, operative technique and outcomes are discussed. Results:?? In all cases, CTA was able to demonstrate individual vascular anatomy, and guide planning for a stacked DIEP flap. Unique anatomy between individuals required a range of variations in flap anatomy, with the contralateral DIEA, SIEA, or perforators each used to perfuse the contralateral hemi-abdominal wall. There was a 100% flap survival, with no donor site morbidity reported. Conclusion:?? The stacked DIEP flap is a safe and reliable technique for augmenting the perfusion of the abdominal wall in cases where the single pedicle DIEP flap is limited. The anatomical basis of the flap can be planned preoperatively with CTA, facilitating faster operating times and good outcomes.

AB  - Aim:?? To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intralesional and systemic steroid therapy in treating problematic proliferating haemangioma. Methods:?? 233 patients with haemangioma were culled from our vascular anomalies database. Indications for treatment, treatment regime, response, side effects and the need for other treatment were recorded. Intralesional Triamcinolone up to 4?mg/kg/injection was preferred for small, localised lesions and oral Prednisolone 2?2.5?mg/kg/day was used for larger lesions, especially around the periorbital region. The mean follow-up was 29.7?months. Results:?? 46(36%) of the 129 patients with proliferating haemangioma required active treatment with 24 receiving steroid therapy. 5 patients received intralesional steroid with 4 needing 2 injections and 2 requiring other treatment modality. All but 1 lesion underwent accelerated regression with no complications. 19 patients received Prednisolone at a mean age of 10 (range, 4?29) weeks. Dramatic response in 10 (53%), stabilisation in 5 (26%) and continued growth occurred in 4 (21%) patients, 3 of whom required debulking surgery. Rebound growth occurred in 9 patients during dose tapering, requiring reintroduction of high dose steroid in 6. Vision dysfunction resolved completely in all affected patients. 3 patients developed growth retardation during treatment but this normalised 3?10?months following cessation of steroid therapy. No other major complications were noted. Conclusion:?? Intralesional and systemic steroid are relatively safe and effective in treating problematic proliferating haemangioma. Systemic steroid therapy is associated with few short-term side effects, hence a multidisciplinary management is essential.

AB  - Introduction:?? Large defects of the lower trunk after cancer resections pose a challenge for a reconstructive surgeon. Pedicled flaps based on the deep inferior epigastric artery provide a very simple but an effective way to cover them. Methodology:?? 9 patients from 24?58?yrs of age were studied at 2 hospitals over a period of 2?yr (2007&2008). Soft tissue defects after resections of SCCs, melanomas etc ranged from 6 ? 10?cm to 15 ? 28?cm. All were reconstructed with an inferiorly based Rectus abdominus flap. Results:?? Almost all the patients had excellent results with no total flap loss. The average operative time was 2.5?hrs. Had a partial flap loss in one case and the average hospital stay being 7?days. Conclusion:?? The rectus flap with skin is quite reliable and a simple option for such complex defects. It provides enough bulk and skin pliability needed in these areas and are pretty fast to learn and do.

AB  - The deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) provides a dependable option for use as an osteo-musculo-cutaneous flap, particularly in mandibular reconstruction. Modifications to flaps based on DCIA perforators have been sought in order to prevent donor site morbidity as a consequence of muscle cuff harvest. Previous studies have been inconsistent in their descriptions of perforator anatomy, and means of assessing these preoperatively have not been widely described. A clinical anatomical study was undertaken, with a cohort of 44 hemi-abdominal walls in 22 consecutive patients undergoing preoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) prior to free flap surgery. The feasibility of CTA and the regional vascular anatomy were both assessed. The use of CTA was shown to demonstrate DCIA perforators with high resolution and to be able to assess vessel size and location. In 44 hemi-abdominal walls, there were 44 perforators of >0.8?mm diameter. There were no suitable perforators in 40% of sides, with 32% of sides having 1 perforator >0.8?mm diameter, 16% having 2 perforators, <10% had 3 perforators, and only 1 side had over 4 perforators. Perforators emerged from the deep fascia on average 5.1?cm cranial and 3.9?cm posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). Of 44 perforators identified, 82% of perforators were located within a 4?cm by 4?cm area, 3?cm superior and 2?cm posterior to the ASIS. The current study has demonstrated the utility of preoperative CTA for identifying DCIA perforators, and for selecting patients who may be suitable for a DCIA perforator flap given the variable perforator anatomy.

AB  - Background:?? The Achilles tendon is the most frequently ruptured tendon in the lower limb and accounts for almost 20% of all large tendon injuries. Despite numerous published studies describing its blood supply, there has been no uniformity in describing its topography. The current study comprises a detailed anatomical study of both the intrinsic and extrinsic arterial supply of the Achilles tendon, providing the detail sought from studies calling for improved planning of surgical procedures where damage to the vascularity of the Achilles tendon is likely. Methods:?? A dissection, microdissection, histological and angiographic study was undertaken on 20 cadaveric lower limbs from 16 fresh and 4 embalmed cadavers. Results:?? The Achilles tendon is supplied by two arteries, the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries. Three vascular territories were identified, with the midsection supplied by the peroneal artery, and the proximal and distal sections supplied by the posterior tibial artery. The mid-section of the Achilles tendon was markedly more hypovascular that the rest of the tendon. Conclusion:?? The Achilles tendon is at highest risk of rupture and surgical complications at its midsection. Individuals with particularly poor supply of the mid-section may be at increased risk of tendon rupture, and approaches to the tendon operatively should consider the route of supply by the peroneal artery to this susceptible part of the tendon.

AB  - McCune-Albright Syndrome was first described in 1937. It is a rare condition with an estimated prevalence of between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 1,000,000 and occurs sporadically in all races. It is defined by at least two features of: fibrous dysplasia, café au lait pigmentation and autonomous endocrine hyperfunction. This case presentation is of a young woman with McCune-Albright Syndrome with severe cranio-facial involvement. We discuss our management of this difficult problem thus far with staged surgical procedures to obtain both functional and cosmetic benefits.

AB  - Acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure is a known complication of patients undergoing burns resuscitation. It can progress rapidly in the absence of primary abdominal pathology, causing multiple organ dysfunction. This is known as secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Intravascular fluid replacement and decompressive laparotomy form the standard management practices for ACS. Despite these measures, survival rates of secondary ACS in burns patients remain extremely poor. The medical records of four severely burnt patients are reviewed. All four patients underwent decompressive laparotomy. Three patients had either vacuum-assisted closure therapy or a Silastic bowel bag inserted and temporary abdominal wound closure was gained using an absorbable synthetic mesh. There was one survivor. Early recognition and alternatives to standard therapy may result in possible decrease in mortality figures. However, the poor outcome may be intrinsic to the severe burn injuries rather than a reflection of current practices. Patients that survive open laparotomy face a new set of complications on road to recovery that are often ignored.

AB  - Purpose:?? The reported rates of incomplete excision of non-melanoma skin cancers varies widely (5?25%) among published literature. This study aims to compare the rate of incomplete excision of non-melanoma skin cancers performed by a plastic surgeon, skin cancer clinic and general surgery department in Toowoomba, Queensland. It also evaluates factors that affect the rate of incomplete excision. Methodology:?? Consecutive primary excisions of non-melanoma skin cancers were analysed for a six month period between 1 January 2008 and 30 June 2008 for three separate groups: plastic surgeon, skin cancer clinic and the general surgery department. The variables studied were age and gender of patients, histology, tumour site and size, adequacy of excision and method of repair. Results:?? A total of 663 skin cancers were excised between the three groups consisting of 392 basal cell carcinomas and 271 squamous cell carcinomas. The incomplete excision rates for the three groups were: plastic surgeon (6.1%), skin cancer clinic (5.2%) and general surgery department (12.9%). The incomplete excision rate between the general surgery department and other two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.03). Conclusions:?? Although the rate of incomplete excision was higher in the general surgery department, all three groups compare favourably with reported figures in the literature. Given that Queensland has one of the highest incidences of skin cancer in the world, the disparity between the groups could be examined further, with consideration given to the complexity of excisions being performed in the hospital setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? This paper presents the first documented case of paediatric Dupuytren's Disease in Australasia and performs a clinical review of paediatric cases world-wide in children under ten years of age. Case Report:?? An eight year old boy was referred with a six month history of nodular mass in the right palm. On examination, there was a 7?mm mid-palmar mass adherent to the overlying skin. Finger range of movement was preserved. Surgical excision was performed and histology confirmed palmar fibromatosis. Post-operative course was unremarkable. Methodology:?? Six cases of histologically proven Dupuytren's Disease have been reported world-wide in children under ten years of age. Publishing clinicians were contacted to obtain current data for these patients. Results:?? The mean age at presentation was 4.8?years in the above group (range = 6?months to 9?years). Most commonly involved sites were the palm or little finger. Fixed flexion deformities were present at the proximal interphalangeal joint in 66% and the distal interphalangeal joint in 16%. All cases were treated surgically. Follow-up data revealed three recurrences in one patient over a 5?year period. No other recurrences were reported with follow-up ranging from 18?months to 5?years. Conclusion:?? Although this paper collates the most complete data to date, information is still limited owing to the rarity of paediatric disease. Long-term outcomes remain to be seen as these patients progress through to adulthood.

AB  - Purpose:?? We have recently shown mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from haemangioma stained strongly for OPG. Vimentin immunoreactivity (IR) is an established marker for immature cells of mesenchymal origin. This study characterises haemangioma biopsies at different phases of progression to identify the presence of progenitor cells. Methods:?? Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin sections of haemangioma at different phases of progression for vimentin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), von Willebrand factor and glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1). Results:?? Positive staining for OPG and vimentin was observed on progenitor cells in the proliferating and early involuting phases of haemangioma. Strong Glut-1 staining of mature capillaries of the involuted phase was inversely related to the degree of OPG and vimentin IR. Positive vimentin staining of cells in the interstitium of involuted heamangioma and weak vimentin IR of blood vessels was found suggesting that these vimentin-positive cells may be MSCs that eventually differentiate into adipocytes that characterise involuted lesions. OPG IR diminished as haemangioma involuted, with little staining seen in involuted lesions. Conclusions:?? OPG and vimentin IR are early progenitor cell markers that stain immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma. In involuted haemangioma OPG IR is scant whereas vimentin-positive cells are present in the interstitium. This finding supports our hypothesis that OPG IR is a marker for progenitor cells present in immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma that is lost as the lesions involute.

AB  - Introduction:?? Leg defects are a real burden as regards to both, morbidity and hospital stay for the patients. Flaps based on the superficial sural system are good options and would substitute complex free flaps. Methodology:?? The study was undertaken over a period of 1?yr (May2007?Apr2008).We studied 17 patients with defects resulting after excision of SCCs, melanomas etc form the age group of 28?70?yrs. They were reconstructed with a proximally or a distally based sural artery flap. The right/left leg ratio was 1:0.7. Results:?? There was no flap loss and the average hospital stay was 8?days. (6?14?days) The average operative time was 2?hrs 20?min (1.5?3?hrs).Minor complications occurred in 2 patients. Conclusions:?? Sural artery flaps are reliable and can be safely used for variety of defects ranging from knee to the foot. They have a very low risk of complications and are easy and quick to do.

AB  - Introduction:?? S epidermidis is a recognised major biofilm pathogen and has been implicated in medical device contamination ranging from artificial hip prostheses to breast implants. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a known pathogen in chronic wounds. Within biofilms, bacteria are enclosed in a polymeric matrix or EPS which cements the bacteria to each other and to the surface. Biofilms act to protect the bacteria from the environment increasing resistance to host immunity, antibiotics and biocides. More recently, we have shown that biofilm occurs on the surface of chronic wounds and that this may have aetiological implications. Method:?? Staph spp and pseudomonas spp biofilm were grown on glass coupons using the CDC biofilm reactor for 48?hrs and the coupons randomly inserted into the wound model and for 24?hrs subjected to: 1 No instillation plus TNP 2 0.1% w/v formulated hypocholorous acid instillation plus TNP 3 Saline instillation (no biocide) plus TNP 4 Betadine instillation plus TNP Betadine and saline instillations were for 30?minutes every 8, 4 and 2?hours per day in separate experiments. NVC instillation was for 3?minutes, every 8, 4 and 2?hours per day in separate experiments. Following treatment, the coupons were carefully extracted to avoid damaging the biofilms. The effect of TNP on the biofilms was then assessed by colony forming units and electron microscopy. Results:?? The results show that lower frequency of instillation did not have significant effect on bacterial load for both types of bacteria. Increase in frequency of instillations resulted in no growth of pseudomonas while increase in frequency of instillations resulted in a significant decrease in staph spp.
