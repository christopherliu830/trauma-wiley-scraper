AB  - A 35?year old man presented to clinic having lost the central two thirds of his left helix and lateral scapha following a human bite. A switch procedure using the root of the opposite helix and adjacent scaphoid cartilage was considered and performed secondarily. The right helix was harvested with a long pedicle length on the superficial temporal (ST) vessels. The vascular pedicle emerged posteriorly from the graft at its transferred site and was tunnelled under the ear to the preauricular ST vessels for anastomosis. Primary donor site defect was closed with a postauricular flap. Postoperatively leech therapy was commenced on day one for a total duration of 4?days. The patient was discharged and followed up in clinic with no complications. Ear reconstruction remains one of the most challenging aspects of reconstructive surgery. Here, we report of a novel alternative ear switch procedure for reconstruction of the helical rim.

AB  - Purpose:?? To review the clinical and histological differences between atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) and malignant fibrohistiocytoma (MFH). Methodology:?? Cases of MFH and AFX were identified and histologically reviewed from our non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) database 1996?2007 for the Central Region of New Zealand. Medline search and recent pathology textbooks were reviewed to determine current opinion and evidence for the diagnostic differentiation between AFX and MFH. Results:?? Of the 54,002 cases of NMSC, 103(0.2%) were histologically reported as AFX and 14(0.03%) MFH, with a mean age of 77 (range 51?93) and 74 (28?88) years respectively. The mean size of AFX was 16.3 (5?70) mm occurring on the head & neck (n = 97), limb (n = 3), trunk (n = 2). 15 (14.7%) lesions were incomplete excised. 12 (11.7%) cases developed local recurrence and 1 metastasis. The mean size of MFH was 20.9 (range 7?50) mm occurring on the head & neck (n = 10), trunk (n = 2), groin (n = 1) and limb (n = 1). 3 (21.4%) lesions were incompletely excised. 2(14.3%) patients developed local recurrence and 2 metastases. Local recurrence occurred in 12 (11.7%) cases of AFX and 2 (14.3%) cases of MFH. The literature states clinical and histological differences between AFX and MFH, but no immunohistochemical (IHC) stain reliably differentiates between them. Conclusion:?? Differentiating AFX from MFH based on histology and IHC is difficult and our cases did not conform to the typical presentation indicated in the literature. AFX and MFH are likely to belong to a spectrum of soft tissue sarcomas with variable aggressiveness.

AB  - Purpose:?? To show that ambulatory non-mechanical negative pressure dressing results in equivalent graft take and survival compared with commercially available mechanical vacuum dressings. Methodology:?? Twenty-four patients, both males and female, between 18 and 95?years of age in the Australian population requiring skin grafting of the lower limb from July 2008 were randomized consecutively into commercial vacuum assisted ambulatory dressing group, KCI Freedom VAC, [VAC] and non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressing group using 14 gauge drain [Belovac]. Patients were discharged on the same day of surgery and reviewed at 5 or 6?days post-operatively. Both groups were treated equally in all other facets of care. The dressings remained intact until outpatient review. A photo of the graft was taken upon removal of the dressing. Graft take/survival was measured from these photographs by an experienced plastic surgeon blinded to treatment group. Results:?? Graft take was found to be equivalent in both groups. All twelve patients in the VAC group were judged to have >95% graft take at five/six days post-op. In the Belovac group all twelve were judged to have >95% graft take at 5/6?days. The cost for VAC group was $AUD413.50/478.50 [5/6?days] compared to $AUD55.93 for the Belovac dressing group. Conclusion:?? We conclude that non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressings are equally effective as commercially available VAC dressings in for the treatment of lower limb skin grafts. We recommend that non-mechanical topical negative pressure dressing is an acceptable, cheap and safe alternative to commercially available dressings for day surgery patient.

AB  - Purpose:?? The Cook-Swartz Implantable Doppler has been used to provide continuous feedback on the vascular status of free flaps and has been reported to improve flap salvage. We review our experience of this device, its efficacy and suitability for ongoing use in free flap monitoring. Methodology:?? All patients who were monitored following free flap reconstruction using the Cook Swartz Implantable Doppler in two Hospitals in Christchurch, NZ were retrospectively reviewed from its first use in December 2006 to December 2008. Results:?? In total 43 probes were used on 23 flaps (4 buried, 7 intraoral) in 21 patients (range 17?83?yrs). The probes were placed on the artery in all cases and the vein in 21 cases. 21 (91.3%) flaps survived. 20 flaps had reliable Doppler signals. Overall there were 2 flap failures (8.7%) and these were not salvageable. There were no technical difficulties with application or removal of the probes and it was well received by junior medical/nursing staff. It provided peace of mind to surgeons performing free flap surgery outside the base hospital (6 cases). Conclusion:?? The implantable Doppler probe is a useful tool in monitoring free flaps where clinical evaluation is difficult especially when flaps are buried. Our current experience supports its ongoing use as a free flap monitoring tool at our institution.

AB  - Background:?? The lower abdominal wall provides ideal autogenous tissue for breast reconstruction. Pedicled TRAM flap is associated with significant flap complication rates and donor site morbidity especially in bilateral reconstruction. Free TRAM flap, muscle sparing free TRAM and DIEP flaps have been used to reduce abdominal wall weakness. Aim:?? To document abdominal wall function following breast reconstruction using pedicled TRAM, muscle sparing free TRAM, and DIEP flaps. Methods:?? Consecutive patients who underwent breast reconstruction with pedicled TRAM, muscle sparing free TRAM or DIEP flaps were culled from our prospective breast reconstruction database 2004?2007. Each reconstructive technique used was favoured exclusively by individual surgeons within our unit. Patient demographics, the type/timing of reconstruction, and flap and donor site complications were recorded. Abdominal wall function was assessed pre-operatively and at 6 and 12?months post-operatively using the Lacote evaluation test. DASH and patient questionnaires were administrated to assess the effect of surgery on daily activities and patient satisfaction. Results:?? s34 pedicled TRAM flaps were performed in 29 (24 unilateral, 5 bilateral) patients. There were 38 muscle sparing free TRAM flaps in 29 (20 unilateral, 9 bilateral) patients and 7 DIEP flaps in 7 patients. Abdominal wall function and complications will be presented.

AB  - Cosmetic tourism has been enjoying unprecedented public attention of late. Enticing New Zealanders with the promise of low cost, overseas travel and the advertised exotic adventure, its popularity grows steadily amongst consumers. We report four cases of complications that had arisen from cosmetic tourism presented to our unit within the last 18?months. With each case presentation, we aim to identify the pitfalls of such practice and thus reasons that lead to these devastating and costly complications for the consumers and health system. Finally, a literature review on the impacts and responses to cosmetic medical tourism from our region and other developed countries including the UK and the US will be presented. In summary, outsourcing health care in our current climate subject our patients to uncertain quality of care, which could seriously threaten their wellbeing. If legislation is to be proposed to limit agents in the advertising and purveyance of medical tourism in New Zealand, it is imperative that accurate account of the adverse events and cost to the taxpayer are recorded. The cost and challenge this global phenomenon poses to our practice warrant prompt study of its extent and impact to the New Zealand plastic surgical community.

AB  - Aim:?? To determine what transmissible resources are available to Plastic Surgery Registrars to provide advice and direction to Surgeons outside of the four New Zealand Regional Burn units needing to perform escharotomies on burn patients. To produce a simple transmissible resource to provide assistance for surgeons performing escharotomies outside of a plastic surgery centre. Methods:?? Regional Burn unit's in New Zealand were contacted via the on call Plastic Surgery registrar and asked to provide advice supported by diagrams in order to safely perform extremity and trunk escharotomy. Review of the available Burn, Plastic Surgery, General Surgery and Emergency Medicine text-books was also undertaken. Results:?? Readily transmissible guidelines are not currently in use and are not available in the majority of plastic surgery or burn text-books. Conclusions:?? Escharotomies will usually be performed in a Burn or Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Centre. At times however, these will need to be performed outside of these centres by Surgeons with little or no experience with the procedure, under the distant guidance of the receiving centre. This can safely be achieved, and with the use of appropriate instructions the comfort and effectiveness with which they are performed can be optimised. A concise single A4 sheet indicating locations, indications and precautions for escharotomy incisions is not currently in use. The adoption of this simple resource would be a valuable supplement to telephone consultation and guidance to safely perform this potentially life and limb saving procedure where delay in transfer necessitates its performance.

AB  - Patients on long-term aspirin and warfarin are not infrequently encountered in local anaesthetic cutaneous surgeries, which could potentially give rise to bleeding related problems post operatively. Encounters with a newer generation of antiplatelets, such as clopidogrel, may also become more prevalent with their use in cardiology and following endovascular procedures. While recommendations from studies in timing or even the need for preoperative discontinuation of aspirin in local anaesthetic procedures have been numerous, they continue to be questioned and the practices can vary significantly from surgeon to surgeon. The study is designed to retrospectively review peri-operative management for aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel in the local anaesthetic cutaneous surgical cases performed at Waikato Hospital Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit, and to gauge their impact on post-operative complications. Case records from the plastic surgery local anaesthetic operating unit and clinics between January and December 2008 are reviewed. Information on the management of long-term aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel are gathered along with other significant co-morbidities and coagulopathies, the type of surgical procedure, and significant complications necessitating further interventions in the hospital. We wish to report our experiences in Waikato Hospital on the management of aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel peri-operatively for local anaesthetic cutaneous procedures and their impact on complications with comparisons to findings in the available literatures.

AB  - Introduction:?? The closure of abdominal wall defect after tumour ablation can be a challenging problem. The component that requires reconstruction may only consist of skin or fascia; or it could consist of a combination of these. The pedicled tensor fascia lata flap is a useful option as it could be harvested as either a fascial or fasciocutaneous flap. When the size of the defect is significant, bilateral TFL flaps could be utilised. Methods and Results:?? To illustrate the flexibility provided by the pedicled TFL flap in abdominal wall reconstruction, two cases are presented in which the nature of abdominal wall defect were different. The first patient had a large fascial defect in the lower abdominal wall and bilateral pedicled TFL fascial flaps were used for reconstruction. The second patient had a full thickness defect and the TFL was harvested as a fasciocutaneous flap for reconstruction. Both defects were repaired satisfactorily without herniation. Conclusion:?? TFL is a versatile flap and should be the method of choice for lower abdominal wall reconstruction.

AB  - Purpose:?? To present a review of biofilms and their significance in surgical practice. Aim:?? To better understand the role biofilms play in in-vivo infection, implantable medical device infection and transmission of infections by patient-ready instruments. Methodology:?? A review was of the biofilm literature was conducted using UNSW, USYD and RACS search engines. Studies were examined for a definition of biofilm and approaches to detection and removal. Subjects of particular relevance to surgical practice were considered to be the role of instrument cleaning in biofilm control and biofilm as a risk factor in viral and prion transmission and infection of implantable medical device. The standardisation of hospital cleaning protocols for medical devices is considered for biofilm control. Results:?? From a medical perspective, biofilms may form on living tissues such as wounds, sinuses, native heart valves. Biofilms may also infect implantable and surface medical devices such as indwelling catheters, breast implants, prosthetic joints, as well as central lines and cannulas. Biofilms may also cause inter-patient transmission of infections through inadequate cleaning regimes of endoscopes, nasoscopes, and surgical instruments particularly cannulated and hinged. Currently there are Australian Standards for disinfection and sterilisation, but no Australian Standard for removal of biofilm. Conclusions:?? There needs to be an increased recognition of the role biofilms play in infections. Methods for assessment of biofilm removal need to be developed and adequate cleaning regimes implemented in the health care setting.
