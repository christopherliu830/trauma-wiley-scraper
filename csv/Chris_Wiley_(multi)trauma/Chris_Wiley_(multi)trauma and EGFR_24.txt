AB  - Abstract Effective translational methodologies for knowledge representation are needed in order to make strides against the constellation of diseases that affect the world today. These diseases are defined by their mechanistic complexity, redundancy, and nonlinearity. Translational systems biology aims to harness the power of computational simulation to streamline drug/device design, simulate clinical trials, and eventually to predict the effects of drugs on individuals. The ability of agent-based modeling to encompass multiple scales of biological process as well as spatial considerations, coupled with an intuitive modeling paradigm, suggests that this modeling framework is well suited for translational systems biology. This review describes agent-based modeling and gives examples of its translational applications in the context of acute inflammation and wound healing. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The formation of misaligned scar tissue by a variety of cell types expressing multiple axon growth inhibitory proteoglycans presents a physical and molecular barrier to axon regeneration after adult spinal cord injuries. Decorin is a small, leucine-rich proteoglycan that has previously been shown to reduce astrogliosis and basal lamina formation in acute cerebral cortex stab injuries. We have therefore tested whether mini pump infusion of hr-decorin into acute stab injuries of the adult rat spinal cord can not only inhibit formation of an astroglial limitans but also deposition of the axon growth inhibitory proteoglycans neurocan, NG2, phosphacan and brevican. Combined immunohistochemical and quantitative Western blot analysis revealed major reductions in levels of core protein expression (>80% for 130-kDa neurocan, 145/80-kDa brevican, 300-kDa phosphacan) and immunoreactivity for all four chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) within decorin-treated injuries compared with untreated controls. Astrogliosis within lesion margins and the accumulation of OX42+ macrophages/microglia within lesion centres were also significantly reduced. These decorin-induced changes in scar formation combined to promote the striking ability of axons from microtransplanted adult sensory neurons to enter, grow within and exit decorin-infused spinal cord injuries, in sharp contrast to the complete failure of axons to cross untreated, CSPG-rich lesions. Decorin pretreatment of meningial fibroblasts in vitro also resulted in a three-fold increase in neurite outgrowth from co-cultured adult sensory neurons and suppression of NG2 immunoreactivity. The ability of decorin to promote axon growth across acute spinal cord injuries via a coordinated suppression of inflammation, CSPG expression and astroglial scar formation make decorin treatment a promising component of future spinal cord regeneration strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important clinical condition that is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. This study was performed to identify the factors that influence AKI stage, undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality. Methods This study was retrospectively conducted on 219 children with AKI who had been referred to the paediatric nephrology division of Dr Sami Ulus Teaching Hospital during their inpatient treatment from 2008 to 2012. AKI was defined using pRIFLE criteria. Results From the 219 enrolled patients, 131 were identified as having AKI at the time of hospital admission. Infant age group was the largest group. RRT was performed in 68 patients. Median RRT initiation time was 1.5?day (0?2) and the mortality increased significantly when RRT initiation time was >1?day. The likelihood of undergoing RRT was higher for patients who were younger, who were managed in PICU and who had intrinsic type of AKI. pRIFLE stage and AKI place did not influence the likelihood of undergoing RRT. Overall mortality was 26.9%. In log-rank tests, factors influencing survival were younger age, being treated in PICU, developing AKI during inpatient treatment, having a comorbid condition and undergoing RRT. pRIFLE stage did not influence survival. In the logistic regression model, factors associated with mortality included younger age, undergoing RRT and having AKI during inpatient treatment. Having underlying disease and being managed in PICU did not influence the likelihood of death. Conclusion Acute kidney injury is an important condition in all hospitalized patients. More studies and interventions are needed on this topic to identify, treat and prevent AKI.

AB  - Abstract Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is a very complex and well-orchestrated phenomenon. It is carried out by the participation of all mature liver cell types. The process is associated with signaling cascades involving growth factors, cytokines, matrix remodeling, and several feedbacks of stimulation and inhibition of growth related signals. Liver manages to restore any lost mass and adjust its size to that of the organism, while at the same time providing full support for body homeostasis during the entire regenerative process. In situations when hepatocytes or biliary cells are blocked from regeneration, these cell types can function as facultative stem cells for each other. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract The NF Conference is the largest annual gathering of researchers and clinicians focused on neurofibromatosis and has been convened by the Children's Tumor Foundation for over 20 years. The 2009 NF Conference was held in Portland, Oregon from June 13 to June 16, 2009 and co-chaired by Kathryn North from the University of Sydney and The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia; and Joseph Kissil from the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia. The Conference included 80 platform presentations in 9 sessions over 4 days; over 100 abstracts presented as posters; and three Keynote presentations. To date, there have been tremendous advances in basic research in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis, and more recently in progress toward identifying effective drug therapies and the commencement of neurofibromatosis clinical trials. The NF Conference attendees have significantly increased (doubling from 140 in 2005 to 280 attending in 2009) with a significant increase in attendance of physicians and clinical researchers. Correspondingly the NF Conference scope has expanded to include translational research, clinical trials and clinical management issues while retaining a core of basic research. These themes are reflected in the highlights from the 2009 NF Conference presented here. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation-18 (CTOT-18) is a follow-up analysis of the 200-subject multicenter heart transplant CTOT-05 cohort. CTOT-18 aimed to identify clinical, epidemiologic, and biologic markers associated with adverse clinical events past 1Â year posttransplantation. We examined various candidate biomarkers including serum antibodies, angiogenic proteins, blood gene expression profiles, and T cell alloreactivity. The composite endpoint (CE) included death, retransplantation, coronary stent, myocardial infarction, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The mean follow-up was 4.5Â Â±Â SD 1.1Â years. Subjects with serum anti-cardiac myosin (CM) antibody detected at transplantation and at 12Â months had a higher risk of meeting the CE compared to those without anti-CM antibody (hazard ratio [HR]Â =Â 2.9, PÂ =Â .046). Plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-C levels pretransplant were associated with CE (odds ratio [OR]Â =Â 13.24, PÂ =Â .029; and ORÂ =Â 0.13, PÂ =Â .037, respectively). Early intravascular ultrasound findings or other candidate biomarkers were not associated with the study outcomes. In conclusion, anti-CM antibody and plasma levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C were associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Although this multicenter report supports further evaluation of the mechanisms through which anti-CM antibody and plasma angiogenesis proteins lead to allograft injury, we could not identify additional markers of adverse events or potential novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers the clinical management of pregnancies complicated by pre-gestational diabetes, as well as the screening and management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It tabulates the main types of diabetes seen in obstetric practice. The 2002 CEMACH audit of 3800 pregnancies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed some fetal complications (perinatal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality) among women with type 1 and type 2 DM. Women with type 1 DM are at greater risk of recurrent and severe hypoglycaemia and retinopathy. In order to significantly limit early fetal loss and congenital abnormalities women need optimal glycaemic control prior to pregnancy. To achieve this, women with pre-gestational diabetes ideally need to plan their pregnancies, be given pre-conception counselling and continue contraception until good glycaemic control has been achieved. Finally, the chapter discusses the long-term health consequences for the child of a diabetic pregnancy.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and fusion proteins directed towards cell surface targets make an important contribution to the treatment of disease. The purpose of this review was to correlate the clinical and preclinical data on the 15 currently approved mAbs and fusion proteins targeted to the cell surface. The principal sources used to gather data were: the peer reviewed Literature; European Medicines Agency ?Scientific Discussions?; and the US Food and Drug Administration ?Pharmacology/Toxicology Reviews? and package inserts (United States Prescribing Information). Data on the 15 approved biopharmaceuticals were included: abatacept; abciximab; alefacept; alemtuzumab; basiliximab; cetuximab; daclizumab; efalizumab; ipilimumab; muromonab; natalizumab; panitumumab; rituximab; tocilizumab; and trastuzumab. For statistical analysis of concordance, data from these 15 were combined with data on the approved mAbs and fusion proteins directed towards soluble targets. Good concordance with human pharmacodynamics was found for mice receiving surrogates or non-human primates (NHPs) receiving the human pharmaceutical. In contrast, there was poor concordance for human pharmacodynamics in genetically deficient mice and for human adverse effects in all three test systems. No evidence that NHPs have superior predictive value was found.
