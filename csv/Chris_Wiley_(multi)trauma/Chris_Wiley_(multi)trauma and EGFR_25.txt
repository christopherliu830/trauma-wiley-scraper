AB  - Abstract Many years of research have resulted in the successful examples of immunotherapies for many diseases including cancers and inflammatory diseases. These new treatments are referred to as biological therapies-such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine therapies. The recent technological advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) development have caused significant investment and interest in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. Therefore, this chapter will highlight these new advances in the biological therapy arena.

AB  - Summary This chapter emphasises the vital role the nurse plays in the prevention of progression to acute kidney injury (AKI) and of the delivery of care for the patient in AKI. In this central role the nurse can maintain close links with the patient's family, which can be instrumental to a family-centred approach to the patient's treatment. AKI may be divided into three major categories, in which each category has a physiological location of the insult: prerenal, renal, and postrenal. An acute impairment may also present in the patient with existing chronic kidney disease, which may lead to further structural damage; this presentation is often referred to as acute-on-chronic renal failure and evidence would indicate that this is an increasing group. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends performing urine dipstick testing for blood, protein, leucocytes, nitrites, and glucose in any patient in whom AKI is suspected as soon as possible.

AB  - The sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform one is a critical regulator of intracellular pH, serves as an anchor for the formation of cytoplasmic signaling complexes, and modulates cytoskeletal organization. There is a growing interest in the potential for sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform one as a therapeutic target against cancer. Sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform one transport drives formation of membrane protrusions essential for cell migration and contributes to the establishment of a tumor microenvironment that leads to the rearrangement of the extracellular matrix further supporting tumor progression. Here, we focus on the potential impact that an inexpensive, $100 genome would have in identifying prospective therapeutic targets to treat tumors based upon changes in gene expression and variation of sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform one regulators. In particular, we will focus on the ezrin, radixin, moesin family proteins, calcineurin B homologous proteins, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, and phosphoinositide signaling as they relate to the regulation of sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform one in cancer progression.

AB  - Abstract Quercetin, a plant-derived flavonoid, is known for its antitumor and antiproliferative activities. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), as a highly aggressive cerebrum tumor, has a poor prognosis that is approximately 12?months despite standard therapy. Therefore, because of the low effectiveness of the current therapeutic strategies, additional medications in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy are needed, which could improve the prognosis of GBM patients. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that quercetin regulates many proteins involved in the cellular signal transduction in GBM. In this review, recent findings on the targeting of particular signaling pathways by quercetin and the subsequent effect on the pathogenesis of GBM are presented and discussed.
