AB  - Objectives:?? Extended radical pelvic resection for advanced primary or recurrent pelvic malignancy is an increasingly common procedure in major colorectal units. Aggressive pre operative chemo-radio therapy creates a cohort of patients with difficult reconstructive variables. We review our plastic surgical reconstructions in this highly heterogeneous population. Method:?? Utilizing the coding system at our institution we identified a cohort of patients whom underwent Vertical Rectus Abdominis Musculocutaneous (VRAM) reconstruction for exenterative pelvic surgery. A thorough retrospective case note analysis was performed specifically looking at three variable subsets. Demographic data and peri-operative care Reconstructive surgical procedures and complications Tumour variables and patient survival outcomes Results:?? Statistical analysis of the patient cohort and subsets will be presented Conclusions:?? This study has demonstrated the versatility of the VRAM flap in obtaining a stable and supple reconstructive cover in advanced pelvic malignancy surgery. Our series confirms strong support for immediate VRAM reconstruction in all pelvic exenterative procedures. We have shown patients undergoing multi-visceral resection after prior chemo-radiotherapy can achieve early, healed and stable perineal closure with low morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as nausea and bloating, are common in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Autonomic dysfunction can lead to changes in the GI secreto-motor function which can be associated with GI symptom development. We hypothesized that regional pH profiles in T1DM differs from health and would be associated with objective physiological/clinical markers. Methods Forty-seven T1DM with confirmed diabetic sensory peripheral neuropathy and 41 healthy age-matched subjects underwent standardized wireless motility capsule testing. T1DM completed the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Disease duration, glycemic control, insulin usage, and 24-hour heart rate variability testing were evaluated. Key Results In comparison to healthy subjects, gastric, and large bowel median pH were lower in T1DM (1.8 ± 1.6 vs 2.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.001 and 6.7 ± 0.6 vs 7.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, change in pH across the pylorus was lower while change in pH across the ileocecal junction was higher in T1DM (5.2 ± 1.5 vs 5.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.003 and 1.8 ± 0.4 vs 1.3 ± 0.4, P < 0.0001, respectively). No difference was found in small bowel median pH. Gastric median pH was associated with small bowel transit time (r = 0.30, P = 0.049). Change in pH across the pylorus was negatively associated with fasting glycose (r = ?0.35, P = 0.027). Small bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.42, P = 0.005) and small bowel transit time (r = 0.48, P = 0.0007). Large bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.35, P = 0.018) and the total GCSI score (r = 0.34, P = 0.023). Conclusions and Inferences The GI pH profile in T1DM with DSPN is different from healthy subjects. Changes in pH profile may have important therapeutic implications and influence pharmacotherapeutic bioavailability.

AB  - SUMMARY There is a much higher incidence of diabetic foot disease in those with concurrent renal disease and outcomes, including amputation and mortality, are generally poorer. The risk factors contributing to the higher incidence of foot disease in those with both diabetes and renal disease are outlined, and the evidence explored demonstrating higher incidence of foot disease across categories of renal disease, including impaired renal function (chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4), haemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, renal transplantation and simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation. Three major pathological aspects of diabetic foot disease in which concurrent renal disease either contributes to a higher incidence, or modifies the clinical manifestations and outcomes, are described: ulceration; Charcot neuroarthropathy and necrotic toes. Pathophysiology, clinical features and management strategies for these three conditions are described. Finally, the evidence for preventative strategies for foot disease is explored, and the important role of speed of access to specialist multi-disciplinary diabetic foot services discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Shortness of breath is a common reason for ED attendance. This international study aims to describe the epidemiology of dyspnoea presenting to EDs in the South East Asia-Pacific region, to compare disease patterns across regions, to understand how conditions are investigated and treated, and to assess quality of care. Methods/Design This is a prospective, interrupted time series cohort study conducted in EDs in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia of consecutive adult patients presenting to the ED with dyspnoea as a main symptom. Data were collected over three 72 h periods in May, August and October 2014 (autumn, winter and spring), and included demographics, comorbidities, mode of arrival, usual medications, pre-hospital treatment, initial assessment, ED investigations, treatment in the ED, ED diagnosis, disposition from ED, in-hospital outcome and final hospital diagnosis. The primary outcomes of interest are the epidemiology and outcome of patients presenting to ED with dyspnoea. Secondary outcomes of interest are seasonal and geographic comparisons of diagnoses and outcomes, disease-specific descriptions of epidemiology, investigation, treatment and disposition, and compliance with treatment guidelines. Discussion This novel study will explore dyspnoea from the viewpoint of the patient's symptom (shortness of breath) rather than that of a single disease. The results will provide robust data about the epidemiology, investigation, treatment and disposition of this diverse patient group. The obtained data also have the potential to inform service planning and to quantify the proportion of patients with mixed cardiac and respiratory disease.

AB  - Background Anlotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit). In the phase III ALTER-0303 trial (Clinical Trial Registry ID: NCT 02388919), anlotinib significantly improved overall survival versus placebo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who had received at least two previous chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase targeted therapy regimens. This study summarized adverse event management in this trial. Methods Patients were randomized (2:1) to anlotinib or placebo up to progression or intolerable toxicity. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 and managed by investigators. Key strategies for preventing and managing the most common adverse events included patient education, supportive care, and dose modification. Results Between February 2015 and August 2016, 294 patients received anlotinib. A total of 170 (57.8%) patients received antihypertensive medications for hypertension, 53 (18.0%) patients received levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, 24 (8.2%) patients received fibrates for hypertriglyceridemia, 11 (3.7%) patients took cortisone cream for hand-foot syndrome, and 38 (12.9%) patients received anti-diarrheal medications for diarrhea. Dose reduction and drug discontinuation were required in 24 (8.16%) and 31 (10.54%) patients in the anlotinib group, respectively. Conclusion Anlotinb-related adverse events could be controlled by patient education, prophylactic measures, early and active intervention, and dose modification.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Summary The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary diagnostic process to determine the medical, psychological and functional capabilities of an older person in order to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and long-term follow-up. The CGA assesses the whole patient, and can reduce length of stay and institutionalization, and improve quality of life. Geriatric syndromes such as falls, delirium or immobility can be used to stream patients towards CGA interventions. Whilst integrating standard medical diagnostic evaluation, CGA emphasizes problem solving, functional status and prognosis, with the aim of restoring independence and alleviating distress. Typically, CGA involves a team of people from various disciplines (geriatric medicine, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, nursing) or a combination of these, working towards a shared common goal using standardized assessment tools, pathways and documentation. CGA produces a list of medical and non-medical problems, which can be constructed by any or all the members of the multidisciplinary care team.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High concentrations of lactate approx. 10?mM are characteristic of wound healing. We have previously shown that lactate instigates release of VEGF from macrophages and endothelial cells. Our present study uses an in vivo murine Matrigel model to study how lactate enhances vascular development and repair. METHODS: Matrigel is a reconstituted basement membrane complex, a liquid at 4 degree C. When injected subcutaneously, it reconstitutes as a gel. 30?mgs of finely divided polylactate polymer (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was mixed with 1cc of Matrigel, and 2 injections were made into the dorsum of each of 60 (average 7/group), 6-month-old Swiss Webster mice. The gel implants were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 11 and 16 days post injection, and were fixed in buffered formalin or frozen. Cell migration and vascular development were assessed using H&E, anti-CD31 and anti-MAC3 antibody stainings for leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Cells and vessels were quantified microscopically. RESULTS: Control implants (without polylactate) developed little or no inflammation or angiogenesis. Polylactated implants developed highly significant number of endothelial cells and recognizable vessels at 6 and 9 days. At 11 and 16 days, sizeable vessels with surrounding connective tissue were found. Though a moderate inflammation occurred in the lactate groups, no foreign body reaction was seen. Larger implants of high molecular weight instigated little inflammation and few vessels. CONCLUSION: Slowly released lactate leads to the formation of new vessels. Our results provide support for further clinical applications of lactate polymer in wounds. NIH/NIGMS Trauma Training Grant

AB  - Summary Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent endocrine emergencies in individuals with diabetes mellitus. However, hypoglycemia in the healthy or non-diabetic individual is rare. This review will focus on the pathophysiology, management, and etiology of hypoglycemia in persons with and without diabetes. Hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes will focus on multiple factors including hypoglycemic unawareness, glucose monitoring, medication management, and comorbidities. Hypoglycemia in the non-diabetic individual can have multiple etiologies and poses a diagnostic challenge. It is important to respond quickly and appropriately to acute hypoglycemia in any individual. Although broad, the etiology of hypoglycemia must include a comprehensive and individualized review of medical, family, social, and pharmacologic patient histories.

AB  - Abstract Aims Diabetic kidney disease independently predicts cardiovascular disease and premature death. We examined the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD, defined as an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and quality of care in a cross-sectional survey of adults (age ≥ 18 years) with Type 2 diabetes across Asia. Methods The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation programme is a disease-management programme implemented using an electronic portal that systematically captures clinical characteristics of all patients enrolled. Between July 2007 and December 2012, data on 28 110 consecutively enrolled patients (China: 3415, Hong Kong: 15 196, India: 3714, Korea: 1651, Philippines: 3364, Vietnam: 692, Taiwan: 78) were analysed. Results In this survey, 15.9% of patients had CKD, 25.0% had microalbuminuria and 12.5% had macroalbuminuria. Patients with CKD were less likely to achieve HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) (36.0% vs. 42.3%) and blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg (20.8% vs. 35.3%), and were more likely to have retinopathy (26.2% vs. 8.7%), sensory neuropathy (29.0% vs. 7.7%), cardiovascular disease (26.6% vs. 8.7%) and self-reported hypoglycaemia (18.9% vs. 8.2%). Despite high frequencies of albuminuria (74.8%) and dyslipidaemia (93.0%) among CKD patients, only 49.0% were using renin?angiotensin system inhibitors and 53.6% were on statins. On logistic regression, old age, male gender, tobacco use, long disease duration, high HbA1c, blood pressure and BMI, and low LDL cholesterol were independently associated with CKD (all P < 0.05). Conclusions The poor control of risk factors, suboptimal use of organ-protective drugs and high frequencies of hypoglycaemia highlight major treatment gaps in patients with diabetic kidney disease in Asia.

AB  - Abstract Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is correlated with angiogenesis and early relapse of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study investigated the role of miR-148a in the regulation of VEGF/angiogenesis and early relapse of CRC. We established a stable clone with miR-148a expression in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines and created a hypoxic condition by using CoCl2 to determine the underlying mechanism of miR-148a. The effects of miR-148a on the phosphoryl-ERK (pERK)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/VEGF pathway were evaluated through Western blotting and the inhibitory effect of miR-148a on angiogenesis was demonstrated through a tube formation assay. Sixty-three CRC tissues (28 early relapse and 35 non-early relapse) were analysed to assess the relationship between miR-148a and HIF-1α/VEGF. The protein expression of pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF in HCT116 and HT29 cells was significantly decreased by miR-148a (all P < 0.05). The protein expression of VEGF/HIF-1α was strongly inversely associated with the expression of miR-148a in the 63 CRC tissue samples (all P < 0.05). Tube formation assay demonstrated that miR-148a significantly obliterated angiogenesis. miR-148a suppresses VEGF through down-regulation of the pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway and might lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis; miR-148a down-regulation increased the early relapse rate of CRC. This demonstrates that miR-148a is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.

Methods and Results Among a total of 224 consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement using SAPIEN 3, 121 patients (54.0%) underwent postdilatation (same contrast volume: N = 101, +1 ml: N = 17, +2 ml: N = 3). THV diameter was assessed (a) during, (b) after implantation, (c) during postdilatation, and (d) after postdilatation by quantitative fluoroscopy. In the overall patients (N = 224), acute recoil was observed from during implantation (23.0?±?2.0?mm) to after implantation (22.5?±?2.0?mm, p?<?.001) with an absolute recoil of 0.52?±?0.25?mm. After postdilatation (N = 121), THV diameter significantly increased from 22.5?±?2.0?mm to 22.9?±?2.1?mm (p?<?.001), with smaller absolute recoil (0.39?±?0.21?mm, p?<?.001). Compared with those who did not undergo postdilatation, patients who underwent postdilatation had larger postprocedural THV area assessed by multi-slice computed tomography (471.4?±?78.1?mm2 vs. 447.5?±?76.3?mm2, p = .02) and larger effective orifice area (EOA) assessed by echocardiography throughout 1 year (at 30 day, 1.66?±?0.33?cm2 vs. 1.45?±?0.27?cm2, p?<?.001; at 6 month, 1.66?±?0.33?cm2 vs. 1.44?±?0.29?cm2, p?<?.001; at 1 year, 1.69?±?0.38?cm2 vs. 1.47?±?0.30?cm2, p?<?.001). Conclusions Postdilatation after implantation of the SAPIEN 3 valve produced a larger THV diameter with less acute recoil, followed by larger EOA throughout 1 year. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of postdilatation on long-term clinical outcomes.

AB  - Summary Mental illness exerts a major burden on human health, yet evidence-based treatments are rudimentary due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathologies. Clinical studies point to roles for the immune system in psychiatric diseases, while basic science has revealed that the brain has an active and multi-cellular resident immune system that interacts with peripheral immunity and impacts behavior. In this perspective, we highlight evidence of immune involvement in human psychiatric disease and review data from animal models that link immune signaling to neuronal function and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework for linking advances in basic neuroimmunology to their potential relevance for psychiatric diseases, based on the subtypes of immune responses defined in peripheral tissues. Our goal is to identify novel areas of focus for future basic and translational studies that may reveal the potential of the immune system for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence from observational and prospective randomized studies in hospitalized patients indicates a strong association between hyperglycemia and increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and complications. Hyperglycemia can occur in patients with diabetes, as well as in non-diabetic subjects with stress-induced hyperglycemia. The risk of mortality and complications correlates with the severity of hyperglycemia, with higher risk in patients without a history of diabetes. In addition, numerous studies have shown that improved glycemic control during hospitalization decreases the rate of complications in critical and non-critical care settings. This chapter reviews the risks associated with hyperglycemia in different clinical situations in non-critical care patients and outlines practical protocols for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with stress hyperglycemia and in patients with diabetes admitted to general medicine and surgery services.

AB  - Insufficient hemodynamics during agonal phase?ie, the period between withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and circulatory arrest?in Maastricht category III circulatory-death donors (DCD) potentially exacerbate ischemia/reperfusion injury. We included 409 Dutch adult recipients of DCD donor kidneys transplanted between 2006 and 2014. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2-with pulse oximetry at the fingertip) and systolic blood pressure (SBP-with arterial catheter) were measured during agonal phase, and were dichotomized into minutes of SpO2 > 60% or SpO2 < 60%, and minutes of SBP > 80 mmHg or SBP < 80 mmHg. Outcome measures were and primary non-function (PNF), delayed graft function (DGF), and three-year graft survival. Primary non-function (PNF) rate was 6.6%, delayed graft function (DGF) rate was 67%, and graft survival at three years was 76%. Longer periods of agonal phase (median 16 min [IQR 11-23]) contributed significantly to an increased risk of DGF (P = .012), but not to PNF (P = .071) and graft failure (P = .528). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that an increase from 7 to 20 minutes in period of SBP < 80 mmHg was associated with 2.19 times the odds (95% CI 1.08-4.46, P = .030) for DGF. In conclusion, duration of agonal phase is associated with early transplant outcome. SBP < 80 mmHg during agonal phase shows a better discrimination for transplant outcome than SpO2 < 60% does.
