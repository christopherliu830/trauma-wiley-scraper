AB  - Aims This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02453555) evaluated the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin (Empa) 10 or 25 mg as add-on to linagliptin (Lina) 5 mg (fixed-dose combination, Empa/Lina 10/5 or 25/5) in insufficiently controlled Japanese type 2 diabetes patients. Methods The trial (40 sites; May 2015-March 2017) involved screening 433 adults (≥20 years) who were treatment-naive or were using one oral antidiabetic drug for ≥12 weeks, which was discontinued at enrolment. Patients with HbA1c 7.5%-10.0% after ≥16 weeks of using Lina (pre-enrolment or during a 16-week, open-label period) and 2 weeks of using placebo (Plc) for Empa/Lina 10/5, plus Lina, were randomized (2:1) to once-daily Empa/Lina 10/5 (n = 182) or Plc/Lina 10/5 (n = 93) for 24 weeks. Patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.0% at Week 24 received Empa/Lina up-titrated to 25/5 (n = 126) or the corresponding placebo (n = 80), per randomization, from Week 28; 172 Empa/Lina and 84 Plc/Lina patients completed 52 weeks. Results Change from baseline in HbA1c was greater (P < .0001) with Empa/Lina than with Plc/Lina at Week 24 (primary outcome, ?0.93% vs 0.21%; adjusted mean difference, ?1.14%) and Week 52 (?1.16% vs 0.06%; adjusted mean difference, ?1.22%). More patients with HbA1c < 7.0% and greater decreases in fasting plasma glucose, body weight and systolic blood pressure were seen in the Empa/Lina group than in the Plc/Lina group. Empa/Lina was well tolerated. The adverse events that were more frequent with Empa/Lina were known empagliflozin-associated events (eg, increased urination, increased blood ketones). There were no adjudication-confirmed diabetic ketoacidosis events or lower limb amputations. Conclusions These results support the notion that empagliflozin-linagliptin in fixed-dose combination is a therapeutic option for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the background, challenges, strategic mapping, high-risk markers, high-risk predictors, investigations, smart testing, management, comprehensive management and preferential management for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The signs suggesting extensive myocardial injuries include high white blood cell count and elevated brain natriuretic peptide level (BNP). Chest pain may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, back or to the epigastric area. Many patients complain of chest tightness rather than chest pain. Some patients, especially the elderly, and women may present with acute shortness of breath, dizziness, pre-syncope, or syncope, nausea and vomiting, rather than classical angina. In the acute setting of STEMI, only the electrocardiogram (ECG), and basic blood tests of complete blood count and electrolytes (sodium, potassium), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine level, protime and prothrombin time are needed before the patient receives thrombolytic therapy or undergoes urgent coronary angiogram for possible angioplasty.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been found to be among the complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although the mechanisms of PN in patients with HCV infection are still unknown, cryoglobulinemia has been implicated as a possible cause of ischemic peripheral nerve impairment mediated by vasoconstriction, altered blood viscosity, and thrombosis of small vessels. However, available information is mostly based on referral patients with chronic HCV infection. In this study, an unselected sample of cases with newly diagnosed HCV infection has been examined to assess the prevalence and type of PN and to correlate the disease with the presence of cryoglobulinemia. The study population included 41 patients with HCV infection and no documented risk factors for PN (18 women and 23 men, aged 17 to 72 years) referred to the neurophysiology units of 7 Italian centers (Genova, Lodi, Messina, Monza, Napoli, Padova, and Siena) for a clinical and electrophysiological screening of peripheral nerve disease. The mean latency between diagnosis of HCV infection (interpreted as a surrogate of the duration of infection) and study entry was 6.8 months (range 1?12). PN was documented in 13 cases (31.7%). Of these, 7 had mononeuropathy and 6 had polyneuropathy. Cryoglobulinemia was present in 4 patients (9.8%) and 3 of them had PN (polyneuropathy 2, mononeuropathy 1). The odds ratio of PN in patients with cryoglobulinemia, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of infection, was 4.4 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3?68.2) and was fairly similar (4.1; 95% CI 0.3?56.3) when the analysis was limited to the presence of polyneuropathy. The lack of statistical significance may by explained by the small sample size. Based on these findings, cryoglobulinemia can be interpreted as an independent risk factor for PN at the presence of HCV infection. However, given the fairly high prevalence of PN in patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection and the high proportion of cases not attributable to cryoglobulinemia (9 out of 13), other factors should be investigated to clarify the mechanisms of HCV neuropathy.
