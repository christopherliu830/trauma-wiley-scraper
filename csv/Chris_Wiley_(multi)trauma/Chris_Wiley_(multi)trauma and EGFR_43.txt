AB  - Progressive brachial and lumbosacral radiculoplexopathies are well known, though infrequent, delayed complications of local irradiation. They present as slowly progressive, generally bilateral but asymmetric, limb weakness mainly affecting distal muscles. The pathogenesis is unknown although some authors supposed an autoimmune process or radio-induced DNA changes. No treatment for this disease is currently available even if some benefits, though transient, have been reported after steroid treatment and more recently, high-dose immunoglobulins (IVIg), suggesting a possible immune-mediated pathogenesis. We previously reported on the beneficial effect of immunotherapies in two patients with postirradiation motor radiculoplexopathy. The first patient had a severe motor lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy starting 20 years after local radiotherapy for seminoma. He became able to walk and run with less waddling and to climb stairs without support after treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. The other patient had severe left brachial and bilateral lumbosacral plexopathies presenting 12 years after toracoascellar and lumbar irradiation for a Hodgkin lymphoma. She improved her right leg strength after one course of IVIg. After one year of continuous steroid therapy the first patient started to progressively deteriorate notwithstanding the subsequent administration of IVIg, resumed courses of steroids, plasma exchanges and azathioprine. The second patient, after one year of continuous IVIg treatment which led to stabilization without further improvement, was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and plasma exchange, with a marginal and transient amelioration followed by progressive worsening that was not halted by the resumption of IVIg. Both patients now suspended any therapy. In conclusion, in both our patients, immune therapies only induced a transient and short-term benefit but did not affect the overall progression of the disease. These findings suggest that even if an immune or inflammatory component, possibly triggered by radiation, may be present in this condition, it does not probably represent the bulk of the pathological process.

AB  - The neuropilins, NP-1 and NP-2, are co-receptors for Sema3A and Sema3F, respectively, both of which are repulsive axonal guidance molecules. NP-1 and NP-2 are also co-receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The neuropilins and their ligands are known to play prominent roles in axonal pathfinding, fasciculation, and blood vessel formation during peripheral nervous system (PNS) development. To screen for additional molecular mechanisms by which Schwann cells and fibroblasts contribute to successful PNS axonal regeneration, we used cDNA microarrays (Clontech) to compare expression profile of multiple messenger RNAs in sciatic nerves distal to transection with their levels in normal sciatic nerves. An evocative result of this screen was a 14-fold increase in NP-2 mRNA in the axotomized nerve segments 4 days post-transection. We verified that NP-2 is induced in transected as well as crushed nerve segments by quantitative PCR, Northern blotting, and Western blotting, and examined the distribution of NP-2 expressing cells in injured sciatic nerves by in situ hybridization. Then, we sought evidences of induction in the injured nerves of the NP-2 ligands, Sema3F and VEGF, and widened our survey to determine whether expression of the functionally related genes, neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and its class 3 semaphorin ligand, Sema3A are also induced in PNS following injury. We showed by in situ hybridization induction of all those genes at four days post-crushed, distally to the lesion. Our results suggest the possibility that the neuropilins and their semaphorin ligands serve to guide, rather than to impede, regenerating axons in the adult PNS.

AB  - It is well known that exposure to toxic substances may induce peripheral and central neurological complications but no cases of acute cranial nerve involvement are reported after single, although massive, exposure to toxic agents. Cranial multineuropathy is an uncommon occurrence. We observed two atypical cases of multinevritis of cranial nerves with mild sensory symptoms at limbs. Both patients had many common features: acute onset, occurrence of neuropraxic block in cranial nerves, and rapid clinical and neurophysiological recovery after corticosteroid therapy. In both cases, the strict time correlation between substance inhalation and acute onset of symptoms suggested a toxic origin of the disease. We emphasize that multinevritis of cranial nerves could be related to acute exposure of toxic substances. Missing this diagnosis could lead to a delay in treatment.

AB  - Tick-born encephalitis (TBE) is caused by a Flavivirus infection after Ixodes Ricinus bite. Among the 62 cases of TBE virus infection observed in the Belluno General Hospital since January 1994, 4 patients (6,6%) presented also signs of lower motor neuron involvement. One patient exhibited severe tetraplegia with respiratory failure. The clinical picture was monomelic in the remaining 3 patients. In all patients reflexes were absent in the affected limbs; sensations were preserved. Needle EMG revealed signs of acute denervation, prominent in proximal muscles. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits. The outcome was good in the three patients with monoparesis who recovered normal muscle strength. The tetraplegic patient is still wheel-chair bound. Polio-like syndromes due to TBE virus infection have been described either in anecdotal reports or in small series of patients from continental Europe. The pathophysiology of the motor neuron damage is unknown.

AB  - CMT4B1 is an autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy characterized by severe progressive muscular atrophy with childhood onset, decreased conduction velocities, demyelination with myelin outfolding, and subsequently axonal loss. The disease gene has been recently identified as myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2), encoding a protein phosphatase (Bolino et?al., Nature Genetics 25: 17?19; 2000). Although this phosphatase is widely expressed, the disorder is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, just as mutations to the related and broadly expressed phosphatase MTM1 produce only myotubular myopathy. The function of MTMR2 and the pathogenetic mechanism of CMT4B are still unknown. We produced several new polyclonal antibodies to MTMR2 in order to better dissect the expression and potential function of MTMR2 in the peripheral nervous system. Although CMT4B manifests primarily as demyelinating neuropathy, our expression data show that MTMR2 protein is present in both Schwann cells and axons in peripheral nerve. In Schwann cells, MTMR2 is localized in the cytoplasm and, at lower level, in the nucleus, while no major differences were observed between non-myelin forming and myelin-forming Schwann cells. DRG sensory neurons and motor neurons, as well as their axons, show MTMR2 expression in their cytoplasm. Thus, it remains unclear whether demyelination in CMT4B is the consequence of a cell-autonomous or a cell-extrinsic defect, the latter possibly due to a defective interaction between Schwann cells and axons.

AB  - Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. An important dose limiting side-effect of long term thalidomide treatment is peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide induces mainly an axonal sensory neuropathy whose incidence is scarcely known. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using neurological examination and neurophysiological studies. 50 patients with diagnosed Multiple Myeloma were studied. Thalidomide was given at a dosage ranging from 100 to 400?mg/die, orally. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated prior and at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Neurological examination included Neurological Symptom Score and Neurological Disability Score. For NCS, amplitude of sensory and motor action potentials (SNAP and MAP) and conduction velocities of median, peroneal and sural nerves, with F wave recording, were evaluated. All patients were asymptomatic at baseline, with a normal neurological examination and NCS. A decline of the SNAP index of 40 % or more (SNAP amplitude at first examination was considered 100 %) was set as the diagnostic marker of axonal neuropathy. Out of 50 patients, 15 discontinued thalidomide for lack of therapeutic response, 15 remained on therapy for 3 months and 20 completed the treatment at 12 months. Incidence of neuropathy, as judged by clinical and neurophysiological criteria, was high (90%) in the group of patients with a 12 months follow up. On the contrary, the incidence of neuropathy in the group of patients with a 3 months follow up and in those treated with a lower dosage, was low (10?20%). In all the patients, who developed a neuropathy, the subjective symptoms preceded NCS abnormalities. Most common symptoms were paresthesias and reduced sensation with a stock and glove distribution. Our data support the view that thalidomide induces very frequently a dose-dependent axonal neuropathy with only a partial reversibility, and that NCS findings lack of a predictive value.

AB  - Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is an ubiquitous transcription factor expressed in a wide variety of cells and involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Many recent data suggest his important role in human inflammatory neuropathies. The present study investigated expression and activation of NF-kB in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a clinical and histopathological model of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. EAN was induced in 11 Lewis rats by injection of peripheral bovine myelin. 4 animals, two immunized with complete Freund's adjuvant and two normal, were used as controls. The clinical course was assessed. Immunohistochemistry, western blot of nuclear extract proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed in the sciatic nerves removed at different times of the disease. Immunoreactivity for the activated form p65 of NF-kB was found in the endoneurial vessel walls, in the external myelin of some nerve fibers and at level of some endoneurial infiltrating cells 14 and 21 days after immunization. No immunoreactivity was found after 7 days as well as in controls. A single band corresponding to NF-kB p65 was detected in all animals, except for the normal controls. EMSA analysis showed a complex binding band in all EAN rats, which was stronger in peak and recovery phase of disease. Our results strongly suggest a crucial role of NF-kB in the genesis of inflammatory demyelination in the peripheral nervous system occurring in EAN.

AB  - Connexin 32 (Cx32), a protein involved in gap-junction formation, in the peripheral nervous system is mainly localized in non-compact myelin of paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. Despite patients with Cx32 mutations have a polyneuropathic phenotype, the pathophysiological correlates of Cx32 defects on axonal function are unknown in humans. Non-invasive methods for assessing axonal excitability have been recently developed (Burke et?al., Clin. Neurophysiol. 2001, Priori et?al. Brain 2002) in humans. These methods allow the indirect estimate of specific ionic conductances of human axons. We assessed the strength-duration function descriptors, the axonal refractoriness and supernormality in a group of Cx32 defective patients with polyneuropathy. Twenty-three healthy control subjects (38 nerves) and 5 patients (10 nerves) with a polyneuropathy and a genetic defect of Cx32 were studied. The ulnar nerve was bipolarly stimulated at the wrist and the CMAP was recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The descriptors (time constant: tsd, rheobasic current: rh50%, threshold: thr100%) of the motor axonal strength-duration function were estimated according to Priori et?al. (2002). Axonal refractoriness was tested by delivering pairs (S1 and S2) of stimuli at variable intervals (10?300?ms). S1 strength was supramaximum, S2 intensity was adjusted to evoke a CMAP 50% of the maximum. The rh50% and the thr100% were markedly increased (rh50% patients [n?=?10, mean?±?SD] 13?±?5.7?mA, controls [n?=?26] 4.8?±?2.1?mA, p?<?0.0001; thr100% patients 47?±?24?mA, controls 9.5?±?3.1?mA, p?<?0.0001) in patients. The tsd was abnormal in 70% of patient's nerves Axonal refractoriness was increased in 56% and axonal supernormality was decreased in 56% of patient's nerves. In conclusion, the Cx32 defect induces abnormalities of the strength-duration function suggesting the involvement of the nodal conductances and axonal hyperpolarization. Hence, the paranodal Cx32 defect functionally spreads to the adjacent nodal region.

AB  - Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy is probably the commonest form of vasculitic neuropathy in Mediterranean countries, as usually related to the widespread hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We describe the spectrum of manifestations in a large series of patients with cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, also analyzing the impact of comorbid factors, which are quite frequent in HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia. The cohort included 60 patients (10 men, 50 women) with peripheral neuropathy associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia as main or sole cause (type 2 in 36 cases, type 3 in 4, not typized in 20), HCV-related in all patients but 8 (3 men and 5 women). Median age of patients was 65 years (range 41?85), and median age at onset of neuropathy was 59 (range 40?84). Peripheral neuropathy represented an onset manifestation of mixed cryoglobulinemia in about half patients. The most frequent clinical pattern was pure sensory neuropathy in 40 patients, including 4 patients with prominent ataxia; sensory neuropathy was asymmetrical in distribution in 9 patients, and in 14 patients sensory action potentials (SAPs) of the sural nerve were normal, suggesting selective involvement of the small sensory fibers. The remaining patients had sensorimotor neuropathy (15 cases) and mononeuropathy multiplex (5 cases). Positive sensory symptoms and restless legs syndrome were the most common manifestations. Neurophysiological study showed axonal degeneration of varying severity in all patients. In 20 patients, additional causes of neuropathy were present, including type 2 diabetes (5 patients), glucose intolerance (6 patients), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3 patients), and alcohol (2 patients). With respect with this subset of patients, in ?pure? cryoglobulinemic neuropathy there was more often a pattern of sensory neuropathy (31/40 vs. 6/20; p?=?0.001), with more frequent asymmetrical distribution (9 vs 0; p?=?0.05) and small fiber involvement (11 vs 3). Severity of neuropathy, as judged on the basis of the Rankin scale and of neurophysiological changes, was similar in the two subgroups. Our study confirms that sensory neuropathy, often asymmetrical, is the most common clinical pattern in cryoglobulinemic neuropathy, and is consistently present in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy rather than in patients with other associated causes of neuropathy; in these latter, paradoxically, clinical and neurophysiological impairment seems not greater than in pure cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.

AB  - The vanilloid receptor VR-1 is a non-selective ligand-gated channel, structurally related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It responds to noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heating in the noxious range, and extracellular acidification. It is able to integrate simultaneous exposure to these stimuli and is involved in different forms of tissue hypersensitivity. VR-1 is predominantly expressed in small-diameter neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which give rise to unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, but its immunoreactivity in human nerve fibers is not known. We assessed the expression of VR-1 in human intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of hairy and glabrous skin and in sural nerve biopsy. Skin biopsies were taken from proximal thigh, distal leg, trunk, arm, and fingertip in 10 healthy subjects. Immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies using polyclonal anti-PGP 9.5 (PGP), monoclonal anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), and polyclonal anti-human VR-1 antibodies were performed. Double staining studies were carried out in the following combinations: PGP-TuJ1 and TuJ1-VR-1. In each site, PGP-positive IENF showed TuJ1 labeling and, most interestingly, VR-1 diffusely co-localized with all TuJ1-positive IENF. These findings indirectly demonstrated the co-localization between VR-1 and the panaxonal marker PGP in IENF. VR-1 immunoreactivity was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve sections from a patient without morphological signs of sensory involvement. Almost 2/3 of unmyelinated fibers showed an intense VR-1 immunoreactivity, which was present also in smooth muscle cells of perineurial and epineurial arterioles. VR-1 immunolabeling was absent in myelinated fibers and in part of unmyelinated fibers, which possibly represented autonomic fibers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that VR-1 is widely expressed in somatic human unmyelinated nerve fibers. Particularly, the diffuse immunoreactivity of IENF, which are naked terminals of small-diameter DRG sensory neurons, suggests that they are essential for selective modalities of nociception and primarily involved in neuropathic hyperalgesia.

AB  - We report two cases of focal inflammatory neuropathy of median nerve with sensory symptoms only in the first patient and motor and sensory disturbances in the second one. In both patients we found at MNR an important segmentary increase of nerve caliber. Surgery excluded nerve tumor and biopsy showed only edema and lymphocytic infiltration sparing nerve fibers. Steroid therapy was successful with rapid disappearance of sensory symptoms and motor deficit. The presence of severe sensory and motor conduction block without signs of axonal damage represent a peculiar neurophysiological aspect in chronic inflammatory focal neuritis; treatment with high-dose of i.v. corticosteroids is frequently helpful.

AB  - A process of motor units (MU) rearrangement may compensate the loss of motor neurons in spinal cord anterior horns in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), at least in the early stages of the disease. Standard electromyography is unable to precisely quantify these pathological changes. Recently, Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE) has been introduced in clinical practice in order to provide a quantitative measure of the process as well as short- and long-term follow-up data. We investigated 8 male patients (mean age?±?SD: 64?±?10.9?yrs, range 45?78) affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria. In order to quantify the total number of motor units, MUNE was performed during the diagnostic work-up (basal, T0), after three (T1) and six months (T2), in abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (16.6% at T1 [p?<?0.002] and 37.9% at T2 [p?<?0.04]), recording from ADM, while the decrease in mean and maximal area did not reach the statistical significance at the same time intervals. Similarly, we found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (20.6% at T1 [p?<?0.008] and 40.3% at T2 [p?<?0.0006]), but not in the mean and maximal area, recording from TA. According to previous data, we found about a loss of about 50% motor units in both the muscles six months after diagnosis. We conclude that MUNE is a useful tool to quantify MU loss in ALS and may result helpful in following the course of ALS and in predicting the prognosis.

AB  - In the nervous system nitric oxide (NO) has been involved as a regulatory molecule in several physiological and pathological events, such as cerebral microcirculation, synaptic plasticity, neural damage, and neuroprotection. The activation of the three isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS): neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS), synthesize NO from L-arginine. Moreover, in response to inflammatory stimuli, iNOS can produce copious amounts of NO for prolonged periods that triggers cell death by either necrosis or apoptosis. This has been considered as a key process in demyelination of both CNS and PNS with a destructive and/or protective controversial role. This study shows by Northern blot analysis that during experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), at the beginning of clinical signs, there is a transient extensive iNOS mRNA induction in nerve roots, which morphology is characterized by severe demyelination, but not in sciatic nerve, where scattered axonal degeneration is evident. Immunocytochemistry performed on teased nerve fibers and ultrastructural analysis showed that iNOS was localized in both inflammatory and Schwann cells, and analysis of cell membrane permeability detected with fluorescent dyes showed a diffuse necrotic phenotype in PNS. With EAN clinical spontaneous recovery, endoneurial iNOS was rapidly down-regulated and in nerve roots almost all cells shifted their membrane permeability to an apoptotic phenotype, whilst necrosis persisted in sciatic nerve, until complete clinical recovery, when both root and nerve returned normal. These data support the hypothesis that, during cell-mediated demyelination, iNOS may influence Schwann cell-axon relationship causing axonal damage and regulating endoneurial cell life and death.

AB  - Antibodies to different neural antigens have been reported in patients with dysimmune neuropathies but their pathogenetic role in these diseases is still debated. In order to identify other possible protein target antigens in these diseases we tested by immunoblot IgG and IgM reactivity with human cauda equina and spinal cord in the sera from 30 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 14 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and 11 with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). As controls we examined sera from 11 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 68 with other neurological and non-neurological diseases (OND) and 28 normal subjects. We found high titers (>1/800) of IgG antibodies to some protein bands of the approximate molecular weight (MW) of 45?50?kDa in spinal cord but not cauda equina, in 20 patients (67%) with GBS, and 1 each with MMN and CIDP (9% and 7%, respectively)(GBS vs. MMN/CIDP p?<?0.05). In 16?GBS positive patients this reactivity was re-tested and found reduced during recovery. A similar IgG reactivity with the 45?50?kDa bands was found in 2 patients (18%) with ALS (GBS vs. ALS p?<?0.05), 15 (23%) with OND (GBS vs. OND p?<?0.001) and in no normal subject. Since the MW of reactive bands corresponded to that of Glial Fibrillar Acidic Protein (GFAP), we tested the serum from 6 intensely positive GBS patients (titers of 1/6400 up to 1/12800) for IgG reactivity with purified GFAP by immunoblot. In four of them IgG bound to GFAP in a pattern similar to that observed with a commercial anti-GFAP antibody. Pre-incubation of one of these sera with purified GFAP completely abolished IgG reactivity with GFAP by immunoblot. This study shows that anti-GFAP IgG antibodies are significantly increased during the acute phase of GBS and decrease during recovery. Further investigation is necessary to clarify their possible pathogenetic role in the disease.

AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MM) is a new generation immunosuppressant, which has been successfully used for treatment of renal, heart and liver transplants, and other immune-mediated diseases. MM is also a safe and steroid-sparing agent for treating neuromuscular diseases, like chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and myastenia gravis. MM is an ester of mycophenolic acid, an agent that inhibits the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Side effects are modest and there is a lower risk for late malignancies than other immunosuppressive drugs. We assessed MM in the treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The therapy of MMN largely depends upon the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). IVIg induce and maintain improvement in MMN, but they do not eradicate the disease and are very expensive. No randomized controlled trials are available to indicate whether immunosuppressive agents are beneficial in MMN. We treated with MM four patients who fulfilled the clinical, laboratory and electrodiagnostic criteria for MMN, aiming to assess whether the drug is safe and may help in reducing or discontinuing IVIg infusion in this disease. MM administration, at 1?g twice daily, was started when patients were still under IVIg treatment and showed minimal or no disability, as judged by the INCAT disability scale. At the third month of MM therapy, IVIg infusion was discontinued in 2 patients and reduced by 20 % in 2 patients. After a follow up ranging from 1 to 6 months, no worsening in the INCAT disability scale was observed in all the patients. One patient discontinued the medication after four months because of gastrointestinal discomfort with diarrhea, weight loss and increased amylase/lipase levels. The promising response to MM and the lack of major side effects, warrant further multicentric controlled trials in MMN.

AB  - A 41-year-old man suffered for 1 year of severe progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy that rendered him bedridden in few months. Routine laboratory investigations, including serum protein immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation, were normal. Electrophysiological studies and sural nerve biopsy showed a severe mixed axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy. X-ray showed multiple osteosclerotic lesions in the spine. MRI disclosed pachymeningeal thickening of the brain and meningeal infiltration at cauda equina level with gadolinium enhancement. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 12% of plasma cells with a monotypic immunocytochemical profile for lambda light chain. A diagnosis of osteosclerotic myeloma (OM) was done. He received two courses of IVIg followed by melphalan and prednisone without any benefit. Very recently he underwent a bone marrow autotransplantation. OM is a rare variant of multiple myeloma, representing less than 3% of all myeloma cases. In contrast to multiple myeloma, in OM half of patients have a peripheral neuropathy similar to CIDP, with or without features of POEMS syndrome. MRI meningeal involvement, concomitant with a severe neuropathy, was not yet described in OM. A paraneoplastic process in addition to a direct neoplastic infiltration may account for the severity of the disease in our patient, despite different therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Unclassified neuropathies still represent a challenge for neurologists, since in about 20?30% of patients no cause can be identified after extensive investigations. In this context, some patients sharing peculiar features have been reported as to be grouped in a single entity termed Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy (CIAP). The onset occurs in middle to late adulthood, there is a predominant sensory involvement and progression is slow, usually not disabling. Electrophysiologic and pathological studies are consistent with a primary axonal injury. We describe five patients affected by adult-onset chronic ?idiopathic? axonal neuropathy with an unusual course characterized by severe disability. Onset occurred in the fifth-seventh decades with sensorimotor symptoms and signs involving both lower and upper limbs with a distal distribution. Over a 2?14 year follow-up, the disease showed a progressive course with severe muscle weakness and atrophy of semi-distal and distal muscles in all patients, and involvement of proximal muscles in four of them. Two patients died because of respiratory and heart failure. All five patients were sporadic. Extensive laboratory examination excluded identifiable causes of neuropathy. Nerve biopsy was carried out in all patients and showed an axonal neuropathy. Amyloid deposits were not observed in nerve sections nor in abdominal fat aspirate. In four patients, treatment with steroids and IVIg was unsuccessful. The nosology of acquired adult-onset axonal polyneuropathies is difficult to be drawn, since in most cases the etiology remains obscure. Our findings suggest that, in this not yet well defined group of neuropathies, different subtypes may exist and represent distinct entities.
