AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1991, five sets of electrophysiological criteria for CIDP have been reported. However, until now, receiver operator characteristic (ROC), such as sensitivity and specificity, of only AAN criteria were investigated, showing a high specificity, but intermediate sensitivity. The application of these criteria may be useful in clinical trials, but is inadequate in clinical practice, since they preclude immunomodulating treatment in patients who do not meet them. OBJECTIVE: 1) to evaluate the ROC and predictive value of five different electrophysiological criteria for CIDP (AAN, INCAT, Rotta et?al, Nicholas et?al. and Saperstein et?al.); 2) to identify the most informative electrophysiological features indicative of demyelination by mean of the likelihood ratio; 3) to determine, in our series of cases, a set of minimal electrophysiological criteria (albeit aspecific) enough sensitive for CIDP diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 patients with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, progressive for at least 2 months, with weakness in least two limbs and documented improvement in strength in response to immunotherapy. Other potential causes were excluded, including diabetes and IgM paraproteinemia with or without anti-MAG reactivity. Twelve patients with axonal polyneuropathy associated with diabetes and 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were included as controls. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated according to all five sets of NCS criteria and ROC was calculated. Likelihood ratio for CIDP was evaluated for each set of NCS criteria and for presence of each of the following features in different number of nerves: motor conduction velocities (MCV), conduction blocks/temporal dispersion, distal motor (DML) and F-wave latencies (FWL). MCV, DML and FWL were considered indicative of demyelination if decreased or increased as suggested by AAN criteria. Results will be discussed.

AB  - GBS is characterized by ascending motor paresis, hypo/areflexia, minimal objective sensory symptoms, electrophysiological evidence of demyelination, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation. Several related syndromes are regarded as variants being the pathogenesis considered an autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve antigens. A 42-year-old veterinary was admitted because of severe myalgias following one-day high fever. Twelve hours later, he experienced dysphonia, dysphagia, and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination showed: normal eye movements, bilateral facial weakness, tongue paralysis, limb and trunk sensory ataxia. Muscle strength was minimally affected and deep jerks were weakened. Sensory testing revealed distal loss for pin-prick, vibration, and position sense in the four extremities. Normal laboratory included emato-urinary tests, CK, rheumatology and endocrine profiles, microbiological and viral screenings. Search for enteric Campylobacter jejuni was negative. CSF protein was 160?mg/dl (normal?<?45). In serum, antiGQ1b IgG were elevated. On admission, electrophysiology was normal. Twenty days later, in motor nerves conduction velocity was normal whereas evidence of demyelination was limited to prolonged F-waves and terminal latencies. IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) produced transient improvement. Because of relapse of sensory symptoms, 10 days later a course of PE was performed with benefit. Patient was followed clinically during six months showing almost complete recovery. In conclusion, we report an acute neuropathy with benign course, high protein in CSF, predominant involvement of sensory fibers, electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination. The nosologic position of this case seems to fit the criteria of GBS sensory variant. The detection in serum of antiGQ1b IgG proposes similarities with FS and with ataxic GBS suggesting a continuity and a possible common autoimmune mechanism attacking either Schwann cells or motor axons.

AB  - The aim of this study is to report changes in muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) and other cardiovascular variables during central apnea occurring during a relaxed wakefulness. We describe a 47-year-old man with a five-year history of apnea. Polysomnographic recording showed repeated central apnea, without an obstructive peripheral component, during sleep or relaxed wakefulness. Neuromuscular disease was excluded by EMG investigation. During relaxed wake, MSA was evaluated by a microneurographic recording from the left peroneal nerve in association with blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), thoracoabdominal respiration and sympathetic skin response (SSR). Microneurographic polygraphic recording was performed during normal respiration (5 minutes) and during repeated apnea episodes (4 consecutive episodes with mean duration of 26.2?s; range 18?45). During normal respiration, MSA was 39.5 burst/min and 64.7 bursts/100 heartbeats, the heart rate was 61.1 beat/min. During the apnea episodes, both MSA (29% and 27%: 50.9 burst/min e 82.1 bursts/100 heartbeats respectively; mean values) and HR (1%: 61.9 beat/min; mean values) increased. The maximum MSA and HR increase was reached at the end of apnea and was followed by a BP increase. Spontaneous SSR were absent during apnea episodes whereas sporadic responses were recorded after the apnea episodes when the breathing acts were wide and prolonged. In conclusion, central apnea caused an increase in MSA and minor increase in HR leading to a BP increase following the apnea episode.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.

AB  - Recent studies of the low abundant signaling lipid, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), reveal an intriguingly diverse list of downstream pathways, the intertwined relationship between PI(3,5)P2 and PI5P, as well as links to neurodegenerative diseases. Derived from the structural lipid phosphatidylinositol, PI(3,5)P2 is dynamically generated on multiple cellular compartments where interactions with an increasing list of effectors regulate many cellular pathways. A complex of proteins that includes Fab1/PIKfyve, Vac14, and Fig4/Sac3 mediates the biosynthesis of PI(3,5)P2, and mutations that disrupt complex function and/or formation cause profound consequences in cells. Surprisingly, mutations in this pathway are linked with neurological diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Future studies of PI(3,5)P2 and PI5P are likely to expand the roles of these lipids in regulation of cellular functions, as well as provide new approaches for treatment of some neurological diseases.

AB  - A process of motor units (MU) rearrangement may compensate the loss of motor neurons in spinal cord anterior horns in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), at least in the early stages of the disease. Standard electromyography is unable to precisely quantify these pathological changes. Recently, Motor Unit Number Estimation (MUNE) has been introduced in clinical practice in order to provide a quantitative measure of the process as well as short- and long-term follow-up data. We investigated 8 male patients (mean age?±?SD: 64?±?10.9?yrs, range 45?78) affected by definite or probable ALS according to El Escorial Criteria. In order to quantify the total number of motor units, MUNE was performed during the diagnostic work-up (basal, T0), after three (T1) and six months (T2), in abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. We found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (16.6% at T1 [p?<?0.002] and 37.9% at T2 [p?<?0.04]), recording from ADM, while the decrease in mean and maximal area did not reach the statistical significance at the same time intervals. Similarly, we found a significant decrease in the mean number of motor units (20.6% at T1 [p?<?0.008] and 40.3% at T2 [p?<?0.0006]), but not in the mean and maximal area, recording from TA. According to previous data, we found about a loss of about 50% motor units in both the muscles six months after diagnosis. We conclude that MUNE is a useful tool to quantify MU loss in ALS and may result helpful in following the course of ALS and in predicting the prognosis.

AB  - In the nervous system nitric oxide (NO) has been involved as a regulatory molecule in several physiological and pathological events, such as cerebral microcirculation, synaptic plasticity, neural damage, and neuroprotection. The activation of the three isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS): neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS), synthesize NO from L-arginine. Moreover, in response to inflammatory stimuli, iNOS can produce copious amounts of NO for prolonged periods that triggers cell death by either necrosis or apoptosis. This has been considered as a key process in demyelination of both CNS and PNS with a destructive and/or protective controversial role. This study shows by Northern blot analysis that during experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), at the beginning of clinical signs, there is a transient extensive iNOS mRNA induction in nerve roots, which morphology is characterized by severe demyelination, but not in sciatic nerve, where scattered axonal degeneration is evident. Immunocytochemistry performed on teased nerve fibers and ultrastructural analysis showed that iNOS was localized in both inflammatory and Schwann cells, and analysis of cell membrane permeability detected with fluorescent dyes showed a diffuse necrotic phenotype in PNS. With EAN clinical spontaneous recovery, endoneurial iNOS was rapidly down-regulated and in nerve roots almost all cells shifted their membrane permeability to an apoptotic phenotype, whilst necrosis persisted in sciatic nerve, until complete clinical recovery, when both root and nerve returned normal. These data support the hypothesis that, during cell-mediated demyelination, iNOS may influence Schwann cell-axon relationship causing axonal damage and regulating endoneurial cell life and death.

AB  - Antibodies to different neural antigens have been reported in patients with dysimmune neuropathies but their pathogenetic role in these diseases is still debated. In order to identify other possible protein target antigens in these diseases we tested by immunoblot IgG and IgM reactivity with human cauda equina and spinal cord in the sera from 30 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 14 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and 11 with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). As controls we examined sera from 11 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 68 with other neurological and non-neurological diseases (OND) and 28 normal subjects. We found high titers (>1/800) of IgG antibodies to some protein bands of the approximate molecular weight (MW) of 45?50?kDa in spinal cord but not cauda equina, in 20 patients (67%) with GBS, and 1 each with MMN and CIDP (9% and 7%, respectively)(GBS vs. MMN/CIDP p?<?0.05). In 16?GBS positive patients this reactivity was re-tested and found reduced during recovery. A similar IgG reactivity with the 45?50?kDa bands was found in 2 patients (18%) with ALS (GBS vs. ALS p?<?0.05), 15 (23%) with OND (GBS vs. OND p?<?0.001) and in no normal subject. Since the MW of reactive bands corresponded to that of Glial Fibrillar Acidic Protein (GFAP), we tested the serum from 6 intensely positive GBS patients (titers of 1/6400 up to 1/12800) for IgG reactivity with purified GFAP by immunoblot. In four of them IgG bound to GFAP in a pattern similar to that observed with a commercial anti-GFAP antibody. Pre-incubation of one of these sera with purified GFAP completely abolished IgG reactivity with GFAP by immunoblot. This study shows that anti-GFAP IgG antibodies are significantly increased during the acute phase of GBS and decrease during recovery. Further investigation is necessary to clarify their possible pathogenetic role in the disease.

AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MM) is a new generation immunosuppressant, which has been successfully used for treatment of renal, heart and liver transplants, and other immune-mediated diseases. MM is also a safe and steroid-sparing agent for treating neuromuscular diseases, like chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and myastenia gravis. MM is an ester of mycophenolic acid, an agent that inhibits the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Side effects are modest and there is a lower risk for late malignancies than other immunosuppressive drugs. We assessed MM in the treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The therapy of MMN largely depends upon the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). IVIg induce and maintain improvement in MMN, but they do not eradicate the disease and are very expensive. No randomized controlled trials are available to indicate whether immunosuppressive agents are beneficial in MMN. We treated with MM four patients who fulfilled the clinical, laboratory and electrodiagnostic criteria for MMN, aiming to assess whether the drug is safe and may help in reducing or discontinuing IVIg infusion in this disease. MM administration, at 1?g twice daily, was started when patients were still under IVIg treatment and showed minimal or no disability, as judged by the INCAT disability scale. At the third month of MM therapy, IVIg infusion was discontinued in 2 patients and reduced by 20 % in 2 patients. After a follow up ranging from 1 to 6 months, no worsening in the INCAT disability scale was observed in all the patients. One patient discontinued the medication after four months because of gastrointestinal discomfort with diarrhea, weight loss and increased amylase/lipase levels. The promising response to MM and the lack of major side effects, warrant further multicentric controlled trials in MMN.

AB  - A 41-year-old man suffered for 1 year of severe progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy that rendered him bedridden in few months. Routine laboratory investigations, including serum protein immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation, were normal. Electrophysiological studies and sural nerve biopsy showed a severe mixed axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy. X-ray showed multiple osteosclerotic lesions in the spine. MRI disclosed pachymeningeal thickening of the brain and meningeal infiltration at cauda equina level with gadolinium enhancement. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 12% of plasma cells with a monotypic immunocytochemical profile for lambda light chain. A diagnosis of osteosclerotic myeloma (OM) was done. He received two courses of IVIg followed by melphalan and prednisone without any benefit. Very recently he underwent a bone marrow autotransplantation. OM is a rare variant of multiple myeloma, representing less than 3% of all myeloma cases. In contrast to multiple myeloma, in OM half of patients have a peripheral neuropathy similar to CIDP, with or without features of POEMS syndrome. MRI meningeal involvement, concomitant with a severe neuropathy, was not yet described in OM. A paraneoplastic process in addition to a direct neoplastic infiltration may account for the severity of the disease in our patient, despite different therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Unclassified neuropathies still represent a challenge for neurologists, since in about 20?30% of patients no cause can be identified after extensive investigations. In this context, some patients sharing peculiar features have been reported as to be grouped in a single entity termed Chronic Idiopathic Axonal Polyneuropathy (CIAP). The onset occurs in middle to late adulthood, there is a predominant sensory involvement and progression is slow, usually not disabling. Electrophysiologic and pathological studies are consistent with a primary axonal injury. We describe five patients affected by adult-onset chronic ?idiopathic? axonal neuropathy with an unusual course characterized by severe disability. Onset occurred in the fifth-seventh decades with sensorimotor symptoms and signs involving both lower and upper limbs with a distal distribution. Over a 2?14 year follow-up, the disease showed a progressive course with severe muscle weakness and atrophy of semi-distal and distal muscles in all patients, and involvement of proximal muscles in four of them. Two patients died because of respiratory and heart failure. All five patients were sporadic. Extensive laboratory examination excluded identifiable causes of neuropathy. Nerve biopsy was carried out in all patients and showed an axonal neuropathy. Amyloid deposits were not observed in nerve sections nor in abdominal fat aspirate. In four patients, treatment with steroids and IVIg was unsuccessful. The nosology of acquired adult-onset axonal polyneuropathies is difficult to be drawn, since in most cases the etiology remains obscure. Our findings suggest that, in this not yet well defined group of neuropathies, different subtypes may exist and represent distinct entities.

AB  - We describe two first cousins presenting a CMT phenotype associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) in one of them. The propositus (ML), a 37-year-old man, showed a severe muscular involvement both proximal and distal, bilateral ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, hypophonia, bilateral pes cavus and absence of deep tendon reflexes (DTR). The cousin (MC), a 27-year-old man, showed a CMT phenotype with marked peroneal atrophy, pes cavus and absence of DTR. Cranial nerves were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed in the propositus, a severe axonal and demyelinating neuropathy and clear myopathic features at EMG. Accordingly, muscle biopsy showed both signs of mitochondrial myopathy and chronic denervation. Furthermore, nerve biopsy confirmed the severe axonal loss and showed abnormalities of myelin sheath which was thinner in relation to the axon diameter. In MC the electrophysiological study and the muscle and nerve biopsies showed only signs of a marked axonal neuropathy. Genetic analysis showed in the propositus a new homozygous mutation in POLG gene that encodes the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. The same mutation was present in the heterozygous state in his parents and in MC. Moreover, the recent observation that mutations in GDAP1 gene could be associated with both axonal and demyelinating autosomal recessive CMT, prompted us to search for point mutations in this gene. However, the direct sequencing of GDAP1 gene did not show any mutation. In conclusion we describe two cousins presumably affected by an axonal autosomal recessive CMT. The presence in the propositus of the homozygous mutation of polymerase gamma gene adds to the CMT phenotype the myopathic features and PEO. It is questionable if in ML the axon hypomyelination could depend on the POLG gene mutation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with both IgM paraproteinemia and anti-MAG antibody (MAG-PN) is regarded as a clinical entity distinct from chronic inflammatory demyelinating PN (CIDP) even in association with paraproteinemia. MAG-PN satisfy current electrophysiological criteria for CIDP and 18 to 37 % of patients fulfilling these criteria have high titers of IgM anti-MAG antibody (Ab). Anti-MAG Ab assay is rather expensive and time consuming, thus resulting sometimes in delaying the appropriate treatment in patients without these Ab. On the contrary, patients with MAG-PN may be treated inappropriately before anti-MAG Ab detection. OBJECTIVE: Determining the predictive value of clinical and electrophysiological features of patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN for the presence of anti-MAG Ab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 49 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for CIDP established by Rotta et?al. (2001) were prospectively included. All of them were submitted to anti-MAG Ab assay and research of paraproteinemia. The following features at the initial evaluation were considered for the analysis: presence of distal or proximal weakness at limbs, asymmetry of motor deficit, presence of sensory ataxia, presence of vibration or pinprick sense deficit, presence of conduction blocks, low terminal latency index (TLI) in at least two nerves at upper limbs, absence of M-response (CMAP) at lower limbs. A discriminative analysis method was used to determine which features were significantly associated with the presence of anti-MAG Ab, then sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio of these features were calculated. RESULTS: Low TLI, absence of CMAP at lower limbs, absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs, were the features significantly associated with the presence of anti-;MAG Ab. The combination of low TLI in two nerves and absence of CMAP at lower limbs or low TLI and absence of proximal and distal weakness at lower limbs had the greatest sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio, resulting in a very high increase in probability that a patient had MAG-PN. DISCUSSION: Low TLI value in at least two upper limb nerves, absence of CMAP and of proximal weakness at lower limbs are the most informative features indicating the presence of anti-MAG Ab in patients with chronic dysimmune demyelinating PN.

AB  - We report a case of a 50- year-old patient, diagnosed as having mycosis fungoides since 1 year, was admitted to our Hospital for progressive weakness and sensory loss in upper and lower limbs. On neurological examination, moderate weakness of the distal muscles of upper and lower limbs, ataxia, loss of proprioceptive and tactile sensation of the hands and foot and diffuse areflexia were noticed. The electrophysiological evaluation revealed signs of prevalent axonal sensory-motor polyradiculoneuropathy and the cerebrospinal fluid showed a marked increase of proteins and a mild increase of cells. A biopsy of the sural nerve revealed a severe axonal loss with preservation of myelin. The possible pathogenetic mechanism of this extremely rare peripheral neuropathy and the differences from previous reports are discussed.

AB  - The availability of antibodies against the pan-axonal marker protein-gene-protein 9.5 (PGP) allowed to definitely demonstrate the existence of small-diameter nerve fibers within the vital layers of the epidermis and prompted to their quantification in sensory neuropathies. However, morphological features of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) have not been fully characterized. We performed immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies in skin biopsies taken in 15 healthy subjects at the proximal thigh or the distal leg using anti-PGP, anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), anti-non-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein-1B (MAP-1B), anti-70 and 200?kDa neurofilament (NF), anti-phosphorylated neurofilament-312 (SMI), anti-peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22), anti-basic myelin protein (MBP), and anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies. IENF density was quantified under light microscope using PGP, TuJ1, MAP-1B, NF, and SMI immunostaining. In each site, the density of TuJ1- and MAP-1B-positive IENF was similar to that of PGP-positive IENF, whereas that of NF-positive IENF was significantly lower. Only sporadic SMI-positive IENF were found. Double confocal staining studies confirmed that TuJ1 and MAP-1B diffusely co-localized with PGP in IENF. These findings suggest that IENF cytoskeleton is predominantly composed by tubules, whereas neurofilaments are less represented. No IENF showed PMP22, MBP, or MAG labeling. All dermal nerve fibers presented PMP22 immunoreactivity, which labeled Schwann cell membrane, whereas only a few of them were MBP- or MAG-positive, confirming that most fibers are unmyelinated. Double staining confocal microscope studies revealed that PMP22 labeling in dermal nerves stopped at the dermal-epidermal junction, whereas TuJ1-positive axons crossed it and run between keratinocytes. This definitely demonstrates that IENF are naked axons, arising from sub-papillary unmyelinated nerves which loose the Schwann cell at the dermal-epidermal junction. The presence of naked nerve fibers within the epidermis suggests that functional interactions with the resident cells, even in sensory transduction, might exist.

AB  - It is well known that painful neuropathy of the small fiber type is frequent in Fabry disease, however it has been rarely investigated in childhood. We report an 11-year-old boy without known familial history of neuromuscular diseases, who complained of painful symptoms in the lower extremities by age 9. Initially pain was present only in association with fever, but during the last year it was triggered also by mild variations in the environmental temperature, so that the boy, to prevent pain, was forced to stay barefooted for most the time during spring and summer, and to wear at least two or three pairs of socks during winter. Physical and neurological examination was negative, except for several small red spots in the testes. Neurophysiological study was negative, but EMG showed motor unit potentials with possible myopathic pattern. Muscle biopsy was unremarkable, apart from endothelial cells containing electron dense lipid inclusions of regular lamellar structure, which were seen also in skin biopsy within fibroblasts, pericytes and endothelial cells. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density was within normal limits (5.5/mm at distal leg and 8.3/mm at proximal thigh), but prominent axonal swellings (possible predegenerative changes) were frequently seen. Diagnosis of Fabry disease was confirmed by deficiency of alfa-galactosidase. Symptomatic treatment with gabapentin was started, in addition to enzyme replacement therapy. Symptoms of small fiber neuropathy in Fabry disease may be present in early disease as an onset manifestation, and the occurrence of small fiber neuropathy during childhood strongly suggests a diagnosis of Fabry disease. Painful symptoms may occur before a significant intraepidermal nerve fiber loss is seen, and are probably correlated to predegenerative changes in the small sensory fibers.

AB  - Introduction: Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC) is a safe and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in HIV infected patients. Its efficacy is focused on its role in modulating TNF-alpha expression and on the restoration of endogenous acetylcarnitine. Peripheral nervous system is frequently involved during HIV infection and distal sensitive polyneuropathy is one of the most common neurological complications (up to 30% of AIDS patients). Etiology is still unknown. One of the pathogenetic hypotheses is the role of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) in causing neuropathic pain. Method: Twenty HIV- positive patients affected by neuropathic pain with EMG-evidence of axonal alterations were enrolled; we excluded patients with mini-mental test score <?24, acute CMV infection, chronic demyelinating neuropathies. All patients were treated with ALC at the dose of 1 gram t.i.d. for 4 weeks. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate characteristics of patient's pain before, during, and after treatment. EMG and neurographic assessment was performed before and after treatment. To evaluate changes in VAS score we used non-parametric Friedman's test (F). Wilcoxon's test (W) was performed to timing the appearance of pain improvement, and to evaluate neurophysiological data. Results: The changes in VAS score were statistically significant during ALC treatment (mean score: before 6.7?±?2.1 ? after treatment 5.0?±?2.1)(F?=?P?<?0.001). The appearance of therapeutic effect was reached during the first week (W?=?P?<?0.03) and during the fourth week (W?=?P?<?0.05) of treatment. Analysis of neurophysiological data showed a statistically significant improvement of peroneal nerve motor parameters: reduced motor distal latency (W?=?P?<?0.02), increased amplitude of the compound motor action potential at distal (W?=?P?<?0.02) and proximal (W?=?P?<?0.05) site of stimulation. Conclusions: Our data show the efficacy of ALC in the treatment of neuropathic pain, confirming previous results. Moreover, the analgesic effects appear during the first week of treatment according with pre-clinical data in different experimental models of pain. Among mechanisms for ALC efficacy in patients with HIV-related polyneuropathy, there is a neurotrophic effect as evidenced from patch-skin biopsy evaluation.

AB  - We describe a 64-year-old patient complaining of progressive gait disturbance, referred to the compressive effect of multiple discal protrusions, for about 3 years. At the age of 62 he presented epileptic seizures during a febrile episode. Cerebral MRI showed bilateral frontobasal T2-weighted hyperintensity involving cortex and white matter. Partial seizures reappeared one year later and a MRI revealed a mild frontobasal atrophy. At the moment of our observation, neurological examination showed waddling gait with bilateral foot drop, muscular atrophy and weakness limited to the gluteal muscles and widespread deep tendon areflexia. Nerve conduction studies showed absent F-waves at both upper and lower limb examination, with normal distal sensorimotor nerve conduction. Needle EMG examination detected mild chronic partial denervation, predominant in proximal muscles of lower limbs. Somatosensory evoked potentials recorded from upper extremities showed bilateral increase in early latencies (N9). Overall, neurophysiological findings indicated a widespread radiculopathy. Serum exams revealed positive anti-nucleus (1:640, granular). CSF examination detected increased IgG level and several oligoclonal bands. Chest radiogram was normal. Soon after our first observation, the patient showed symptoms of respiratory insufficiency. A CT scans revealed a thoracic mass compatible with microcytoma, whereas anti-Hu (3?+) antibodies and increased NSE (neuronal specific enolase) titer were found. In the following two weeks, the patient showed a progressive worsening of the general clinical conditions and died. We interpreted this complex neurological picture, which included an atypical limbic encephalitis and a slowly progressive polyradiculopathy, as a paraneoplastic syndrome. The almost complete resolution of the encephalitic process and the subtle chronic involvement of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by a limited, though widespread, radicular impairment, are rather peculiar features.
