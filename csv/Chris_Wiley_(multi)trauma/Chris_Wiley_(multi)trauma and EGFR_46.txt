AB  - The aim of this study is to report changes in muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) and other cardiovascular variables during central apnea occurring during a relaxed wakefulness. We describe a 47-year-old man with a five-year history of apnea. Polysomnographic recording showed repeated central apnea, without an obstructive peripheral component, during sleep or relaxed wakefulness. Neuromuscular disease was excluded by EMG investigation. During relaxed wake, MSA was evaluated by a microneurographic recording from the left peroneal nerve in association with blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), thoracoabdominal respiration and sympathetic skin response (SSR). Microneurographic polygraphic recording was performed during normal respiration (5 minutes) and during repeated apnea episodes (4 consecutive episodes with mean duration of 26.2?s; range 18?45). During normal respiration, MSA was 39.5 burst/min and 64.7 bursts/100 heartbeats, the heart rate was 61.1 beat/min. During the apnea episodes, both MSA (29% and 27%: 50.9 burst/min e 82.1 bursts/100 heartbeats respectively; mean values) and HR (1%: 61.9 beat/min; mean values) increased. The maximum MSA and HR increase was reached at the end of apnea and was followed by a BP increase. Spontaneous SSR were absent during apnea episodes whereas sporadic responses were recorded after the apnea episodes when the breathing acts were wide and prolonged. In conclusion, central apnea caused an increase in MSA and minor increase in HR leading to a BP increase following the apnea episode.

AB  - At least 15 genetic loci and ten genes have been associated with the demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy and related disorders. As pathogenic mutations have been identified in more and more genes, the labor and expense of screening for such mutations has increased substantially. Using conventional methods such as direct sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or heteroduplex analysis, molecular diagnosis of CMT remains laborious due to the large number of exons to be screened. Some genes (MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, GJB1) are small and have to be analyzed in a relatively large number of patients while other rarer genes, such as periaxin (PRX, 19q13), are too large (7 exons encoding transcripts of 4.8?5.5 kilobases) to be easily included in a molecular diagnostic panel. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the more economical techniques (SSCP and heteroduplex analysis) is far from being optimal (?). Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) is a newly developed method to scan DNA for mutations, which is capable of automated high-throughput analysis that does not require modified PCR primers, specific reagent arrays or detection labels, or any sample pretreatment other than PCR. We have undertaken the mutational analysis of some genes associated with CMT1 and related neuropathies by using DHPLC. Optimal conditions have been determined for DHPLC analysis of MPZ, PMP22, GJB1 and PRX genes in an initial group of 30 patients with severe demyelinating neuropathy, negative for the common 17p11 duplication. The very high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by analyzing a control group of patients with known mutations in the MPZ, PMP22 and GJB1 genes. The work is still in progress. Thus far, DHPLC has resolved all the mutations previously detected by sequencing and allowed the identification of a number of polymorphic variants in the PRX gene and a novel disease mutation in MPZ gene exon 4 in a patient with an intermediate (axonal-demyelinating) form of CMT. Interestingly, this mutation had consistently appeared as homozygous at previous direct sequencing analysis. DHPLC clearly showed the heterozygous state of the mutation, thus demonstrating the power of this technique also in identifying sequencing artifact or mutation mosaicism, if any.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive focus on 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) as candidate molecule in a variety of pathophysiological conditions occurring in humans is here provided. Despite an active, now well characterized, metabolism in most cells and tissues, HNE can be easily detected and quantified by means of several methods, although with different sensitivity. Measurements of HNE and/or stable metabolites in biological fluids are already applied as lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress markers in a huge number of human disease processes, often sustained by inflammatory reactions. A primary involvement of this aldehydic product of membrane lipid oxidation in inflammation-related events, as well as in regulation of cell proliferation and growth, in necrotic or apoptotic cell death, appears supported by its marked ability to modulate several major pathways of cell signaling and, consequently, gene expression. The actual knowledge of HNE reactivity, metabolism, signaling and modulatory effect in the various human organs should provide a solid background to the investigation of the aldehyde's contribution to the pathogenesis of human major chronic diseases and would likely promote advanced and oriented applications not only in diagnosis and prevention but also in molecular treatment of human diseases. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a monophasic illness. Early nadir and lack of multiple relapses have differentiated it from the chronic form (CIDP). We present a case whose unusual course overlaps both disorders. A 71-year-old man presented with paresthesiae and weakness evolving over 1-week period, 2 weeks after an upper respiratory infection. Spinal fluid analysis and electrophysiologic findings supported the clinical diagnosis of GBS. He was treated with a 5-day course of IVIG with rapid, almost complete recovery over the following 10 days. Four weeks later, his symptoms recurred. Another dose of IVIG produced rapid but transient improvement. He was started on oral steroids but continued to deteriorate. Clinical and laboratory reevaluation confirmed the presence of an inflammatory polyradiculopathy; IVIG was resumed. Over the following 3 months, his clinical course was characterized by 3 increasingly severe deteriorations, the last one to quadriplegia, severe bulbar dysfunction requiring tracheostomy and PEG placement, ophthalmoplegia and autonomic dysfunction. Transient improvements occurred between these relapses. Aggressive treatment, which included IVIG, plasma exchange, IV steroids and IV cyclophosphamide, did not produce sustained benefit. He remained pseudo-locked-in for 10 days. Another 5-day IVIG course was completed; he began to improve and continued to do so over the following 5 weeks. The nadir of GBS is usually reached within 4 weeks. Treatment fluctuations usually occur within the first weeks, and relapse during the recovery phase is often limited and isolated. Multiple relapses until a defined nadir are highly uncommon. The bulbar and cranial nerve involvement, rapidity of the relapses, dysautonomia, need for mechanical ventilation, and improving electrophysiology all argue against the diagnosis of CIDP. It remains unknown whether repeated doses of IVIG could change the natural course of this disease leading to such an unusual temporal profile.

AB  - Nerve injuries associated with surgical operations are well recognized and described in literature. Ulnar neuropathy, brachial plexus, and lumbosacral roots injuries are the most frequent as shown by two large reviews on anesthesia-related nerve damage from the American Society of Anesthesiologists closed claims study (Kroll DA 1990, Cheney FW 1999). Several factors such as section, compression, traction, and ischemia, contribute to the nerve injuries but the exact mechanism(s) in an individual case often is unclear. We describe a case of perioperative bilateral median neuropathy at the distal forearm, an uncommon site of nerve injury, which we ascribe to demyelinative conduction block secondary to nerve compression. Nerve conduction studies precisely localized the area of abnormality. There is a limited understanding of the relationships between conventional perioperative care and the genesis of peripheral nerve lesions. As a result, there is a lack of agreement in literature on the correct standards for positioning the patient during anesthesia. In selected cases nerve conduction studies at the onset of symptoms may provide insights into localization, mechanism and prognosis of nerve lesions. We believe that a timely and proper electrophysiological study may be helpful for understanding the perioperative nerve injuries as well as for determining the best preventive strategies.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects and its efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in patients with ischemic stroke. We investigated its efficacy in preventing and reversing established nerve disorders in streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes. After STZ injection (60?mg/kg/ip), EPO (5000 units/kg b.w. i.p. three times a week) was started in a group of rats and continued for five weeks (prevention schedule). In another group of diabetic rats, EPO was started six weeks after STZ, continued for five weeks (therapeutic schedule). Groups of non-diabetic control rats were similarly treated. Antidromic nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in the tail was assessed at five weeks for all groups and at 11 weeks for the therapeutic schedule. Compared to non-diabetic rats, NCV was 21% lower (P?<?0.001) at five weeks in the STZ group, EPO partially prevented this decrease (14% lower than with non-diabetic controls), with a significant difference from the untreated-diabetic group (P?<?0.01). After six weeks of uncontrolled diabetes, at the beginning of therapeutic EPO, NCV was reduced by 23% and after 11 weeks by 40%, EPO efficacy was confirmed. Thermal (hot plate method) and mechanical (Randall-Selitto method) nociceptive thresholds were monitored weekly throughout the study. In addition, in all groups, the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers, which reflects possible degeneration of somatic unmyelinated fibers, was assessed in the hindpaw using protein-gene-product 9.5 immunostaining. Rats developed mechanical hyperalgesia within two weeks after STZ injection. Both the prevention and therapeutic schedules of EPO reduced diabetic hyperalgesia after two weeks of treatment, reaching statistical significance at fur, and five weeks of treatment, with no such effect in non-diabetic controls. Hindpaw thermal response latencies were significantly (P?<?0.001) increased in untreated diabetic rats compared with untreated controls. EPO had no effect on these latencies in control rats but partially prevented the increase in diabetic rats, so the values were still different from controls, but significantly different from untreated diabetics at four and five weeks in both the prevention and therapeutic studies (P?<?0.05). These observations extend the therapeutic utility of EPO and highlight its potential for treating established diabetic neuropathies.

AB  - Several effective antineoplastic drugs are severely neurotoxic and induce the onset of disabling peripheral neuropathies. The clinical presentation of this side effect depends on the type of antineoplastic agent administered. The signs and symptoms shown are predominantly motor (e.g. in the case of vinca alkaloids), sensorimotor (e.g. with the taxanes) or sensory (e.g. using platinum-derived drugs). The pathogenesis of these antineoplastic drug-induced peripheral neuropathies is still poorly understood, although a relationship has been suggested between some neuronal growth factors (neurotrophins) and the toxic action of cisplatin (CDDP) and paclitaxel. In this study we correlated the changes in the circulating levels of Nerve Growth factor (NGF) in a series of 24 women affected by locally advanced squamous cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy with the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) as assessed by the Total Neuropathy Score (TNS). After informed consent, blood samples were drawn before chemotherapy and after treatment and NGF circulating levels were determined by ELISA (EmaxTM ImmunoAssay System, Promega, USA; plasma working dilutions NGF 1:80) following the manufacturer protocols. The results obtained in this series of patients evidenced a significant correlation between the severity of CIPN and the reduction in the circulating levels of NGF (r?=???0.480, p?=?0.017 by two-tailed Spearman correlation test, 95% CL ?0.745 to ?0.082), thus confirming similar results previously obtained in a rat model of CDDP peripheral neurotoxicity. In conclusion, our data suggest that a relationship exists between CIPN and NGF circulating levels in patients treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel. Therefore, this preliminary observation support the need for further studies in order to explore the possibility of reducing the severity of platinum-drug sensory neurotoxicity with treatments aimed at increasing the circulating levels of NGF.

AB  - To our knowledge there are no evidence of other multientrapment neuropathy related to growth hormone (GH) administration. We observed the case of a 45 year-old bodybuilder complaining of paraesthesias and dysaesthesias in hands and feet after self-administration of high-dose of recombinant GH therapy. The patient complained of these transitory symptoms after each cycle of GH therapy. Electrodiagnostic studies showed: 1)?moderate? right CTS and ?minimal? left CTS; 2)?mild? right ulnar entrapment at elbow; 3) decrease in left ulnar motor nerve conduction in the segment across the elbow; 4) decrease in left ulnar sensory nerve action potential amplitude; and 5) bilateral absence of ulnar nerve F-wave from abductor digiti minimi. Our data suggested multiple nerve entrapment at upper limbs. Moreover, basing on the history of feet paraesthesia, we hypothesized a mild involvement of distal sensory fibers in the legs, which was not assessed by neurophysiological studies. The anecdotal history and neurophysiological findings of this case suggest that more attention should be paid to the adverse effects of GH on peripheral nerves.

AB  - Autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have been transferred with third generation lentiviral vectors, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the human PGK promoter, and transplanted in wild type mice. Transplanted mice have been sacrificed at 6, and 9 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to study the timing and extent of migration of BM derived transduced cells into peripheral nervous system (PNS). Starting from 6 months after BMT cells have been found in the PNS, such as in the acoustic ganglion, the dorsal root ganglions (DRG) and the sciatic nerve. At 9 months from transplant GFP positive cells represented the 50?60% of the F4/80 (a microglial marker) positive population of sciatic nerve sections and the 65?75% of F4/80?+ cells of the acoustic ganglion and DRG. At these sites, GFP positive cells were found between nerve fibers and neurons, they expressed F4/80, and were negative for GFAP, neuronal and myelin markers. Autologous BMT coupled with HSC transduction with high efficiency vectors could provide therapeutic benefit to several disorders affecting the PNS such as many lysosomal storage disorders. In these patients clinical evidence confirms the relevance of PNS involvement in the prognosis of the disease.

AB  - Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for the treatment of gouty arthritis, Beh√ßet's disease and amyloidosis. Reported side effects, such as blood dyscrasias and gastroenteritis, are probably ascribed to its antimitotic properties. Colchicine-induced myopathy with vacuolar changes and frequently associated sensory-motor axonal neuropathy have also been described. A 52-yr-old woman, previously treated for gouty arthritis, persisted in self-administering colchicine intermittently for three years, in order to reduce body weight by inducing diarrhea. The patient had weakness and hypotrophy in upper and lower girdles and proximal muscles, ?stocking and glove? hypoesthesia and loss of deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs. EMG examination showed a neurogenic/myogenic mixed pattern and nerve conduction studies were consistent with sensory-motor axonal polyneuropathy. Muscle biopsy showed a vacuolar myopathy, with autophagic vacuoles and associated neurogenic changes. A moderate loss of myelinated fibers and some degenerating axons were observed in sural nerve biopsy. There were neither demyelinating changes nor autophagic vacuoles within axons. Muscle and nerve findings were thus suggestive of colchicine neuromyopathy. The drug was withdrawn and clinical-electrophysiological data improved. Colchicine muscular toxicity is presumably due to inhibition of tubulin monomer polymerization. The microtubular network destabilization might cause cytoplasmic deposits of autophagic debris in skeletal muscle. We thus evaluated number, density and spatial array of microtubules in myelinated and unmyelinated axons by transmission electron microscopy. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis was carried out on high magnification photographs in our patient biopsy and in control nerves (normal and with axonal loss). Decrease of microtubular density and increase of tangentially oriented microtubules were observed both in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. No neural deposits of tubulin-like material, as described in some cases of colchicine myopathy, were found. As in experimental vincristine neuropathy, cytoskeletal damage induced by colchicine seems related to effects of primary microtubular disarray on axonal transport and caliber, rather than to the extent of axonal loss.

AB  - Platinum compounds are very effective anti-cancer agents and act forming adducts with DNA and cytoplasmic proteins. Their main dose-limiting side effect is peripheral neurotoxicity. Cisplatin neurotoxicity has been studied in many in vitro and in vivo models but little information is available for oxaliplatin. In this study we evaluated and compared the effect of cisplatin and oxaliplatin (a gift from Debiopharm S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) in an in vitro model of neurotoxicity using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which may be considered as neuroblasts. Both platinum compounds are toxic and induce cellular death by apoptosis. Oxaliplatin is less neurotoxic than cisplatin. Concentrations of oxaliplatin 3?4 times higher than those of cisplatin are necessary to induce the same percentage of cellular death. We analyzed the activation/inactivation of specific molecules involved in the apoptotic transduction pathway. After exposure to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly reduced and thus could not exert its anti-apoptotic action. Conversely, the pro-apoptotic proteins p53, caspase 3, and caspase 7 were activated. In our experiments in SH-SY5Y cells treated with cisplatin or oxaliplatin, the amount of p53 protein was markedly increased. In treated cultures, both caspase 3 and 7 were cleaved with the appearance of their active fragments which induced PARP cleavage. Our results suggest that neurotoxicity of cisplatin and oxaliplatin share a similar pathway. Neurotoxicity induced by platinum compounds is due not only to DNA damage but also to the activation of specific molecular pathways committing cells to apoptosis.

AB  - A 69-year-old right-handed man was recently referred to our institution with a two-month history of diplopia and ptosis in his left eye: the ocular symptoms typically fluctuates during the day, being least severe in the morning and worsening as the day progress or while reading or driving. Neostigmine injection produced a clear improvement of weakness. The serum concentration of anti-AChR antibody was elevated >?8.4?nmol/L (NV?<?0.4); a chest CT scan was unremarkable with no evidence of mediastinal mass. The clinical picture and laboratory tests support the diagnosis of ocular myasthenia. His past medical history was insignificant until the age of 59. At that time, he complained with a diffuse, slightly asymmetrical muscle weakness both in the upper and lower limbs and sensory symptoms of glove and stocking distribution (numbness). A progressive course over months was seen with hand and anterior leg muscles hypertrophy becoming evident. Strength was decreased distally greater than proximally in the upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent. The cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a protein level of 72?mg/dl (NV?<?45?mg/dl). Nerve conduction study showed a multifocal sensory-motor polyneuropathy with both conduction block/temporal dispersion of the C-MAP and slowing of the velocity. A diagnosis of chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) was considered and the patient was treated with steroids, plasmapheresis and azathiaprine: after a slight improvement, the condition has been stabilized. Both MG and CIDP have been individually associated with disorders of presumed autoimmune pathogenesis. Their concurrence is rarely found (less than 10 cases to the best of our knowledge): although the existence of this syndrome can be strongly supported by the clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory data, a common basic abnormality of immune regulation is still unknown.

AB  - *Software NEUROPA based on the ?consensus? Committee for standardization of measurements on polyneuropathy of the Gruppo di Studio Sistema Nervoso Periferico (Antonimi G, Cavaletti G, Di Iorio G Fabrizi G, Galardi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Ghirlanda P, Lori S, Nobile-Orazio E, Padua L, Scarpini E, Schenone A, Tonali P, Uncini A, Vita G). Kind of study: survey prospective multicentric multidimensional study. Aim of the study: to evaluate the characteristic (including disability and Health Related Quality of life - HRQoL) a representative sample of patients with suspected, or diagnosed, polyneuropathy (or multineuropathy) admitted in neurological centers. The HRQoL dimension of the study was developed with the collaboration of the Quality of Life Study group of the Italian Neurological Society. Timing: The period of enrollment started on 1-10-02 e will end on 30-01-03. Acquired data: Besides clinical data we acquire data on the diagnostic pathway the patients have done, disability, HRQoL. All the data are monthly sent to the Department of Neuroscience of Universit√† Cattolica where statistical analysis will be performed. Conclusion: The acquired data will provide information on 1) the frequency of the different type of disease we have to study in the different kind of centers; 2) the clinical picture and the actual involvement in daily activity of this kind of patients and therefore the priority we have to give them; 3) the necessities of the neurological centers where this kind of patients are admitted and therefore what we have to requests to the national and regional sanitary service to better study this kind of patients and to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. # Antonini G, Bacci A, Cardinali P, Cavalletti G, Cocito D, Corbo, Di Iorio, Fabrizi GM, Fazio R, Galassi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Girlanda P, Insola A, Liguori R, Maggio M, Mazzeo A, Messina C, Murasecco D, Nemni R, Nobile Orazio E, Pareyson D, Porazzi D, Quattrini A, Ragno M, Rizzuto N, Romano M, Santoro L, Sartucci F, Sabatelli M, Schenone A, Sghirlanzoni, Siciliano G, Villacara A, Vita G.

AB  - Experimental diabetic neuropathy has a number of features in common with the human disease, including a reduction of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in nerve fibers, and alteration of the essential fatty acid metabolism leading to changes in membrane composition. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial in different pathological conditions including diabetic complications. Since the PUFA composition of cell membranes largely depends on the diet, most studies have supplemented the diet with fish oil (FO), particularly rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, or DHA and EPA ethyl esters. We have prepared a new formulation of n-3 PUFA wax esters (WE) enriched in DHA and EPA that have a bioavailability comparable to oil and esters, are easily digestible and are free from most of the previous drawbacks. The present study was designed to measure Na+, K+-ATPase activity, NCV, and FA content in plasma phospholipids (PL) and to assess the preventive effect of newly formulated n-3 PUFA-WE, and individual EPA and DHA-WE (as compared with standard and FO-supplemented diets) on these abnormalities. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60?mg/kg/ip). After STZ injection, diabetic and non-diabetic control rats were fed the standard diet (St) without supplementation or supplemented with either FO or n-3 PUFA-WE or individual EPA and DHA-WE, to reach a daily dose of 0.15?g/kg, the experiment continued for five weeks. Analysis of the FA composition of plasma PL, which better reflects FA intake and content in biological membranes, showed that the sums of n-3 PUFA were double the St diet after n-3 supplement of independent of the dietary regimen, whereas those of FA of the n-6 family were not affected by n-3 supplementation. Thus, the n-6/n-3 ratios were reduced from 15:1 with the St diet to 7:1 for the FO and WE diets. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly lower in diabetic rats (?30?35%), significantly restored in diabetic rats that received FO, n-3 PUFA and EPA-WE supplementation, and partially restored by DHA-WE (9% lower than with non-diabetic controls). These effects were partially associated with a significant beneficial effect on NCV which was reduced by 20% in diabetic rats. FO protected against this decrease (3%), n-3 PUFA-WE were only partially protective (11%), and EPA and DHA-WE had scant effect. This study indicates that, like FO, n-3 PUFA-EPA and DHA-WE have beneficial effects on diabetic-induced alterations in sciatic nerve ATPase+-ATPase activity and, partially, also on NCV. The newly formulated n-3 PUFA WE offer a potential advantage over products in current use, on account of their greater stability.

AB  - A 60?y.o. female was investigated for progressive distal paresthesias, which had started a few years before. Neurological examination revealed mild sensory ataxia, areflexia in lower limbs with normal motor function. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable; autoantibodies to non-organ-specific, extractable nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were absent and CSF was normal; neurophysiologic findings showed absent sural sensory responses. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a complete depletion of large and small myelinated fibers without aspects of regeneration; no vascular or perivascular inflammation nor changes suggestive of vasculitis were detected. Salivary gland biopsy showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Late systemic manifestations included dry skin, xerophtalmia and arthralgias. Severe sensory neuropathy is rarely associated with Sj√∂gren syndrome. It occurs more frequently in female patients and its major pathologic process is believed to be a dorsal root ganglionitis.

AB  - CMT1A is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy due to increased genetic dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). The functions of PMP22 as a structural protein of peripheral myelin and a regulator of the proliferation, differentiation, shaping and apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) are well known. However, the effects of its overexpression on the molecular phenotype of SCs are still unclear. In order to detect genes that are modulated by PMP22 overexpression, we performed a cDNA microarrays experiment on PMP22 overexpressing sciatic nerves from a transgenic model of CMT1A. Differential expression of 117 known genes that are sensitive to PMP22 dosage was observed. The number of up- and down-regulated genes in the transgenic nerves was 99 and 144 respectively, of 22.000 spotted genes. In the up-regulated group, the number of known genes was 30 and the number of EST was 69. In the down-regulated group, the number of known genes was 87 and that of EST 57. We classified the differentially expressed genes into functional categories. Among these, we focused our attention on groups of down-regulated genes coding for cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins and for extracellular matrix components, like collagens. Moreover we identified a group of genes with chromosomal localization in candidate regions for demyelinating neuropathies. The differential expression of several sequences was confirmed by RT-PCR, performed both on normal and transgenic rat sciatic nerves, and on primary SCs cultures obtained from normal and CMT1A rats. Therefore, we point out the importance of the interaction between SCs and extracellular matrix and the involvement of SCs cytoskeletal organization in the pathogenesis of CMT1A. Moreover, this study suggests us new candidate genes that could be submitted to sequence analysis in demyelinating CMT.
