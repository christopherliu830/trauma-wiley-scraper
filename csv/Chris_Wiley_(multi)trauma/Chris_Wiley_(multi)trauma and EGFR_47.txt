AB  - The aim of the study is to determine the site of autonomic lesion in a patient with Holmes-Adie Syndrome (HAS) who subsequently developed generalized anhydrosis. We describe a 38-year-old woman who from age 33 showed a right pupil larger than the left and from age 34 complained of focal and, a year later, generalized anhydrosis. Neurological examination showed absent tendon reflexes and right mydriatic pupil. Brain MRI, EEG, motor and sensory conduction studies were normal. Serologic screening for autoimmune disease was negative. To determine the site of the autonomic lesion the patient underwent the following investigations: pupillary tests with a diluted solution of pilocarpine (0.062%) and adrenaline (0.1%); cardiovascular reflexes; thermoregulatory sweat test (TST); circadian rhythm of body core temperature (CRT°); sympathetic skin response (SSR); microneurography recording of skin sympathetic activity (SSA) from median and peroneal nerves, and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) from peroneal nerve; skin biopsy to evaluated the eccrine glands. Pupillary tests showed postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic denervation only of the right pupil. TST showed complete anhydrosis, SSR and SSA were absent and skin biopsy revealed normal morphology of the eccrine glands with hypotrophy of their structures. These results indicated a lesion of the postganglionic skin sympathetic fibers. Mechanisms for heat loss and conservation, cardiovascular reflexes and MSA were normal excluding a hypothalamic dysfunction or a more diffuse involvement of the autonomic nervous system. In conclusion, our patient showed a HAS associated with generalized anhydrosis and the autonomic investigations suggested underlying postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic lesions.

AB  - *Software NEUROPA based on the ?consensus? Committee for standardization of measurements on polyneuropathy of the Gruppo di Studio Sistema Nervoso Periferico (Antonimi G, Cavaletti G, Di Iorio G Fabrizi G, Galardi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Ghirlanda P, Lori S, Nobile-Orazio E, Padua L, Scarpini E, Schenone A, Tonali P, Uncini A, Vita G). Kind of study: survey prospective multicentric multidimensional study. Aim of the study: to evaluate the characteristic (including disability and Health Related Quality of life - HRQoL) a representative sample of patients with suspected, or diagnosed, polyneuropathy (or multineuropathy) admitted in neurological centers. The HRQoL dimension of the study was developed with the collaboration of the Quality of Life Study group of the Italian Neurological Society. Timing: The period of enrollment started on 1-10-02 e will end on 30-01-03. Acquired data: Besides clinical data we acquire data on the diagnostic pathway the patients have done, disability, HRQoL. All the data are monthly sent to the Department of Neuroscience of Università Cattolica where statistical analysis will be performed. Conclusion: The acquired data will provide information on 1) the frequency of the different type of disease we have to study in the different kind of centers; 2) the clinical picture and the actual involvement in daily activity of this kind of patients and therefore the priority we have to give them; 3) the necessities of the neurological centers where this kind of patients are admitted and therefore what we have to requests to the national and regional sanitary service to better study this kind of patients and to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. # Antonini G, Bacci A, Cardinali P, Cavalletti G, Cocito D, Corbo, Di Iorio, Fabrizi GM, Fazio R, Galassi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Girlanda P, Insola A, Liguori R, Maggio M, Mazzeo A, Messina C, Murasecco D, Nemni R, Nobile Orazio E, Pareyson D, Porazzi D, Quattrini A, Ragno M, Rizzuto N, Romano M, Santoro L, Sartucci F, Sabatelli M, Schenone A, Sghirlanzoni, Siciliano G, Villacara A, Vita G.

AB  - Experimental diabetic neuropathy has a number of features in common with the human disease, including a reduction of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in nerve fibers, and alteration of the essential fatty acid metabolism leading to changes in membrane composition. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial in different pathological conditions including diabetic complications. Since the PUFA composition of cell membranes largely depends on the diet, most studies have supplemented the diet with fish oil (FO), particularly rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, or DHA and EPA ethyl esters. We have prepared a new formulation of n-3 PUFA wax esters (WE) enriched in DHA and EPA that have a bioavailability comparable to oil and esters, are easily digestible and are free from most of the previous drawbacks. The present study was designed to measure Na+, K+-ATPase activity, NCV, and FA content in plasma phospholipids (PL) and to assess the preventive effect of newly formulated n-3 PUFA-WE, and individual EPA and DHA-WE (as compared with standard and FO-supplemented diets) on these abnormalities. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60?mg/kg/ip). After STZ injection, diabetic and non-diabetic control rats were fed the standard diet (St) without supplementation or supplemented with either FO or n-3 PUFA-WE or individual EPA and DHA-WE, to reach a daily dose of 0.15?g/kg, the experiment continued for five weeks. Analysis of the FA composition of plasma PL, which better reflects FA intake and content in biological membranes, showed that the sums of n-3 PUFA were double the St diet after n-3 supplement of independent of the dietary regimen, whereas those of FA of the n-6 family were not affected by n-3 supplementation. Thus, the n-6/n-3 ratios were reduced from 15:1 with the St diet to 7:1 for the FO and WE diets. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly lower in diabetic rats (?30?35%), significantly restored in diabetic rats that received FO, n-3 PUFA and EPA-WE supplementation, and partially restored by DHA-WE (9% lower than with non-diabetic controls). These effects were partially associated with a significant beneficial effect on NCV which was reduced by 20% in diabetic rats. FO protected against this decrease (3%), n-3 PUFA-WE were only partially protective (11%), and EPA and DHA-WE had scant effect. This study indicates that, like FO, n-3 PUFA-EPA and DHA-WE have beneficial effects on diabetic-induced alterations in sciatic nerve ATPase+-ATPase activity and, partially, also on NCV. The newly formulated n-3 PUFA WE offer a potential advantage over products in current use, on account of their greater stability.

AB  - A 60?y.o. female was investigated for progressive distal paresthesias, which had started a few years before. Neurological examination revealed mild sensory ataxia, areflexia in lower limbs with normal motor function. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable; autoantibodies to non-organ-specific, extractable nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were absent and CSF was normal; neurophysiologic findings showed absent sural sensory responses. Sural nerve biopsy revealed a complete depletion of large and small myelinated fibers without aspects of regeneration; no vascular or perivascular inflammation nor changes suggestive of vasculitis were detected. Salivary gland biopsy showed focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Late systemic manifestations included dry skin, xerophtalmia and arthralgias. Severe sensory neuropathy is rarely associated with Sjögren syndrome. It occurs more frequently in female patients and its major pathologic process is believed to be a dorsal root ganglionitis.

AB  - CMT1A is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy due to increased genetic dosage of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). The functions of PMP22 as a structural protein of peripheral myelin and a regulator of the proliferation, differentiation, shaping and apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) are well known. However, the effects of its overexpression on the molecular phenotype of SCs are still unclear. In order to detect genes that are modulated by PMP22 overexpression, we performed a cDNA microarrays experiment on PMP22 overexpressing sciatic nerves from a transgenic model of CMT1A. Differential expression of 117 known genes that are sensitive to PMP22 dosage was observed. The number of up- and down-regulated genes in the transgenic nerves was 99 and 144 respectively, of 22.000 spotted genes. In the up-regulated group, the number of known genes was 30 and the number of EST was 69. In the down-regulated group, the number of known genes was 87 and that of EST 57. We classified the differentially expressed genes into functional categories. Among these, we focused our attention on groups of down-regulated genes coding for cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins and for extracellular matrix components, like collagens. Moreover we identified a group of genes with chromosomal localization in candidate regions for demyelinating neuropathies. The differential expression of several sequences was confirmed by RT-PCR, performed both on normal and transgenic rat sciatic nerves, and on primary SCs cultures obtained from normal and CMT1A rats. Therefore, we point out the importance of the interaction between SCs and extracellular matrix and the involvement of SCs cytoskeletal organization in the pathogenesis of CMT1A. Moreover, this study suggests us new candidate genes that could be submitted to sequence analysis in demyelinating CMT.

AB  - 50?60% of CIDP patients show a clinical remission with the administration of standard therapies. Unfortunately, the achievement of this goal does not conclude patients? troubles but coincide with the beginning of another story whose course is often uncertain. In our study of CIDP patients we attempted to establish the fate of 36 patients showing an initial remission after treatments. Over a long-term period of follow-up, we observed that the disease in these patients can follow 3 different clinical courses. A first group of 11 patients had a monophasic disease. All of them achieved a complete remission after therapy with corticosteroids and no relapses were observed after drug interruption over a follow-up period of 6 months-12 years. The duration of treatment varied between 3?24 months. A second group of 6 patients had a relapsing course; these patients became asymptomatic with corticosteroids but relapsed after a period of time of at least six months (range 6 months-16 years) since therapy suspension. The number of relapses varied from 1 to 4. A third group was represented by patients (19 in our series) who needed continuous treatment over a long period of time to maintain improvement. The apparent relapsing-remitting course in these patients was always related to tapering of therapies. The duration of this chronic active form ranged from 2 to 17 years. 5 patients of the last group were able to top therapies without evidence of worsening over a follow-up period of 2?12 years. This subgroup of patients had a prolonged monophasic course rather than a relapsing-remitting form. Our findings show that CIDP is a heterogeneous disease encompassing cases with a single monophasic episode in which the term ?chronic?, with respect to GBS, is referred mainly to the prolonged phase of worsening and cases in which the chronic nature of the condition in outlined by the long duration (up to decades) of the ?active phase?, made-up of therapy-related relapses/remissions.

AB  - Traditional outcome assessment in neurological diseases has always been based on physician-derived and instrumental findings. Over the last two decades, clinical and public health researchers emphasized the need for a thorough evaluation of concepts such as Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) to study the impact of chronic illnesses and their treatments on the patient's life. The most frequent inherited neuropathy is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). CMT Patients develop progressive weakness and sensory disturbances, becoming sometimes severely disabled even at very young age. In CMT clinic, neurophysiologic, pathologic and genetic evaluation, are considered fundamental to assess nerve involvement and diagnose, but how these findings are related to HRQoL and disability is not assessed. We propose a prospective follow-up (24?30 months) of CMT patients with multiple measurements of CMT. Besides conventional clinic, pathologic, neurophysiologic and genetic measurements we adopt validated patient-oriented measurements to assess HRQoL and disability. Aims of the study are: 1) to assess HRQoL and disability of CMT patients in a wide and well-represented sample and to evaluate the relationships between conventional parameters and the patient's perception of his own HRQoL and disability; 2) to evaluate natural history of HRQoL and disability in CMT, and to evaluate the predictive value of phenotype, genetic picture, neurophysiological and pathological pattern 3) to develop a national network and a database on CMT disease (this aim includes the standardization, based on a consensus validation process, of the most used terms and measurements in CMT and the development of a database software). In a preliminary reunion, the authors developed a dedicated database for patients affected by CMT. Details about this database will be presented.

AB  - Gangliosides (Gs) have been implicated as potential antigens in autoimmune neuropathies and anti-tumoral immune response, but their role in paraneoplastic neuropathy has been poorly investigated. We describe one patient affected by lung adenocarcinoma and subacute motor axonal neuropathy with high titres of IgG1 and IgG3 to several Gs. Expansion (3% of total T cells) of peripheral g/d T lymphocytes was found, as compared to healthy controls (<0.5%) and to patients with lung neoplasia without neuropathy (1.1%). At three months after neoplasia removal, we observed stabilization of the neuropathy, decline of anti-Gs IgG and of g/d T cells, which dropped to normal values. Expression of GM1, GD1a, GM2 and GM3 was found by immunohistochemistry on patient's neoplastic cells, but not in control lung neoplasia. Absorption experiments of anti-Gs IgG revealed that only GD1a and GM1, among all Gs tested, significantly decreased anti-Gs IgG reactivity. Indirect immunohistochemistry with biotinylated IgG purified from the patient showed positive signals on motoneurons, dorsal root ganglia, axonal structures and Schwann cells and his own neoplastic cells. At autopsy, IgG deposits were found on the same neural targets. Purified IgG from the patient exerted high levels of cytotoxicity on both Schwann and neuroblastoma cells, as compared to healthy controls. The association of neoplasia, peripheral neuropathy and autoimmune responses to Gs observed in our patient proposes a pathogenetic role for Gs as putative autoantigens in paraneoplastic neuropathy.

AB  - We describe a patient affected by MMN with CB exhibiting unusual progression and clinical features. MMN is a chronic immune mediated demyelinating neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive painless asymmetrical weakness usually in distal limb muscles. GM1 antibodies are found in high titer in 22%- 84% of cases. Electrophysiological findings are CB not at usual sites of compression, abnormal temporal dispersion and F-waves, normal or near-normal sensory conduction studies. This 63 year old woman was referred for evaluation of one year and half duration weakness which began in right upper limb and progressed to contralateral and to lower extremities. On first admission (July 2001) neurological examination showed normal cranial nerves and sensory testing, severe asymmetric weakness mainly proximal in the upper extremities and distal in the lower. There were atrophy of small hand muscles and weak deep reflexes. She denied sensory symptoms. There were no upper motor neuron signs. Laboratory tests including CK, tumor marker, CSF, anti-GM1 antibodies were unremarkable. Electrophysiological study was consistent with MMN with CB. Patient underwent IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) and PE without significant improvement. In October 2002, her conditions rapidly worsened: she became quadriplegic, unable to swallow, to chew and to protrude her tongue. Admitted to ICU because of respiratory failure, tracheotomy was performed. Repeated searches for GM1 antibodies gave negative results. CSF was still normal. IVIG was administered twice with partial benefit although severe disability persisted. The case presented has notable features: the rapid monophasic progression to quadriplegia within two years and half, the acute worsening in absence of precipitating events and of systemic illness, the severe involvement of cranial nerves and respiratory muscles. The late response to IVIG is in favor of an immune mediated disorder despite the absence of GM1 antibodies.

AB  - To better assess historical, physical and neurophysiological features of UNE, 20 centers widely distributed in the national country have joined a collaborative study in November 2001. Case recognition was based on clinical ground: symptoms or signs suggestive of ulnar nerve impairment at elbow, as numbness/ paresthesia in the part of ulnar innervated hand with or without sensory loss, elbow pain and weakness of ulnar hand muscles with or without hypotrophy. Electrophysiological examination was performed by a proper protocol according to AAEM/AAN recommendations (1999). Two validated (DASH and BCTQ) and one newly proposed self-administered questionnaires were used for patient-oriented evaluation. Clinical severity was assessed with a 3-stage scale (Antoniadis, 1997) and a 4-stage scale (Giannini, 2001). Electrophysiological severity was quantified using a 5-step neurophysiological classification (Padua, 2001) and a 13-point neurophysiological score (Mondelli, 2000). Two hundred-seven patients (218 limbs affected) were collected until October 2002. The females/males ratio was 1:1.9 and females were younger than males (mean age 44.5 and 52.5?yrs. respectively). Repetitive stress injury was reported as possible pathogenetic factor in 50.5% of cases and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - comorbidity was diagnosed in 22.5% of limbs without gender difference. Reduction of ulnar nerve motor conduction across the elbow was found in 86.2% of limbs. EMG neurogenic pattern in ulnar supplied hand muscles and digit-wrist ulnar SAP abnormalities were respectively observed in 61.5% and 49.1% of cases. Pain (61%), associated with positive provocative test (p?<?0.01), was equally distributed in each clinical classes and was related with higher BCTQ score (p?<?0.001). DASH questionnaire showed the highest relation to clinical scale and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). High relations were found among clinical scales, neurophysiological classification and electrophysiological score (p?<?0.001). These preliminary results show a very good reliability of most measurements used for multiperspective assessment of UNE syndrome.

AB  - The X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is associated with mutations in the Connexin 32 gene (Cx32) and is the second most common CMT subtype after CMT1A, in which the 17p11.2 duplication is the underlying molecular defect. CMTX is characterized by no male-to-male transmission, intermediate motor conduction velocities (MCV), and more severe disease in males. In our series of CMT patients, we found 9 different Cx32 mutations in 11 families. Overall there were 26 patients, 13 males and 13 females, aged 11?76?yrs. Age at onset ranged considerably (1?60?yrs), but symptoms began earlier in males (mean 15.4?yrs, 77% within age 20) than in females (mean 25?yrs). All patients were autonomous, but disease severity was greater in males, while 4 female carriers were asymptomatic. Pain and tremor were frequent complaints. Two patients had Babinski sign and one had rest tremor. Nerve conduction studies were performed in 23 patients (13 males, 10 females). Upper limb motor conduction velocities (MCV) ranged between 25 and 57?m/s, and were slower in males (25?48?m/s) than in females (34?57?m/s). MCV were in the upper range of CMT1 (25?38?m/s) in 10/13 males but only in 3/10 females. In some cases, nerve conduction slowing was non-uniform within single nerves, and one female patient had a previous diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. There was considerable asymmetry of involvement between different nerves. The median nerve was often more severely affected than the ulnar nerve, and not only in females, as previously reported, but also in males. Therefore, it appears unlikely that this asymmetry is accounted for by a Lyonization phenomenon. Subclinical abnormalities of central nervous system as revealed by multimodal evoked potential studies were found in 8/10 patients. Expression of Cx32 in the brain is the likely explanation of this finding that confirms previous non-systematic observations. We found seven missense and two nonsense mutations (one novel mutation). Two families presented distinct mutations at the same codon (Arg164), while the Arg22Stop and Arg220Stop mutations were each found in two unrelated cases.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive focus on 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) as candidate molecule in a variety of pathophysiological conditions occurring in humans is here provided. Despite an active, now well characterized, metabolism in most cells and tissues, HNE can be easily detected and quantified by means of several methods, although with different sensitivity. Measurements of HNE and/or stable metabolites in biological fluids are already applied as lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress markers in a huge number of human disease processes, often sustained by inflammatory reactions. A primary involvement of this aldehydic product of membrane lipid oxidation in inflammation-related events, as well as in regulation of cell proliferation and growth, in necrotic or apoptotic cell death, appears supported by its marked ability to modulate several major pathways of cell signaling and, consequently, gene expression. The actual knowledge of HNE reactivity, metabolism, signaling and modulatory effect in the various human organs should provide a solid background to the investigation of the aldehyde's contribution to the pathogenesis of human major chronic diseases and would likely promote advanced and oriented applications not only in diagnosis and prevention but also in molecular treatment of human diseases. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
