AB  - Abstract Carboplatin (CBP) is a widely used targeted anticancer therapeutic drug, however, multi-drug resistance induced by the accumulation of CBP eventually causes diseases progression. The anti-malarial drug artesunate (ART) also exerts anti-cancer effects in various cancers; however, the combined effect of ART and CBP on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In the present study, the NSCLC cell line A549 was pretreated with various concentrations of CBP, ART and gemcitabine (GEM). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were conducted to detect cell viability. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by both flow cytometry and TUNEL apoptotic assay. The expression profiles of cell cycle-related proteins and apoptotic proteins were determined by western blot. Cell clone numbers were visualized using crystal violet staining. Here, we found that both CBP and ART suppressed cell viability, and promoted cell apoptosis, and the combined application of ART and CBP at a lower concentration exhibited synergistic effects. Specifically, the combination of ART and CBP at a lower concentration suppressed cell clone numbers, promoted cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and induced the expression of the cell cycle and apoptosis related proteins BAX, p21, p53, and Caspae-3, while decreasing Bcl-2 and CyclinB1 expression. Based on these results, we concluded that combined application of ART and CBP exerts synergistic anti-tumor effects on NSCLC by enhancing cell apoptosis in a mitochondria-dependent manner.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in an immediate loss of motor and sensory function below the injury site and is associated with a poor prognosis. The inhibitory environment that develops in response to the injury is mainly due to local expression of inhibitory factors, scarring and the formation of cystic cavitations, all of which limit the regenerative capacity of endogenous or transplanted cells.Strategies that demonstrate promising results induce a change in the microenvironment at- and around the lesion site to promote endogenous cell repair, including axonal regeneration or the integration of transplanted cells. To date, many of these strategies target only a single aspect of SCI; however, the multifaceted nature of SCI suggests that combinatorial strategies will likely be more effective.Biomaterials are a key component of combinatorial strategies, as they have the potential to deliver drugs locally over a prolonged period of time and aid in cell survival, integration and differentiation. Here we summarize the advantages and limitations of widely used strategies to promote recovery after injury and highlight recent research where biomaterials aided combinatorial strategies to overcome some of the barriers of spinal cord regeneration.

AB  - Acting in the interfaces between environment and membrane compartments, membrane ion channels, and receptors transduce various physical and chemical cues into downstream signaling events. Not surprisingly, these membrane proteins play essential roles in a wide range of cellular processes such as sensory perception, synaptic transmission, cellular growth and development, fate determination, and apoptosis. However, except insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors, the functions of membrane receptors in animal lifespan modulation have not been well appreciated. On the other hand, although ion channels are popular therapeutic targets for many age-related diseases, their potential roles in aging itself are largely neglected. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the conserved functions and mechanisms of membrane ion channels and receptors in the modulation of lifespan across multiple species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, mouse, and human.

Describe options of systemic treatment of refractory meningiomas with hydroxyurea, somatostatin analogues, or CAV multi-agent chemotherapy. This article is available for continuing medical education credit at CME.TheOncologist.com Although meningiomas are the most common tumor in the central nervous system, their incidence, epidemiology, and clinical outcomes have historically been poorly defined. This has been attributed to their benign course, difficulty obtaining histologic diagnosis, and lack of uniform database registration. Their clinical behavior can range from a silent incidentaloma to a lethal tumor. Projections of an aging population should raise medical awareness of an expectant rise in the incidence of meningiomas. This disease increases with advancing age, has a female predilection, and exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with a higher risk for disease development. There have been minimal advances in treatment, except in radiation therapy. Although no U.S. Food and Drug Administration?approved systemic therapy exists, there are treatment options that include hydroxyurea and sandostatin. Currently, no molecularly targeted therapy has provided clinical benefit, although recurring molecular alterations are present and novel therapies are being investigated.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - A 40-year-old smoker complained of pain, deep and burning in character, constant, and persistent, associated with paresthesias in his feet for a period of two years. Furthermore, he developed aching non-traumatic foot ulcers. There was no history of diabetes and systemic illness. Neurological examination revealed loss of all modalities of sensation and hyperhidrosis in the limbs with a prominent distal-to-proximal gradient. The following laboratory tests were normal: blood count; test for liver, kidney, and thyroid function; cryoglobulins; anti-HCV antibodies and HIV. Neurophysiological investigation revealed an axonal neuropathy with a distal-to-proximal distribution in the limbs. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe chronic axonal neuropathy. Prominent thickening of endoneurial microvessel endothelial cells was present with narrowing of lumen. Congo Red staining was negative. He initiated treatment with alprostadil alfa-ciclodestrina and stopped smoking. The patient reported prompt improvement of neurologic symptoms as well as skin abnormalities few months after the begin of therapy. Ischemic neuropathy in which nerve damage occurs in the more distal portion of the limbs has been reported. In our patient, clinical presentation, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of a Lower Extremity Ischemic Neuropathy probably triggered by smoke.

AB  - Abstract Stroke is a multi-factorial polygenic disease and is a major cause of death and adult disability. Administration of bone marrow stem cells protects ischemic rat brain by facilitating recovery of neurological functions. But the molecular mechanism of stem cells action and their effect on gene expression is not well explored. In this study, we have transplanted 1 ? 106 human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) in middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) adult male Wistar rats through intracarotid artery route at 24 h after surgery. Motor behavioral tests (rotarod and open field) were performed to assess the changes in motor functions at day 0 and day1, 4, 8 and 14. The expression of studied genes at mRNA and protein level was quantified by using Q-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Further, we have assessed the methylation pattern of promoter of these genes by using methylation-specific PCR. Data were analyzed statistically and correlated. A significant improvement in behavioral deficits was observed in stem cells treated group after 14th day post stroke. Significantly (p < 0.05) increased mRNA and protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor and ANP genes in hBMMSCs treated group along with decrease in methylation level at their promoter was observed. On the other hand, significantly decreased mRNA and protein level of TSP1 and WNK1 in hBMMSCs treated group was observed. In conclusion, hBMMSCs administration significantly improves the behavioral deficits by improving motor and locomotor coordination. The promoter of TSP1 and WNK1 genes was found to be hyper-methylated in hBMMSCs group resulting in their decreased expression while the promoter of ANP and brain derived neurotrophic factor was found to be hypo-methylated. This study might shed a light on how hBMMSCs affect the gene expression by modulating methylation status.

AB  - Abstract Keratinocytes and fibroblasts isolated from dysplastic oral lesions were combined to provide a renewable source of epithelia. A dysplasia-scoring index was devised to compare the architectural and cytological features and used together with robust immunophenotyping to show that the engineered epithelia showed most of the characteriztics of the clinical lesions. The strains of dysplastic oral keratinocytes with an extended or immortal lifespan provided a reproducible resource of epithelia showing mild (DOK), moderate (POE9n) or severe (D20) dysplasia when maintained under defined conditions. The dysplasia score was influenced by growth conditions, with KGF polarizing proliferation to the basal layer and reducing the severity of dysplasia. When compared to the normal counterparts, dysplasia-associated fibroblasts expressed MMP9, secreted more HGF, increased the dysplasia score for epithelia generated with mortal dysplastic keratinocytes and induced morphological changes in normal keratinocytes, highlighting the role of the microenvironment in determining the phenotype of dysplastic epithelia.

AB  - Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male urogenital malignancy worldwide. Surgery, endocrine therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the main clinical management options for PCa. However, these three therapies each have limitations. For example, surgery is not suitable for the advanced PCa patients with extensive metastases, and radiotherapy causes serious side effects. Primary endocrine therapy promotes the progression of hormone-sensitive PCa into the castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, considering these drawbacks, chemotherapy has become an effective and extensive treatment for PCa. Among the modern therapeutic strategies against advanced PCa, polymer-nanocarrier-incorporated formulations have gradually emerged due to their well-controlled release profiles and improved tumor targeting abilities. The drug delivery systems based on polymer nanoplatforms passively target tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Simultaneously, stimuli-responsive polymer nanoplatforms unload cargoes in response to certain stimuli in the tumor area. Furthermore, the active targeting ligand-conjugated polymer nanoformulations against PCa-specific markers have also achieved great success in PCa therapies. Herein, the advanced polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy are reviewed, while the future development of polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy is also predicted.

AB  - Abstract Rhabdomyolysis in deceased donors usually causes acute renal failure (ARF), which may be considered a contraindication for kidney transplantation. From January 2012 to December 2016, 30 kidneys from 15 deceased donors with severe rhabdomyolysis and ARF were accepted for transplantation at our center. The peak serum creatinine (SCr) kinase, myoglobin, and SCr of the these donors were 15 569±8597 U/L, 37 092±42 100 ?g/L, and 422±167 ?mol/L, respectively. Two donors received continuous renal replacement therapy due to anuria. Six kidneys exhibited a discolored appearance (from brown to glossy black) due to myoglobin casts. The kidney transplant results from the donors with rhabdomyolysis donors were compared with those of 90 renal grafts from standard criteria donors (SCD). The estimated glomerular filtration rate at 2 years was similar between kidney transplants from donors with rhabdomyolysis and SCD (70.3±14.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 72.3±15.1 mL/min/1.73 m2). We conclude that excellent graft function can be achieved from kidneys donors with ARF caused by rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Abstract Due to their capacity to self-renew, proliferate and generate multi-lineage cells, adult-derived stem cells offer great potential for use in regenerative therapies to stop and/or reverse degenerative diseases such as diabetes, heart failure, Alzheimer's disease and others. However, these subsets of cells can be isolated from different niches, each with differing potential for therapeutic applications. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF), a stem cell enriched and adipose-derived cell population, has garnered interest as a therapeutic in regenerative medicine due to its ability to secrete paracrine factors that accelerate endogenous repair, ease of accessibility and lack of identified major adverse effects. Thus, one can easily understand the rush to employ adipose-derived SVF to treat human disease. Perhaps faster than any other cell preparation, SVF is making its way to clinics worldwide, while critical preclinical research needed to establish SVF safety, efficacy and optimal, standardized clinical procedures are underway. Here, we will provide an overview of the current knowledge driving this phenomenon, its regulatory issues and existing studies, and propose potential unmapped applications.
