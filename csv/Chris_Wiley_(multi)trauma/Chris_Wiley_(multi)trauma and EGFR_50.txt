AB  - Abstract Appropriate anticoagulation for hemodialysis (HD) requires a subtle balance between under- and over-heparinization to prevent extracorporeal circuit (ECC) clotting and bleeding, respectively. We discuss five key issues relating to anticoagulation therapy for chronic HD in adults following a review of relevant literature published since 2002: (i) options for standardization of anticoagulation in HD settings. The major nephrology societies have issued low evidence level recommendations on this subject. Interventional studies have generally investigated novel low-molecular weight heparins and provided data on safety of dosing regimens that cannot readily be extrapolated to clinical practice; (ii) identification of clinical and biological parameters to aid individualization of anticoagulation treatment. We find that use of clinical and biological monitoring of anticoagulation during HD sessions is currently not clearly defined in routine clinical practice; (iii) role of ECC elements (dialysis membrane and blood lines), dialysis modalities, and blood flow in clotting development; (iv) options to reduce or suppress systemic heparinization during HD sessions. Alternative strategies have been investigated, especially when the routine mode of anticoagulation was not suitable in patients at high risk of bleeding or was contraindicated; (v) optimization of anticoagulation therapy for the individual patient. We conclude by proposing a standardized approach to deliver anticoagulation treatment for HD based on an individualized prescription prepared according to the patient's profile and needs.

AB  - Abstract Background/Objectives Higher resting heart rate is a risk factor for arterial cardiovascular diseases. We assessed whether higher heart rate is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods In a prospective epidemiologic cohort, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we associated resting heart rate by electrocardiogram with physician-validated incident hospitalized VTE through 2015. We also examined whether lower heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic imbalance, might be a risk factor for VTE. Results Resting heart rate at Visit 1 (1987-1989), when participants were 45 to 64 years old (mean, 54 years), was not associated with incidence of VTE (n = 882 cases). However, heart rate at Visit 4 (1996-1998; mean age, 63 years) was associated positively with VTE (n = 557 cases). The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of VTE across Visit 4 heart rate categories of <60, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and ≥80 bpm were 1 (reference), 1.22 (1.01-1.49), 1.39 (1.09-1.78), and 1.44 (1.01-2.06), respectively, and when evaluated continuously 1.11 (1.02-1.21) per 10 bpm greater heart rate. For the most part, HRV indices were not associated with VTE or associations were explained by inverse correlations of HRV indices with heart rate. Conclusion We found a significant positive and independent association of resting heart rate at ARIC Visit 4 with incidence of VTE. The reason why high heart rate is a risk marker for VTE warrants further exploration.

AB  - ABSTRACT There is an increased tendency for hip fractures in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although surgery is the mainstay of treatment for hip fractures, there is scant information on outcomes after hip fracture surgery in diabetic patients at different stages of CKD. In this population-based cohort study, we compared the surgical outcome, readmission, and mortality rates after osteosynthesis of hip fractures in diabetic patients with different stages of renal function. Diabetic patients who received primary osteosynthesis for hip fracture between January 1997 and December 2013 were enrolled. The primary outcomes were surgical outcomes, including infection and revision surgery. The secondary outcomes were all-cause readmission and mortality. This study included 44,065 patients; 11,954 had CKD (diabetic CKD group), 1662 patients were receiving dialysis (diabetic dialysis group), and 30,449 patients had no CKD (diabetic non-CKD group). We found that the diabetic dialysis group had a significantly higher risk of infection and revision surgery compared with diabetic non-CKD patients (HR?=?1.52, 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.87; HR?=?1.62, 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.97, respectively, both P?<?0.001) and diabetic CKD patients (HR?=?1.62, 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.99; HR?=?1.48, 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.80, respectively, both P?<?0.001). Diabetic CKD patients had a comparable risk of surgical complications including infection and revision as diabetic non-CKD patients. For readmission and mortality, the diabetic dialysis group had the highest risk among the three groups at all time-points (3 months after surgery, 1 year, and the last follow-up, all P?<?0.001). Compared with the diabetic non-CKD group, the diabetic CKD group had an elevated risk of readmission and mortality at all time-points (all P?<?0.001). In conclusion, CKD was associated with worse outcomes after hip fracture fixation surgery. Although at significantly higher risk of readmission and mortality, CKD patients still had a comparable risk of infection and revision to non-CKD patients. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
