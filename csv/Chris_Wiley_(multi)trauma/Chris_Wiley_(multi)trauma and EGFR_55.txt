AB  - ABSTRACT HIV-infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-exposure are associated with bone loss. African data are limited despite the region's HIV burden. Of 247 ART-naïve, premenopausal, urban, black African women aged 33.9±6.6?years from Soweto, South Africa, measured at baseline, 110 underwent anthropometry, DXA and blood and urine collections at 12 and 24 months; 39 were HIV-negative (Nref), 28 were people with HIV (PWH) not ART-exposed for the duration of the study (ART-N) and 43 were PWH who were ART-exposed within the first 12 months (ART-Y). At baseline ART-Y had lower BMI and fat mass than Nref. Within 12 months of ART-initiation, aBMD had decreased at the lumbar spine and whole-body-less-head, despite increased weight, and hip aBMD had not increased in line with Nref. There was no evidence of further bone changes between 12 and 24 months. By 24 months, ART-Y had gained weight and fat mass, but remained lighter with less fat than Nref. ART-initiation normalized the low serum albumin of ART-Y at baseline but was associated with elevated bone turnover markers at 12 and 24 months. Vitamin D status and renal phosphate handling were normal. ART-N had similar aBMD and other characteristics to Nref throughout, except, unlike Nref, weight and fat mass did not increase and serum albumin decreased. This study in African women of childbearing age demonstrated that the bone loss that had occurred in these PWH after ART-initiation did not continue after 12 months and that bone loss did not occur in ART-unexposed PWH over 2?years. At 24 months, despite gains in weight and fat mass, ART-exposed women remained lighter, with lower aBMD, fat mass and higher bone turnover than women without HIV. More studies are required to establish if the bone loss and fat gain reverse, stabilize, or continue with further ART-exposure, particularly during and after menopause.

AB  - The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on soft tissue are not well characterized. This study utilized a diabetic wound model to examine the effects of PEMF effects on soft tissue healing. Methods: Wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db and wild type C57BL6 mice. Mice were exposed to PEMF (4.5?ms pulse/15?hz) for 8?hrs/day for 14 days. Gross closure was assessed with digital analysis of area changes over time. Histological examination assessed granulation and epithelial gap, cell proliferation (BrdU), and endothelial cell density (CD31). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in the presence or absence of PEMF for 8?hrs and VEGF/FGF2 was measured in culture supernatants by ELISA. Results: Mice exposed to PEMF had accelerated wound closure at day 7 (wound area as % of original, db/db: 60%(PEMF) vs. 78%(control), C57BL6: 15% vs. 42%, p?<?0.05) and day 14 (db/db: 21% vs. 55%, C57BL6: 8% vs. 28%, p?<?0.05), with increased granulation and cell proliferation (db/db day 7: 52?±?8 vs. 31?±?5 cells/HPF (200x)). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly higher CD31 density in wounds exposed to PEMF at day 7 (vessels/HPF, db/db: 28?±?4 vs. 17?±?4, C57BL6: 41?±?7 vs. 28?±?6) and day 14 (db/db: 32?±?6 vs. 21?±?5, C57BL6: 48?±?5 vs. 40?±?5). HUVECs in PEMF exhibited 5-fold higher levels of FGF2 compared to controls after 30?min (20.50?pg/ml?±?6.75 vs. 4.25?pg/ml?±?0.75), with no change in VEGF through 8?hrs. Conclusions: PEMF accelerates closure time and endothelial cell proliferation in wound healing. Upregulation of FGF2 in HUVECs exposed to PEMF suggests that release of angiogenic growth factors may explain increased vascular density and accelerated wound closure. Clinical uses include treatment for diabetic ulcers and other non-healing wounds. This work is supported in part by the Alumni Fund, Alumni Association of SUNY Downstate College of Medicine (MJC).

AB  - A critical limitation of using retroviral vectors for gene therapy is their inability to infect non-dividing cells. Although, the adenoviral vectors have the advantage of being able to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, they elicit inflammatory response, thus making the interpretation of in vivo experiments harder. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral vectors do not have those limitations, however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. To determine if low-oxygen microenvironment affects viral vector-mediated gene transfection, we have used two other viral vectors, Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral constructs in vitro and in vivo to express foreign genes in hypoxic cultured human dermal fibroblasts and ischemic rat wounds. Both cultured normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) human dermal fibroblasts were identically transfected by the AAV vector. A lenti6-LacZ construct was injected onto the periphery of rat ischemic and non-ischemic wound (106 pfu/wound) at the time of wounding. Wounds were harvested at post-operative day 7. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with a in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed without any inflammatory response. No significant difference of transfection efficiency was observed between the ischemic and non-ischemic wounds. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and Lentiviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in both ischemic and non-ischemic cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Epithelialization and vascularization are key elements involved in the repair of cutaneous wounds. One method of regulation for these pathways is expression of a signaling molecule known as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which, in turn, is regulated by the transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1). It has been suggested that chronic wounds, which are most commonly located in ischemic tissue among the elderly, may be the result of a loss of function in the VEGF regulation pathway. Using our rat back flap model, which demonstrates the negative influences of age and ischemia on wound healing, we examined the relative expression of HIF-1 and VEGF in aged and young rats at 3,7, and 10 days post-wounding. Four full-thickness biopsy punches (7?mm) were made on the back of each aged and young rat. The rostral wound pair was made ischemic by raising a transverse flap (1.8?cm wide???8?cm length). The caudal wound pair served as a non-ischemic control. Inserting a sterilized polyethylene sheet under both ischemic and nonischemic wounds prevented wound contraction. RNA was extracted from the tissue at the specified time points, and run on Real-Time PCR to determine relative expression of VEGF and HIF-1. Preliminary data suggest that, at the 3 day time point, there is a significant increase in both HIF-1 and VEGF expression in young rats under ischemic conditions and a significant increase in VEGF expression in aged rats under ischemia with a strong (but not significant) trend towards increase in HIF-1 as well. While the rat model does not produce significant differences between aged and young animals, this upregulation under ischemia indicates that HIF-1 and VEGF expression may play a vital role in the early signaling of ischemic wound repair.

AB  - Introduction: Fetal mouse skin wounds heal without scar before gestational day E17. Because scarless repair is inherent to fetal skin and occurs superimposed on skin differentiation, genome-wide gene expression during skin development was tested. Methods: Dorsal skin from BALB/C mice fetuses at E14, E15, E18 and E20 was collected. RNAs from individual fetuses were hybridized to mouse microarrays with 42,000 gene elements. The E14/E18 hybridizations were repeated three times, and the E15/E20 repeated twice with different samples. (?x??=?fold change). Results: Increased genes on E18 and E20 were clustered into several groups: 1) ECMs: type I (2.8x), III (2.3x), VI, and XIV procollagens; 2) Cell surface: integrin beta1 binding protein2 (5.2x), integral membrane protein2A and 2B (avg 3.8x); 3) Proteases: mast cell protease4 (15x) and 5 (24x), MMP23 (3x); 4) Growth factor-related: acidic FGF (3.7x), FGF receptor3 (2.9x), TGF-alpha (2.3x). Decreased genes on E18 and E20 included: 1) Growth factors: TGF-beta2 (0.42x), PDGF-alpha (0.41x), PDGF receptor-beta (0.37x), NGF receptor associated protein (0.18x); 2) Proteases: MMP 11 (0.27x), 14 (0.39x); 3) ECM: fibromodulin (0.5x), Vcam1 (0.22x), keratin18 (0.2x) and 19 (0.46x), collagen XVIII (0.36x). Conclusions: Genes with increased expression at E14, E15 and decreased expression at E18, E20 have possible antifibrotic function. These data identify hundreds of possible anti-fibrotic and pro-fibrotic genes as candidates for further functional analysis as regulators of repair. Supported by NIH DE00463?03

AB  - Bone marrow cells have been used to potentiate wound healing in chronic wounds (Badiavas and Falanga, 2003). We postulate that the performance of these autografted cells may be enhanced by seeding them into scaffolding with normal skin architecture; indeed that the differentiation of the precursor cells may be determined by the juxtaposition of intact extracellular matrix. This might in turn lead to a prefabricated skin substitute capable of recapitulating fully functional skin. We are seeding murine gfp+ bone marrow cells, containing mixed mesenchymal and hematopoietic precursor cells into Alloderm?, a decellularized preserved skin graft. This seeding is potentiated by meshing the skin and gentle centrifugation of fresh marrow into the dermal aspect of the allograft. Other samples were merely co-cultured with the cells in Dexter?s media. Duplicate samples were fixed and stained with DAPI at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Viewed under fluorescence, gfp+ cells are bright green.Comparing these images with DAPI-staining allows viable cells to be identified which are gfp+. H the spindle shape suggests a fibroblast (Fig 2). In addition, the population of gfp+ cells has markedly expanded by day 14, attaining near confluence in some sections (Fig 3). No cells were seen in controls (Fig 4). Conclusion: True skin replacement will only be possible when the panoply of skin appendages can be recapitulated. The experiments presented here are evidence that pluripotential precursor cells can be seeded into dermal matrices providing an optimal environment for regeneration. 1 2 3 4

AB  - Background: Over the last two decades, there have been a number of studies in Europe on contact sensitivity in patients with chronic leg ulcerations with a frequency of positive patch test results ranging from 40 to 82.5%. The prevalence of sensitization has not been studied in North America. Furthermore, many of the newer dressings and wound care products in the market have not been studied for contact sensitivity in patients with chronic wounds. Objectives: 1) To determine the prevalence of allergen sensitivity in patients with history of leg ulcers in two North American study centers, 2) to compare our results to the European studies and to the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) database and 3) to help delineate a standard battery of allergens for patch testing in North American leg ulcer patients Methods: 54 patients with an active or past leg ulcer were prospectively entered in the study. The patients were patch tested to both the NACDG Standard series, as well as, a comprehensive supplemental series of 48 allergens including wound care medicaments and dressings. Results: 63% of patients were sensitized to at last one allergen. The most common allergens were Balsam of Peru (29.6%), bacitracin (24.1%), fragrance mix (20.4%), wood tar mix (20.4%), propylene glycol (13.5%), neomycin sulfate (13%), benzalkonium chloride (13%), carba mix (11.1%), nickel sulfate (11.1%) and Duoderm CGF (11.1%). Duoderm CGF was the most allergenic dressing in our study group. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of positive patch tests in patients with past or current leg ulcerations. Using a modified leg ulcer series along with the standard NACDG series is very important in evaluating patients with leg ulcers.
