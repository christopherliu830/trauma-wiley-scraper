AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem, resulting in both adverse tissue form and function and the goal of therapeutic interventions is to reduce and prevent excessive scarring. We have demonstrated that a recombinant adenovirus containing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (rAd-p21), inhibited scar formation by blocking cell cycle progression and attenuated cell proliferation at the wound site (Perkins et?al 2002). Recently, we have shown rAd-p21 specific antiproliferative effects on granulation tissue in vivo(Gu, et?al, manuscript submitted). Safety parameters using rAd-p21 for anti-scarring may include effects on wound strength and dehiscence of the wound. We tested effects of rAd-p21 on wound strength in vivo using tensile strength as an endpoint and included comparisons with other clinically relevant antiproliferative agents. Specifically, rAd-p21 at doses from 1???107 to 3.8???1010 particle (PN) per incision was administered intradermally to linear rat incisions and assayed 14?28 days post treatment. rAd-p21 mildly reduced tensile strength at high doses (≥3???1010PN), whereas low to moderate doses (1???107 to 1???1010PN) had no effect. Interestingly, all rAd-p21 treated wounds regained tensile strength indistinguishable from vehicle control, 4 weeks after treatment, suggesting that rAd-p21 wounds recover with time. An adenovirus control vector, not containing a gene (rAd-Empty), showed subtle reduction of tensile strength that was only statistically significant at day 21. This suggests that delivery of rAd-Empty alone in the wound has little effect on wound strength. Triamcinolone at 5?mg/mL/wound, 5-FU at 10?mg/mL/wound, and low doses of MMC did not significantly reduce tensile strength, although high doses of MMC (0.2?mg/mL/wound) severely reduced tensile strength which failed to recover after 28 days. Morphological analysis of all groups revealed necrosis only in the MMC treatment. This data suggests that rAd-p21 may reduce the hyperproliferative status in excessive scar formation with minimal effects on wound strength.

AB  - Introduction: Angiogenesis is thought to be important for granulation tissue formation and for the delivery oxygen and other nutrients to the healing wound bed. We examined whether angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) such as endostatin decrease neovascularization in full-thickness wounds leading to impaired granulation tissue formation and delayed wound closure. Methods: Endostatin at tumor-inhibiting doses (20?mg/kg/BID) was injected daily starting three days prior to surgery. Two full-thickness wounds were created on the mouse dorsum using a novel wound healing model developed in our lab. A second experimental group had topical VEGF (10??g/QD) applied to these wounds. Both groups were compared to PBS-treated controls. Wounds were analyzed for closure time, granulation tissue formation, and wound vascularity using CD31. Results: Endostatin-treatment delayed wound closure compared to control mice (17.4d?±?1.51 vs. 12.8?±?0.89, P?<?0.05), resulted in decreased granulation tissue formation at all time points (P?<?0.05), and significantly reduced wound vascularity as measured by CD31+ vessel counts (P?<?0.05). VEGF application to the wound bed of endostatin-treated mice normalized wound closure despite endostatin treatment (13.8d?±?1.1 vs. 17.44d?±?1.51, P?<?0.05). Conclusion: Endostatin impairs wound angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation and delays full-thickness wound closure. Topical VEGF was able to reverse this effect and may represent a novel approach to improve wound healing in patients receiving AI. These findings may have serious implications for patients undergoing AI treatment that require surgery or who have wound healing complications.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - Background: Physiological healing in acute wounds generally occurs by granulation from the wound base and by migration of epithelium from the wound edges toward the center of the wound in a uniform, concentric fashion. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) compared this phenomenon in acute wounds treated with standard care versus acute wounds pharmacologically stimulated with growth factor therapy. Methods: With informed consent, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. The biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel Q.D., ii) rhPDGF-BB Q.O.D., iii) daily rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). Wound morphology was carefully examined and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Results: There were distinct differences in the morphological pattern of healing seen between control wounds and growth factor-stimulated wounds. Acute wounds treated with bacitracin tended to heal in circumferential fashion, as predicted. Growth factor-stimulated wounds, by contrast, exhibited accentuated angiogenesis (granulation), with non-uniform epithelial islands streaming into the wound. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that rhPDGF-BB influences acute wound healing by promoting accelerated granulation and epithelialization. Accelerated healing is manifest by different healing morphologies. The biological basis for these differences requires further histological and molecular analyses.

AB  - The importance of controlling the bioburden in wounds can not be over emphasized. Glycerine based gel sheets have been used extensively to show their bacteriostatic/fungistatic properties. Hoekstra studied animal wounds and compared glycerine dressings with water based dressings and the glycerine showed superior bioburden reduction. Vandeputte showed similar results when comparing hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings and looked at the histology of the wounds to find differences in the quantities of the types of cells present. The reduced scar formation of wounds are thought to be attributed to the influence of the glycerine on the healing process. Hoestra has reported the dramatic reduction in the inflammation reaction soon after application of the glycerine gel dressing. Studies by Oliveria-Gandia, Davis, and Mertz showed the glycerine dressings to be more effective than hydrogel or hydrocolloid dressings in reducing bioburden in animal wounds that were inoculated with microbes and also reducing biocounts in appropriate growth medium. Vandeputte conducted a diabetic study(no exclusions) that compared the glycerine dressing (n?=?15) with standard protocol(n?=?14) for diabetic foot wounds, that showed the test dressing to be far superior. He along with thousands of other nurses around the world have reported the use of glycerine dressings on superficial burns to reduce pain, reduce the chance for infection, reduce scar formation, and to protect the wound from friction and pressure. J. Baksa extensively used the glycerine gel sheets in his burn unit not only for the superficial wounds but also for 3rd and 4th degree burns on children as well as after surgical removal of hypertrophic and keloid scars to prevent reoccurrence. T.M. Baum and M.J. Busuito also reported the use of the glycerine dressing for scar prevention and treatment. The glycerine dressing has been used extensively for te treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers in hospitals, nursing homes, athletic fields, as well as, under casts, splints and braces. R. Horchner reported a >95% reduction in pressure ulcers in a direct comparison to the control and to hydrocolloids.

AB  - Delayed wound healing is a common complication of diabetes resulting in significant clinical morbidity. The diabetic wound exhibits impaired cellular infiltration and consequently inadequate granulation tissue formation. Additionally, altered patterns of apoptosis. In this study, we have evaluated the differential gene expression pattern in transgenic diabetic female mice, 5?6 weeks old, in a full thickness cutaneous punch wound model. We assessed the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and differential gene expression pattern at 4th, 7th and 11th day post wounding. Supernatants obtained from diabetic wound tissue homogenates were subjected to zymogram analysis. The data showed that MMPs were expressed at higher level by 4th day post wounding, whereas expression of MMPs were down regulated towards the 11th day post wounding suggesting their role during early phase of wound healing. The pathway specific gene array data demonstrated differential regulation of several growth factors, transcription factors and other related genes such as fibroblast growth factors and their receptors, ID3 and restin respectively. The cytokine/extracellular matrix protein osteopontin (OPN), an important component of cellular immunity and inflammation also showed higher expression after 4 days post wounding. The expression of OPN remained at higher level after 11 days post wounding in diabetic mice, whereas the expression were down regulated to basal level in normal wounded animal suggesting that the expression of OPN was concomitant with the extent of healing. Other adhesion molecules such as integrin αV and PECAM-1 were also differentially regulated. Though a single gene may not be solely responsible for any defect or impairment in healing as it is a very tightly controlled and regulated process, however, a detailed study of these gene(s) may shed some light to the delayed healing in diabetic mice.

AB  - Peptides of the innate immune system play a vital role in the protection and repair of almost all biological systems. Such peptides have been implicated in a range of activities associated with prevention of disease and modulation of innate immunity. HB107 is a derivative of one such peptide, Cecropin B, that has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing wound healing in both burn and incision animal models. HB107 has been evaluated for efficacy in a mouse incision model and for safety and efficacy in a pig burn wound model. Topical application of the peptide gives RE50(time needed for 50% re-epithelialization) values of 10.28 days for 500?ug/mL and 12.72 days for 100?ug/mL compared to control 16.45 days. Additionally the peptide was well tolerated in terms of safety both topically and in an IV acute toxicity mouse model with no adverse effects observed. HB107 not only demonstrated efficacy and safety, but due to being a relatively short synthetic peptide, costs significantly less to manufacture than the current approved therapies.

AB  - Macrophages serve as the coordinators of the wound healing process. Since 1998 following the Israeli Ministry of health authorization, macrophage suspensions have been used for the treatment of ulcers, in more than 800 elderly and paraplegic patients suffering from decubital chronic ulcers. As previously published, a significant number of genes showed increased levels of expression in hypo-osmotic shock activated cells, using DNA microarrays technique. The majority of these genes are considered to be directly involved in the macrophage function and in the wound healing process. Macrophge suspensions are prepared from a whole blood unit of healthy, young volunteer blood donors in a closed, sterile system, as previously described. The activated cells are applied to the wounds either by local injection or by direct deposition to the wound. Between January 2000 and October 2003, 112 patients with postoperative sternal wound infection were treated with macrophage suspension. Full closure of the wounds was achieved in 104 (93%) of the patients. Original wound surface area 8?175?cm2 (mean 93) Days until treatment 6?180 (mean 47) Days until 50% closure 6?60 (mean 21) Days until full closure 10?138 (mean 49) No side effects were noted. The use of macrophage suspension is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that reduces risk of complications and morbidity and improves the quality of life for long -suffering patients. Length and cost of hospital stay may be reduced, as the treatment requires no hospitalization.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) transiently expresses in acute wound. In non-healed wounds, MMP-9 together with other proteinases persistently elevate, which may lead excessive ECM degradation and failure of wound closure. To understand the molecular regulation of MMP-9 we investigated the signal transduction for TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9 by dermal fibroblasts. TNF-alpha initiates three major signal pathways including NF-11B, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. On the other hand, Rho-GTPase plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, angiogenesis, and mitosis. It remains unknown if the ?cross talk? of these signals having a role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we found that over expression of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) specifically attenuates TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9. However, TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-3 and proMMP-2 activation was intact. NF-?B signal is regarded as a common pathway for many MMPs. Indeed, PAK did not affect TNF-alpha mediated degradation of Ikappa B, suggesting additional signal is targeted by PAK. In contrast, MMP-3 but not MMP-9 expression is specifically blocked by p38 MAK. Thus TNF-alpha induced expression of multiple MMPs in wound healing may utilize different intracellular signal pathways.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.

AB  - Summary Glial neoplasms are relatively common in adulthood. This predominantly reflects glioblastoma, which has an incidence of about four cases per 100 000 person-years. That the most aggressive of the gliomas is the one seen with greatest frequency by physicians treating cancer patients sets a prevailing view of gliomas as very poor, prognostically. Among the adult gliomas, only glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and diffuse low-grade astrocytoma occur frequently enough to be studied in randomized controlled trials. There are a large number of less common glial variants such as pilocytic astrocytoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA), which appear to be much more readily controlled with local therapies and have a much better prognosis than the common gliomas such as glioblastoma. However, the treatment and outcome data for many of those types of glioma is limited to a few modest uncontrolled series. There are also gliomas that on rare occasions arise in atypical locations such as the brain stem and spinal cord. This chapter reviews the basic clinical features, treatment, and prognostic data for the more common gliomas and highlights the application of that data to the rare forms of adult glioma and gliomas arising in atypical locations.

AB  - Abstract Renal disorders account for a substantial fraction of the budget for health care in many countries. Proteinuria is a frequent manifestation in afflicted patients, but the origin of the proteins varies based on the nature of the disorder. The emerging field of urinary proteomics has the potential to replace kidney biopsy as the diagnostic procedure of choice for patients with some glomerular forms of renal disease. To fully realize this potential, it is vital to understand the basis for the urinary excretion of protein in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we discuss the structure of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney, and the process by which proteins/peptides enter the urine. We discuss several aspects of proteinuria that impact the proteomic analysis of urine of patients with renal diseases.

AB  - A number of strategies have been explored for the treatment of cutaneous defects such as protein growth factor or gene therapy approaches. Alternative approaches include dermal or dermal-epidermal skin substitutes or clot substitutes such as fibrin sealants (FS?s). Here we test the fibrinogen-thrombin formulation of fibrin sealant combined with fibroblasts and PDGF in wound healing models. Four formulations varying in fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were applied to full-thickness biopsy wounds in the rabbit ear cutaneous wound-healing model with or without cultured rabbit dermal fibroblasts (RDFs; 3???105 cells/wound) embedded in the fibrinogen component. At post-wounding day 7, there was no difference in the diluted vs. non-diluted formulations for either the promotion of granulation tissue coverage of the open wounds or total granulation tissue area when tested without embedded cells. Including the RDFs, the highest degree of wound coverage by granulation tissue was observed in the combined dilution formulation (17.3?mg/ml fibrinogen, 167?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10) that was 167%(p?<?0.05) of the non-diluted FS containing cells (50?mg/ml fibrinogen, 250?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10). Inclusion of fibroblasts increased granulation tissue area within the wounds vs. FS alone (p?<?0.05) for each diluted formulation although no differences in this parameter was observed within each group (FS alone or with embedded cells). However, addition of the vulnerary growth factor PDGF-B (3??g; n?=?4) with the embedded RDFs in the combined dilution formulation increased granulation tissue area over 2-fold (p?<?0.01). Additionally, the presence of the RDFs promoted incorporation of the granulation tissue with and epithelial migration over the FS suggesting an active interaction between cells delivered to the wound by FS and the host repair cells. The findings suggest the progress of cutaneous defect repair can be enhanced by ex vivo cell delivery in Fibrin Sealant that is adjusted to balance hemostasis with promotion of wound healing processes.

AB  - Introduction: Burn depth, based on the hemodynamic alterations that occur following a thermal insult, can be assessed in a rapid, non-invasive, and nondestructive fashion using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR has the capability to determine the difference between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. Methods: Sixteen burn patients admitted to an adult regional burn center were studied and evaluated with the NIR point and imaging devices. Non-burned skin adjacent to the burn site was used as the control. NIR measurements were compared between superficial (8 wounds), full thickness (8 wounds) burn wounds and control sites. Results: NIR was able to easily detect an increase in oxyhemoglobin (68.3%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (4.8%, p?<?0.05%) and total hemoglobin (91.3%, p?<?0.05) which typically occurs with superficial burn injuries. Full thickness injuries experienced a substantial drop in oxyhemoglobin (88.8%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (79.1%, p?<?0.05) and total hemoglobin (77.5%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to control sites. Conclusions: These results confirm that NIR spectroscopy can successfully distinguish between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. The second phase of this study will involve determining the depth of indeterminant burn wounds and this preliminary data will also be presented. Acknowledgement: National Research Council of Canada

AB  - Introduction: Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures at the ends of each chromosome. Due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the full length of the chromosome, up to 50?200 base pairs of the telomere are lost during each successive round of cell division. In adult human somatic cells, telomerase is not active resulting in progressive loss of telomere length and entry into replicative senescence as observed in cell culture. hTERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme which maintains telomere length. Transfection of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) by hTERT has been shown to reverse the senescent phenotype seen in aging HDFs in vitro. ERK (p44/42) is a MAP kinase which functions as a critical intermediary in the determination of cell growth and differentiation. Activation of ERK occurs through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues. ?Methods: In order to delineate some of the cellular mechanisms by which hTERT functions, we treated adenoviral hTERT (Ad-hTERT) transfected HDFs with TGFB1, and assayed phosphorylated ERK activity by Western blotting.?Results: Ad-hTERT treated HDFs demonstrated a 2?3 fold increase in phospho-ERK activity. In addition, our preliminary findings show that Ad-hTERT transfected HDFs have increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression by real-time rtPCR. ?Conclusions: Increased phosphor-ERK activity as well as increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression is seen in hTERT transfected HDF?s. Further studies will focus on defining other intermediary changes resulting from Ad-hTERT tranfection. Funding source: Geron Corporation
