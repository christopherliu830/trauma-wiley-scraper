AB  - Abstract Morpholine is a heterocycle featured in numerous approved and experimental drugs as well as bioactive molecules. It is often employed in the field of medicinal chemistry for its advantageous physicochemical, biological, and metabolic properties, as well as its facile synthetic routes. The morpholine ring is a versatile and readily accessible synthetic building block, it is easily introduced as an amine reagent or can be built according to a variety of available synthetic methodologies. This versatile scaffold, appropriately substituted, possesses a wide range of biological activities. There are many examples of molecular targets of morpholine bioactive in which the significant contribution of the morpholine moiety has been demonstrated; it is an integral component of the pharmacophore for certain enzyme active-site inhibitors whereas it bestows selective affinity for a wide range of receptors. A large body of in vivo studies has demonstrated morpholine's potential to not only increase potency but also provide compounds with desirable drug-like properties and improved pharamacokinetics. In this review we describe the medicinal chemistry/pharmacological activity of morpholine derivatives on various therapeutically related molecular targets, attempting to highlight the importance of the morpholine ring in drug design and development as well as to justify its classification as a privileged structure.

AB  - Abstract Aim Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent commonly used for the prevention and treatment of bleeding disorders. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods From 2005 to 2014, we encountered four CKD patients who experienced severe complications related to TXA. Clinical manifestations and outcome of these patients were recorded. We then performed a qualitative literature review of published cases of TXA toxicity in CKD patients in the PubMed database from 1 January 1972 to 31 December 2015. Results In our centre, two peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients developed neurotoxicity after intravenous TXA use for surgical bleeding and one PD patient developed neurotoxicity after oral TXA use for post-polypectomy colonic bleeding. One kidney transplant recipient developed acute obstructive uropathy due to retention of blood clot at the pelvi-ureteric junction of graft kidney after taking oral TXA for menorrhagia. Dosage of TXA was not adjusted according to renal function in all cases. All of them recovered without permanent disability after TXA was stopped. From our literature search, we identified two cases of neurotoxicity (one PD, one stage 4 CKD patient), one case of retinal toxicity in a haemolysis (HD) patient, one case of ligneous conjunctivitis in a CKD patient, and one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a CKD patient. Conclusion Neurotoxicity is a very common clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in CKD patients. Thrombotic complication is rare. Dosage adjustment of TXA is essential in CKD patients.

AB  - Abstract Recent studies have suggested that changes in serum phosphate levels influence pathological states associated with aging such as cancer, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular function, even in individuals with normal renal function. The causes are only beginning to be elucidated but are likely a combination of endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and cell autonomous effects. We have used an integrated quantitative biology approach, combining transcriptomics and proteomics to define a multi-phase, extracellular phosphate-induced, signaling network in pre-osteoblasts as well as primary human and mouse mesenchymal stromal cells. We identified a rapid mitogenic response stimulated by elevated phosphate that results in the induction of immediate early genes including c-fos. The mechanism of activation requires FGF receptor signaling followed by stimulation of N-Ras and activation of AP-1 and serum response elements. A distinct long-term response also requires FGF receptor signaling and results in N-Ras activation and expression of genes and secretion of proteins involved in matrix regulation, calcification, and angiogenesis. The late response is synergistically enhanced by addition of FGF23 peptide. The intermediate phase results in increased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production and is necessary for the late response providing a functional link between the phases. Collectively, the results define elevated phosphate, as a mitogen and define specific mechanisms by which phosphate stimulates proliferation and matrix regulation. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the cellular response to elevated extracellular phosphate, functionally connecting temporally coordinated signaling, transcriptional, and metabolic events with changes in long-term cell behavior.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation after brain injury is still poorly understood. To further elucidate such processes, here, we examine the interplay between astrocyte proliferation taking place predominantly at the vascular interface and monocyte invasion. Using genetic mouse models that decrease or increase reactive astrocyte proliferation, we demonstrate inverse effects on monocyte numbers in the injury site. Conversely, reducing monocyte invasion using CCR2?/? mice causes a strong increase in astrocyte proliferation, demonstrating an intriguing negative cross-regulation between these cell types at the vascular interface. CCR2?/? mice show reduced scar formation with less extracellular matrix deposition, smaller lesion site and increased neuronal coverage. Surprisingly, the GFAP+ scar area in these mice is also significantly decreased despite increased astrocyte proliferation. Proteomic analysis at the peak of increased astrocyte proliferation reveals a decrease in extracellular matrix synthesizing enzymes in the injury sites of CCR2?/? mice, highlighting how early key aspects of scar formation are initiated. Taken together, we provide novel insights into the cross-regulation of juxtavascular proliferating astrocytes and invading monocytes as a crucial mechanism of scar formation upon brain injury.

AB  - Abstract Fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10), a mitogen for the epithelial cells lining the lower urinary tract, has been identified inside urothelial cells, despite its acknowledged role as an extracellular signaling ligand. Recombinant (r)FGF-10 was determined by fluorescence microscopy optical sectioning to localize strongly to nuclei inside cultured urothelial cells. To clarify the possible role of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in this translocation, a variant of rFGF-10 was constructed which lacked this sequence. rFGF-10(no NLS) was found in cytoplasm to a far greater degree than rFGF-10, identifying this motif as a possible NLS. Furthermore, this variant displayed poor or non-existent bioactivity compared to the wild-type protein in triggering mitogenesis in quiescent urothelial cells. The presence of rFGF-10(no NLS) in the nucleus suggested that additional interactions were also responsible for the nuclear accumulation of rFGF-10. The FGF-10 receptor was observed in cell nuclei regardless of the presence or concentration of exogenous rFGF-10 ligand. Co-localization studies between rFGF-10 and the FGF-10 receptor revealed a strong intracellular relationship between the two. This co-localization was seen in nuclei for both rFGF-10 and for rFGF-10(no NLS), although the correlation was weaker for rFGF-10(no NLS). These data show that an NLS-like motif of rFGF-10 is a partial determinant of its intracellular distribution and is necessary for its mitogenic activity. These advancements in the understanding of the activity of FGF-10 present an opportunity to engineer the growth factor as a therapeutic agent for the healing of damaged urothelial tissue. J. Cell.
