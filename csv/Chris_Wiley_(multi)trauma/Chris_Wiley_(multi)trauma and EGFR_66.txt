AB  - ABSTRACT Marine mussels secret protein-based adhesives, which enable them to anchor to various surfaces in a saline, intertidal zone. Mussel foot proteins (Mfps) contain a large abundance of a unique, catecholic amino acid, Dopa, in their protein sequences. Catechol offers robust and durable adhesion to various substrate surfaces and contributes to the curing of the adhesive plaques. In this article, we review the unique features and the key functionalities of Mfps, catechol chemistry, and strategies for preparing catechol-functionalized polymers. Specifically, we reviewed recent findings on the contributions of various features of Mfps on interfacial binding, which include coacervate formation, surface drying properties, control of the oxidation state of catechol, among other features. We also summarized recent developments in designing advanced biomimetic materials including coacervate-forming adhesives, mechanically improved nano- and micro-composite adhesive hydrogels, as well as smart and self-healing materials. Finally, we review the applications of catechol-functionalized materials for the use as biomedical adhesives, therapeutic applications, and antifouling coatings. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Overview Primary brain tumors are uncommon but aggressive neoplasms even when histology is low grade. Secondary, or metastatic, tumors are at least 3 times more common than all primary tumors combined. Diagnosis is easily established by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgical resection provides histologic confirmation and decompression; surgery alone may suffice for low-grade tumors and most extra-axial tumors such as meningiomas. Treatment of parenchymal brain tumors, primary or metastatic, often requires a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which may improve patient function and control disease but rarely achieves cure.

AB  - Summary A highly regulated extracellular environment and healthy neuronal cell functions are essential for maintaining the viability of the central nervous system (CNS). One way this is achieved is via the blood?brain barrier (BBB), a cellular interface that is responsible for ion and nutrition transportation, separates somatic circulating blood from the cerebrospinal fluid in the CNS, and is important for maintaining the homeostatic balance of the CNS environment. Consisting of tight junctions between endothelial cells of the microvasculature of the CNS, the BBB keeps large microorganisms or hydrophilic molecules in the circulating blood from penetrating into the cerebrospinal fluid. However, limited by current technologies, delivery of therapeutic agents or imaging molecules into the brain is also blocked by these highly selective tight junctions. Currently, targeting of malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and the delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain remains a big obstacle because of the existence of the BBB, but numerous researches have been devoted in discovering the suitable candidates for specific tumor targeting inside the brain.
