AB  - Abstract Adipose tissue is a rich source of multipotent mesenchymal stem-like cells, located in the perivascular niche. Based on their surface markers, these have been assigned to two main categories: CD31?/CD45?/CD34+/CD146? cells (adventitial stromal/stem cells [ASCs]) and CD31?/CD45?/CD34?/CD146+ cells (pericytes [PCs]). These populations display heterogeneity of unknown significance. We hypothesized that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, a functional marker of primitivity, could help to better define ASC and PC subclasses. To this end, the stromal vascular fraction from a human lipoaspirate was simultaneously stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD31, CD45, CD34, and CD146 antigens and the ALDH substrate Aldefluor, then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Individual ASCs (n?=?67) and PCs (n?=?73) selected from the extremities of the ALDH-staining spectrum were transcriptionally profiled by Fluidigm single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction for a predefined set (n?=?429) of marker genes. To these single-cell data, we applied differential expression and principal component and clustering analysis, as well as an original gene coexpression network reconstruction algorithm. Despite the stochasticity at the single-cell level, covariation of gene expression analysis yielded multiple network connectivity parameters suggesting that these perivascular progenitor cell subclasses possess the following order of maturity: (a) ALDHbrASC (most primitive); (b) ALDHdimASC; (c) ALDHbrPC; (d) ALDHdimPC (least primitive). This order was independently supported by specific combinations of class-specific expressed genes and further confirmed by the analysis of associated signaling pathways. In conclusion, single-cell transcriptional analysis of four populations isolated from fat by surface markers and enzyme activity suggests a developmental hierarchy among perivascular mesenchymal stem cells supported by markers and coexpression networks.

AB  - Summary Research in the last decade has revealed that bone is not only a target tissue for numerous circulating hormones but functions as an endocrine organ itself. As a recent study demonstrated a stimulatory effect of the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin (OCN) on testosterone production in mice, we investigated whether such an association can be replicated in humans. We used data from 1338 men (25?86 years) in the population-based epidemiological Study of Health in Pomerania and from 110 male outpatients with bone disorders (18?85 years) for the study. We analysed cross-sectional associations between OCN and total testosterone serum concentrations (TT), as well as associations between further markers of bone turnover [bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), serum C-terminal telopeptides of Type I collagen (CTX), urinary deoxypyridinoline] and TT using ordinary least square (OLS) regression models. Multivariable OLS models revealed a positive association between OCN and TT in the population-based (? coefficients for a one standard deviation increase, 0.590; standard error (SE), 0.175; p-value, <0.01) and patient-based (? coefficient, 0.575; SE, 0.132; p-value, <0.01) samples even after adjustment for age and body mass index (both samples), and time of blood sampling (population-based sample only). Furthermore, we observed positive associations between BAP and TT (? coefficient, 0.403; SE, 0.170; p-value, 0.02) as well as between CTX and TT (? coefficient, 0.733; SE, 0.172; p-value, <0.01) in men from the general population. The present investigation shows that OCN is associated with TT in the general population and in patients with bone disorders, and may thus indicate general male health status. Additional longitudinal observational studies are warranted to confirm our findings and future experimental research is necessary to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the observed associations.

AB  - Summary Whereas the number of patients on the transplant waitlist has steadily increased, the number of deceased donor kidneys has remained far below the growing need, leading to longer waiting time and increased waitlist deaths. The Organ Procurement Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS) database revealed that over the past decade, approximately 22?000?to 34?000 kidney transplant candidates of all ages were added to the waitlist annually. During the same time period, approximately 4300?6700 patients were removed from the list annually due to death or medical conditions that preclude transplantation. Currently, it is estimated that approximately half of the deaths on the waitlist occur among patients who are placed on the ?inactive status? list. Hence, managing the waitlist patients has been one of the greatest problems facing transplant centers. This chapter discusses the categorization of waitlist status set forth by the OPTN/UNOS, factors that may have an impact on waiting times, and suggested guidelines for the management of adult transplant candidates on the active waitlist as well as those on hold for various medical and psychosocial reasons.

AB  - A large number of potential regulatory mechanisms have been described which may be involved in the control of cell function in the periodontium. In this review, soluble effector molecules which may regulate normal cell turnover and which may control the maintenance of the per-iodontal space are considered. There is evidence for the involvement of growth factors including EGF, PDGF, FGFs, IGF I & II and TGF? in these processes. The role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in periodontal turnover is of considerable interest as they appear to be able to regulate all stages of this process from specifying cell commitment to regulating differentiated cell function. Empirical evidence suggests the importance of mechanical stimulation in controlling the maintenance of the periodontal ligament space. The wide range of effects of mechanical stimulation are briefly reviewed and the central role of prostaglandins is considered. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of mineralised tissue function, and the potential role of NO in maintenance of the ligament space is considered. Further studies are required which address the interactions between all of these mechanisms in order to determine the key factors which may control periodontal cell function. For the future an understanding of these interactions has the potential to lead to important clinical developments in periodontal and orthodontic therapy.
