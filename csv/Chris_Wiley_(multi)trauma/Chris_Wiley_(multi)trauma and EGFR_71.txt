AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most serious complications seen in intensive care units (ICUs). However, its epidemiology, risk factors and clinical outcomes in surgical critically ill patients remains unclear. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of the university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. AKI was diagnosed according to the KDIGO 2012 criteria. Results A total of 189 of the 400 patients enrolled in our study developed AKI (47.3%). The severity was: stage 1 = 29.6% of all AKI (56 cases), stage 2 = 30.7% (58 cases), and stage 3 = 39.7% (75 cases). Risk factors of AKI development included a higher BMI, a greater APACHE-II score, septic shock, use of mechanical ventilation, acute medical complications during surgical admission, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. After adjustment for covariates, only the most severe stage of AKI (stage 3) was associated with increasing 28-day ICU mortality compared with no AKI stage, HR = 7.75 (95% CI, 1.46?41.20, P = 0.02). Conclusion Acute kidney injury is common and is associated with an increase in mortality in surgical ICU patients. There should be more focus on patients with AKI risk factors to prevent this deleterious event.

AB  - Summary Increasing numbers of diabetes inpatients across all hospital wards and specialities means that dietitians working in all areas need to have a good understanding of the guidelines for diabetes inpatients and how these apply to their particular patients? needs. In order to minimise impact on appetite for meals, oral nutrition supplements (ONS) are usually prescribed between meals, potentially resulting in extended periods when blood glucose concentrations maybe elevated. Exclusive enteral nutrition induces a more pronounced insulin and glucose response than solid, oral nutrition. Dietitians should be aware of appropriate insulin and medication regimes suited to different feeding rates and timings. Factors to be considered when planning nutritional support include individual nutritional requirements, gut absorption, suitability and tolerance of night-time enteral nutrition, and the need for breaks for procedures or other events. Current guidelines do not make full recommendation for management of patients requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

AB  - Summary This chapter includes HGNC entries for proteins that are expressed on the cell surface, namely receptors for different ligand classes, transporters and ion channels. Targets for existing drugs are strongly over-represented in this group; for example, approximately 40% of current medicines affect G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and hundreds of these molecules are listed with annotations that indicate pharmaceutical potential. The chapter also discusses targets that involve protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions. These are cytokines and their receptors, adhesion molecules and host defence molecules; the allocation of entries in these three sections is less clear-cut than with the GPCRs. The last group of entries that is discussed is the transporters and channels. The ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier families are not only primary therapeutic targets but also contain proteins that contribute to drug resistance.

AB  - Abstract The diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of lower extremity amputation worldwide and is directly associated with comorbidity, disability and mortality. Oxidative stress mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these wounds. Intra-lesional infiltration of epidermal growth factor has emerged as a potential therapeutic alternative to allow for physiological benefit while avoiding the proteolytic environment at the centre of the wound. The aim of this study was to characterise the response of patients with DFUs to epidermal growth factor treatment in terms of redox status markers. Experimental groups included patients with DFUs before and 3?4 weeks after starting treatment with epidermal growth factor; compensated and non-compensated diabetic patients without ulcers; and age-matched non-diabetic subjects. Evaluations comprised serum levels of oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve markers. Patients with DFUs exhibited the most disheveled biochemical profile, with elevated oxidative stress and low antioxidant reserves, with respect to non-ulcerated diabetic patients and to non-diabetic subjects. Epidermal growth factor intra-lesional administration was associated with a significant recovery of oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve markers. Altogether, our results indicate that epidermal growth factor intra-ulcer therapy contributes to restore systemic redox balance in patients with DFUs.
