AB  - To reach ideal therapeutic potential of stem cells for regenerative medicine purposes, it is essential to retain their self-renewal and differentiation capacities. Currently, biological factors are extensively used for stemness maintaining and differentiation induction of stem cells. However, low stability, high cost, complicated production process, and risks associated with viral/endotoxin infection hamper the widespread use of biological factors in the stem cell biology. Moreover, regarding the modulation of several signaling cascades, which lead to a distinct fate, phytochemicals are preferable in the stem cells biology because of their efficiency. Considering the issues related to the application of biological factors and potential advantages of phytochemicals in stem cell engineering, there is a considerable increasing trend in studies associated with the application of novel alternative molecules in the stem cell biology. In support of this statement, we aimed to highlight the various effects of phytochemicals on signaling cascades involved in commitment of stem cells. Hence, in this review, the current trends in the phytochemicals-based modulation of stem cell fate have been addressed. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Malignant glioma is the most common adult primary brain tumor, and the mechanism of its oncogenesis is poorly understood. Growing evidence has shown that E3 ubiquitin ligases can promote tumorgenesis of glioma. CHIP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can induce ubiquitylation and degradation of many tumor-related proteins, and it has been reported to act as an upstream regulator in breast cancer; however, its role in human gliomas has not been evaluated yet. In this study, the expression of CHIP in glioma tissues was studied using immunohistochemistry. CHIP expression in glioma cells was studied by real-time RT-PCR, western blot and double immunofluorescence staining. The role of CHIP in glioma oncogenesis was investigated by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression in vitro and in vivo. We showed CHIP expression in glioma samples was related to tumor grades, with stronger staining in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. Knocking down of CHIP suppressed proliferation, colony formation of U251 and U87 glioma cells, while overexpression of CHIP resulted in enhanced proliferation and colony formation in vitro. In a nude mouse xenograft model, intratumoral injection of CHIP RNAi lentivirus significantly delayed tumor growth. In contrast, overexpression of CHIP resulted in enhanced tumor growth in vivo. After CHIP RNAi, both survivin mRNA and protein were decreased, while CHIP overexpression induced increased mRNA and protein levels of survivin. This is the first study demonstrating CHIP contributes to oncogenesis of glioma. (Cancer Sci 2011; 102: 959?966)

AB  - Abstract Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are endowed with the ability to generate multiple cell lineages and carry great therapeutic potentials in regenerative medicine. Future application of ESCs in human health and diseases will embark on the delineation of molecular mechanisms that define the biology of ESCs. Here, we discuss how the finite ESC components mediate the intriguing task of brain development and exhibit biomedical potentials to cure diverse neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract There is increasing evidence that Darwin?s theory of evolution by natural selection provides insights into the etiology and treatment of cancer. On a microscopic scale, neoplastic cells meet the conditions for evolution by Darwinian selection: cell reproduction with heritable variability that affects cell survival and replication. This suggests that, like other areas of biological and biomedical research, Darwinian theory can provide a general framework for understanding many aspects of cancer, including problems of great clinical importance. With the availability of raw molecular data increasing rapidly, this theory may provide guidance in translating data into understanding and progress. Several conceptual and analytical tools from evolutionary biology can be applied to cancer biology. Two clinical problems may benefit most from the application of Darwinian theory: neoplastic progression and acquired therapeutic resistance. The Darwinian theory of cancer has especially profound implications for drug development, both in terms of explaining past difficulties, and pointing the way toward new approaches. Because cancer involves complex evolutionary processes, research should incorporate both tractable (simplified) experimental systems, and also longitudinal observational studies of the evolutionary dynamics of cancer in laboratory animals and in human patients. Cancer biology will require new tools to control the evolution of neoplastic cells.
