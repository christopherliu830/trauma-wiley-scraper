AB  - Overview Breast cancer in women remains a major medical problem with significant public health and societal ramifications, including issues related to screening, risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and survival following diagnosis. Major advances have markedly improved the understanding of clinical phenotypes, as well as the biologic pathways that drive tumor growth and resistance. This research has led to dramatic changes in treatment that have contributed to a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality over the last two decades, and is the basis of ongoing clinical research. Molecular profiling has provided insights into the heterogeneity of breast cancer subtypes; combining biology and tumor burden has allowed stratification of both risk and treatment to begin the process of individualizing screening, prevention, and treatment. As new information accumulates, new paradigms of management become the standard of care reflected in international guidelines. Our challenge is to apply new formation and treatment appropriately and effectively, and to understand both response and resistance. Information obtained from molecular, biologic, and pathologic investigations and clinical trials provides the major focus of this chapter.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains some of the tissue characteristics and basic principles of imaging and discusses specific applications and techniques in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A magnetic resonance technique that simulates magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) but which differs in principle is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The goal of MRCP is to selectively image fluid within the biliary tree and pancreatic duct. Various comparisons of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and MRI have shown that MRI has significantly better capacity to characterize liver lesions. MRI of the pancreas is optimally performed with a high-performance gradient system (1.5 T) using phased-array torso coil to improve the signal-to-noise ratio with a smaller field of view and thin-slice profile. Magnetic resonance sequences used to evaluate the gallbladder are similar to other imaging protocols used in the abdomen, including axial T1-weighted breath-hold gradient echo (GRE) chemical shift sequences, T2-weighted sequences, MRCP, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Preclinical and clinical data have shown promise in using antiangiogenic agents to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). We conducted this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of single-agent pazopanib in patients with MPM. Materials and Methods Patients with MPM who had received 0?1 prior chemotherapy regimens were eligible to receive pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6), with a preplanned interim analysis for futility. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS, adverse events assessment and clinical benefit (complete response, partial response [PR], and stable disease [SD]). Results Thirty-four evaluable patients were enrolled, with a median age of 73?years (49?84). The trial was closed early because of lack of efficacy at the preplanned interim analysis. Only 8 patients (28.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2?48.7%) in the first 28 evaluable were progression-free at 6 months. PFS6 was 32.4% (95% CI, 17.4?50.5). There were 2 PR (5.9%) and 16 SD (47.1%). The overall median PFS and OS were 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.0?6.0) and 11.5 months (95% CI: 5.3?18.2), respectively. The median PFS and OS for the previously untreated patients was 5.4 months (95% CI, 2.7?8.5) and 16.6 months (95% CI, 6.6?30.6), respectively; and 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.3?4.2) and 5.0 months (95% CI: 3.0?11.9), respectively, for the previously treated patients. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed in 23 patients (67.6%). Conclusion Single-agent pazopanib was poorly tolerated in patients with MPM. The primary endpoint of PFS6 was not achieved in the current study. ClinicalTrials.gov identification number. NCT00459862. Implications for Practice Single-agent pazopanib did not meet its endpoint in this phase II trial in malignant mesothelioma. Pazopanib is well tolerated in mesothelioma patients with a manageable toxicity profile. There is a need to better identify signals of angiogenesis that can be targeted in mesothelioma. Encouraging findings in frontline treatment warrant further investigations in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
