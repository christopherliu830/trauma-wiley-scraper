AB  - Summary The adrenal glands are chiefly responsible for releasing hormones in response to stress through the synthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol and catecholamines such as epinephrine, and in response to plasma osmolarity changes through the secretion of aldosterone. The adrenal cortex is divided into functional zones, including zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. The outermost layer, the zona glomerulosa, is the main site for production of mineralocorticoids, mainly aldosterone, which is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure by affecting the functions of the kidneys. The innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is responsible for producing glucocorticoids, chiefly cortisol. Whereas the zona glomerulosa is primarily regulated by angiotensin II, both the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis are regulated by corticotropin or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Both these zones become hypofunctional and atrophic when adrenocorticotropic hormone is deficient; on the other hand, they become hypertrophic and hyperplastic when adrenocorticotropic hormone is secreted in excess.

AB  - Abstract It is difficult to convey the accelerating rate and growing importance of mass spectrometry applications to human blood proteins and peptides. Mass spectrometry can rapidly detect and identify the ionizable peptides from the proteins in a simple mixture and reveal many of their post-translational modifications. However, blood is a complex mixture that may contain many proteins first expressed in cells and tissues. The complete analysis of blood proteins is a daunting task that will rely on a wide range of disciplines from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, electromagnetic instrumentation, mathematics and computation. Therefore the comprehensive discovery and analysis of blood proteins will rank among the great technical challenges and require the cumulative sum of many of mankind's scientific achievements together. A variety of methods have been used to fractionate, analyze and identify proteins from blood, each yielding a small piece of the whole and throwing the great size of the task into sharp relief. The approaches attempted to date clearly indicate that enumerating the proteins and peptides of blood can be accomplished. There is no doubt that the mass spectrometry of blood will be crucial to the discovery and analysis of proteins, enzyme activities, and post-translational processes that underlay the mechanisms of disease. At present both discovery and quantification of proteins from blood are commonly reaching sensitivities of ?1?ng/mL. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:685?732, 2011

AB  - The incidence and severity of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) increase with advancing age, as does the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Not surprisingly, heterogeneous forms of CVD may coexist with AD changes in the ?ageing brain?. These include angiopathies (affecting both large and small arteries) that result from ?classical? risk factors (hypertension, smoking and diabetes) and others (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) that are biochemically closely linked to AD. The morphologic consequences of these various vascular diseases are infarcts and/or haemorrhages of varying sizes within the brain, which lead to neurocognitive decline that may mimic AD ? though the vascular abnormalities are usually detectable by neuroimaging. More subtle effects of CVD may include neuroinflammation and biochemical ?lesions? that have no reliable morphologic correlate and thus escape the attention of even an experienced Neuropathologist. The pathogenesis of hippocampal injury resembling ischaemic change ? commonly seen in the brains of geriatric subjects ? remains controversial. In recent years, genetically determined forms of microangiopathy (e.g. CADASIL, CARASIL, Trex1-related microangiopathies, CARASAL, familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or CAA) have provided interesting cellular and molecular clues to the pathogenesis of sporadic microvascular disease such as arteriolosclerosis and AD-related CAA.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent cells that due to their ability to homing to damaged tissues and differentiate into specialized cells, are remarkable cells in the field of regenerative medicine. It's suggested that the predominant mechanism of MSCs in tissue repair might be related to their paracrine activity. The utilization of MSCs for tissue repair is initially based on the differentiation ability of these cells; however now it has been revealed that only a small fraction of the transplanted MSCs actually fuse and survive in host tissues. Indeed, MSCs supply the microenvironment with the secretion of soluble trophic factors, survival signals and the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosome. Also, the paracrine activity of EVs could mediate the cellular communication to induce cell-differentiation/self-renewal. Recent findings suggest that EVs released by MSCs may also be critical in the physiological function of these cells. This review provides an overview of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles as a hopeful opportunity to advance novel cell-free therapy strategies that might prevail over the obstacles and risks associated with the use of native or engineered stem cells. EVs are very stable; they can pass the biological barriers without rejection and can shuttle bioactive molecules from one cell to another, causing the exchange of genetic information and reprogramming of the recipient cells. Moreover, extracellular vesicles may provide therapeutic cargo for a wide range of diseases and cancer therapy.

AB  - Abstract More than a decade ago our groups pioneered the analysis of serum proteins of laboratory animals with up-to-date proteomic techniques. We were, and still are, convinced that conforming animal procedures to the minimally invasive approaches typical of clinical biochemistry focuses attention on the actual conditions under which any finding arrived at on animal models of disease may eventually be applied to human patients for screening/diagnosis. We are also convinced that, besides the proteins present in trace level as a result of tissue leakage during disorders affecting specific peripheral organs, changes in the concentration of some of the major serum proteins as part of an acute-phase response may be taken as biological end-points during a number of experimental procedures. When reviewing literature data about proteomic investigations on plasma or serum of mice, we realized that not much work has been done in the direction we favor. In addition, we noticed that sometimes information about serum proteome has been coarsely treated and in a few cases even misunderstood/misused. In the following, we present current findings on serum/plasma proteome of the laboratory mouse not only under control conditions and during an experimentally induced acute-phase reaction, but also in a number of models of disease, mainly related to cancer and to metabolic disorders.
