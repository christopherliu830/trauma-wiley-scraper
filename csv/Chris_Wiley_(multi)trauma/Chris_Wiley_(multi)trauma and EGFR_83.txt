AB  - Overview The management of soft tissue sarcomas is driven by the anatomic site and histology of the primary and is increasingly affected by the specific genetics of the sarcoma. In this chapter, we focus on the principles of management of this group of over 50 cancer subtypes to highlight commonalities and differences from anatomical constraints of surgery to specifics of adjuvant radiation to identification of systemic therapeutics that are appropriate for each histology. We will discuss in this chapter the etiology, presentation, diagnosis, staging, and multidisciplinary management of patients with sarcomas of soft tissue. Surgery remains paramount to achieve cure for the vast majority of sarcomas. Radiation therapy is used for larger tumors in the appropriate clinical context. The evolution of increasingly sophisticated radiation techniques is highlighted in this chapter. As pertains to systemic therapy, this chapter is written at a time in which first-line therapies for soft tissue sarcomas may change, raising anew some questions of adjuvant therapy that remain incompletely answered. Where appropriate, we attempt to link specific histologies or molecular changes to therapeutic suggestions, with the understanding and hope that novel agents will supplant the medications that are available but that have not materially affected outcomes for few diagnoses other than GIST in the past several years.

AB  - Abstract Neuronal development relies on a highly choreographed progression of dynamic cellular processes by which newborn neurons migrate, extend axons and dendrites, innervate their targets, and make functional synapses. Many of these dynamic processes require coordinated changes in morphology, powered by the cell's cytoskeleton. Intermediate filaments (IFs) are the third major cytoskeletal elements in vertebrate cells, but are rarely considered when it comes to understanding axon and dendrite growth, pathfinding and synapse formation. In this review, we first introduce the many new and exciting concepts of IF function, discovered mostly in non-neuronal cells. These roles include dynamic rearrangements, crosstalk with microtubules and actin filaments, mechano-sensing and -transduction, and regulation of signaling cascades. We then discuss the understudied roles of neuronally expressed IFs, with a particular focus on IFs expressed during development, such as nestin, vimentin and α-internexin. Lastly, we illustrate how signaling modulation by the unconventional IF nestin shapes neuronal morphogenesis in unexpected and novel ways. Even though the first IF knockout mice were made over 20?years ago, the study of the cell biological functions of IFs in the brain still has much room for exciting new discoveries.

AB  - Summary In principle, for the development of pharmacophore models, two different approaches are known, the ligand-based and the structure-based approaches. Ligand-based pharmacophore modeling is an important tool for facilitating drug discovery in the absence of a macromolecular target structure. Structure-based pharmacophore modeling is based on the 3D structure of a macromolecule-ligand complex or a macromolecule without a ligand. As every virtual screening tool, also pharmacophore modeling very much depends on the data employed for model generation, refinement, and theoretical validation. This chapter describes the entire multiple ligand continuum from linked pharmacophore patterns to highly integrated examples including biological results to illustrate the broad spectrum of successful pathways for design and development of multiple ligands. It discusses the author's work to develop efficient kinase inhibitors to enable the development and characterization of further kinase targets and drugs.

AB  - Abstract Electrochemical immunosensors (EIs) for the determination of disease biomarkers has attracted a wide interest due to its high sensitivity, low cost, and possible integration in compact analytical devices. The use of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to develop EIs contributes to the great potential they have in point of care (POC) test, since SPEs show good electrical properties and allow the reduction of the electrochemical instrumentation down to small pocket-size devices. Moreover, during the last years, SPEs have gone through significant improvements related to both their design and printing materials. Since cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the major threats of global health, there is a growing demand for the development of portable, rapid, simple and inexpensive devices for the detection of these diseases. This article presents an overview about the main biomarkers of cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the EIs based on SPEs for the detection of these biomarkers.
