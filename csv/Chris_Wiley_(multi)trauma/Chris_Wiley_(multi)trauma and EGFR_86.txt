AB  - Abstract Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing cells that generate the major cell types of the central nervous system, namely neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, during embryonic development and in the adult brain. NSCs reside in a complex niche where they are exposed to a plethora of signals, including both soluble and physical signals such as compressive and shear stresses, but also discontinuities and differences in morphology of the extracellular environment, termed as topographical features. Different approaches that incorporate artificial micro- and nano-scale surface topographical features have been developed aiming to recapitulate the in vivo NSC niche discontinuities and features, particularly for in vitro studies. The present review article aims at reviewing the existing body of literature on the use of artificial micro- and nano-topographical features to control NSCs orientation and differentiation into neuronal and/or neuroglial lineage. The different approaches on the study of the underlying mechanism of the topography-guided NSC responses are additionally revised and discussed.

AB  - The 22nd Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) Scientific Retreat was convened in Washington, D.C. from October 8 to 10, 2015. This event is the foremost scientific conference in the world focusing on basic, translational, and clinical prostate cancer research with the highest potential for accelerating the understanding of prostate cancer biology and improving the lives and outcomes of prostate cancer patients. Topics highlighted during the 2015 Retreat included: (i) new strategies and treatments for localized high-risk, hormone-naïve, oligometastatic, castrate-resistant, and treatment-refractory prostate cancer settings; (ii) the biology and genomics of tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution; (iii) new understandings on the mechanisms and targeting of oncogenic drivers of prostate cancer; (iv) bioengineering of novel therapies and drug delivery methods; (v) innovative approaches to tumor immunotherapy; (vi) emerging molecular imaging technologies with improved sensitivity and specificity; and (vii) advancements in prognostic and predictive biomarkers and precision medicine strategies.

AB  - Abstract IL-2RA are frequently used as induction therapy in liver transplant recipients to decrease the risk of AR while allowing the reduction of concomitant immunosuppression. The exact association with the use of IL-2RA, however, is uncertain. We performed a systematic literature search for relevant studies. Random effects models were used to assess the incidence of AR, steroid-resistant rejection, graft loss, patient death, and adverse drug reaction, with or without IL-2RA. Six studies (two randomized and four non-randomized) met the eligibility criteria. Acute rejection at six months or later favored the use of IL-2RA significantly (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.22?0.66, p = 0.0005). Although not statistically significant, IL-2RA showed a substantial reduction of the risk of steroid-resistant rejection (RR 0.32; CI 0.19?1.03, p = 0.0594). Graft loss and patient death showed a reductive tendency through the use of IL-2RA. The use of IL-2RA is safe and is associated with a statistically significantly lower incidence of AR after transplantation and substantial reduction of steroid-resistant rejection, graft loss, and patient death.

AB  - Abstract We present a summary of a guideline produced by an international group of experts for managing type 1 diabetes in adults with an emphasis on the special needs of older people with this condition. The rationale for delivering high-quality diabetes care for adults with type 1 diabetes, why it is important to include older people in our considerations, and the key underpinning principles of the guideline are included. The structure of the recommendations given is described and consists of ?general? recommendations followed by ?specific? recommendations according to three categories depending on the characteristics of adults addressed, such as functional level or self-management ability. Recommendations are provided in the areas of: clinical diagnosis, establishing management plans and glucose regulation, diabetes self-management education, nutritional therapy, physical activity, exercise and lifestyle modification, insulin treatments and regimens, use of technology in diabetes management, hypoglycaemia, managing cardiovascular risk, management of microvascular risk, and inpatient management of type 1 diabetes and ketoacidosis.
