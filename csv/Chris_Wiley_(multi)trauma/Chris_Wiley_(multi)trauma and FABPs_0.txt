AB  - Abstract Extended human longevity has resulted in increasing numbers of elderly persons in the general population. However, old age is also associated with a variety of serious physical disorders. Frailty among sedentary elderly patients is related to the impaired structure and function of contractile fibers. Biochemical research into cellular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia promises to acquire the scientific basis of evidence to aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The recent application of MS-based proteomic methodology has identified a large cohort of disease-specific markers of sarcopenia. This review critically examines the biomedical implications of the results obtained from the proteomic screening of both aged human muscle and established animal models of sarcopenia. Substantial alterations in proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, regulatory and contractile elements of the actomyosin apparatus, myofibrillar remodeling and the cellular stress response are discussed. A multi-factorial etiology appears to be the basis for a slower-twitching aged fiber population, which exhibits a shift to more aerobic-oxidative metabolism. It is hoped that the detailed biomedical characterization of the newly identified biomarkers of sarcopenia will translate into better treatment options for reversing age-dependent muscle degeneration, which could improve the standard of living for a large portion of society.

AB  - Background:?? Previous studies have shown that nutritional status affects recovery after elective surgery. The impact of nutritional status in the acute surgical setting has not been well defined. Methods:?? Over a 4?week period consecutive patients admitted for >24?hours under the general surgical service at a tertiary hospital were screened on admission using the subjective global assessment (SGA) nutritional assessment tool. Results:?? Of 332 eligible patients, 310 were screened. Diagnoses at discharge were: Colorectal pathology (28%), Infective (23%), Hepatopancreaticobiliary (15%), upper gastrointestinal (9%), Vascular (5%), trauma (5%), other (15%). 5% had a malignancy diagnosed during their admission. Mean age was 52?years (95% CI 18?84), mean BMI was 28.6?kg/m2 (95% CI 19.2?41.7), and 170 (55%) were female. 48% were deemed well nourished (SGA-A), 40% had moderate/suspected malnutrition (SGA-B) and 12% were severely malnourished (SGA-C). Median (range) hospital stay was 3 (1?20), 5 (1?30) and 7 (2?38)?days (p < 0.001 Kruskal Wallis) for SGA category A to C respectively. Cox regression revealed that SGA was an independent predictor of day stay after taking age, malignancy, sex, albumin, lymphocyte and diagnosis into consideration. Conclusion:?? Nutritional status in the acute surgical setting, as measured by a simple clinical tool predicts duration of hospital stay. Admission nutrition screening may be considered in order to determine nutritional requirements of acute surgical patients.

AB  - Purpose:?? To investigate intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, in both rat intestinal ischaemia reperfusion injury, and in human necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Methodology:?? Plasma was collected from anaesthetized rats that underwent intestinal ischaemia reperfusion (IIR) injury and from control rats undergoing sham laparotomy. In a separate study, plasma and urine was collected from infants with NEC, and from control infants with non-abdominal diagnoses. iFABP was measured in urine and plasma using a commercially available ELISA. SMA was detected in plasma using a western blot technique. Results are median [IQR] and compared by Mann-Whitney test unless otherwise stated. Results:?? Animal model: Plasma iFABP was significantly higher in the IRI group compared with control group (IRI 32.4 [29.2] ng/ml vs. control 3.8 [3.3] ng/ml; p < 0.01). SMA became detectable in IRI plasma during reperfusion (p < 0.01 compared with pre-ischaemia, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test), but never in the control group. Human NEC Study:?? Urinary iFABP was significantly higher in the NEC group (2.1 [3.9] pg/nmol) compared to controls (1.1 [0.7] pg/nmol, p, < 0.05). Furthermore plasma and urinary iFABP correlated with extent of intestinal damage at laparotomy, and decreased with NEC resolution. SMA was detectable in the plasma of infants with multifocal or panintestinal NEC, but in neither focal nor non-operative disease. Conclusion:?? FABP and SMA are markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, and may offer clinically relevant information in the diagnosis and management of severe intestinal disease.

AB  - Background:?? Necrotising fasciitis is a soft tissue infection with progressive tissue necrosis, affecting the deep fascial layers. It is a rare life-threatening disease with mortality rates from 6.1?43%. Many factors have been associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate these factors by analysing data from a larger patient series than any presented in the published literature to date. Methods:?? The medical records of 151 sequential patients with necrotising fasciitis treated in the Alfred Hospital from 1997?2004 were reviewed to identify the factors associated with increased mortality. The data was then analysed with multivariate analysis to identify the statistically significant factors. Results:?? Mortality rate of this study was 11.3%. The statistically significant factors were CRP > 200 on admission (p = 0.018), mechanical ventilation on admission (p = 0.002), older age (p = 0.0231), male (p = 0.013), delayed hyperbaric therapy from first symptoms (p = 0.045), spontaneous precipitant (p = 0.015), and complications of multi organ failure (p = 0.006), acute renal failure (0.011), acidosis (p = 0.001) or atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001), sepsis (p = 0.045). Conclusions:?? The knowledge of these factors will assist in the management of necrotising fasciitis by prioritising these patients, allocating more appropriate resources to prevent delay in hyperbaric treatment and by promptly treat the disease, especially in ICU setting to prevent complications and improve survival.

AB  - Summary Background The prevalence of exercise-induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms has been reported up to 70%. The pathophysiology largely remains unknown. Aim To review the physiological and pathophysiological changes of the GI-tract during physical exercise and the management of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods Search of the literature published in the English and Dutch languages using the Pubmed database to review the literature that focused on the relation between splanchnic blood flow (SBF), development of ischaemia, postischaemic endotoxinemia and motility. Results During physical exercise, the increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) redistributes blood flow from the splanchnic organs to the working muscles. With prolonged duration and/or intensity, the SBF may be decreased by 80% or more. Most studies point in the direction of increased SNS-activity as central driving force for reduction in SBF. A severely reduced SBF may frequently cause GI ischaemia. GI-ischaemia combined with reduced vagal activity probably triggers changes in GI-motility and GI absorption derangements. GI-symptoms during physical exercise may be prevented by lowering the exercise intensity, preventing dehydration and avoiding the ingestion of hypertonic fluids. Conclusions Literature on the pathophysiology of exercise-induced GI-symptoms is scarce. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity and decreased splanchnic blood flow during physical exercise seems to be the key factor in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced GI-symptoms, and this should be the target for symptom reduction.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.
