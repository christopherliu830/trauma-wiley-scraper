AB  - Objective:?? To determine whether serum antioxidant capacity measured by the electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) could resolve differences in severity of the inflammatory disease acute pancreatitis. Methods:?? Experimental animal study using male Wistar rats. Group 1 (baseline), immediate euthanasia with no surgical interventions; Group 2 (sham), identical surgical procedures to the pancreatitis groups but no intraductal infusion; Groups 3?5, acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 3%, 4% or 5% sodium taurocholate respectively. Terminal blood and pancreatic tissue samples for CV, biochemistry and histology were collected at 12?h (Groups 2?5). Results:?? There was a significant positive correlation of the first serum cyclic voltametric peak current maxima (CVi1) with pancreatic histological severity (Spearman r = 0.51, p = 0.007) as well as with a number of other markers of systemic disease severity, notably bicarbonate (r =?0.57, p = 0.002), base excess (r =?0.65, p < 0.001) urea (r =?0.68, p < 0.001) and calcium (r =?0.60, p = 0.008). CVi1 was superior at indicating the severity of the disease state compared to a standard method of total antioxidant capacity measurement. Conclusions:?? CV was found to be a simple, technique that could differentiate between the physiological and histological severities of acute pancreatitis. Further clinical studies are now justified to determine if point-of-care CV offers prognostic and treatment-monitoring advantages for severe acute inflammatory illnesses within the critical care setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? Inguinal hernia repair is a common operation with much focus in recent times on improving morbidity. The use of mesh repair has greatly decreased reoccurrence rates and focus turns towards improving postoperative groin pain. This review examines the use of UHS in inguinal hernia repair and relation with postoperative groin pain. Methods:?? A retrospective audit of consecutive cases over one year (telephone and mailed questionnaires) was conducted. The recently validated IPQ (inguinal pain score) was used. A review of files and operative reports was also undertaken. Cases undergoing bilateral repair, or other operations simultaneously were excluded. Results:?? 59 patients (61%) participated in the audit, with a mean follow up of 11?months (range 5?16). 4 minor wound complications occurred. Higher pain scores appeared to correlate preoperatively with age and workers compensation status. Postoperative pain scores and limitation to functional status were low, and trended towards lower values in the UHS (ultrapro hernia system) repair group compared to the group who underwent repair with PHS (preceding week pain scores respectively ?UHS repair, mean 1.22, (95%CI 1.07?1.38); PHS 1.76, (95%CI 1.11?2.43)). The average time until pain disappeared in the groin was within one month (IPQ score of 1.27). For those patients still experiencing any pain, (14 of 59; 23.7%) it occurred on average, once per week for minutes to hours and was at a level that could be ignored. Conclusion:?? Inguinal hernia repair with UHS appears to be a safe procedure with minimal complications and a favourable postoperative chronic pain profile.

AB  - Introduction:?? The goal of an acute general surgical unit (AGSU) is to improve the management of all emergency surgical admissions including those with acute gall bladder disease. In May 2008, John Hunter Hospital Newcastle implemented an AGSU. Changes to service provision included an in-house consultant (7?am to 7?pm) dedicated to acute surgery with access to an afternoon operating list most weekdays. This study compares the management of acute gall bladder disease before and after implementation of the AGSU in the setting of an unchanged policy of operative management during the index admission (where appropriate) for acute gall bladder disease. Method:?? An analysis was performed of all patients admitted via the emergency department with biliary colic or cholecystitis. Demographic, clinical management data and complications were compared for the 6?months of June to November (inclusive) 2007 (pre-AGSU) and 2008 (AGSU). Results:?? In 6?months of 2007, 45 patients were admitted with acute gall bladder disease of which 35 (78%) underwent operative management. By comparison in the same 6?months of 2008, there were 70 admissions, with operative management in 61 (87%). In 2008 average length of stay was 4.24?days (5.07?days in 2007); average time from admission to surgery 34.8?hrs (54.5?hours in 2007, p < 0.05) and, 70.5% of operations occurred between 8?am and 5?pm on a weekday (60% in 2007). Conclusion:?? The provision of an acute gall bladder service is improved within a dedicated acute general surgical unit. This translates to benefits to patients, staff and healthcare economics.

AB  - The SAT SET course is an innovative course designed by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in response to a need to meet the challenges posed by the new SET training program. The course aims to teach current Fellows of the College a number of skills and evaluation methods required of surgical supervisors in assessment and performance management. Specifically, the course demonstrates effective use of the Mini-CEX and DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) for initial and mid-term assessment of trainees; discusses the College's training policies and relevant legal issues such as the appeals process, as well as explaining expectations of their roles as supervisors and trainers. The course is a forerunner in Australia in active teaching of modern competency-based assessment tools implemented across a number of disciplines and workplace environments. From its commencement in May 2007 until September 2008, 555 Fellows have participated in SAT SET courses convened in Australia and New Zealand (229 in 2007, 326 in 2008). In addition, 185 SET Supervisor Fellows have attended the course, approximately 40% of all Surgical Supervisors in Australasia. Our survey aims to test the outcomes of the SAT SET course by the cumulative feedback from Supervisors who have attended the course and follow-up. Future iterations to improve the course, such as video demonstration of mid-term assessment, co-badging of SAT SET courses with hospitals and expansion of resources for facilitators will also be discussed.

AB  - Background:?? The main aims of intestinal failure (IF) surgery are to reduce the severity of IF in patients by repairing fistulae and restoring continuity in those with short gut, and to restore body image. We report on the surgical management of IF patients at a major tertiary referral institution, in order to evaluate current management practises and outcomes. Methods:?? Retrospective review of outcomes between July 2005 and December 2007. Results:?? 60 patients (36 male; median age 47?yrs) underwent 78 operations. On presentation 42 (70%) required parenteral nutrition (PN) and 34 (57%) had stomas. IF was secondary to short gut in 19 (30%) or enterocutaneous fistulae in 42 (70%). Median number of procedures before referral was 4 (1?14). Median time from last operation to our intervention was 365?days (25?3534). Median length of stay postoperatively was 16?days, and at a median follow-up of 268?days, 54 (90%) had been discharged from surgical care. 7 (12%) required ICU care postoperatively but 30?day/inpatient mortality rates were 0%. Re-fistulation occurred in 5 patients. 23 (56%) became independent of PN. Residual small bowel length was the only significant contributing factor identified (p = 0.007). Conclusion:?? Surgical management of IF is safe when performed in a dedicated unit and when time is allowed for patient optimisation.

AB  - Herniae have been documented since ancient times, but the era of modern hernia treatment is accepted as starting with the surgery of Bassini. Suture repairs of various types then dominated the treatment of hernia until the era of mesh repair championed by Stoppa and Lichtenstein. Surgeons feel that mesh repairs have revolutionized hernia surgery. Have the mesh repairs really made such a difference? There is evidence that all is not as it seems! Published recurrence figures don't seem to withstand close scrutiny. One of the trendy terms in herniology is the ?myo-pectineal orifice?, while many hernia specialists pay lip service to this concept, very few available hernia operations address this problem. The latest area of interest in the world of hernia surgery is the area of post-hernia groin pain, either neuralgic or non-neuralgic. There are studies showing an incidence of chronic groin pain following anterior repairs of 30% or more, and yet these operations are the most common hernia operations in the world! Keith in 1924 first postulated the concept of herniosis and was criticized. However there is a large volume of convincing evidence that herniae are manifestations of a metabolic disorder. They are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm and possibly with such diverse conditions as diverticular disease, cholelithiasis, and perhaps haemorrhoidal disease. Are we there yet? The answer is certainly no. However research into the metabolic problem of hernia development means that we are surely closer than we have ever been before.

AB  - Background:?? The rate of adverse events occurring in Australian hospitals is reported to be up to 12?17%. Adverse events need to be identified, reported and responded to if the system of health care is to be improved. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and nature of adverse events (unintentional harm arising as a result of healthcare) in general surgery in the Geelong Hospital. Method:?? A review was conducted of adverse events in the hospital incident reporting system (Riskman) and general surgical audits between 2004 and 2008. Adverse events were categorised according to severity (1?4) and the hospital response to these events noted. Results:?? There were 888 adverse events arising in 12801 general surgical admissions (6.93%). Their severity assessment codes (SAC) were: catastrophic (0.15%),; major (0.40%),; moderate (2.22%),; and minor (4.30). Some of the complications reported in surgical audits were also adverse events, the major ones being mortality (0.74%), unplanned reoperation (1.27%) and unplanned readmission (1.46%). Identification and tracking of these enabled implementation of system changes. These included a colorectal outcome reporting, PreVENT program (for DVT prophylaxis), review of colonoscopy initiatives, bedside tracheostomy care, and an electronic system to respond to pathology results (TR3). Conclusion:?? The adverse event rates occurring in general surgery at the Geelong Hospital were lower than those previously reported in the literature and may reflect a general improvement in the quality of care during the last decade if these rates are applicable to other hospitals. The hospital response to adverse events has resulted in significant sustainable system changes.

AB  - Introduction:?? The aim of the study was to evaluate whether C reactive protein level (CRP) on admission could aid the diagnostic accuracy of Alvarado score in acute appendicitis. Patients and methods : 233 patients (males 115, females 118, median age 28?years, range 15?87?years) who underwent appendicectomy were evaluated. Methods:?? Patients were categorized in to 3 groups retrospectively based on the Alvarado score. Group I: score 7?10 (n = 154), Group II: score 4?6 (n = 66), Group III: score < 3 (n = 13). Negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of CRP which was performed at the time of admission was calculated. Results:?? Overall, 169 of 233 (72.5%) had histopathological confirmation of acute appendicitis. In Group I it was 134 patients (87%), Group II: 35 patients (53%) and none of patients in Group III. NPV and PPV for Group I was 29.6% and 85.5%, Group II was 65% and 80% respectively. Conclusion:?? The CRP level improves the predictive value of diagnosing acute appendicitis in the equivocal group of Alvarado 4?6. Patients in this group with a normal CRP should be further investigated before proceeding to appendicectomy.

AB  - Aim: 1 Determine the sensitivity and specificity of Webster wound dehiscence (WD) risk scoring system when applied to a population beyond purely a veterans population as in Webster study. 2 Identify additional risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD that was not considered in the Webster study. Method:?? Bi-centre, retrospective case ? control analysis of preoperative and postoperative risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD over seven years (Jan 2000?Dec 2006). 103 patients with abdominal WD were compared to a randomly selected control group of 103 patients with midline laparotomies who were matched to year of operation. Patients were stratified according to the Webster WD risk scoring system and sensitivity and specificity analysis performed. Chi-square analysis was performed on risk factors that were not included in Webster WD Risk scoring model. Results:?? The overall WD rate is 2.8%. (103/3585 patients). Analysis of risk factors that were not considered by the Webster model within the WD group shows peritoneal sepsis (p = 0.04), prolonged ileus (p = 0.006) and current smoking status (p = 0.01) are significant factors associated with patients scoring highly for developing abdominal WD. Conclusions about the sensitivity and specificity of Webster WD risk scoring model can be drawn once control group data are collated. Conclusion:?? Webster WD risk scoring system appears to be a valid tool in identifying patients at high risk for WD. Peritoneal sepsis, prolonged ileus and smoking are associated with high risk of developing abdominal WD.

AB  - Purpose:?? Patients with Gallstone Pancreatitis (GP) have a high risk of choledocholithiasis. MRCP has been recommended by some as the investigation of choice to diagnose choledocholithiasis. This study examines the diagnostic value of selective MRCP in GP. Methodology:?? Retrospective audit of all presentations of GP between Jan 2001?December 2007 at Middlemore Hospital. Demographic data, clinical presentation, biochemical, radiological findings and outcomes were reviewed. Data were analysed using univariate analysis and chi-squared test. Results:?? There were 339 cases of gallstone pancreatitis with 243 females and a mean age of 52?years. Overall, 95 cases of choledocholithiasis- as confirmed by ERCP/ Intra-Operative Cholangiogram (IOC) ? were diagnosed. The indications for MRCP in this study were heterogeneous. 117 patients underwent MRCP within a median of 4?days of admission with 15 (13.7%) showing choledocholithiasis. There was no significant difference in time to MRCP between positive and negative groups. ERCP/IOC confirmed 13/15 stones within a median of 2.5?days. MRCPs, however, missed 8 cases of choledocholithiasis subsequently demonstrated on ERCP/IOC where clinical suspicion remained after a negative MRCP. MRCP sensitivity was 62.0, specificity 97.9. The Positive Likelihood Ratio was 6.5, Negative Likelihood Ratio was 0.1. PPV was 86.7, NPV was 92.0. 222 patients followed different clinical pathways with 82 Common Bile Duct (CBD) stones diagnosed by ERCP/IOC. Conclusion:?? Choledocholithiasis is common in GP. Selective MRCP is highly specific in GP but may not be sensitive enough to exclude choledocholithiasis in this context.

AB  - Purpose:?? To determine the outcome of patients who had ultrasound detected, but no evidence of clinical correlation. Methodology:?? In a single surgeon practice, all the patients referred by General Practitioners between Aug 2007 to June 2008 with an ultrasound suggesting inguinal hernia, but with no clinical correlation were included. All of them were managed non-surgically. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess the outcome in 16 out the 19 patients eligible for the study. Median follow-up was eight months. Results:?? Pain in the inguinal region was the predominant symptom at presentation. Seven patients had become pain free within two weeks of the initial consultation. The remaining 9 patients had residual pain; 5 patients noticed improvement, 1 patient felt no change and 2 patients had other diagnosis made for their symptoms. No patient chose to see another specialist or had an operation for the management of the initial presentation. Conclusion:?? Fourteen out of sixteen (87.5%) patients who had an ultrasound demonstrating the presence of an inguinal hernia, with no clinical correlation, had improvement or resolution of their pain. This study demonstrates the importance of non surgical management in patients with groin pain and ultrasound detected inguinal hernia but with no clinical correlation.

AB  - Introduction:?? Although modern surgery is often complex, adherence to simple but critical safety steps have been shown to markedly improve patient outcomes. Aim:?? To review and compare surgical practice at a tertiary surgical centre to recommendations from the WHO Safe Surgery Saves Lives Committee. Methodology:?? Retrospective analysis of all prospectively recorded surgical adverse events over an 18?month period (1st Jan 2007?30th June 2008). These events were compared to the WHO recommendations. Results:?? The tertiary centre practiced all but 3 of the WHO recommendations and 166 surgical adverse events and 23 process failures/near misses were identified. Rate of adverse events was better than the average reported in industrialised nations. Leading adverse events were infection and bleeding/haematoma. Seventeen percent of adverse events identified could have been modified had a ?sign-out? process been followed. Conclusion:?? Implementation of WHO recommendations has the potential to reduce surgical adverse events.

AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy has become the procedure of choice for acute appendicitis at our hospital. It provides ideal training in a variety of laparoscopic techniques. It is both safe for patients and good for the community by improving the skills of surgical trainees. Methods:?? We reviewed the prospective audit of one junior registrar's first 150 consecutive cases of laparoscopic appendicectomy, after supervision for the first five cases. Results:?? 150 patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy over a period of 27?months. Ages ranged from 14 to 72 with a mean of 28. A standard 3 port technique was used, utilizing mostly suture loops, or occasionally linear staplers to tackle the appendix base. Of 124 patients with confirmed appendicitis, 44 (35%) had perforated, possibly reflecting delay in access to operating theatre in a busy public hospital. Despite this, only two post operative abscesses occurred, and both resolved after percutaneous drains. Hospital stay ranged from 2?7?days (Mean 2, Median 3.5?days). Senior surgical assistance was required in only two patients, once for laparoscopic repair of a serosal tear, and once for conversion for an inflammatory mass subsequently shown to be a carcinoma. Analysis of the cohort in three groups of fifty: early, mid, and late in the series demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both operative time and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy is the ideal training operation. After some initial supervision the trainees can perform surgery unsupervised and gain experience in a wide variety of surgical techniques. Clinical acumen and operative times improve with experience.

AB  - Purpose:?? Mechanical Bowel Preparation (MBP) is often used by surgeons for patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colectomy (LC) due to the concern that small lesions normally palpable at open surgery may not be seen at the time of laparoscopic surgery. This study sought to determine whether preoperative marking of the colonic primary at the time of colonoscopy with Spot? could overcome this concern. Methodology:?? All patients suitable for a LC had Spot? marking performed at their colonoscopy. One millilitre of Spot? marking was injected submucosally in 3 positions around the circumference of the lumen at least 5?cm distal to the lesion. The first 100 LC performed by the surgeon for lesions were audited for the purpose of this study, and MBP was not used while all patients received preoperative immunonutrition. Results:?? Overall mortality was 0%. The anastomotic leak rate was 2% (1 reoperation, 1 low output fistula). Conversion rate was 23%. Spot? marking was successfully identified at laparoscopy in all 100 cases. No cases were converted as a result of failure to identify the marking, however 1 case required an extension in the final incision due to the fact the Spot? marking had been placed proximal to the lesion. Anastomoses were performed ?across? the Spot? marking on 3 occasions with no untoward effect. Conclusion:?? Spot? marking is a safe and effective way to mark lesions in the colon in order to facilitate LC without the need for MBP.

AB  - There is increasing use of CT in intestinal obstruction to delineate those patients requiring expeditious surgical intervention from those in whom conservative management is appropriate. We sought to assess the accuracy of CT in predicting those patients for whom conservative management would suffice. A mixed prospective-retrospective series had 75 patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a CT performed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if there was an immediate indication for surgery eg peritoneal irritation or shock. A positive diagnosis was defined as suitability for conservative management based on CT absence of an obstructing lesion and/or progression of contrast. A negative diagnosis was defined as a high-grade obstruction, signs of strangulation or a lesion requiring operation eg volvulus or tumour. Sixty-two cases (82.7%) had a history of abdominal surgery. Forty-one (54.7%) underwent operative intervention during their index admission. Diagnostic accuracy measures for CT in predicting successful conservative management were: sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 77.5%, positive predictive value 78% and negative predictive value 91.2%. In those with prior abdominal surgery, these results were 96.7%, 71.9%, 76.3% and 95.8% respectively. CT is highly effective in detecting bowel obstruction cases that do not require operation and also in predicting those cases that actually do. These measures are slightly improved when selecting patients with previous abdominal surgery. CT scanning may therefore be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm for acute bowel obstruction. Future studies may benefit from more standardised assessment criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - Purpose:?? ACPO often occurs in patients with serious comorbidities and can result in high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the current practice of treatment of pseudo obstruction in the era of neostigmine in a single metropolitan hospital. Method:?? A retrospective review of prospective hospital databases was undertaken to identify patients with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction and gather demographic information. Further information was retrieved from patient files. Results:?? 133 patients were identified with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction from June 1996 to December 2008. The median age was 68.5 (range 17?95). There were 80 (60%) males. Overall median length of stay was 37?days with a mortality rate of 9%. For conservative treatment or neostigmine (CN), endoscopic decompression (E), surgery (S) groups, the mortality rates were 9.5%, 8.6% and 6.2% respectively, p = 0.36. There were 94 patients in the CN group, 16 (12%) required surgery (S) and 23 (17%) had endoscopy (E), p = 0.36. The median time to diagnosis from admission was 10?days (CN), 0?days (E) and 7?days (S); p = 0.13. The most frequent mode of diagnosis was gastrograffin enema for CN (43), AXR for E (9) and CT abdomen for S (7). It was noted that 44 (33%) patients had unrelated surgery within the last 30?days prior to the current admission. Surgery for complications was required including 7 colectomies (44%) and 5 caecostomies (31%). Conclusion:?? Surgery remains crucial as a treatment modality for pseudo-obstruction in the era of neostigmine. The majority of operations performed at our institution for pseudo-obstruction were colectomies, which reflects a high rate of complications in our cohort of patients.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.

AB  - Background:?? The aim is to compare the outcomes of surgical management of large bowel emergencies. The traditional treatment of Hartmann's resection was compared to the new modalities of Colonic stenting for malignant obstruction and laparoscopic washout for perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. Methods:?? This paper is a retrospective review of 112 consecutive large bowel emergencies presenting to The Tweed Hospital and John Flynn Private Hospital warranting surgical intervention during the 8?year period 2000?2008. Patients with obstruction from cancer and perforation from diverticulitis were included. Patients with volvulus, pseudo-obstruction, bleeding, stercoral ulceration and prolapse were excluded. Patients with non urgent colonic stenting were also excluded. Results:?? The patient groups were comparable for age, ASA and pathology after exclusions. 57 patients underwent a Hartmann's (obstruction 23, perforation 34) vs. 55 patients undergoing stent for obstruction 21, or washout for perforation 34. Significant differences were observed in the mortality rates, Hartmann's 11/57 (19%) vs. stent and washout 2/55 (37%). Also length of stay: Hartmann's 15?days vs. stent and washout 6?days. Hartmann's was required to salvage 2 failed stents and 6 failed washouts. In 16 of 26 washouts and 11 of 17 stents patients underwent delayed elective resection. Conclusion:?? Patient selection, technical expertise and long learning curve were all aspects that influenced the early results of stenting and washout. Hartmann's is no longer the preferred treatment option for left sided colonic emergencies.

AB  - Introduction:?? The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for patients presenting with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) suggest patients should undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal tract examination in addition to coeliac serology. Studies suggest that in approximately 20% of patients no diagnosis is made. In these patients subsequent management and risk of underlying malignancy remains unclear. In our unit all patients initially negative following investigation undergo an abdominal CT scan. Aim To determine 1) cancer detection and overall disease detection rates for patients referred with IDA on the cancer pathway 2) Subsequent outcomes of patients with no diagnosis made after initial investigations. Methods:?? Patients referred between Jan 2002 ? Jan 2005 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to 1) diagnosis following initial investigations 2) addition diagnosis following abdominal CT 3) Eventual outcome 3?years following presentations. Results:?? 111 patients were reviewed. Following initial investigation 12 colorectal and 2 gastric cancers were identified. 63% of patients had a diagnosis following initial investigations. Three patients were diagnosed with underlying malignancy following abdominal CT. 38 patients had no diagnosis, non reattended over a 3?year period with significant pathology. Conclusion:?? BSG guideline investigations with addition abdominal CT is sufficient to detect disease in patients with IDA.
