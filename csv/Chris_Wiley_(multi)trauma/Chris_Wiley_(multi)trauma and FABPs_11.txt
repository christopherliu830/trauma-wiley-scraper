AB  - Abstract Terrorist attacks or nuclear accidents could expose large numbers of people to ionizing radiation, and early biomarkers of radiation injury would be critical for triage, treatment, and follow-up of such individuals. However, no such biomarkers have yet been proven to exist. We tested the potential of high throughput proteomics to identify protein biomarkers of radiation injury after total body X-ray irradiation (TBI) in a rat model. Subtle functional changes in the kidney are suggested by increased glomerular permeability for macromolecules measured within 24?h after TBI. Ultrastructural changes in glomerular podocytes included partial loss of the interdigitating organization of foot processes. Analysis of urine by LC-MS/MS and 2-DE showed significant changes in the urine proteome within 24?h after TBI. Tissue kallikrein 1-related peptidase, cysteine proteinase inhibitor cystatin C and oxidized histidine were found to be increased while a number of proteinase inhibitors including kallikrein-binding protein and albumin were found to be decreased postirradiation. Thus, TBI causes immediately detectable changes in renal structure and function and in the urinary protein profile. This suggests that both systemic and renal changes are induced by radiation and it may be possible to identify a set of biomarkers unique to radiation injury.

AB  - Abstract For several decades, there has been considerable interest in marine-derived long chain n-3 fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) due to their outstanding health benefits. n-3 LCPUFAs can be found in nature either in triglycerides (TAGs) or in phospholipid (PL) form. From brain health point of view, PL n-3 is more bioavailable and potent compared to n-3 in TAG form, as only PL n-3 is able to cross the blood?brain barrier and can be involved in brain biochemical reactions. However, PL n-3 has been ignored in the fish oil industry and frequently removed as an impurity during degumming processes. As a result, PL products derived from marine sources are very limited compared to TAG products. Commercially, PLs are being used in pharmaceutical industries as drug carriers, in food manufacturing as emulsifiers and in cosmetic industries as skin care agents, but most of the PLs used in these applications are produced from vegetable sources that contain less (without EPA, DPA, and DHA) or sometimes no n-3 LCPUFAs. This review provides a comprehensive account of the properties, structures, and major sources of marine PLs, and provides focussed discussion of their relationship to brain health. Epidemiological, laboratory, and clinical studies on n-3 LCPUFAs enriched PLs using different model systems in relation to brain and mental health that have been published over the past few years are discussed in detail.
