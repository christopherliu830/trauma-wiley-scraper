AB  - Summary This chapter begins with a discussion of pathophysiology and implications of broad classes of congenital cardiac defects, including mixing lesions, shunts, and outflow obstruction lesions. Next, airway and ventilation management is presented, focusing on cardiorespiratory interactions, and the influence of lung volumes, intrathoracic pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure on cardiac physiology. Then, alternative modes of ventilation, and weaning from ventilation are discussed. The next section of the chapter presents a discussion of myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic monitoring, with an emphasis on assessment of cardiac output, surgical factors, effects of bypass, dysrhythmias, low preload/high afterload, and decreased myocardial contractility. The latter part of the chapter starts with a presentation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, postoperative complications, quality improvement, and mechanical support of the circulation. Finally, reviews of hemostasis, infection control, neurological complications and monitoring, fluid management and renal dysfunction, and nutritional and gastrointestinal complications are presented.

AB  - Peptic ulcers (PU) are the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They result in significant costs both to the patient and the health care system. Despite a decrease in the prevalence of H. pylori infection, the incidence of bleeding PU has not reduced. Resuscitation of the patient with a bleeding PU remains the foundation of management. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has evolved from initially a diagnostic tool to now also being a therapeutic modality. The endoscopic stigmata of a visible vessel or active bleeding have been validated as indicators of a high risk of adverse outcomes. Multiple endoscopic techniques have been developed to treat bleeding PU with these stigmata. The most effective and commonly used are thermal contact therapy (heater probe or bipolar electrocoagulation) and endoscopic clipping. They are each used either as monotherapies or combined with adrenaline injection. These techniques have been shown to reduce the rates of rebleeding, surgery and mortality. Early studies showed no benefit from the use of H2-receptor antagonists in patients with bleeding PU. In contrast, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) given after endoscopic haemostatic therapy as a bolus and then a subsequent 72?hr infusion, have been shown to significantly reduce the rates of rebleeding,, surgery and mortality compared to placebo. In summary, endoscopic techniques combined with pharmacological treatment with PPIs significantly improve outcomes in patients with bleeding PU with high risk endoscopic stigmata. These methods are widely available and are essential in the optimal modern management of bleeding PU.

AB  - Purpose:?? Lesions of the submandibular gland represent a pleomorphically diverse group making benign and malignant lesions difficult to differentiate from each other. The current series aims to identify the roles of pre-operative cytology and imaging with subsequent histopathology in the management of these lesions. Methods:?? Between 1998 and 2008 fifty-four patients, of median age 54?years (range 25?94), were retrospectively identified. Fifty patients underwent fifty-two surgical procedures involving the submandibular gland. The utility of imaging and cytology was analysed, and the accuracy of cytology correlated with histopathology. Results:?? Pathologies of resected specimens included: sialadenitis; 17 (32%), pleomorphic adenoma; 9 (17%), calculi; 8 (15%), lymphoma; 5 (10%) squamous cell carcinoma; 2 (4%), adenoid cystic carcinoma; 1 (2%) and other; 10 (20%). Twenty-eight patients (52%) underwent fine needle aspiration cytology/core biopsies; of these 25 proceeded to surgery. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of fine needle aspiration cytology correlation with histology were 88.0%, 71.4%, and 94.4% respectively. Overall, the complication rate was 9.6%. Conclusion:?? This series demonstrates histological outcomes in patients specific to the submandibular salivary gland for which there are few comparative series in the literature. The trans-cervical surgical approach to submandibular gland pathology is a safe and effective method with minimal morbidity. Combining investigative modalities and cytology optimises the diagnosis and management of submandibular salivary gland lesions.

AB  - Introduction:?? Surgical teaching for clinical medical students is often undertaken across multiple clinical campuses. There are concerns heterogeneity of clinical experience may result in heterogeneity of learning outcome achievements. To avoid this, we have utilised standardised learning materials and tutorials across four hospital campuses. Methods:?? Using a feedback questionnaire, clinical experience from assigned hospitals was collected, including a question on influence of clinical experience on future career choice. This was analysed for inter-hospital differences. Clinical experience was also assessed by analysis of individual student portfolios. Students were administered a centralised standardised formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) during rotations. We analysed OSCE results from 2005 to 2008 for internal reliability and correlation with final written examination grades on a hospital-by-hospital basis. Results:?? Analysis of student feedback results and portfolios identified inter-hospital differences in clinical experience. Students indicated that clinical experiences had influence on decision to pursue future surgical careers. The OSCE had a good level of internal reliability (Cronbach's-alpha 0.62?0.75). No significant inter-hospital difference in OSCE results was found using one-way analysis of variance. OSCE results had strong correlations with final examination grades. Conclusions:?? Heterogeneity of clinical experience across different teaching settings does not translate into heterogeneity in achievement of learning outcomes when teaching materials are standardised. Consistent with previous published data, undergraduate clinical experience may influence future career choices.

AB  - Purpose:?? Stoma formation is a standard procedure in gastrointestinal surgery; however, the incidence seems to remain high. Here, we performed a prospective study on 137 patients with ileostomy or colostomy in order to identify potential risk factors. Methodology:?? 137 patients received stomas and were prospectively followed up four times after surgery. Early and late stoma complications, potential risk factors, and QOL were recorded using a modified SF-36 form. Results were subjected to statistical analysis and discussed with the view onto the current literature. Results:?? 72 patients received a colostomy and 65 patients an ileostomy. There was a complication rate of 55.5% (n = 76). 53 patients had early, 44 patients had late, and some had both early and late complications. Early complications occurred less than two months after surgery and included necrosis (16.1%), abscess (13.9%), and dehiscence (10.9%). Late complications included parastomal hernia (11.7%), chronic peristomal skin alteration (8.8%), stenosis (6.6%), prolaps (3.6%), and retraction 0.7%). 15 patients with late stoma complications needed surgery. High body mass index, emergency procedure, and omitted preoperative stoma marking were associated with significant higher risks for developing stoma complications. The availability of a stoma nurse greatly influenced outcome and QOL. Conclusion:?? Stoma complications are not rare and the surgeon should pay special attention to details of the technique. QOL of stoma patients is greatly influenced by specially trained stoma nurses. The identified risk factors have to be considered in order to reduce the incidence of stoma complications in the future.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery Programs (EPR) have been shown to reduce mortality, morbidity and length of stay. Can similar results be produced in tertiary centres with the presence of complex colorectal cases? Method:?? 102 patients were prospectively analysed with a power calculation of 34 being established prior to commencement of the study. The average age was 66.6 (male: female ratio of 1:1). Data collection included demographics, operative procedure, pain scores, POSSUM scores, American Society of Anaesthiology (ASA) scores, and discharge times. All complications were documented. Results:?? 83 cases were open procedures and 19 laparoscopically, (3 were converted intra-operatively). The majority were anterior resection (47, [46.1%]) and right hemicolectomies (32, [31.3%]). The average overall discharge time was 11.75?days compared to 15.11 (p < 0.001) prior to commencement of the study in 2005. Anterior resections and subtotal colectomies (14.3 and 13.7?days respectively) had significantly longer lengths of stay compared to right hemicolectomies (10.7?days) [p < 0.001]. 56% patients were ASA grade 3 & 4 (50% and 6% respectively). A clear correlation with increasing ASA and discharge time was demonstrated (ANOVA p = 0.0004) with significant exponential rise with ASA greater than 2. POSSUM scoring demonstrated a positive correlation with prolonged hospital stay with increasing scores having worse discharge time. Conclusion:?? In the presence of complex major surgery and tertiary centre referrals an ERP is feasible producing an average saving of 3.36?days. The benefit is however less with increasing ASA and POSSUM Scores. It however still produced an average economic bed stay saving cost of $3700 per patient stay.

AB  - Background:?? Colonoscopy is the gold standard for investigating pathology of the large bowel. Numerous factors influence the efficacy of bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel preparation can lead to missed pathology. Timing of preparation, timing of procedure and patient bowel habit may have an influence on the quality of the preparation. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of cleansing of sodium picosulphate with different administration schedules and to evaluate whether patient's prior bowel patterns influenced quality of cleansing. Methods:?? 325 patients were interviewed prior to colonoscopy to evaluate prior bowel habit and timing of preparation administration. The quality of preparation was then assessed during colonoscopy. Further patient factors evaluated included patient tolerance, compliance and adverse reactions to preparation. Procedural factors evaluated included quality of cleansing and circular muscle hypertrophy. Procedure total time, caecal intubation time and withdrawal times were also recorded. A 5-point scale was used to assess quality of cleansing. Results:?? The quality of cleansing for individual bowel segments was worse for afternoon procedures (p < 0.05 for all segments), and for patients with prior constipation (p < 0.05 for transverse and descending segments). No correlation was found between the quality indicators (total duration, caecal intubation time, withdrawal times), colon length, circular muscle hypertrophy or presence of diverticula for cleansing quality. Conclusion:?? The quality of cleansing is significantly improved when bowel preparation is taken the day prior to colonoscopy. In addition patients with prior constipation demonstrated poorer cleansing.

AB  - Purpose:?? Burnout is the state of prolonged physical, emotional, and psychological exhaustion characteristic of individuals working in human service occupations. This study examines the prevalence of burnout among Younger Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), and its relationship to demographic variables. Methodology:?? In March 2008, a survey was sent via email to 1,287 Younger Fellows. This included demographic questions, a measure of burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and an estimate of social desirability (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale ? Form C). Results:?? The sample comprised 278 participants ? an overall response rate of 21.6%. Females exhibited higher levels of personal burnout and work-related burnout, but no significant difference in patient-related burnout. Younger Fellows in hospitals with less than 50 beds reported significantly higher patient-related burnout levels. An equal work division between public and private practice resulted in higher work-related burnout than concentration of work in one sector. Younger Fellows working more than 60?hours per week reported significantly higher personal burnout than those who worked less than this. There was no significant correlation between age, country of practice, surgical specialty and any of the burnout subscales. Conclusion:?? Female surgeons, surgeons that work in smaller hospitals, those that work more than 60?hours per week, and those with practice division between the private and public sectors, are at a particularly high risk of burnout. Further enquiry into potentially remediable causes for the increased burnout in these groups is indicated.

AB  - Purpose:?? Early identification of the disease severity in acute pancreatitis and focused management based on Ranson's criteria has shown to improved patients? outcomes in many trials. We introduced Ranson's criteria at Ipswich Hospital in 2007 and compared the patients? outcome using historical controls. Methodology:?? A retrospective chart analysis was undertaken on patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at Ipswich Hospital between 2006 and 2007. Ranson's criteria and treatment protocols were introduced in January 2007 and data was collected prospectively. Data was assessed for the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, transfers to tertiary centres, morbidity and mortality. Results:?? 33 patients were admitted with acute pancreatitis in 2006 compared to 76 patients in 2007. Ranson's criteria were not formally assessed in any patient prior to 2007. However, 88% of patients had Ranson's criteria scored with strict adherence to the treatment protocol since 2007. 13 patients were scored as severe (greater than 3) in 2007 compared to none in 2006. 6% of patients developed pneumonia compared to 14% in 2007. Length of stay was 5.5?days in 2007 versus 4.87?days in 2006. Five ICU admissions and 4 transfers to tertiary centres occurred in 2007 compared to one transfer with no ICU admissions in 2006. There was no mortality in 2006 compared to 2% in 2007. Conclusion:?? Use of Ranson's criteria enables us to tailor our treatment of acute pancreatitis. It is a clinically useful tool and strict adherence leads to quick severity stratification, improved management and better use of health care resources.

AB  - Purpose:?? Providing enteral supplements containing ?immunonutrition? has been proposed to decrease postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay for elective surgical patients. This meta-analysis was undertaken to elucidate the potential benefit of providing immune-enhanced nutrition in surgical patients. Methodology:?? A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing the use of perioperative immunonutrition with standard nutrition provision in elective adult surgical patients between 1990 and 2008. The variables analysed included mortality, total complications, infective complications, anastomotic leak and length of hospital stay. Results:?? 21 distinct studies were identified that met inclusion criteria involving 2135 patients (immunonutrition n = 1100; standard nutrition n = 935). The provision of immunonutrition was shown to be associated with significant reductions in the incidence of total postoperative complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69, p < 0.0001), postoperative infective complications (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37, 0.60, p < 0.0001), anastomotic breakdown (OR 0.43, 95% 0.25, 0.75, p = 0.003), and the duration of hospital stay (WMD ?2.95, 95% CI ?4.01, ?1.88, p < 0.0001) when compared to standard nutritional provision. No differences were seen between interventions with relation to mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41, 1.97. p = 0.8). Conclusion:?? Provision of immunonutrition in preference to standard nutrition was associated with clinically significant decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in the development of postoperative complications including those of infective origin and anastomotic breakdown but has no impact on mortality.

We present the clinical scenario and review of the literature. Methods:?? A plexiform neurofibroma presenting as a presacral mass is described, with the difficulties in diagnosis and investigation explored. Results:?? CT and MRI are useful imaging modalities in the diagnosis of an undifferentiated presacral mass and certainly contribute to eliminating some differential diagnoses and exploring characteristics of the lesion, but ultimately the need for a histological diagnosis and surgical excision is highlighted. Conclusion:?? Presacral masses are difficult to diagnose, assess and treat. Adequate imaging and histological confirmation are essential in their treatment.

AB  - Introduction:?? Lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (LGIH) is a major health burden. Although for the majority no intervention is required, where conservative management fails, radiological intervention is required to either localise or embolise the bleeding vessels. In recent years CT angiography (CTA) has increasingly been used for localisation. This study assesses the utilisation of this investigation in patients with acute LGIH. Methods:?? A review of all patients admitted to the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle with acute LGIH was performed and patients undergoing CTA selected. The utility and safety of CTA was assessed as well as a comparison made between positive and negative tests. Results:?? Between January 2005 and August 2008 there were 334 emergency admissions with LGIH of which 79 patients underwent CTA. In 30 (38%) patients, CTA localised an active bleeding site. Of the remaining 49 CTA, other pathology was identified in 8 (10%). Overall mortality was 5% and intervention rate was 9% (4 segmental colectomy and 3 selective angiography). There was no difference in rate of intervention or mortality between the CTA positive and negative groups. Transfusion requirement (4.28 vs. 2.34 units, p < 0.05) and haemodynamic instability at the time of CTA were higher in the positive CTA group. Conclusion:?? LGIH will resolve without intervention in the majority. CTA is safe and a positive test is not indicative of a higher intervention rate but provides a management strategy. We suggest it be performed on patients receiving more than 2 units of packed cells or those with haemodynamic instability.

AB  - Background:?? Biologically active factors produced by the intestine and transported by the protein fraction of mesenteric lymph are thought to contribute significantly to the development of distant organ failure in haemorrhagic shock. Despite the likely relevance of the protein composition of mesenteric lymph conditioned by haemorrhagic shock, there is no detailed description of its proteome. The aim of this study was to provide the first comprehensive description of the proteome of haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph. Methods:?? 20 male Wistar rats were randomized to either control or haemorrhagic shock group. Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 30?mmHg in the shock group for 90 minutes followed by resuscitation and mesenteric lymph collection for another 90 minutes. Proteomic changes in mesenteric lymph due to haemorrhagic shock were identified using LC-MS/MS. Results:?? 245 proteins were identified in mesenteric lymph, including 35 hypothetical proteins. 60 of the 245 proteins had a significant increase in their relative abundance in the haemorrhagic shock group vs. sham group. Potentially toxic pancreatic enzymes had increased abundance in post-shock mesenteric lymph. In addition, a bioinformatics approach allowed for the identification of key pathways relating to defence and metabolic responses. A number of potentially important proteins were also identified as targets for future research in hemorrhagic shock: peroxiredoxins, 14-3-3 zeta/epsilon, calmodulin, cofilin, and profilin. Conclusions:?? This study not only provides the first comprehensive list of protein changes in the haemorrhagic shock conditioned mesenteric lymph, but also provides rational for future research.

AB  - Purpose:?? Anaesthesia delivery for colonoscopy within HNEAHS is either by an Anaesthetic driven propofol or an Endoscopist supplied sedation service (usually midazolam and fentanyl). The aim of this project is to compare patient satisfaction with respect to these two different modalities of anaesthetic delivery. Methodology:?? All patients undergoing colonoscopy between 1/9/2008 and 30/12/2008 in two endoscopy units (that utilised different sedation services) were surveyed with respect to their pain, recall and satisfaction regarding their anaesthetic delivery. Results:?? 263 out of a potential 735 patients consented prospectively to participation in the survey. Patients undergoing Anaesthetic driven propofol experienced less pain during colonoscopy than those who had Endoscopist supplied sedation (VAS 0.05/10 vs. 1.34/10, p < 0.0001). There was also significantly less recall during the procedure with propofol, and a significantly higher rate of satisfaction with the anaesthetic driven propofol service. There was no difference with respect to recall of events or pain following the procedure. Most importantly a higher proportion of patients who had Anaesthetic driven propofol would either be willing to undergo the procedure again when compared with patients having Endoscopist supplied sedation (99% vs. 95%, p < 0.05), or recommend it to others (100% vs. 92%, p < 0.005). Conclusion:?? An Anaesthetic driven propofol service for colonoscopy provides superior patient satisfaction when compared to Endoscopist supplied sedation.

AB  - Purpose:?? The Apgar score for neonates is well established. Gawande et al (1) recently reported a validated Apgar score for surgery derived for intraoperative parameters (blood loss, lowest heart rate, lowest mean arterial pressure). They studied elective general and vascular surgical patients and demonstrated predictive capability in terms of major complications and death within 30?days. The aim of our study was to determine if the Apgar surgical score was valid and useful in an Australian hospital setting. Methods:?? Elective and emergency surgical procedures over a 31-day period were prospectively studied. The anaesthetic and surgical teams were not aware of the Apgar score. The postoperative course of each patient was reviewed. Primary outcome measures were death or major complications; secondary measures were ICU admission and inpatient length of stay. Results:?? 790 patients were studied and the Apgar score calculated. No correlation was found between Apgar score and complications or death within 30?days. Only 20 (2.5%) had a score of less than 4, and in this group there was 1 death and 6 patients with complications. There were no unplanned ICU admissions. Inpatient length of stay was not shown to be significantly longer in those with lower scores. The Apgar score did not correlate with ASA status. Patients undergoing Caesarean section tended to have poor Apgar scores but excellent outcomes. Conclusion:?? Using the surgical Apgar would not have altered the management of any patient in the study e.g., planning ICU admission etc. and therefore we are unable to recommend its introduction as a routine measure.

AB  - Purpose:?? A sentinel case of missed rectal malignancy resulting in a poor outcome for a patient prompted a search for a process that ensures adequate follow up of all significant histopathology results. This paper aims to quantify the problem of inadequate histopathology follow up and develop an electronic tool and review process to ensure the patient's results are acted upon appropriately. Methodology:?? A Histopathology audit was undertaken at the Geelong Hospital between 2002 and 2006. Patients where inadequate follow up had occurred were identified. The situation for these patients was rectified and the risk quantified. An integrated electronic tool was then developed including a minimum data set. A review process was then tested to ensure adequacy of future follow up. Results:?? 6.3% (120/1912) of histopathology results in a 5?year period had been inadequately followed up. No further adverse outcomes were identified but each case was a potential time bomb for the patients who were not scheduled for clinical review (3.8%) or a recommended procedure (2.5%). A process of follow up has now been implemented and a minimum data set, procedure and electronic audit tool developed to assist with this process. Conclusion:?? Failure of adequate follow up of histopathology is a potential pitfall in any large health system. One such failure led to a disastrous outcome and a comprehensive audit suggested 6.3% of patients in the last 5?years were also at risk. We have established a review process we believe is reliable and developed an electronic tool to facilitate this process.
