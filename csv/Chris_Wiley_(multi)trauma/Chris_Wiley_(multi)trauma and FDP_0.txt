AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Background Prehospital management of the traumatically injured patient has evolved significantly since the organization of emergency medical services across the United States in the 1970s. Initially focusing on the utilization of crystalloid solutions to restore shed blood volume, robust military and civilian trauma experiences led to a modern day shift towards balanced blood component and ultimately whole blood use for immediate volume replacement. In addition, prehospital transfusion or remote damage control resuscitation (RDRC) has been widely adopted. This has led to point of injury resuscitation using blood products both in the United States and abroad. Objectives This article will review the evolution of civilian and military prehospital resuscitation as well as the current practice of prehospital whole blood transfusion in the civilian trauma population in the United States. Additionally, we will provide an overview of our regional trauma system's use of whole blood with focus on the programme infrastructure, donor programme, product rotation schedule and logistical challenges. Finally, we provide three case report examples of the effective use of whole blood in our civilian emergency medical services (EMS) programs.

AB  - Abstract The purposes of our study were to correlate ultrasonographically measured and joint angle estimated excursions of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons of the hand and to estimate the relative motion of FDS and FDP while gripping cylinders of standard diameter in normal human subjects. Thirty wrists from 15 human subjects were imaged with an ultrasound scanner. Speckle tracking was used to measure the excursion of the FDS and FDP tendons. The tendon excursions necessary to grip three differently sized acrylic tubes were measured and correlated with the corresponding finger joint angles. The FDP/FDS excursion ratio was calculated. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the FDS excursion and MP?+?PIP joint angle was 0.61. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the FDP?+?FDS excursion and the DIP?+?PIP?+?MP joint angle was 0.67. The FDP/FDS excursion ratio was smaller for larger excursions (gripping a smaller diameter tube) and larger for small excursions (gripping a larger diameter tube, P?<?0.01). These data suggest that speckle tracking may be a useful method to discriminate the relative motion of flexor tendons, which in turn may be relevant in evaluating tendon function, for example after tendon injury. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:?Although there are two major scoring systems for the clinical diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the validity of these systems for leukemia-associated DIC remains to be confirmed. Methods:?By analyzing 125 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients, we investigated clinical and laboratory features of leukemia-associated DIC, and determined the validity of the two established criteria. Results:?A total of 36 patients (29%) were diagnosed with DIC according to expert opinion, a method regarded as the de facto gold standard. Leukemia-associated DIC is characterized by rare manifestation of organ failure because of thrombosis and no relevance of the platelet count for the diagnosis. The results of receiver operating characteristics analysis favored fibrin degradation product (FDP) rather than D-dimer as the fibrin-related marker test. Although prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen, and serum FDP levels were significantly different for patients with and without DIC, multivariate analysis identified FDP levels to be the only factor associated with DIC diagnosis. The cut-off level of 15??g/mL for FDP was found to be the most effective to differentiate DIC from non-DIC, resulting in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. The diagnostic results for our patients produced with this FDP-based system were at least comparable with or superior to those obtained with the two currently available scoring systems. Conclusions:?Our findings suggest that an FDP-based criterion may be applicable for the diagnosis of leukemia-associated DIC. Although it appears to be simple and practicable enough for clinical use, prospective validation of this criterion is needed.

AB  - Abstract??? Objectives:? This paper assesses the effect of fear on a number of dental utilization behaviors and oral heath outcome in a sample of adult Floridians. Methods:? A telephone survey was conducted in 2004 among 504 adult Floridians. Data collected included sociodemographic factors, specific fear of dental pain (FDP), global FDP, global dental fear, three measures of dental utilization behaviors, and one measure of oral health outcome. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted to quantify the individual and multivariate associations between fear factors and four behavior and outcome measures. Results:? Global FDP was significantly associated with putting off making a dental appointment and approach to dental treatment. Global dental fear showed an independent negative impact on all four behavior and outcome measures; reports regarding specific fear of painful dental events were not significantly associated with four behavior and outcome measures. Conclusions:? Our findings suggest that: (i) dental fear and FDP have independent negative effects on dental utilization behaviors and oral health outcome after controlling for other sociodemographic and general health factors; and (ii) global dental fear encompasses broader components than FDP.

AB  - Aim Blunt injuries to visceral organs have the potential to lead to delayed pseudoaneurysm formation or organ rupture, but current trauma and surgical guidelines do not recommend repetitive imaging. This study examined the incidence and timing of delayed undesirable events and established advisable timing for follow-up imaging and appropriate observational admission. Methods Patients with blunt splenic (S), liver (L), or kidney (K) injury treated with non-operative management (NOM) in our institution were included and retrospectively reviewed. Results From January 2013 to January 2017, 57 patients were admitted with documented blunt visceral organ injuries and 22 patients were excluded. Of 35 patients (L, 10; S, 17; K, 6; L  S  S, 9; K, 1) patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization. Delayed undesirable events occurred in four patients: three patients with splenic pseudoaneurysm on hospital day 6?7 and one patient with splenic delayed rupture on hospital day 7. The second follow-up computed tomography scan carried out 1?2 days after admission did not show any significant findings that could help predict undesirable results of delayed events. The patients with delayed events had longer continuous abdominal pain than that of event-free patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions Undesirable delayed events were recognized on follow-up computed tomography scans in 11.4% of NOM patients at hospital day 6?7 and tended to be associated with high-grade splenic injuries and continuous symptoms. Repetitive screening of these patients 6?7 days after injury might be warranted because of the potential risk of delayed events.

AB  - The use of fresh platelets has gained value in medicine as an essential part of wound treatments. This is not surprising since platelets contain a number of bioactive factors that contribute to the process of wound healing, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF). Fresh platelets? short shelf life limits platelet-based therapies. If platelets can be stabilized in freeze-dried form (FDP) then long-term storage as well as pathogen inactivation methods become possible. Adlyfe and Oregon Freeze-Dry have been developing technology to stabilize freeze-dried human platelets that can be subjected to gamma irradiation and stored for a long duration. Upon reconstitution, irradiated FDP retained growth factors PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-B1 in quantities similar to fresh platelets as judged by capture ELISA. The rehydrated FDP promoted new DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation of primary human dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs) similar to fresh platelets. The FDP also promoted remodeling of extracellular matrix by accelerating fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels and stimulated HUVECs to undergo angiogenesis and form capillary structures in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that FDP and fresh platelets have comparable in vitro wound healing potential. Preclinical wound healing stud'ies in diabetic mice are under way and further development will allow FDP to be a safe and well-suited alternative to fresh platelets for wound healing applications.

AB  - The Quebec platelet disorder is a serious bleeding disorder associated with proteolysis of α-granular proteins, including fibrinogen. We evaluated fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) assays as screening tests for this disorder. Patients with the Quebec platelet disorder (13/13) had elevated serum FDPs (P?<0.01) due to secreted degraded platelet fibrinogen, but normal plasma FDPs and D-dimers. Unrelated controls with bleeding disorders (32/34) had undetectable FDPs, and controls with FDPs due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and other illnesses (11/11) had elevated FDPs in all assays (P?<?0.01). Immunoblot analyses indicated plasma fibrinogen was normal in the Quebec patients and platelet FDPs were found in their platelet lysates, releasates and serum samples. Their platelet FDPs were not altered by treatment with fibrinolytic inhibitors and were different from the FDPs in DIC and in plasmin-digested fibrinogen. Tests for serum FDPs may provide a simple rapid way to screen for the Quebec platelet disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND Implications from the pragmatic, randomize, optimal platelet and plasma ratios (PROPPR) trial are critical for remote damage control resuscitation (DCR). Utilizing DCR principals in remote settings can combat early mortality from hemorrhage. Identifying the appropriate transfusion strategy is mandatory prior to adopting prehospital hemostatic resuscitation strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The PROPPR study was examined in relation to the following questions: 1) Why is it important to have blood products in the prehospital setting?; 2) Which products should be investigated for prehospital hemostatic resuscitation?; 3) What is the appropriate ratio of blood product transfusion?; and 4) What are the appropriate indications for hemostatic resuscitation? RESULTS PROPPR demonstrates that early and balanced blood product transfusion ratios reduced mortality in all patients at 3 hours and death from exsanguination at 24 hours (p?=?0.03). The median time to death from exsanguination was 2.3 hours, highlighting the need for point-of-injury DCR capabilities. A 1:1:1 transfusion ratio of plasma:platelets:packed red blood cells increased the percentage of patients achieving anatomic hemostasis (p?=?0.006). PROPPR used the assessment of blood consumption score to identify patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. The critical administration threshold predicted patient mortality and identified patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. CONCLUSION A balanced resuscitation strategy demonstrates an early survival benefit, decreased death from exsanguination at 24 hours and a greater likelihood of achieving hemostasis in critically injured patients receiving a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma:platelets:PRBCs. This finding highlights the need to import DCR principals to remote locations.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This retrospective study assessed radiographic bone changes and prevalence of inflammation around teeth and neighbouring implants supporting a single-unit fixed dental prosthesis (FDP), in relation to implant- positioning and characteristics. Material and Methods Patients with an implant-supported FDP in function for at least 1 year were recruited. The radiographic horizontal and vertical position of the implants were identified. Probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and radiographic bone level around implants and adjacent teeth at the time of placement, prosthesis delivery, and the most recent review were assessed. Results 98 patients with 195 implants were evaluated for a mean of 37.8 months. Survival rate was 99.6% and success ranged from 31.3% to 91.3% when different success criteria were utilized. Significantly greater interproximal bone loss around teeth and higher prevalence of interproximal peri-implant inflammation occurred when the horizontal distance of BL implants was <1 mm, but not with TL implants. There was no significant impact of the corono-apical positioning of the implants on marginal bone loss. Conclusion Proximity of implants to adjacent teeth of <1 mm leads to increased prevalence of inflammation and interproximal bone resorption at the teeth adjacent to bone level implants.

AB  - Summary Development of milling machines that could mill both complex external and internal geometries has broadened the scope of CAD/CAM technology from simple inlays/onlays to the entire realm of fixed prosthodontics. Materials available for the fabrication of fixed restorations can be categorized in several different ways: by strength, composition, purpose, and fabrication method. The types of hard milled materials consist of composites, composite/ceramic hybrids, and some ceramics. The highest-strength materials are now suitable for high-stress applications, including fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). However, they are relatively new and still lack the support of long-term clinical experience and research. The beauty of technology incorporation for fixed prosthodontics is that the practitioner does not necessarily have to move to an entirely CAD/CAM workflow. Options exist to utilize digital technology for some aspects of patient treatment and conventional materials and methods for others.

AB  - Background Apixaban and rivaroxaban are approved for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and embolic stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The aim of this study was to find appropriate methods of monitoring the anticoagulant effects of are direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and establish on-therapy ranges using conventional tests. Methods A total of 184 samples were collected from 91 patients receiving DOACs. Concentrations of apixaban and rivaroxaban in plasma were accessed by an anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay. PT, APTT, antithrombin, D-dimer, dRVVT screen/confirm, FDP, and fibrinogen levels were measured. On-therapy ranges were calculated by substituting previously reported trough plasma concentrations of DOACs. Results Anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay-based DOACs levels were 26.0-279.5 (115.9 ± 56.5) ng/mL for apixaban at 2.5 mg BID, 19.9-565.1 (205.3 ± 162.4) ng/mL for apixaban at 5 mg BID, 2.3-395.3 (205.3 ± 162.4) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 15 mg OD, 3.6-494.8 (119.6 ± 95.1) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 20 mg OD, and 9.6-431.4 (140.8 ± 113.6) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 15 mg BID. PT (%), antithrombin, and dRVVT confirm tests showed good correlation with plasma apixaban levels. Plasma rivaroxaban concentrations were correlated well with PT (sec), PT (%),and dRVVT confirm results. On-therapy ranges established for dRVVT confirm test by linear regression were as follows: 1.32-1.52 for apixaban 2.5 mg BID, 1.12-1.75 for apixaban 5 mg BID, 1.11-1.78 for rivaroxaban 15 mg OD, 1.09-1.64 for rivaroxaban 20 mg OD, and 1.22-1.81 for rivaroxaban 20 mg BID. Conclusions Apixaban concentrations were well correlated with PT (%), antithrombin, and dRVVT confirm test. Rivaroxaban concentrations showed good correlation with PT (sec), PT (%), and dRVVT confirm test.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a dynamic pathological process where excess amounts of thrombin, the principal role player in the clotting pathway, are generated intravascularly. The diagnosis of DIC is very often suspected in critically ill patients although the clinical features can vary according to the underlying disease state initiating this process. A combination of tests performed in repeats is necessary to reliably diagnose DIC. The principal aim in the management of this condition involves timely and appropriate treatment of the triggering process with adequate transfusion support and certain therapeutic agents in selected situations.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To collate and describe emergency admissions to a large animal tertiary university referral hospital during a 12-month period. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Large animal tertiary university referral hospital. Animals: Large animal emergency patient admissions. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Information obtained from the medical record included the presenting complaint, clinical problem, admission time, duration of clinical signs before presentation, diagnostic procedures performed, therapies administered, and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission, and survival to discharge. The most common category listed for the presenting complaint and clinical problem categories was gastrointestinal. Most emergency cases were admitted during the evening and in late spring, summer, and early fall. Most cases had a duration of clinical signs before presentation of >2 hours and ≤8 hours (27%) or >8 hours and ≤24 hours (29%). The most common diagnostic procedures performed during the first 24 hours were palpation per rectum, ultrasonographic examination, radiographs, and abdominocentesis. Antimicrobials, fluids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common therapies administered. Approximately 25% of cases required surgery. An exploratory celiotomy was performed in approximately 15% of cases. Enterotomy, intestinal resection and anastomosis, cesarean section, or joint or sheath lavage was each performed in <5% of cases. Overall survival to discharge was 74%. Conclusions: Large animal emergency clinicians are required to have knowledge on a wide range of diseases and should be proficient at performing numerous procedures on an emergency basis. Gastrointestinal disease is the most common type of emergency and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission are a reflection of this type of case. Only 25% of cases required surgery. Additional research in the form of a multicenter study and surveying both private and university practitioners needs to be performed to further define the necessary skills for an ?ideal? large animal emergency clinician.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - Background Ultrasound guidance is now a standard nerve localization technique for peripheral nerve block (PNB). Ultrasonography allows simultaneous visualization of the target nerve, needle, local anesthetic injectate, and surrounding anatomical structures. Accurate deposition of local anesthetic next to the nerve is essential to the success of the nerve block procedure. Due to limitations in the visibility of both needle tip and nerve surface, the precise relationship between needle tip and target nerve is unknown at the moment of injection. Importantly, nerve injury may result both from an inappropriately placed needle tip and inappropriately placed local anesthetic. The relationship between the block needle tip and target nerve is of paramount importance to the safe conduct of peripheral nerve block. Methods This review summarizes the evolution of nerve localization in regional anesthesia, characterizes a problem faced by clinicians in performing ultrasound-guided nerve block, and explores the potential technological solutions to this problem. Results To date, technology newly applied to PNB includes real-time 3D imaging, multi-planar magnetic needle guidance, and inline injection pressure monitoring. This review postulates that optical reflectance spectroscopy and bioimpedance may allow for accurate identification of the relationship between needle tip and target nerve, currently a high priority deficit in PNB techniques. Conclusions Until it is known how best to define the relationship between needle and nerve at the moment of injection, some common sense principles are suggested.
