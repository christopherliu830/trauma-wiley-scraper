AB  - Abstract The versatile electrospinning technique is recognized as an efficient strategy to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients and has gained tremendous progress in drug delivery, tissue engineering, cancer therapy, and disease diagnosis. Numerous drug delivery systems fabricated through electrospinning regarding the carrier compositions, drug incorporation techniques, release kinetics, and the subsequent therapeutic efficacy are presented herein. Targeting for distinct applications, the composition of drug carriers vary from natural/synthetic polymers/blends, inorganic materials, and even hybrids. Various drug incorporation approaches through electrospinning are thoroughly discussed with respect to the principles, benefits, and limitations. To meet the various requirements in actual sophisticated in vivo environments and to overcome the limitations of a single carrier system, feasible combinations of multiple drug-inclusion processes via electrospinning could be employed to achieve programmed, multi-staged, or stimuli-triggered release of multiple drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of the designed electrospun drug-eluting systems is further verified in multiple biomedical applications and is comprehensively overviewed, demonstrating promising potential to address a variety of clinical challenges.

AB  - Abstract Background This article aims to review key issues that criminological psychologists should address in the twenty-first century, especially in relation to why people become offenders, why people commit offences, and the link between explanation and the prevention and reduction of offending. Conclusions It is important to explain between-individual differences in the development of criminal potential and within-individual differences in the commission of crimes. More research is needed on protective factors, on investigating which risk factors are causes, and on causal mechanisms linking risk factors and offending. Questions about situational influences on offending should be included in longitudinal studies of the development of offenders. Comprehensive theories of offending need to be developed and tested. More longitudinal and experimental studies need to be carried out by criminological psychologists. Copyright ? 2004 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the electrocardiographic characteristics of ventricular tachycardia arising from the right ventricular outflow tract and the particular association between this arrhythmia and the presence of localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in English bulldogs. Methods: Five English bulldogs were referred with a history of syncope or cardiogenic shock. In all dogs, 12-lead surface ECG, thoracic radiograph and echocardiography were collected. In all but one dog 24-hours Holter monitoring and signal-averaged ECGs was examined and in one dog electrophysiological study and radiofrequency catheter ablation of the VT substrate was performed. Results: Documented arrhythmias included a single sustained monomorphic wide QRS tachycardia in four dogs, and an alternans of two different monomorphic forms in one dog. Mean QRS duration during tachy-cardia was 91·6 ±9·83 milliseconds. QRS complexes manifested a left bundle branch block morphology and an inferior axis (81 ±13·73°). R wave notching was present in the caudal (inferior) leads in three tachy-cardias. Lead I was negative in 3 of 6, positive in 1 of 6 and isodiphasic in 2 of 6. Lead aVL was negative in 5 of 6 and positive in 1 of 6. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms revealed late potentials in three dogs. Echocardiography showed a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in all dogs. Cardiac map-ping established two sites of origin of ventricular tachycardia within the right ventricular outflow tract in one dog: caudal free-wall and cranial-septal. Clinical Significance: The presence of a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement and ventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block morphology could suggest segmental arrhythmogenic right ven-tricular cardiomyopathy in the English bulldog.

AB  - ABSTRACT The ability to treat large tissue defects with customized, patient-specific scaffolds is one of the most exciting applications in the tissue engineering field. While an increasing number of modestly sized tissue engineering solutions are making the transition to clinical use, successfully scaling up to large scaffolds with customized geometry is proving to be a considerable challenge. Managing often conflicting requirements of cell placement, structural integrity, and a hydrodynamic environment supportive of cell culture throughout the entire thickness of the scaffold has driven the continued development of many techniques used in the production, culturing, and characterization of these scaffolds. This review explores a range of technologies and methods relevant to the design and manufacture of large, anatomically accurate tissue-engineered scaffolds with a focus on the interaction of manufactured scaffolds with the dynamic tissue culture fluid environment.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes minimally invasive treatments for thrombosis including a multimodality approach centered on interventional radiology, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs target the clot directly by accelerating fibrinolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, and urokinase have been administered intravenously in cats and dogs with thrombosis with variable success. The chapter also talks about clinical signs, diagnostics, intervention, and long-term therapy of central venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, ischemia?reperfusion injury, and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in dogs and cats. Treatment of venous thrombi must be based upon consideration of the overall clot burden and extent, the resulting clinical signs associated with the venous obstruction, and the ability to control the underlying cause of the clot if it is identified. Echocardiography is an easily accessible modality useful in confirming a thrombus in the proximal pulmonary artery. Angiography, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are also useful modalities in confirming and locating the PTE.

AB  - Summary The components and reactions of the fibrinolysis system are well understood. The pathway has fewer reactants and interactions than coagulation, but the generation of a complete quantitative model is complicated by the need to work at the solid-liquid interface of fibrin. Diagnostic tools to detect disease states due to malfunctions in the fibrinolysis pathway are also not so well developed as is the case with coagulation. However, there are clearly a number of inherited or acquired pathologies where hyperfibrinolysis is a serious, potentially life-threatening problem and a number of antifibrinolytc drugs are available to treat hyperfibrinolysis. These topics will be covered in the following review.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To test whether or not transmucosal healing at two-piece implants is as successful as submerged placement regarding crestal bone levels and patient satisfaction. Material and methods: Adults requiring implants in the anterior maxilla or mandible in regions 21?25, 11?15, 31?35 or 41?45 (WHO) were recruited for this randomized, controlled multi-center clinical trial of a 5-year duration. Randomization was performed at implantation allowing for either submerged or transmucosal healing. Final reconstructions were seated 6 months after implantation. Radiographic interproximal crestal bone levels and peri-implant soft tissue parameters were measured at implant placement (IP) (baseline), 6 and 12 months. Patient satisfaction was assessed by a questionnaire. A two-sided t-test (80% power, significance level α=0.05) was performed on bone-level changes at 6 and 12 months. Results: One hundred and twenty-seven subjects were included in the 12-month analysis (submerged [S]: 52.5%, transmucosal [TM]: 47.2%). From IP to 6 months, the change in the crestal bone level was ?0.32?mm (P<0.001) for the S group and ?0.29?mm (P<0.001) for the TM group. From IP to 12 months, bone-level changes were statistically significant in both groups (S ?0.47 mm, P<0.001; TM ?0.48?mm, P<0.001). The mean differences of change in the bone levels between the two groups were not statistically significant at either time point, indicating the equivalence of both procedures. For both groups, very good results were obtained for soft tissue parameters and for patient satisfaction. Conclusions: Transmucosal healing of two-piece implants is as successful as the submerged healing mode with respect to tissue integration and patient satisfaction within the first 12 months after IP.

AB  - A seven-year-old, neutered male greyhound was presented with a history of episodic shifting hindlimb lameness and pain. Ischaemic necrosis of areas of the hindlimb digits and skin and a firm swelling within the medial right thigh musculature were found on physical examination. Investigation demonstrated thrombosis of the terminal aorta and right external iliac artery with ischaemic necrosis of muscular and dermal tissue distal to the sites of thrombosis. The dog was euthanased due to poor prognosis. Necropsy findings were of a poorly differentiated invasive sarcoma of the skeletal muscle of the proximal right hindlimb, thrombosis of the aorta and right external iliac artery and secondary renal glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemistry of the neoplastic tissue indicated angiosarcoma based on expression of CD31 and factor VIII-related antigen. Thrombosis was considered likely to be due to systemic hypercoagulability because of the presence of altered flow characteristics and endothelial damage in the vascular tumour bed. Aortoiliac thrombosis, paraparesis and hindlimb ischaemia are unusual sequelae of angiosarcoma in the dog.
