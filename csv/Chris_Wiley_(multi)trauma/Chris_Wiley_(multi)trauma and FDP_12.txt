AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - Angiogenesis is an essential process during wound healing. The chemokine IL-8 is a well-known inflammatory and angiogenic factor. We found that IL-8 stimulates activation of SREBPs, molecules that are critical for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and that this activation is markedly increased during IL-8-induced angiogenesis. Two important processes in the early stages of angiogenesis are increase in proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Therefore, we tested whether IL-8 stimulates these processes in a SREBP-dependent manner both in vivo and in culture. Our data show that IL-8 stimulates SREBP-1 and -2 gene expression which leads to an increase in both the precursor and the mature forms of these proteins in human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVEC). In addition, several genes downstream of SREBPs are also up-regulated by IL-8 stimulation, in particular 3-hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCA). Furthermore, SREBP-1 was abundant in the neovasculature of wound healing skin, and this expression could be suppressed by local application of antibodies to IL-8 or to its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. To test whether SREBP activation is critical for the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells induced by IL-8 during angiogenesis, we used either RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that escorts SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi for maturation (activation), or treated endothelial cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an inhibitor of SREBP activation. Both SCAP RNAi and 25-HC significantly inhibited IL-8-induced SREBP activation during endothelial cell migration and proliferation indicating that SREBPs are critical components of the signaling pathways leading to IL8-induced angiogenesis. In addition, in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, 25-HC markedly inhibited both developmental- and IL-8-induced angiogenesis in 7-day and 10-day CAMs, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate a novel regulatory mechanism for IL-8-induced angiogenesis that is mediated by SREBPs.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - To investigate changes in the mechanical properties of skin with injury, tissue was evaluated 70 days following full thickness wounding in juvenile female Yorkshire pigs (N?=?14). Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions, for both scar tissue and uninjured skin. The samples were evaluated mechanically in vitro using a protocol of stress relaxation followed by tensile failure, in an INSTRON universal test machine. Specimens were subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period, after which they were returned to the original length and failed in tension. Axial normal skin exhibited a smaller force at 10% elongation (?58%, p?=?0.002), and higher failure load (p?=?0.027) and displacement (p?=?0.028) than transverse. Scarring reduced the failure strength on average by 60% in the axial and 65% in the transverse directions (p?<?0.001), with large decreases (>50%) in displacement at failure in both directions (p?<?0.001). Elongation of 10% produced a larger force in axial scars (p?<?0.001) than their normal counterparts, indicating a reduction in small-displacement compliance. Axial scars exhibited greater failure strength (p?=?0.009) than transverse scars, yet no significant differences were observed in elongation to failure or load at 10% elongation. These results indicate that normal skin exhibits higher compliance and failure strength in the axial direction. Following injury, the strength and compliance of the tissue are greatly reduced, and the strong compliance directionality originally observed, is lost. Therefore it appears that the healing response leads to increases in tissue stiffness, such that small displacements result in larger tissue loads. This is further complicated by the reduced ability of the scar to resist failure. Taken together, these findings illustrate the compounding negative effects of scar on tissue integrity and function.

AB  - Introduction:? Clinically, it has been observed that treatment with an occlusive dressing that results in hydration of the epidermis reduces scarring. A keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system in which the epidermis is hydrated results in increased TNF production by keratinocytes, and reduced collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. We wished to test the hypothesis that in a nonhydrated coculture system, increasing TNF expression would result in decreased collagen synthesis by fibroblasts. Both keratinocytes and fibroblasts play essential role in scar formation. However, little is known about how TNF-alpha specific communication between these cell types modulates scar formation. To better elucidate this interaction, we used a keratinocyte/fibroblast coculture system to assess fibroblast function in a milieu of TNF-alpha overexpression by keratinocytes. Methods:? Primary human keratinocytes were transfected with adenovirus (MOI?=?10) containing cDNA for TNF-alpha (AdTNF-alpha) or with LacZ and then cocultured with human dermal fibroblasts for 6 days. Results:? TNF-alpha transfected keratinocytes and their corresponding conditioned media showed a 3000-fold increase of TNF-alpha expression and synthesis in QRT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequent antibody blocking experiments with a specific TNF-alpha antibody showed a dose-dependent increase in collagen type 1 protein in the conditioned media. Col-1A1 mRNA expression in dermal fibroblasts was significantly reduced (p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? Our data demonstrate that in a coculture setting, TNF-alpha expression by keratinocytes reduces Col-1A1 expression in fibroblasts and suggests a mechanism for clinical finding on the scar-reducing effects of hydration. This may bolster support for a TNF-alpha-mediated therapeutic intervention to ameliorate wound scarification.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Using peptide growth factors to improve upon natural wound healing provides promise, but topical application of growth factors has found limited clinical success. Gene therapy has been limited by low transfection efficiency. We are investigating the use of electroporation (EP)in vivo to enhance transfection efficiency and improve wound healing with DNA expression vectors for growth factors. Methods:? To assess plasmid transfection and wound healing, gWIZ luciferase vector and PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector were used, respectively. Cutaneous wounds were produced via 8?mm-punch biopsy in Sprague Dawley rats. Healing was impaired by cecal ligation induced sepsis. We used NIH image analysis software and histologic assessment to assess wound closure. Results:? Plasmid Transfection: EP effectively increased expression of gWIZ luciferase vector 53-fold compared to vector without EP (p?<?0.001). We demonstrated that transfection was localized to skin when transfected skin was reflected to reveal underlying muscle. We found that EP-assisted transfection lasted for 30 days, which is appropriate for treatment of wound healing. Wound Healing:? Using PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector and EP wounds were 60% smaller on day 12 versus vector without EP (p?<?0.009). We assessed quality of healing with a histologic scoring system grading quality of epithelial coverage, organization of scar and resolution of inflammation. KGF vector?+?EP score of 3.0 +/? 0.3 was better than that of 1.8 +/? 0.3 for treatment with vector alone (p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? These results demonstrate the capacity of electroporation-facilitated transfection with DNA plasmid expression vector for growth factor to improve wound healing. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and its murine homolog spi2 are serine protease inhibitors present in plasma, that are locally up-regulated during wound healing. Ad-spi2 and Ad-ACT expression vectors were constructed to address the biological activity of locally expressed serpins. The condition medium of infected COS-1 cell at 2?d postinfection contained 1.23?ng/ml spi2 and 2.61?ng/ml ACT. Ad-LacZ or Ad-spi2 108?pfu was injected into the sponges after 3?d subcutaneous implantation in rats. Histological analysis showed that overexpression of spi2 improves granulation tissue organization and collagen deposition at d7 implantation. Moreover, overexpression of spi2 increases the contents of tissue DNA (23.8%, p?<?0.05) and protein (25.3%, p?<?0.05) in sponge implantation model in rats. In incisional wound models in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats, Ad-spi2 increases tensile strength by 26%(p?=?0.011) and 29%(p?=?0.022) as well as Ad-ACT increases by 10.3%(p?=?0.037) and 32%(p?=?0.004), respectively. In adriamycin-induced wound model in rats, histological analysis displayed less inflammatory cells infiltrating in Ad-ACT injected wound than in Ad-LacZ after 21?d injection of adriamycin. Inflammation enzymes MPO and elastase levels were decreased by 32.3% and 29.2% in Ad-ACT injected wound tissue. Our data concluded that overexpression of spi2 and ACT improves wound healing in rats probably via inflammatory resolution. (Supported by Switch Biotech and the Department of Veterans Affairs)

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Tissue ischemia is a common occurrence in many disease processes including chronic wounds, stroke, solid tumors, and myocardial infarction. The application of gene delivery for healing of wounds has demonstrated increasing therapeutic promises in animal models. Adenoviral vectors have been successfully used for gene delivery to the ischemic wound. However, these vectors typically demonstrate short, transient transgene expression while eliciting significant cytotoxic immune response. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) do not have those limitations; however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. The goal of this study was to compare AAV vector with adenoviral vector in terms of relative efficiency of gene delivery and cytotoxic immune response in ischemic wounds. Reporter constructs Ad5-LacZ and AAV-LacZ (108?pfu/wound) were injected onto the dermis of rabbit ear prior to creation of ischemic wounds. Wounds were harvested at postoperative day 10. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with an in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed with both vectors; however, transduction rates with AAV vector was approximately 10-fold lower than Adenovirus. Unlike Adenovirus, no noticeable inflammatory cell infiltration was observed with AAV injection. Even when the dosage of AAV was increased to 109?pfu/wound inflammatory cell infiltration remained negligible. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and adenoviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in ischemic tissues. The particular advantage of AAV is the ability to transfect with higher doses while at lower dose maximal transfection rate seems to be more with Adenovirus.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. In vitro cell culture bioactivity experiments are planned. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated.

AB  - Wound repair is described as a delicately balanced and well-orchestrated progression of events, which ultimately results in healing in the majority of acute cases. However, time taken to complete healing can vary greatly between patients and any alteration in this physiological process could delay healing further. Thus, a wound treatment, which facilitates healing independent of wound type and in patients where healing is compromised or impeded, would be extremely advantageous. Previous studies suggest a beneficial role for biomaterials such as collagen/ORC in modifying the chronic wound environment; however, their effect on the acute wound environment is unknown. While it is generally accepted that acute wounds heal at an optimum rate due to a positive wound environment, we wanted to determine if current advanced wound healing treatments could augment or impact this healing rate. In this study we evaluated the effect of advanced wound therapies in the presence of acute wound fluid on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. We hypothesize that an enhanced effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid may be indicative of a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute wounds. Results demonstrate that of the wound treatments tested only collagen/ORC containing therapies exhibited a positive effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid. We conclude, therefore, that collagen/ORC biomaterials, already shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wounds, may also be a valuable therapy in the treatment of acute wounds.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)

AB  - Introduction:? There is growing clinical evidence that moist wounds show improved wound healing in terms of less scar tissue formation and better cosmesis. Increased levels of wound fluid improve migration of keratinocytes along the wound surface. Occlusive dressings provide such a hydrated wound environment. However, the underlying mechanisms on how occluded wounds exert the clinical observed effect are yet barely understood. We hypothesized, that keratinocytes play a keyrole in hydrated wounds by sending cytokine signals to upper epidermal layers and even more important to the dermis. We therefore focused on connexins, intercellular channels that are strongly involved in cell-cell communication, hemostasis, and small molecule exchange. Methods:? Full thickness incisions to the panniculus carnosus were made on female Fisher rats. Both incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 5-0 polypropylene suture. One incision on each rat was randomly covered with an occlusive dressing until harvest. Wounds were harvested on PODs 3, 7, and 10. RNA was selectively extracted from both the epidermis and dermis. Histo'logy slides were preliminary evaluated by using a 0?4 scale rating cellularity count in the epithelium, subepithelium, and peripanniculous as well as epithelial thickness. Results:? Cellularity count was significantly reduced in the epithelial and subepithelial compartment of occluded wounds as well as the epithelial thickness in occluded wounds (p?<?0,05). QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of Cx30-mRNA on POD10 in occluded wounds versus nonoccluded wounds. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that occlusion promotes epithelialization and maturation of incisional wounds most likely through hydration. Up-regulation of Connexin30 on POD10 supports that thesis, as it suggests an advanced communication process in keratinocytes in occluded wounds.

AB  - Laser therapy has been considered useful for the treatment of chronic wounds. Different research groups have been working with fibroblastic metabolism, after culture irradiation with red and infrared sources of laser. Previously it has been demonstrated that lasers stimulate collagen synthesis and [3H]tymidine uptake when fibroblasts are irradiated and grown in the presence of fetal bovine serum (5?10%). Our group has been evaluating the in vitro effects of low-level laser (??=?650?nm) activity on fibroblast metabolism. In this work, fibroblast activity was evaluated after 24, 48, and 72?h from G0 using synchronized fibroblast cultures previously irradiated with a single dose of low-level laser at different power densities (3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30?mW/cm2), during different times of exposure (15, 30, 60, and 120?sec). Proliferation was measured by [3H]tymidine uptake, and ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 were evaluated by ELISA. Significant changes in proliferation were only observed after 48?h when 'cultures were irradiated during 30?sec with 3.75, 7.5, and 15?mW/cm2, or during 60 seconds at 15?mW/cm2. However, ProMMP-1 diminished significantly after 24 and 48?h when cultures were irradiated with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 30 and 60?sec, and with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 15 seconds, after 48?h. TIMP-1 expression was significantly lower than the control during each dose and they were assayed 24?h after each irradiation. Based on the above data, fibroblast proliferation is stimulated 48?h after irradiation, using low-level laser to incorporate cells from G0 to the cell cycle, almost in the absence of serum (1%), although ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 responses were observed 24?h after irradiation with the same doses. These results indicate that low-level laser can stimulate normal human fibroblasts to reduce collagen turnover, and consequently can be useful to stimulate normal fibroblast activity in a wound. As a result, this therapy could be administered every 2 days and may be more effective.

AB  - Percutaneous devices play a central role in modern medicine, but are associated with significant risk of infection. One approach to circumvent this risk is to heal the wound around the device by creating a seal at the skin/device interface. We previously showed, using cell adhesion assay and organ culture model, that surface modification of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)[poly(HEMA)] with 1,1?-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) dramatically enhanced keratinocyte attachment to poly(HEMA). Although the organ culture model addresses epithelial response to an implanted biomaterial, to fully evaluate the cutaneous interaction with biomaterials, we tested implants in a mouse model. Porous poly(HEMA) rods with 40??m pore size were implanted into two different sites on dorsal skin of forty eight, 6?8 week old male C57BL/10?J mice. Porous poly(HEMA) rods were treated with 1) PBS, 2) CDI, and 3) CDI plus laminin 5. Samples were harvested at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery and analyzed morphologically using H&E and immunohistochemistry. Implanted rods remained intact and infection free at all time points. Morphological analysis showed diffuse dermal cellular infiltration in all samples and evidence of epidermal integration into the pores of CDI treated poly(HEMA) and CDI plus laminin 5 treated poly(HEMA). Immunohistochemistry showed laminin 5 expression at the skin/poly(HEMA) interface resembling the junctional epithelium of the tooth. Engineering this type of attachment to percutaneous devices is attractive since the tooth is a natural example of percutaneous material, where bacterial invasion of bone is prevented by epithelial attachment.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.
