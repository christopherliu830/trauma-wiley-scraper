AB  - Summary Pediatric intensive care units are quintessentially multidisciplinary units that care for patients of other physicians and must integrate all stakeholders, including the families and child, into the care delivery process. This chapter will review the major functions of the pediatric intensive care unit, and then discuss major organ system dysfunction and common diseases in critically ill children. This includes the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, renal, and gastroenterological systems. Infection, sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response syndromes will also be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Fibrinogen Richfield exemplifies a dysfibrinogen associated with a life-long thrombotic tendency. The evaluation of this novel case indicates that, like similar thrombotic dysfibrinogenemias, the abnormal protein polymerizes abnormally and demonstrates impaired clot dissolution. A survey of other cases of dysfibrinogenemia indicates that the relatively common abnormalities of Fibrinopeptide A release are generally asymptomatic or associated with bleeding, polymerization abnormalities are likely to be asymptomatic or associated with thrombosis (or occasionally bleeding), and complex abnormalities or additional, independent hemostatic defects are rather common. Thrombin and Reptilase clotting times are not helpful in distinguishing between the subsets, but clinical history, fibrinopeptide release, and polymerization studies may be useful. Abnormalities of fibrinogen function tend to correlate with changes in molecular domains related to binding and hydrolysis.

AB  - Summary Congenital (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients may have obstetric complications during their pregnancies. This study aimed to evaluate thromboelastography (TEG) as a potential tool for assessing the tendency for obstetric complications in those patients in a non-pregnant state. A total of 22 female subjects with congenital (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia were recruited. Nine subjects had histories of obstetric complications and the other 13 subjects had at least one uneventful pregnancy without obstetric complications as yet. Detailed clinical investigation and phenotype/genotype detection were carried out, and both kaolin-activated TEG and functional fibrinogen TEG (FF-TEG) were applied in all subjects. Significant differences were identified in all TEG parameters except for R and angle between these two groups (P < 0.05) by covariance analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of discrimination between these two groups of patients was performed for TEG parameters. Significantly high odds ratio (OR) of obstetric complications occurrence were demonstrated in K ≥ 3.8 min, maximum amplitude (MA) ≤ 54.2 mm, comprehensive index (CI) ≤ ?3 (11.67, 95% CI 1.527?89.121, P < 0.05 in all), and MA-CFF ≤ 12.1 mm (20.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.967?203.322, P = 0.002). Moreover, MA-CFF had better prognostic performance, with a corresponding area under the receiver operating curve of 0.923 (range 0.815?1.031, P = 0.001). This study suggests that (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients with values outside of the cut-off values of TEG assays under non-pregnant state may have a higher risk of obstetric complications occurring when they are pregnant. No parameters under non-pregnant state in clinical laboratory have ever been reported to be risk factors for obstetric complication occurrence in (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients. This study explored such parameters in TEG assays and found that parameters of TEG assays under non-pregnant status might predict the occurrence of obstetric complications, which could provide physicians with important information about whether fibrinogen replacement therapy is required, so as to prevent the occurrence of obstetric complications, especially for patients who are asymptomatic in daily life.

AB  - Summary. Background:? Orthopedic surgery, especially total knee and total hip arthroplasty, is considered a risk factor for peri-operative venous thromboembolism. Objectives:? This study evaluates how accelerated inflammatogenic cellular interactions and the subsequent production of tissue factor and CD40 ligand play an important role in the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism. Patients and methods:? Twenty-four patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to groups with (Ti; n?=?12) and without (Tn; n?=?12) pneumatic tourniquet inflation. Results:? Numbers of leukocyte-platelet aggregates, especially those comprising monocytes-platelets in central venous blood from the Ti group, were increased during the peri-operative period (P?<?0.01), and returned to the baseline level at 24?h after starting surgery. Levels of PAC-1, P-selectin, CD40 ligand, tissue factor, Mac-1 expression on monocytes including monocyte-platelet aggregates, and the number of microparticles including those of endothelial cell origin were noticeably increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Whole blood coagulability was also obviously increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Furthermore, the concentrations of venous plasma tissue factor antigen, CD40 ligand, platelet factor 4, ?-thromboglobulin, the soluble fibrin monomer complex and prothrombin fragment 1+2 were also increased (P?<?0.05). Conclusions:? This study showed that platelet, leukocyte and endothelium activities as well as their interactions are enhanced during the peri-operative period of total knee arthroplasty, particularly in venous blood from the lower half of the body, which consequently augments blood coagulability. Further, tourniquet inflation during surgery exaggerates these responses.
