AB  - Background Heterophilic antibodies are still an important source of interference in immunoassays, but reports of interference with D-dimers are rare. Are D-dimer level abnormalities, found in the clinic, caused by heterophilic antibodies as well, or are other mechanisms involved? We will elaborate on this issue through two different examples in this article. Methods Serum from two patients with significantly elevated levels of D-dimers were measured and compared by different methods, diluted, and dealt with heterophilic antibody blockers. At the same time, to retrieve the interference, we focused on the cause of D-dimer false positives and made a systematic review of the literature. Results The D-dimer values were normal (0.49 and 0.15 ?g/mL) detected with different testing method and decreased after addition of heterophilic antibody blocking reagent. According to literature data, there were 66.7% (4/6) references showed the interference were heterophilic antibody. Conclusions The influence of heterophilic antibodies on the measurement of D-dimers remains a big challenge. Different measuring instruments and methods may have significant differences in the measurement of D-dimers. By using a combination of instrumental methods for measuring, incorporating heterophilic antibody blockers, and combining with clinical performance and imaging data, most of the interference can be eliminated.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - Complement fragment (C)5a is a 74 residue pro-inflammatory polypeptide produced during activation of the complement cascade of serum proteins in response to foreign surfaces such as microorganisms and tissue damaged by physical or chemical injury. C5a binds to at least two seven-transmembrane domain receptors, C5aR (C5R1, CD88) and C5L2 (gpr77), expressed ubiquitously on a wide variety of cells but particularly on the surface of immune cells like macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. C5aR is a classical G protein-coupled receptor that signals through Gαi and Gα16, whereas C5L2 does not appear to couple to G proteins and has no known signalling activity. Although C5a was first described as an anaphylatoxin and later as a leukocyte chemoattractant, the widespread expression of C5aR suggested more general functionality. Our understanding of the physiology of C5a has improved significantly in recent years through exploitation of receptor knockout and knockin mice, C5 and C5a antibodies, soluble recombinant C5a and C5a analogues and newly developed receptor antagonists. C5a is now also implicated in non-immunological functions associated with developmental biology, CNS development and neurodegeneration, tissue regeneration, and haematopoiesis. Combined receptor mutagenesis, molecular modelling, structure-activity relationship studies and species dependence for ligand potency on C5aR have been helpful for identifying ligand binding sites on the receptor and for defining mechanisms of receptor activation and inactivation. This review will highlight major developments in C5a receptor research that support C5aR as an important therapeutic target. The intriguing possibilities raised by the existence of a non-signalling C5a receptor are also discussed.

AB  - The primary objective of this paper was to evaluate the published evidence of efficacy and safety of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections in paediatric upper limb hypertonia (PULH). Secondary objectives included the provision of clinical context, based on evidence and expert opinion, in the areas of assessment, child and muscle selection, dosing, and adjunctive treatment. A multidisciplinary panel of authors systematically reviewed, abstracted, and classified relevant literature. Recommendations were based on the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) evidence classification. Following a literature search, 186 potential articles were screened for inclusion, and 15 of these met the criteria and were reviewed. Grade A evidence was found to support the use of BoNT to reach individualized therapeutic goals for PULH. There is grade B evidence (probably effective) for tone reduction following BoNT injections and grade U evidence (inconclusive) for improvement in upper limb (UL) activity and function. BoNT injections were generally found to be safe and well tolerated with the most common side effect identified as a transient decrease in grip strength.

AB  - Abstract This review describes practical criteria and a systematic process to aid the treatment planning decision of whether to preserve teeth by root canal treatment (RCT) or extract and provide an implant. Recommendations presented are based on best available evidence from the literature and the expert views of specialists in endodontics and restorative dentistry, including dental implantology. A MEDLINE search was conducted using the terms ?root canal therapy?, ?dental implants?, ?decision making?, ?treatment planning?, ?outcome? and ?human?, and supplemented by hand-searching. When evaluating the outcome of root canal treatment, an observation period of 4?5?years is required for complete healing of periapical lesions. Dental implants, however, present a de novo situation and a functional period of at least 5?years is often required before peri-implant diseases are established and detected. Good long-term success rates and greater flexibility in clinical management indicate that RCT or retreatment should be performed first in most instances unless the tooth is judged to be unrestorable. When deciding if a compromised tooth of questionable prognosis should be maintained or replaced by an implant, both local, site-specific and more general patient-related factors should be considered. Following systematic evaluation and consideration of the best treatment option in a particular case, a treatment recommendation may then be given in favour or against tooth retention. Whilst single risks are possibly accepted for single tooth restorations, teeth with questionable prognosis and multiple pre-treatment requirements are better not included as abutments in fixed dental prostheses to reduce the risk to survival of the entire restoration.

AB  - Summary Background Although recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) is a widely used novel anticoagulant agent for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in Japan, its clinical efficacy in sepsis-induced DIC has not been demonstrated convincingly. Objective To assess the benefits and harms of rhTM in sepsis-induced DIC patients. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of rhTM therapy for sepsis-induced DIC for both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (retrospective case-control studies and/or prospective cohort studies) separately. All-cause mortality (28?30 days) as efficacy and serious bleeding complications as adverse effect were measured as primary outcomes. We assessed body of evidence quality at the outcome level by using the Grading of Evidence, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results We analyzed 12 studies (838 patients/3 RCTs; 571 patients/9 observational studies). Pooled relative risk was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.62?1.06) in the RCTs, indicating non-significant reduction in mortality, and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.45?0.77) in the observational studies. Meta-regression analysis revealed a significant negative slope between effect size of rhTM therapy and baseline mortality rate in individual studies (P = 0.012), suggesting that probability of a beneficial effect with rhTM therapy increases with increasing baseline risk. Risk of serious bleeding complications was not significantly different between rhTM and control groups. We judged the quality of evidence as moderate for mortality and serious bleeding. Conclusions The rhTM was associated with a trend in reduction of mortality at 28?30 days in sepsis-induced DIC patients. Further large rigorous trials are needed to confirm or refute these findings before implications for practice are clear.
