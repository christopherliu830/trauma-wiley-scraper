AB  - Summary This review focuses on the molecular genetics, biochemistry and evolution of terpenoid synthases relevant to terpenoid defences in conifers. In grand fir (Abies grandis) biosynthesis of terpenoids of the three classes of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes is inducible t y stem wounding at the level of gene activation and increase of enzyme activity of the respective terpene synthases. The monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases utilize prenyl diphosphates of appropriate size as substrates to generate the large diversity of carbon skeletons characteristic of the terpenoid resin of conifers. A large and diverse gene family of grand fir terpene synthases has been cloned and cDNAs arc actively expressed in Escherichia coli for enzyme characterization. The monophyletic group of grand fir monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases represents both constitutively expressed and inducible genes encoding single product and multiple product enzymes. Several events of gene duplication and functional specialization of new synthases occurred during the evolution of terpenoid biosynthesis in grand fir, and gave rise to the enormous diversity and variability of this ancient and successful plant defence against herbivores and pathogens. The review concludes with a perspective of the biotechnological applications of terpenoid synthases for the genetic engineering of agricultural crops and forest trees.

AB  - Abstract Spasticity is a disorder of the sensorimotor systme characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone with exagerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. It is one component of the upper motoneruon syndrome, along with released flexor reflexes, weakness, and loss of dexterity. Spasticity is an important ?positive? diagnostic sign of the upper motoneuron syndrome, and when it restricts motion, disability may result. The ?negative? signs--weakness and loss of dexterity--invariably alter patient function when they occur. In an upper motoneuron syndrome, the alpha motoneuron pool becomes hyperexcitable at the segmental level. This hyperexcitability is hypothesized to occur through a variety of mechanisms, not all of which have yet been demonstrated in humans. Spasticity caused by spinal cord lesions is often marked by a slow increase in excitation and overactivity of both flexors and extensors with reactions possibly occurring many segments away from the stimulus. Cerebral lesions often cause rapid build-up of excitation with a bias toward involvement of antigravity muscles. Chronic spasticity can lead to changes in the rheologic properties of the involved and neighboring muscles. Stiffness, contracture, atrophy, and fibrosis may interact with pathologic regulatory mechanisms to prevent normal control of limb position and movement. In the clinical exam, it is important to distinguish between the resistance due to spasticity and that due to rheologic changes, because the distinction has therapeutic implications. Diagnostic nerve or motor point blocks and dynamic or multichannel EMG are useful to distinguish the contributions of spasticity and stiffness to the clinical problem. 1997 John Wiley  20 (suppl 6):S1-S13.

AB  - Since Haissaguerre and his colleagues demonstrated the importance of the pulmonary veins in the generation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 1998, a variety of different ablative interventions have been performed to eliminate AF. Various complications related to catheterization, ablation itself including pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial effusion, stroke, and atrioesophageal fistula have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome characterized by enhanced activation of coagulation with some intravascular fibrin formation and deposition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient whose condition was complicated by DIC after segmental ostial isolation of pulmonary veins for persistent AF. The patient has completely recovered from the DIC by hemodialysis, administration of blood constituents for 15 days.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this systematic review was to critically analyse the available evidence on the effect of different modalities of alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) as compared to tooth extraction alone in function of relevant clinical, radiographic and patient-centred outcomes. Material and Methods A comprehensive search aimed at identifying pertinent literature for the purpose of this review was conducted by two independent examiners. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that met the eligibility criteria were selected. Relevant data from these RCTs were collated into evidence tables. Endpoints of interest included clinical, radiographic and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Interventions reported in the selected studies were clustered into ARP treatment modalities. All these different ARP modalities were compared to the control therapy (i.e. spontaneous socket healing) in each individual study after a 3- to 6-month healing period. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted if at least two studies within the same ARP treatment modality reported on the same outcome of interest. Results A combined database, grey literature and hand search identified 3,003 records, of which 1,789 were screened after removal of duplicates. Following the application of the eligibility criteria, 25 articles for a total of 22 RCTs were included in the final selection, from which nine different ARP treatment modalities were identified: (a) bovine bone particles (BBP) + socket sealing (SS), (b) construct made of 90% bovine bone granules and 10% porcine collagen (BBG/PC) + SS, (c) cortico-cancellous porcine bone particles (CPBP) + SS, (d) allograft particles (AG) + SS, (e) alloplastic material (AP) with or without SS, (f) autologous blood-derived products (ABDP), (g) cell therapy (CTh), (h) recombinant morphogenic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and (i) SS alone. Quantitative analyses for different ARP modalities, all of which involved socket grafting with a bone substitute, were feasible for a subset of clinical and radiographic outcomes. The results of a pooled quantitative analysis revealed that ARP via socket grafting (ARP-SG), as compared to tooth extraction alone, prevents horizontal (M = 1.99 mm; 95% CI 1.54?2.44; p < 0.00001), vertical mid-buccal (M = 1.72 mm; 95% CI 0.96?2.48; p < 0.00001) and vertical mid-lingual (M = 1.16 mm; 95% CI 0.81?1.52; p < 0.00001) bone resorption. Whether there is a superior ARP or SS approach could not be determined on the basis of the selected evidence. However, the application of particulate xenogenic or allogenic materials covered with an absorbable collagen membrane or a rapidly absorbable collagen sponge was associated with the most favourable outcomes in terms of horizontal ridge preservation. A specific quantitative analysis showed that sites presenting a buccal bone thickness >1.0 mm exhibited more favourable ridge preservation outcomes (difference between ARP [AG + SS] and control = 3.2 mm), as compared to sites with a thinner buccal wall (difference between ARP [AG + SS] and control = 1.29 mm). The effect of other local and systemic factors could not be assessed as part of the quantitative analyses. PROMs were comparable between the experimental and the control group in two studies involving the use of ABDP. The effect of other ARP modalities on PROMs could not be investigated, as these outcomes were not reported in any other clinical trial included in this study. Conclusion Alveolar ridge preservation is an effective therapy to attenuate the dimensional reduction of the alveolar ridge that normally takes place after tooth extraction.

AB  - Summary Limitations to successful plasma therapy include constraints related to inventory, turnaround time, and volumes infused. For PCCs, availability of four-factor PCCs may be limited, and three-factor PCCs are not approved for replacement of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, except for factor IX. Close collaboration among critical care specialists, hematology, transfusion medicine, and pharmacy services is desirable for management of patients with complex coagulopathies. In the absence of clearly supportive evidence, physicians should exercise restraint in the use of rFVIIa in off-label settings. Physicians need to be encouraged to adapt their clinical practices with sound clinical evidence for use of each of the hemostatic/prothrombotic products.

AB  - Abstract Women with antithrombin (AT) III deficiency are prone to pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism. We report 2 cases with genetically confirmed ATIII deficiency, one with a mutation in exon 3A and the other with an exon 4 deletion, in whom the pregnancies were successfully managed with prophylactic therapies for thrombosis. A 35-year-old pregnant woman was treated with intravenous infusions of ATIII concentrate alone, and the other 22-year-old pregnant woman was mainly treated with subcutaneous injections of heparin and oral low-dose aspirin therapy. Both pregnancies resulted in vaginal deliveries of healthy neonates. The literature concerning prophylactic therapies for thrombosis in ATIII deficiency-complicated pregnancy is reviewed, and the clinical problems, including the adverse effects of the therapies, are discussed.
