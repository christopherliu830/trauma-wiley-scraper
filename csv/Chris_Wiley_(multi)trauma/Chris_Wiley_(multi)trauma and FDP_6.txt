AB  - Abstract Objectives: To assess retrospectively the cumulative costs for the long-term oral rehabilitation of patients with birth defects affecting the development of teeth. Methods: Patients with birth defects who had received fixed reconstructions on teeth and/or implants ≥5 years ago were asked to participate in a comprehensive clinical, radiographic and economic evaluation. Results: From the 45 patients included, 18 were cases with a cleft lip and palate, five had amelogenesis/dentinogenesis imperfecta and 22 were cases with hypodontia/oligodontia. The initial costs for the first oral rehabilitation (before the age of 20) had been covered by the Swiss Insurance for Disability. The costs for the initial rehabilitation of the 45 cases amounted to 407,584?CHF (39% for laboratory fees). Linear regression analyses for the initial treatment costs per replaced tooth revealed the formula 731?CHF+(811?CHF ? units) on teeth and 3369?CHF+(1183?CHF ? units) for reconstructions on implants (P<.001). Fifty-eight percent of the patients with tooth-supported reconstructions remained free from failures/complications (median observation 15.7 years). Forty-seven percent of the patients with implant-supported reconstructions remained free from failures/complications (median observation 8 years). The long-term cumulative treatment costs for implant cases, however, were not statistically significantly different compared with cases reconstructed with tooth-supported fixed reconstructions. Twenty-seven percent of the initial treatment costs were needed to cover supportive periodontal therapy as well as the treatment of technical/biological complications and failures. Conclusion: Insurance companies should accept to cover implant-supported reconstructions because there is no need to prepare healthy teeth, fewer tooth units need to be replaced and the cumulative long-term costs seem to be similar compared with cases restored on teeth.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - Summary: Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are critically involved in activation of the coagulation system in sepsis, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (APC) regulate the coagulation system by inhibiting thrombin generation. In addition to these anticoagulant effects, both AT and APC have been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses induced by various noxious stimuli in rats such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. AT promotes the endothelial release of prostacyclin, a potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that inhibits the monocytic production of TNF-α, by interacting with cell-surface heparin-like substances. APC directly inhibits the production of TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of both nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and activator protein-1 in monocytes stimulated with LPS. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial membranous integral protein that binds thrombin, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by generating APC. Furthermore, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, a natural anticoagulant for the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system, also attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in rats by inhibiting TNF-α production by monocytes. These findings strongly suggest that natural anticoagulants could regulate inflammatory responses as well as the coagulation system in rats by inhibiting the monocytic production of TNF-α. Such anti-inflammatory properties of natural anticoagulants are potentially important for their replacement in patients with sepsis who frequently develop DIC and organ failure as inflammatory responses.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review the hemostasis literature relevant to development of coagulopathy in the critically ill equine patient. Data Source ? Original scientific and review articles. Human Data Synthesis ? Inflammation plays a critical role in the activation and amplification of clot formation, as well as the impairment of physiologic anticoagulant mechanisms, and fibrinolysis. Earlier identification of coagulopathy in patients at risk and restoration of physiologic hemostasis may result in better outcome. Development of scoring systems based on information other than coagulation markers alone may better identify patients with subclinical coagulopathy. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Critically ill equine patients commonly at risk for coagulopathy include those with severe gastrointestinal disease, septic foals, and adults subjected to severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Publications provide information regarding coagulation markers helpful for identification of hemostatic dysfunction in specific patient populations, as well as information regarding the influence of coagulopathy on outcome. Data regarding clinically relevant information on therapeutic intervention are lacking. Conclusions ? The relationship between inflammation and endotoxemia and development of coagulopathy is better understood in both human patients and the critically ill equine patient. Prospective clinical trials evaluating clinically relevant and financially feasible approaches to treatment are still needed.

AB  - Abstract Electrochemical immunosensors (EIs) for the determination of disease biomarkers has attracted a wide interest due to its high sensitivity, low cost, and possible integration in compact analytical devices. The use of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to develop EIs contributes to the great potential they have in point of care (POC) test, since SPEs show good electrical properties and allow the reduction of the electrochemical instrumentation down to small pocket-size devices. Moreover, during the last years, SPEs have gone through significant improvements related to both their design and printing materials. Since cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the major threats of global health, there is a growing demand for the development of portable, rapid, simple and inexpensive devices for the detection of these diseases. This article presents an overview about the main biomarkers of cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the EIs based on SPEs for the detection of these biomarkers.
