AB  - Background? A balanced transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets are recommended for massively bleeding trauma patients. Fibrinogen concentrates could potentially lessen or replace the need for FFP and/or platelet transfusions. Aim? To provide a review of the literature covering the application of fibrinogen concentrates in trauma care. Methods? PubMed and Cochrane database search: fibrinogen and (concentrate or trauma), not congenital, published between 2000 and 2012. Results? Six papers were identified. None were randomized controlled trials. The main conclusion of these papers was that administration of fibrinogen sometimes together with prothrombin complex concentrate might improve haemostasis in trauma patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Data regarding the effect of fibrinogen concentrate together with a more physiological resuscitation fluid, i.e. FFP, or as the only intervention in bleeding trauma patients is lacking. Conclusions? Evidence for the use of fibrinogen concentrate to trauma patients with massive bleeding is sparse, of poor quality and confined to patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Well-designed prospective, randomized, double-blinded studies evaluating the effect of fibrinogen concentrate, as the only intervention, are urgently needed.

AB  - Aim Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported to predict survival in several types of malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate their predictive value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We retrospectively analyzed plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer levels from 252 subjects: control (n?=?20), hepatitis (n?=?20), cirrhosis (n?=?20), and HCC (n?=?192) subjects. The clinical involvement and prognostic value of fibrinogen and D-dimer was analyzed in HCC subjects. To confirm the effects of tumor on hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured in nude mice following HCC inoculation. Results Fibrinogen decreased and D-dimer increased in cirrhosis subjects relative to other groups. In HCC subjects, elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were significantly associated with adverse tumor features (increased size, stage, and grade) and systemic inflammation. Patients with HCC with either elevated fibrinogen or D-dimer levels had significantly higher 3-year tumor recurrence rates (65% vs. 41%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 67% vs. 40%, P?=?0.011 for D-dimer) and significantly lower 3-year overall survival rates (57% vs. 79%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 56% vs. 80%, P?=?0.001 for D-dimer). After multivariate analysis, elevated fibrinogen levels remained an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Finally, elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were confirmed in nude mice following tumor inoculation. Conclusion The fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, elevating after carcinogenesis, may serve as simple but effective predictors of adverse tumor profiles and outcomes in HCC.

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Summary.? Fibrinogen, a hexameric glycoprotein encoded by three genes ?FGA, FGB, FGG? clustered on chromosome 4q is involved in the final steps of coagulation as a precursor of fibrin monomers required for the formation of the haemostatic plug. Inherited disorders of fibrinogen abnormalities are rare and not as well clinically characterized as some other inherited bleeding disorders. To characterize the clinical manifestations, molecular defects and treatment modalities of these rare disorders, a Medline search from January 1966 to September 2007 for these disorders reported in large studies and registries was undertaken. Inherited fibrinogen disorders can manifest as quantitative defects (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia) or qualitative defects (dysfibrinogenemia). Quantitative fibrinogen deficiencies may result from mutations affecting fibrinogen synthesis, or processing while qualitative defects are caused by mutations causing abnormal polymerization, defective cross-linking or defective assembly of the fibrinolytic system. Clinical manifestations vary from being asymptomatic to developing catastrophic life-threatening bleeds or thromboembolic events. Management of bleeds includes use of purified plasma-derived concentrates, cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma. Use of some of these products carries risks of viral transmission, antibody development and thromboembolic events. Establishment of registries in Iran, Italy and North America has fostered a better understanding of these disorders with an attempt to explore molecular defects. Rare Bleeding Disorder Registries developed through the United States and international efforts hopefully will encourage development and licensure of safer, effective products.

AB  - Summary.? Hereditary fibrinogen disorders include type I deficiencies (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia, i.e. quantitative defects), with low or unmeasurable levels of immunoreactive protein; and type II deficiencies (dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia, i.e. qualitative defects), showing normal or altered antigen levels associated with reduced coagulant activity. While dysfibrinogenemias are in most cases autosomal dominant disorders, type I deficiencies are generally inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Patients affected by congenital afibrinogenemia or severe hypofibrinogenemia may experience bleeding manifestations varying from mild to severe. This review focuses on the genetic bases of type I fibrinogen deficiencies, which are invariantly represented by mutations within the three fibrinogen genes (FGA, FGB, and FGG) coding for the three polypeptide chains Aα, B?, and ?. From the inspection of the mutational spectrum of these disorders, some conclusions can be drawn: (i) genetic defects are scattered throughout the three fibrinogen genes, with only few sites appearing to represent relative mutational hot spots; (ii) several different types of genetic lesions and pathogenic mechanisms have been described in affected individuals (including gross deletions, point mutations causing premature termination codons, missense mutations affecting fibrinogen assembly/secretion, and uniparental isodisomy associated with a large deletion); (iii) the possibility to express recombinant fibrinogen mutants in eukaryotic cells is rapidly shedding light into the molecular mechanisms responsible for physiologic and pathologic properties of the molecule; (iv) though mutation analysis of the fibrinogen cluster does not yield precise information for predicting genotype/phenotype correlations, it still provides a valuable tool for diagnosis confirmation, identification of potential carriers, and prenatal diagnosis.

AB  - Summary Background Acute-phase proteins may help assess the nature and severity of lesions and outcome in horses undergoing colic surgery. Objectives To compare serum amyloid A and plasma fibrinogen concentrations ([SAA] and [fibrinogen]) in the immediate post-operative period after exploratory celiotomy and determine their value in assessment of post-operative complications and survival to discharge. Study design Observational study. Methods This study included horses over 1 year of age undergoing exploratory celiotomy. Surgical procedures, lesions, post-operative care, complications and survival to discharge were recorded. [SAA] and [fibrinogen] were measured prior to surgery and 5 days post-operatively. Statistical analyses included Yate's Chi-square test, linear mixed effects model, Mann?Whitney U test and logistic regression. Results Of 300 horses, 52.0% developed post-operative complications and 83.7% survived to discharge, with significantly reduced chance of survival in horses that developed post-operative complications (P<0.01). Median [SAA] at days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and median [fibrinogen] at days 3, 4 and 5 were significantly different between horses that did and did not develop post-operative complications (P<0.05). Median [SAA] at days 1, 4 and 5 were significantly different between horses that did and did not survive to discharge (P<0.05). Logistic regression revealed post-operative complications to be associated with strangulating lesions (OR 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41?3.91, P≤0.001) and higher [fibrinogen] at admission (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00?1.45, P<0.05), and survival to discharge to be associated with lower [SAA] at 5 days post-operatively (OR 0.965, 95% CI 0.94?0.99, P = 0.002). Main limitations A large variety of lesions and complications prevented detailed analysis of associations between inflammatory markers, lesions and complications. Conclusions Horses that develop post-operative complications have acute-phase responses of greater magnitudes and durations compared with those that do not develop complications. This is also seen in horses that do not survive to discharge. Measuring [SAA] daily and [fibrinogen] at admission, may help predict the development of post-operative complications.

AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Fibrinogen replacement is critical in major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH). Purified, pasteurised fibrinogen concentrate appears to have benefit over cryoprecipitate in ease of administration and safety but is unlicensed in pregnancy. In July 2009, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service replaced cryoprecipitate with fibrinogen. Objectives To examine the impact of this externally imposed change on blood product use and clinical outcomes in MOH. Methods Women with MOH requiring fibrinogen between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2011 were identified from an MOH database. Aetiology of MOH, medical treatments, blood product use and clinical outcomes were compared between the cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen groups. Results Of 21 614 deliveries, 77 cases of MOH were identified. Of the 77 cases, 34 (44%) received cryoprecipitate (n?=?14) or fibrinogen concentrate (n?=?20). The mean (±SEM) dose utilised was 2·21 ± 0·35 pools of cryoprecipitate and 4 ± 0·8 g of fibrinogen. There was a stronger correlation between the increase in fibrinogen level and dose of fibrinogen (Pearson co-efficient 0·5; P?=?0·03) than dose of cryoprecipitate (Pearson co-efficient 0·32; P?=?0·3). Mean (±SEM) estimated blood loss (EBL), red cell concentrate (RCC) and Octaplas transfused were greater (but not significantly) in the cryoprecipitate group compared with the fibrinogen group; EBL?=?5·2 ± 1·1 vs 3·3 ± 0·5 L (P?=?0·1); RCC?=?7·2 ± 1·2 vs 5·9 ± 1·0 U (P?=?0·4); Octaplas?=?4·1 ± 0·7 vs 3·2 ± 0·7 U (P?=?0·36), respectively. Haemostasis was secured, and there were no adverse reactions or thrombotic complications. Conclusion Purified virally inactivated fibrinogen concentrate is as efficacious as cryoprecipitate in correcting hypofibrinogenaemia in MOH.

AB  - SUMMARY The use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in trauma patients is an exciting application because hemorrhage and coagulopathy play prominent roles both in the syndrome of severe hemorrhagic shock and in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anecdotal use of rFVIIa in non-hemophilic trauma patients extends back to 1999, and experience at individual institutions is now in the hundreds of cases. Efficacy in controlling traumatic coagulopathy approaches 80%, with long-term survival of about half of the patients treated. There have been few reports of inappropriate thrombotic events in trauma patients. A single prospective randomized study of rFVIIa in victims of hemorrhagic shock has been completed, with some favorable results. Further trials in hemorrhagic shock are underway in both European and American trauma centers, while a trial in TBI patients will begin within the coming year.

AB  - Trauma remains a major cause of death throughout the world, especially for patients younger than 45 years. Due to rapid advances in clinical management, both in the acute and prehospital settings, trauma patients survive devastating injuries at unprecedented rates. However, these patients can often face life threatening complications that stem from the robust innate immune response induced by severe hemorrhage, leading to further tissue injury rather than repair. The complement and coagulation cascades are key mediators in this disordered reaction, which includes the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy. There is increasing evidence that cross-talk between these two pathways allows rapid amplification of their otherwise targeted responses and contributes to overwhelming and prolonged systemic inflammation. In this article, we summarize the initial steps of innate immune response to trauma and review the complex complement and coagulation cascades, as well as how they interact with each other. Despite progress in understanding these cascades, effective therapeutic targets have yet to be found and further research is needed both to improve survival rates as well as decrease associated morbidity.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine if, amongst civilian trauma patients requiring massive transfusion (MT), the use of a formal trauma transfusion pathway (TTP), in comparison with transfusion without a TTP, is associated with a reduction in mortality, or changes in indices of coagulation, blood product utilisation and complications. A systematic review of three bibliographic databases, reference lists and conference proceedings was conducted. Studies were included if comparisons were made between patients receiving transfusion with and without a TTP. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers on population characteristics, transfusion strategies, blood product utilisation, indices of coagulation, clinical outcomes and complications. Data were pooled using a random effects model and heterogeneity explored. Seven observational studies met all eligibility criteria. Amongst 1801 patients requiring MT, TTPs were associated with a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·55, 0·87). No significant increase in the mean number of PRBC transfused between TTP and control patients was seen (MD ?1·17 95% CI ?2·70, 0·36). When studies assessing only trauma patients were considered, TTPs were associated with a reduction in the mean number of units of plasma transfused (MD ?2·63, 95% CI ?4·24, ?1·01). In summary, the use of TTPs appears to be associated with a reduction in mortality amongst trauma patients requiring MT without a clinically significant increase in the number of PRBC transfused and a potential reduction in plasma transfusion. Effects of TTPs on platelet transfusion, indices of coagulation and complications remain unclear. A randomised controlled trial is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Aim To test the null hypothesis of association between chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) and plasmatic levels of the C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen in a population of severely hypertensive patients. Methodology One hundred and seventy patients with severe refractory hypertension were selected. All patients were submitted to radiographic, clinical and periodontal evaluation. Plasmatic levels of CRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen were measured on the morning of the first periodontal appointment using commercially available kits. Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to appraise the effect of the co-variables on the plasmatic levels of the inflammatory markers assessed. Results Of the 170 subjects who participated, 105 (61.8%) were females and the median age of the participants was 53 years (range: 40?78). The adjusted multiple linear analyses demonstrated that plasmatic levels of CRP levels were associated with the body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.259, P < 0.001) and residual tooth roots (RTR) (r = 0.191, P = 0.041). IL-6 and fibrinogen levels showed associated with BMI (r = 0.400, P < 0.001 and r = 0.214, P = 0.002 respectively). CAP correlated weakly with CRP (r = 0.250, P = 0.005), IL-6 (r = 0.174, P = 0.020) and fibrinogen (r = 0.393, P < 0.001) levels. Conclusion The null hypothesis was rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis. In other words, the presence of chronic apical periodontitis was associated with higher plasmatic levels of CRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen, in a population of severely hypertensive patients. However, the weak association between CAP and each dependent variable suggests a modest participation of endodontic infection on the plasmatic levels of biomarkers.

AB  - Background and Objectives? The empiric use of a high plasma to packed red-blood-cell [fresh frozen plasma:red-blood-cells (FFP:RBC)] ratio in trauma resuscitation for patients with massive bleeding has become well accepted without clear or objective indications. Increased plasma transfusion is associated with worse outcome in some patient populations. While previous studies analyse only patients who received a massive transfusion, this study analyses those that are at risk to receive a massive transfusion, based on the trauma-associated severe haemorrhage (TASH) score, to objectively determine which patients after severe trauma would benefit or have increased complications by the use of a high FFP:RBC ratio. Methods? Multicentre retrospective study from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society. Multivariate logistic regression and statistical risk adjustments utilized in analyses. Results? A high ratio of FFP:RBC in the ≥15 TASH group was independently associated with survival, with an odds ratio of 2·5 (1·6?4·0), while the <15 TASH group was associated with increased multi-organ failure, 47% vs. 38%, (P?<?0·005). Conclusions? A predictive model of massive transfusion upon admission might be able to rapidly identify which severe trauma patients would benefit or have increased complications from the immediate application of a high ratio of FFP:RBCs. This study helps to identify the appropriate population for a prospective, interventional trial.

AB  - Abstract Fibrinogen Richfield exemplifies a dysfibrinogen associated with a life-long thrombotic tendency. The evaluation of this novel case indicates that, like similar thrombotic dysfibrinogenemias, the abnormal protein polymerizes abnormally and demonstrates impaired clot dissolution. A survey of other cases of dysfibrinogenemia indicates that the relatively common abnormalities of Fibrinopeptide A release are generally asymptomatic or associated with bleeding, polymerization abnormalities are likely to be asymptomatic or associated with thrombosis (or occasionally bleeding), and complex abnormalities or additional, independent hemostatic defects are rather common. Thrombin and Reptilase clotting times are not helpful in distinguishing between the subsets, but clinical history, fibrinopeptide release, and polymerization studies may be useful. Abnormalities of fibrinogen function tend to correlate with changes in molecular domains related to binding and hydrolysis.

AB  - Summary Pneumopericardium, the presence of air in the pericardial space, is a rare condition that has been well documented in human medicine and associated with several different aetiologies, most commonly trauma. We report a case of pneumopericardium after blunt chest trauma in an adult horse. The horse responded well to conservative therapy and made a full recovery.

AB  - Severely injured patients are at a risk of acute traumatic coagulopathy contributing to high mortally rates. The early use of tranexamic acid in this setting has been shown to be safe and improves survival. Optimal FFP: Red cell ratios needed with respect to outcomes are yet to be defined. Slow turnaround times associated with the use of laboratory based coagulation testing can lead to delays in appropriate component support with a need for validated algorithms for near patient global tests of haemostasis. Multidisciplinary protocols are required for managing traumatic haemorrhage with emphasis on good communication supported by training, audit and on-going review of cases to optimise patient care.

AB  - The Quebec platelet disorder is a serious bleeding disorder associated with proteolysis of α-granular proteins, including fibrinogen. We evaluated fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) assays as screening tests for this disorder. Patients with the Quebec platelet disorder (13/13) had elevated serum FDPs (P?<0.01) due to secreted degraded platelet fibrinogen, but normal plasma FDPs and D-dimers. Unrelated controls with bleeding disorders (32/34) had undetectable FDPs, and controls with FDPs due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and other illnesses (11/11) had elevated FDPs in all assays (P?<?0.01). Immunoblot analyses indicated plasma fibrinogen was normal in the Quebec patients and platelet FDPs were found in their platelet lysates, releasates and serum samples. Their platelet FDPs were not altered by treatment with fibrinolytic inhibitors and were different from the FDPs in DIC and in plasmin-digested fibrinogen. Tests for serum FDPs may provide a simple rapid way to screen for the Quebec platelet disorder.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The effectiveness of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) has been assumed from low quality studies with multiple biases. This review aimed to (i) evaluate the association between the institution of an MTP and mortality and (ii) determine the effect of MTPs on transfusion practice post trauma. Methods A systematic review of studies that examined patient outcomes before and after the institution of an MTP in the same centre was conducted. The design and results of each study were described. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes from each study were pooled. Results There were eight studies that satisfied inclusion criteria with marked heterogeneity in study populations (I2 = 72.1%, P = 0.001). Two studies showed significantly improved mortality following implementation of an MTP, and six studies showed no significant change. Pooled OR for the effect of an MTP on short-term mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.48?1.11). The effect of MTPs on transfusion practice was varied. Conclusion Despite the popularity of MTPs and directives mandating their use in trauma centres, in before?after studies, MTPs have not always been associated with improved mortality. Evidence-based standardization of MTPs, improved compliance and analysis of broader endpoints were identified as areas for further research.

AB  - Abstract Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increases the risk of mortality in trauma patients. To decrease the occurrence of VTE, low dose anticoagulants are commonly prescribed. This may be unacceptable in trauma patients who have a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be employed as an alternative strategy to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Insertion of an IVC filter is an invasive procedure that has a range of complications. The benefits of IVC filter insertion must be compared to its risk of complications in each individual patient. A search of the literature since 2005 was conducted on MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The clinical question posed was does prophylactic IVC filter insertion decrease the risk of PE in trauma patients? The available evidence was low level and unable to definitively answer this question. The majority of articles infer that IVC filter insertion is safe and may decrease the risk of PE. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to be conducted in this area.

AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.
