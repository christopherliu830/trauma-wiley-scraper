AB  - Objective To test the effect of pentoxifylline, a hemorheologic agent used to treat intermittent claudication, on the course of vascular dementia. Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Setting Outpatient tertiary care center. Patients 64 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for multi-infarct dementia with modified Hachinski ischemic scores ≥6, 38 of whom completed the trial. Intervention Pentoxifylline (Trental?) 400 milligram tablets three times daily vs placebo for 36 weeks. Main Outcome Measure Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS). Results Baseline demographic values and psychometric variables were similar in the placebo and control groups; endpoint statistical analysis was used to allow the use of data from all patients in this clinically high-risk group. For the total group, the slowing of deterioration did not reach statistical significance (by 2-tailed t test), as measured by scores on the total ADAS (P = 0.058) or on the cognitive (ADAS items 1?11; P = 0.064) or non-cognitive subscales (ADAS items 12?21; P = 0.234), although it was significant on the cognitive subscales excluding memory (ADAS items 2?6, 8?10; P = 0.036). For the subgroup of 40 patients who had CT and/or MRI evidence of stroke as well as meeting the other inclusion criteria, treatment with pentoxifylline was associated with significantly slower deterioration, as measured by the total ADAS (P = 0.023) and cognitive subscores (P = 0.020) but not non-cognitive subscores (P = 0.118). For the subgroup of 37 patients who had at least one discrete clinical stroke, treatment with pentoxifylline was associated with significantly less deterioration on the total ADAS (P = 0.002) and both the cognitive (P = 0.001) and non-cognitive (P = 0.017) subscores. Conclusion Treatment with pentoxifylline may slow the progression of dementia in patients who meet DSM-III criteria for ?multi-infarct dementia? and who also have clinical and neuroradiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease.

AB  - Vascular access thrombosis is a frequent complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Genetic mutations, inflammation, and changes in the vascular wall are some factors that are thought to increase thrombosis risk. In this study, we tested for possible relationships between vascular thrombosis and some known thrombophilic mutation/polymorphisms in coagulation factors [factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin (Pt) G20210A, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T), factor XIII (F-XIII) Val34Leu, alpha-fibrinogen (AF) Thr312Ala, factor VII (F-VII) R353Q] and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene in our HD patients. Patients who had experienced at least 3 episodes of AVF thrombosis composed of the study group, and patients who had never encountered this complication composed of the control group. None of the patients in either group had a history of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, dialysis-related amyloidosis, or vasculitis. In order to find the frequency of F-XIII Val34Leu, AF Thr312Ala, and F-VII R353Q polymorphisms in our population, we also searched persons without renal disease or history of thrombosis (normal group). Results are summarized in Table. There was a tendency toward thrombotic mutation/polymorphisms in the study group for FVL, Pt G20210A, ACE I/D, and AF Thr312Ala. We suggest that patients who develop recurrent AVF thrombosis should be screened for the above-mentioned factors and investigated for other possible risk factors. This screening would allow more effective focus on prophylaxis.

AB  - We have previously shown that resident fibroblasts from human chronic wounds are phenotypically abnormal, displaying an impaired response to TGF-beta 1, decreased TGF-beta Type II receptor expression, and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2, Smad3, and p42/44 MAPK. We now report that these human cells delay healing by approximately 30% when implanted in mouse incisional wounds and in a dorsal flap model. These new findings point to the need for the transplantation of new healthy cells in human chronic wounds. Bioengineered living skin constructs can deliver new cells to chronic wounds, at least for a limited period of time. However, most available bioengineered skin constructs consist of already differentiated allogeneic cells, which do not allow for the possibility of engraftment and reconstitution of wound structures. Recently, in a preliminary report, we have shown that autologous bone marrow-derived cells can dramatically enhance the healing of recalcitrant chronic wounds when all other treatments have failed. Our present efforts are now focused on characterizing the bone marrow cells involved in this stimulation of wound healing and in developing better ways for their topical delivery to the wound. Here we present evidence that a fibrin construct may be an ideal way of applying bone marrow-derived cells to human chronic wounds. Autologous bone marrow cells are allowed to grow in culture under conditions favoring the survival and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), as shown by surface markers and functional studies. This usually requires two weeks after bone marrow harvesting. The cellular component is then placed in a fibrinogen solution which, when simultaneously combined with thrombin through a CO2 driven flow, delivers a fine cell-containing fibrin polymer film to the wound. In vitro and in vivo experiments, both in mouse models and in human wounds, show the feasibility of this approach.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes various abdominal vein thromboses, their clinical implications, and strategies of treatment. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that includes hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome, BCS), portal (PVT), splenic and mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT). The optimal management of SVT requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes hepatologists, experts on thrombosis, radiologists and surgeons. In the paediatric population, renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the most prevalent non catheter-related thrombosis during the neonatal period. For patients with RVT, a medical therapy, instead of a surgical approach (thrombectomy or nephrectomy), is recommended. Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition most commonly diagnosed in the post-partum period. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are generally recommended for 3-6 months in the presence of transient risk factors, whereas a prolonged duration is suggested for idiophatic OVT, cancer-related OVT, and in patients with severe thrombophilia abnormalities.

AB  - Summary A 25-year-old mare was examined for persistent colic. Over the previous month, the mare had experienced several episodes of mild recurrent colic. The episode of colic persisted for 18 h and the pain became unresponsive to analgesic therapy. Euthanasia was undertaken. Post mortem examination revealed an atypical infiltrative lipoma of the mesojejunum, confirmed histopathologically. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report of a diffuse infiltrative lipoma of the equine mesojejunum.

AB  - Summary In the hemophilias or other congenital clotting deficiencies, either acute or chronic hemorrhage in vulnerable anatomic locations can produce a hematologic emergency. In virtually every instance, replacement of the relevant missing clotting factor or cells (platelets) should follow immediately critical initial cardiovascular or respiratory resuscitation measures. A history of recent trauma should increase the hematologists' index of suspicion but the absence of such a history should not eliminate the possibility of injury-induced bleeding in these populations. Surgical management may need to follow resuscitation and factor replacement if organ compromise cannot be prevented by these initial therapeutic interventions. In the latter circumstances, clotting factor replacement strategies will likely need to be continued until homeostasis is achieved and requisite healing is well underway. Occult hemorrhage that progresses may produce emergent circumstances particularly in the central nervous system and nearby to the airway. Therefore, mainstays of emergent management for inherited bleeding disorders include a cautious expectancy that the status quo may not assure adequate management and vigilance that bleeding may return insidiously.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Comparative surgical audit is increasingly important, although fraught due to the difficulty of risk adjusted analysis. The surgical risk score was developed to provide surgeon-independent risk-adjusted mortality in general surgery using readily available clinical indices (CEPOD grade of operative urgency, BUPA grade of operative magnitude and ASA grade of patient comorbidities). Methods: Prospective data collection from 4308 patients admitted under the care of three general surgeons (May 1997?October 1999) created an initial data set of 3144 procedures with 134 deaths. Each procedure was scored by summation of linear scales allocated to CEPOD, BUPA and ASA grades to devise a surgical risk scale (SRS) ranging from 3 to 14. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis involving the three variables and uni-variate analysis of the SRS scores were undertaken. Receiver operating characteristic and calibration curves were formulated. This process was validated on another data set (2780 patients) derived from all admissions to the same surgeons (November 1999?December 2000). Results: Uni-variate logistic analysis of the SRS score revealed it to be significantly predictive of death (? = 0.84, P < 0.001). The SRS score did not over predict mortality for low risk procedures. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.931 for the initial data set and 0.951 for the validation set. Conclusion: The SRS is easy to use, formulate and interpret. It has been validated as a tool for risk-adjusted comparative audit in a population of general surgical patients.

AB  - Summary There are several differences in treatment of neonatal foals with antimicrobials, compared to mature horses. Firstly, the dose of many antimicrobials is different in the foal. For orally administered drugs, this may also affect their efficacy, due to different enteral absorption. Secondly, neonatal foals are not yet hindgut fermentors and this allows antimicrobials with a high propensity to cause colitis in mature horses to be used. Thirdly, toxicities are different and some antimicrobials used in mature horses, such as enrofloxacin, are not suitable for use in foals. Foal-specific information is therefore needed for their safe and effective treatment with antimicrobials.

AB  - Abstract Several focal skeletal muscle diseases, including tumours and trauma lead to a limited loss of functional muscle tissue. There is still no suitable clinical approach for treating such defects. A promising approach could be the tissue engineering of skeletal muscle. However, a clinically reliable differentiation stimulus for three-dimensional (3-D) cultures is necessary for this process, and this condition has not yet been established. In order to qunantify and analyze the differentiation potential of electrical cell stimulation, primary myoblasts were stimulated within a 3-D fibrin-matrix. Gene expression of MyoD, myogenin and AChR were measured by real-time RT-PCR over a time period of eight days, showing immediate down-regulation of all marker genes. For tissue engineering approaches, cell multiplication is crucial for acquisition of sufficient tissue volumes for reconstruction. Therefore, all experiments were performed with high and low passaged myoblasts, demonstrating higher transcript rates of marker genes in lowpassage cells. Our findings strongly suggest a reconsideration of electrical stimulation in muscle tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract The receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand binding protein that was initially described as an AGEs-binding protein. Other proteins, some of them classified as danger signals or alarmins have been described as RAGE ligands. Of note, RAGE shares some of its ligands with some member of the Toll-like receptor family. Once RAGE is engaged by any of its ligands, the receptor is able to trigger robust pro-inflammatory cellular responses. At present, RAGE has emerged as a relevant actor in the onset and development of chronic inflammation, which underlies many human diseases. Key Concepts The receptor of advanced glycation end products is a multi-ligand receptor. RAGE variants are mainly originated by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage. RAGE and TLRs share common ligands and signalling pathways. RAGE activation is associated with activation of pro-inflammatory signalling. RAGE activation by AGEs play a key a role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Most of the misfolded proteins linked to neurodegeneration act as RAGE ligands. RAGE activation plays a key role in the disturbance of endothelial functions and cardiovascular homeostasis. RAGE has been regarded as the bridge association between chronic inflammation and cancer. RAGE activation in tumour cells promotes proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis.

AB  - Summary The components and reactions of the fibrinolysis system are well understood. The pathway has fewer reactants and interactions than coagulation, but the generation of a complete quantitative model is complicated by the need to work at the solid-liquid interface of fibrin. Diagnostic tools to detect disease states due to malfunctions in the fibrinolysis pathway are also not so well developed as is the case with coagulation. However, there are clearly a number of inherited or acquired pathologies where hyperfibrinolysis is a serious, potentially life-threatening problem and a number of antifibrinolytc drugs are available to treat hyperfibrinolysis. These topics will be covered in the following review.
