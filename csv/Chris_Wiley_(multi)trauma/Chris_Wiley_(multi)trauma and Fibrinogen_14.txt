AB  - Neuropathy, mechanical stress, and macrovascular disease are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulceration. Implicit in the development of gangrene and ulceration is the recognition that these factors interact with the microcirculation, resulting in the failure of skin capillary flow to meet nutritive requirements. There is little evidence to associate structural microangiopathy with foot microcirculatory failure. Significant functional abnormalities of the microcirculation have been defined. In accord with the haemodynamic hypothesis early hyperaemia and capillary hypertension promote more sinister late functional abnormalities with increasing duration of diabetes. These late functional abnormalities include loss of autoregulation and reduced hyperaemic responses which interact with loss of neurogenic flow regulation, disturbed endothelial function, and abnormal rheology to produce the familiar clinical picture of the diabetic foot. Ischaemia secondary to multi-segment arterial disease induces additional abnormalities of microcirculatory function which are superimposed on the pre-existing diabetic microvascular structural and functional microangiopathy.

AB  - Summary Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding usually presents with haematemesis or melaena, but should be considered in any patient with unexplained hypotension or syncope, or decompensated chronic liver disease. In patients with severe upper GI bleeding, a good outcome requires vigorous resuscitation, and close collaboration with medical, endoscopic, radiological and surgical teams: it is important to involve these specialists as early as possible to discuss the management plan. Urgent endoscopy is needed for patients with shock on admission, with known varices or signs of chronic liver disease, or evidence of continued bleeding. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be stopped/reversed, if the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks: for patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve, recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary stents, discuss this with a cardiologist. Patients with low-risk peptic ulcer bleeding based on clinical and endoscopic criteria (e.g. clean ulcer base) can be discharged on the same day as endoscopy.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate efficacy of hypotonic water as adjuvant therapy after marginal resection of canine mast cell tumors (MCT). Study Design? Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized study. Animals? Dogs (n=30) with spontaneous, cutaneous, solitary MCT. Methods? The wound bed of MCT, resected with margins <0.5?cm, was injected with either hypotonic or isotonic water according to a standardized protocol. Follow-up was obtained by clinical examination at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months and annual telephone contact with the owner. Results? Eighteen dogs were treated with isotonic lactated Ringer's solution and 12 dogs with hypotonic distilled water. All MCT were stage 0 tumors and most grade II. Six tumors (4 isotonic, 2 hypotonic) recurred locally, 3 of these dogs died from disease-related reasons within 4 months. The surviving 3 dogs were alive with a median survival time (ST) of 1092 days. The calculated 2-year recurrence-free rate was 92.7%; the 2-year disease-free rate 79.1%; and the 2-year survival rate 89.5%. No significant differences in local recurrence and ST were observed between treatment groups. Histologic grading was the only significant prognosticator for ST and recurrence-free periods. Conclusion? No significant differences in local recurrence and ST were observed between adjunctive hypotonic water and placebo treatment after marginal resection of solitary MCT. Clinical Relevance? Hypotonic water does not decrease the rate of local recurrence in dogs with solitary MCT after marginal surgical excision.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) are increasingly-recognized health conditions in children, with both acute and chronic sequelae. Risk factors for, and pathogenesis of, VTE are readily related to three principal factors, consisting of venous stasis, endothelial damage, and the hypercoagulable state (i.e. thrombophilia), termed the triad of Virchow. In children, greater than 90% of VTE are provoked by an overt clinical risk factor, the most common of which is a central venous catheter. Risk factors for childhood-onset (beyond the neonatal period) AIS include sickle cell disease, infection, cerebral arteriopathy, and congenital cardiac disease. In perinatal AIS, risk factors are less well-defined, and have been hypothesized to include maternal-fetal conditions. While some acquired and inherited thrombophilias have been associated with increased risk of incident and/or recurrent VTE and AIS, knowledge of other diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of VTE/AIS in children remains quite limited. To date, very few published studies have employed plasma mass spectrometry-based ?omics? approaches (proteomics, lipidomics or metabolomics). Ongoing and future research efforts involving multicenter prospective study-derived plasma biobanks in pediatric VTE (such as the Kids-DOTT trial) and AIS (including VIPS) along with new multi-omics-compatible sample processing methods offer fertile opportunities for discovery and validation of both novel risk factors and prognostic markers, with great potential to achieve improved prognostic stratification in these diseases.

AB  - Summary Infants of birth weight ≤2500?g are termed low birth weight (LBW). These children often have considerable morbidity from prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction. Additionally, LBW infants have increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac congenital anomalies and may require surgery. Primary rather than palliative surgical repair of cardiac lesions has been preferred in recent years. However, LBW remains a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity after open-heart surgery (OHS). There is a paucity of information about the anesthetic challenges presented by LBW infants undergoing OHS. This review summarizes the perioperative issues of relevance to anesthesiologists who manage these high-risk patients. Emphasis is placed on management concerns that are unique to LBW infants. Retrospective data from the authors? institution are provided for those aspects of anesthetic care that lack published studies. Successful outcome often requires substantial hospital resources and collaborative multi-disciplinary effort.

AB  - Summary Thromboelastography (TEG) was first described by Hartert in 1948, and was designed to monitor viscoelastic clot strength in whole blood in real time. The current TEG method and Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were subsequently developed from the original principles. Both of the modern methods provide data by measuring changes in the viscoelastic strength of a small sample of clotting blood in response to a constant rotational force. The important advantage of these techniques is to visually observe and quantify blood coagulation including the propagation, stabilization and dissolution phases of clot formation under low shear conditions. Analysis of the results provides detailed kinetic data on fibrin generation, clot strength and fibrinolysis. These TEG/ROTEM analyses therefore enable evaluation of global clotting function and the monitoring of haemostatic treatment in various clinical situations, not only in patients with genetic bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia, but also in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, liver transplantation or suffering from traumatic injury. Some evidence suggests that haemostatic management using TEG/ROTEM leads to a reduction in total transfusions of whole blood or clotting factors. Wider clinical application of this technology seems likely.

It provides an overview of specific medical considerations involved with dental diagnosis and treatment of this ?at risk population.? The role of oral inflammation is referenced within the context of the oral/systemic paradigm (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease/stroke, respiratory diseases, and cognition). Oral manifestations associated with multi-organ diseases, tobacco/alcohol use, and medications are additionally discussed. Finally, the paper encourages development of interdisciplinary approaches to positively influence health outcomes.

AB  - Abstract We investigated whether there is an association between factor V Leiden (FVL) and/or prothrombin gene G20210A mutation (PT20210A) and cerebral thromboembolism in a pediatric Argentinean population. From May 1992 to January 2002, 44 consecutive children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) and 23 children with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (SVT) were prospectively studied at a single center. The prevalence of both mutations was compared with a 102 age-matched controls. In children with AIS, the frequencies (patients vs. controls), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the presence of FVL were as follows: 2.3% vs. 2%, OR/95% CI, 1.16/0.2 to 13.2; P value = 0.99. No cases of PT20210A were found in this group. In children with SVT, the frequencies (patients vs. controls), OR, and 95% CI were as follows: FVL (4.3% vs. 2%, OR/95% CI, 2.27/0.22 to 6.2; P value = 0.99) and PT20210A (4.3% vs. 1%; OR/95% CI, 4.6/0.3 to 76.3; P value = 0.3354). One child with PT20210A also had an inherited protein C deficiency. In 12 (18%) out of the 67 children with cerebral thromboembolism, without the aforementioned mutations, other prothrombotic disorders were detected. Although a multi-center prospective study with a large number of Argentinean pediatric patients is needed to obtain considerable evidence, no association between factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin gene G20210A mutation and cerebral thromboembolism was found in this pediatric series.

The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

A 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding (Case 2) was evaluated for respiratory stertor and severe, acute swelling of the head in the submandibular region. A physical examination, complete blood count, blood chemistry, upper airway endoscopy, and peripheral blood Anaplasma phagocytophilum polymerase chain reaction were completed for both horses. Both horses tested positive for A. phagocytophilum. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 1 revealed a feed contaminated pharynx, absent swallowing reflex, and left laryngeal hemiplagia. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 2 revealed severe diffuse pharyngeal swelling occluding the airway. Due to increased respiratory effort in Case 2, a tracheotomy was performed. In both horses, treatment consisted of intravenous oxytetracycline 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 2?3 days followed by minocycline 4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h for 10?14 days. Both horses made full recoveries.

AB  - Background Heterophilic antibodies are still an important source of interference in immunoassays, but reports of interference with D-dimers are rare. Are D-dimer level abnormalities, found in the clinic, caused by heterophilic antibodies as well, or are other mechanisms involved? We will elaborate on this issue through two different examples in this article. Methods Serum from two patients with significantly elevated levels of D-dimers were measured and compared by different methods, diluted, and dealt with heterophilic antibody blockers. At the same time, to retrieve the interference, we focused on the cause of D-dimer false positives and made a systematic review of the literature. Results The D-dimer values were normal (0.49 and 0.15 ?g/mL) detected with different testing method and decreased after addition of heterophilic antibody blocking reagent. According to literature data, there were 66.7% (4/6) references showed the interference were heterophilic antibody. Conclusions The influence of heterophilic antibodies on the measurement of D-dimers remains a big challenge. Different measuring instruments and methods may have significant differences in the measurement of D-dimers. By using a combination of instrumental methods for measuring, incorporating heterophilic antibody blockers, and combining with clinical performance and imaging data, most of the interference can be eliminated.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Summary This study reports the use of parathyroid hormone fragment peptide 1-34 (PTH1-34) cross-linked to a hydrogel in a fibrin base for the treatment of subchondral cyst-like lesions (SCLs). The objectives were to determine the clinical and radiographic outcome of 28 horses with lameness attributable to one or two SCLs treated locally with one of three different concentrations of PTH1-34 and to identify which concentration produces the best results. Twenty-eight horses (34 SCLs) were treated surgically by debriding the content of the SCL and injecting different concentrations (0.1, 0.4, or 1 mg/mL) of PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel into the cavity. Treatment was considered successful if the horse was sound 12 months after treatment. The mean age of the horses was 7.2 years. Treatment was successful in 22 (78.6%) horses and improved the radiographic appearance of 27 (79.4%) SCLs. The outcome was not affected by age of the horse or by the number of SCLs (1 or 2) per horse. PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel administered into the SCL after surgical debridement of the lesion appears to be an effective treatment for horses with one or two SCLs. A PTH1-34 concentration of 0.4 mg/mL may be slightly superior to concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/mL in resolving SCLs.

AB  - Summary The priority in treating the equine patient with acute diarrhoea is to stabilise the haemodynamic aberrations secondary to the fluid and electrolyte losses. Once this has been initiated and the patient is stabilised ancillary treatments may be beneficial. Besides the well established effects of NSAIDs and polymixin B on systemic inflammation, recent studies suggest that the use of DTOS to bind bacterial toxins and Saccharomyces boulardii to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea may be beneficial. The justification for using probiotic products is scant. There is no evidence to suggest that systemic use of antimicrobials benefits equine patients with colitis, with the exception of metronidazole in cases of clostridial diarrhoea. In light of their potentially detrimental effects, their use can, in the opinion of the authors, not be advocated. Better understanding of the pathways of systemic inflammation and more selective anti-inflammatory drugs may be of great benefit in the future.
