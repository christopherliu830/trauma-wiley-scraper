AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review the hemostasis literature relevant to development of coagulopathy in the critically ill equine patient. Data Source ? Original scientific and review articles. Human Data Synthesis ? Inflammation plays a critical role in the activation and amplification of clot formation, as well as the impairment of physiologic anticoagulant mechanisms, and fibrinolysis. Earlier identification of coagulopathy in patients at risk and restoration of physiologic hemostasis may result in better outcome. Development of scoring systems based on information other than coagulation markers alone may better identify patients with subclinical coagulopathy. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Critically ill equine patients commonly at risk for coagulopathy include those with severe gastrointestinal disease, septic foals, and adults subjected to severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Publications provide information regarding coagulation markers helpful for identification of hemostatic dysfunction in specific patient populations, as well as information regarding the influence of coagulopathy on outcome. Data regarding clinically relevant information on therapeutic intervention are lacking. Conclusions ? The relationship between inflammation and endotoxemia and development of coagulopathy is better understood in both human patients and the critically ill equine patient. Prospective clinical trials evaluating clinically relevant and financially feasible approaches to treatment are still needed.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Double layer dermal substitute (DS) consist of a 3-dimensional collagen structures and a superficial silicon layer that are positioned within the defect provide to promote tissue regeneration in skin wounds. DS often have unique physical characteristics due to differences in manufacturing techniques. The aim of this study is the clinical and histological comparison of Nevelia and Integra double layer DSs in patients with post-traumatic injury wounds. Thirty patients with post-traumatic wounds localised on the inferior limbs were randomised in 2 groups Nevelia or Integra, followed by autologous dermal epidermal graft (DEG). Clinical results were evaluated through the healing time; Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 1, 2, and 3 weeks and after 1 and 3 years. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation were performed at 0, 2, and 3 weeks. The difference in healing time between groups (P?=?.467, log-rank test), pain and self-estimation was not statistically significant after 35, 42, and 49 days and at 1-year follow up. Histological data showed evident healing of wound after 2 weeks compared with preoperative with both DSs. At 3 weeks reepithelialisation and dermal regeneration were evident with both substitutes; however Nevelia showed early regenerative properties in terms of epidermal proliferation and dermal renewal compared with Integra. Nevelia showed also a more evident angiogenesis vs Integra evaluated as α-SMA immunohistochemistry. Differences in the MSS score were statistically significant at 3 years follow up in favour of Nevelia group (P?=?.001). At long-term follow up, Nevelia showed a better clinical outcome measured as MSS score vs Integra measured as MSS. Histological and immunohistochemistry data showed that Nevelia allows faster neoangiogenesis and tissue regeneration with neoformed tissue architecture closer to the physiology of the skin.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Summary Iron is of key importance for aerobic metabolism, and natural feeds of the horse are fairly rich sources of iron. Accordingly, the known incidence of iron deficiency anaemia is apparently rare in performance horses; despite this, iron deficiency in performance horses continues to be of concern to trainers and veterinarians. Effects of exercise on plasma ferritin concentrations were therefore studied in Standardbreds, Finnhorses and half-bred riding horses. Blood samples were taken after a moderate exercise test on a racetrack, a competition exercise test on a treadmill and a race. Even moderate exercise caused an increase in plasma ferritin concentration, with the increase being greater as the intensity and duration of exercise increased. Return to the basal level was slower after maximal-intensity exercise than after moderate exercise. In conclusion, although ferritin is a useful marker of low iron stores, samples should be taken only after at least 2 days rest following strenuous exercise.

AB  - Abstract Advances in interventional radiology and surgical techniques now allow complex abdominal diseases to be more successfully treated in small animals. Abdominal vascular alterations, acquired as individual process or as complication of other lesions such as neoplasia, can be life-threatening or at least greatly limit curative interventions of underlying diseases. Computed tomography (CT) and high-definition ultrasonography are now readily available in veterinary referral centers. Yet, there is little information currently available on the use of these modalities for the diagnosis and characterization of these vascular alterations. The purpose of this article is to review the CT and ultrasonographic findings of acquired vascular diseases in the abdomen of dogs and cats, using both the veterinary and human medicine literature as references, and highlighting essential concepts through figures.

AB  - Summary Despite current recommendations on the management of severe peri-operative bleeding, there is no pragmatic guidance for the peri-operative monitoring and management of cardiac surgical patients taking direct oral anticoagulants. Members of the Transfusion and Haemostasis Subcommittee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology, of their own volition, performed an independent systematic review of peer-reviewed original research, review articles and case reports and developed the following consensus statement. This has been endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology. In our opinion, most patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy presenting for elective cardiac surgery can be safely managed in the peri-operative period if the following conditions are fulfilled: direct oral anticoagulants have been discontinued two days before cardiac surgery, corresponding to five elimination half-live periods; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or a high risk of bleeding, a pre-operative plasma level of direct oral anticoagulants has been determined and found to be below 30 ng.ml?1 (currently only valid for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban). In cases where plasma level monitoring is not possible (e.g. assay was not available), discontinuation for 10 elimination half-live periods (four days) is required. For FXa inhibitors, a standard heparin-calibrated anti-Xa level of < 0.1 IU.ml?1 should be measured, indicating sufficient reduction in the anticoagulant effect. Finally, short-term bridging with heparin is not required in the pre-operative period.

AB  - Summary: Background: To evaluate the biocompatibility of surgical mesh, explanted mesh samples were collected and analysed. ?Methods: All mesh specimens (N?= 347) underwent a detailed clinical work-up and morphological study by conventional light microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry. ?Results: The mean implantation interval for all mesh samples was approximately 24 months; the reason for explantation in the present data pool included complications such as recurrence (mean 63?%), chronic pain (mean 30?%), infection (mean 21?%) or fistula formation (mean 7?%). All mesh types in this particular database exhibited no significant differences in recurrence rates and infection, but significant differences in chronic pain. Here, the low-weight mesh Vypro? seems to have advantages over heavy-weight mesh modifications. Moreover, histological examination in all specimens revealed a typical foreign body reaction depending on the polymer and the mesh features such as pore size and surface area. ?Conclusions: Hernia repair with surgical mesh may be complicated by recurrence, chronic pain and infection including fistula formation in the long-term follow-up. The main differences between single-mesh modifications were found in chronic pain. Here, low-weight mesh constructions should show improved patient comfort.

AB  - Adsorption of polymer molecules under flow conditions governs a broad range of desired or undesired phenomena and has a broad range of applications. Microfluidic platforms integrated with analytical instrumentation offer the capability to study polymer adsorption in flow in a time- and labour-efficient manner. Precise control of the microchannel dimensions and flow parameters enables accurate control of shear forces imposed on polymer solutions and on the molecules deposited on the surface, along with high sensitivity, enhanced reliability, and low reagent consumption. This review highlights recent advances in theoretical and experimental microfluidic studies of polymer immobilization under flow conditions in three area, namely, biosensing, biofouling, and studies of thrombosis and hemostasis.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Abstract Glomerular crescents are most common in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis but also occur in non-inflammatory chronic glomerulopathies; thus, factors other than inflammation should trigger crescent formation, eg vascular damage and plasma leakage. Here we report that Alport nephropathy in Col4A3-deficient Sv129 mice is complicated by diffuse and global crescent formation in which proliferating parietal epithelial cells are the predominant cell type. Laminin staining and transmission and acellular scanning electron microscopy of acellular glomeruli documented disruptions and progressive disintegration of the glomerular basement membrane in Col4A3-deficient mice. FITC-dextran perfusion further revealed vascular leakage from glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space, further documented by fibrin deposits in the segmental crescents. Its pathogenic role was validated by showing that the fibrinolytic activity of recombinant urokinase partially prevented crescent formation. In addition, in vitro studies confirmed an additional mitogenic potential of serum on murine and human parietal epithelial cells. Furthermore, loss of parietal cell polarity and unpolarized secretion of extracellular matrix components were evident within fibrocellular crescents. Among 665 human Alport nephropathy biopsies, crescent formation was noted in 0.4%. We conclude that glomerular vascular injury and GBM breaks cause plasma leakage which triggers a wound healing programme involving the proliferation of parietal cells and their loss of polarity. This process can trigger cellular and fibrocellular crescent formation even in the absence of cellular inflammation and rupture of the Bowman's capsule.

AB  - The blood coagulation balance in the organism is achieved by the interaction of the blood platelets (PLTs) with the plasma coagulation system (PCS) and the vascular endothelial cells. In healthy organism, these systems prevent thrombosis and, in events of vascular damage, enable blood clotting to stop bleeding. The dysregulation of hemostasis may cause serious thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic pathologies. Numerous engineered nanomaterials are being investigated for biomedical purposes and are unavoidably exposed to the blood. Also, nanomaterials may access vascular system after occupational, environmental, or other types of exposure. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the effects of engineered nanomaterials on hemostasis. This review focuses on investigations of nanomaterial interactions with the blood components involved in blood coagulation: the PCS and PLTs. Particular emphases include the pathophysiology of effects of nanomaterials on the PCS, including the kallikrein-kinin system, and on PLTs. Methods for investigating these interactions are briefly described, and a review of the most important studies on the interactions of nanomaterials with plasma coagulation and platelets is provided.
