AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Objective To compare surgical trauma, perioperative pain, surgical time, and complication rate in mares undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy by natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopy. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Healthy mares (n = 12). Methods Ovariectomy was performed with a vessel-sealing device by transvaginal NOTES (n = 6) using a flexible endoscope and specialized instruments or by bilateral flank laparoscopy (n = 6). Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - Summary Inflammation has been recently implicated in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to examine the variation of inflammatory indexes during the first week after successful electrical cardioversion of persistent AF. Successive measurements of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels were performed in 30 cardioverted patients. At the end of the 7-day follow-up period, AF had recurred in 30% of patients. A significant variance was found in serial measurements of fibrinogen levels in the two groups (non-relapse and relapse, p?=?0.005). Fibrinogen levels increased significantly in patients who relapsed into AF, but remained stable in patients who remained in sinus rhythm. In the latter patients, CRP values tended to decrease post-cardioversion, but WBC count was significantly lower (p?<?0.001) on the 7th day (6083?±?1335), compared with baseline values (6648?±?1395). The variation of inflammatory indices post-cardioversion might have prognostic implications with regard to sinus rhythm maintenance.

AB  - ABSTRACT Blood platelets prevent bleeding after trauma by forming occlusive aggregates at sites of vascular injury. Platelet aggregation is mediated by the integrin heterodimer αIIb?3 and occurs when platelet agonists generated at the injury site convert αIIb?3 from its resting to its active conformation. Active αIIb?3 is then able to bind macromolecular ligands such as fibrinogen that crosslink adjacent platelets into hemostatic aggregates. Platelets circulate in a plasma milieu containing high concentrations of the principal αIIb?3 ligand fibrinogen. Thus, αIIb?3 activity is tightly regulated to prevent the spontaneous formation of platelet aggregates. αIIb?3 activity is regulated at least three levels. First, intramolecular interactions involving motifs located in the membrane-proximal stalk regions, transmembrane domains, and the membrane-proximal cytosolic tails of αIIb and ?3 maintain αIIb?3 in its inactive conformation. Transmembrane domain interactions appear particularly important because disrupting these interactions causes constitutive αIIb?3 activation. Second, the agonist-stimulated binding of the cytosolic proteins talin and kindlin-3 to the ?3 cytosolic tail rapidly causes αIIb?3 activation by disrupting the intramolecular interactions constraining αIIb?3 activity. Third, the strength of ligand binding to active αIIb?3 seems to be allosterically regulated. Thus, αIIb?3 exists in a minimum of three interconvertible states: an inactive (resting) state that does not interact with ligands and two active ligand binding states that differ in their affinity for fibrinogen and in the mechanical stability of fibrinogen complexes they form. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - SUMMARY Massive transfusion or major haemorrhage protocols have been widely adopted in the treatment of critically bleeding patients. Following evidence that higher ratios of transfused plasma and platelets to red blood cells may offer survival benefits in military trauma patients, these ratios are now commonly incorporated into massive transfusion protocols. They more closely resemble the effects of whole blood transfusion, which in the second half of last century was largely replaced by individual blood component transfusion based on laboratory-guided indicators. However, high-quality evidence to guide transfusion support for critically bleeding patients across the range of bleeding contexts is lacking, including for both trauma and non-trauma patients. More data on major haemorrhage support and clinical outcomes are needed to inform guidelines and practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Patients with severe, multiple, traumatic injuries are challenging to manage in critical care. Early identification of injuries and optimal resuscitation is essential for favourable outcomes. Trauma-related haemorrhage can lead to the lethal triad of hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis. Many trauma patients require urgent haemorrhage control and structural fixation through operative intervention. However, metabolic derangement and cardiovascular instability may delay surgery, resulting in an ongoing cycle of deterioration. Damage control surgery (DCS) may be used as a temporizing measure until the patient is stabilized in critical care. The aim of this case study is to discuss the complex issues faced in the critical care management of a severely injured patient. Design We conducted a patient case study, with analysis of care using published evidence. The key terms used to search for evidence were trauma, injury, damage control surgery, spinal fixation, critical/intensive care and nurse. Results We report the care of a trauma patient with complex, conflicting injuries requiring management of the lethal triad and DCS. The delay in subsequent definitive repair of spinal column fractures provided many challenges for critical care nurses including restricted patient mobilization, positioning and pressure ulcer prevention. A review of contemporary evidence relating to DCS reveals that whilst this technique is used increasingly in trauma, the research focuses on single system injuries. Conclusion Evidence and guidelines are required to support DCS for critical care patients with multiple, conflicting injuries including spinal fractures. For patients with delayed surgical intervention, rotational bed therapy may assist critical care nurses in meeting needs.

AB  - Summary We report four years of observational data from a large UK hospital and tertiary referral unit, following the introduction of a rotational thromboelastometry-guided algorithm for treatment of coagulopathy in major obstetric haemorrhage. Fibrinogen concentrate was used to treat acquired hypofibrinogenaemia as defined by a FibTEM A5 value of < 7 mm, or 7?12 mm with ongoing or high risk of haemorrhage. Of 32,647 deliveries over 4 years, 893 (2.7%) women had an estimated blood loss ≥ 1500 ml. Two-hundred and three (23%) of these had a FibTEM A5 ≤ 12 mm and 110 received fibrinogen concentrate. We compared clinical outcomes and blood product use with 52 patients who met the same criteria, over a 12-month pre-intervention period during which shock packs were used. In the algorithm group, there was a significant reduction in the number of units (p < 0.0001) and total volume (p = 0.0007) of blood products transfused, with a reduction in transfusion-associated circulatory overload (p = 0.002). Women with placental abruption exhibited more severe coagulopathy and required higher doses of fibrinogen concentrate than women who bled due to other causes. Analysis of rotational thromboelastometry results demonstrated that coagulopathy is not observed in all women who suffer obstetric haemorrhage and cannot be predicted solely by blood loss. Therefore, formulaic treatment with blood products is not justified. When coagulopathy does occur, it appears to be multifactorial and can be severe. Point-of-care testing allows early identification and individualised treatment of coagulopathy. This is supported by the improved outcomes reported.

AB  - Abstract Aims To examine the efficacy of using fibrin glue (FG) as an interpositioning layer in the repair of complicated vesioovaginal fistulae (VVFe) as compared to the classical repair using martius flaps (Ml?). Methods The study was conducted in 3 African institutions. Forty female patients with complicated VVFs were randomized into 2 groups. Group A were repaired anatomically using PG as interpositioning layer. Group B were repaired anatomically using MF as an interpositioning layer. FG used in this study was prepared from patients own blood. Complicating factors were recurrence, local moderate lo severe fibrosis, fistula location involving the bladder neck, and or size of the fistola being more than 1.5 cm in its largest diameter. Patients were evaluated after 2 weeks, one month and 3 months postoperatively. Results Thirty eight patients were evaluable as 2 patients, one from each group, lost to follow-up. Patient demographics were not different between the two study groups. The frequency of occurrence of complicating factors was not different between the 2 groups. Thirteen of group A and eleven from group B were rendered dry and that was maintained for as long as they were followed-up. The difference in the outcome was not statistically significant. Conclusion The use of FG as an interpositioning layer during the vaginal anatomical repair of complicated VVF appears to be of great value as an alternative to the use of MF interpositioning. Decreasing the operative time and adding simplicity to the already complicated procedure are additional values of using this procedure. Neurourol. Urodynam. 28:438?441, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Extensive loss of skeletal muscle tissue results in mutilations and severe loss of function. In vitro-generated artificial muscles undergo necrosis when transplanted in vivo before host angiogenesis may provide oxygen for fibre survival. Here, we report a novel strategy based upon the use of mouse or human mesoangioblasts encapsulated inside PEG-fibrinogen hydrogel. Once engineered to express placental-derived growth factor, mesoangioblasts attract host vessels and nerves, contributing to in vivo survival and maturation of newly formed myofibres. When the graft was implanted underneath the skin on the surface of the tibialis anterior, mature and aligned myofibres formed within several weeks as a complete and functional extra muscle. Moreover, replacing the ablated tibialis anterior with PEG-fibrinogen-embedded mesoangioblasts also resulted in an artificial muscle very similar to a normal tibialis anterior. This strategy opens the possibility for patient-specific muscle creation for a large number of pathological conditions involving muscle tissue wasting.

AB  - Abstract There is growing recognition that traumatic brain injury is a highly variable and complex systemic disorder that is refractory to therapies that target individual mechanisms. It is even more complex in elderly persons, in whom frailty, previous comorbidities, altered metabolism, and a long history of medication use are likely to complicate the secondary effects of brain trauma. Progesterone, one of the few neuroprotective agents that has shown promise for the treatment of acute brain injury, is now in national and international phase 3 multicenter trials. New findings show that vitamin D hormone (VDH) and VDH deficiency in the aging process (and across the developmental spectrum) may interact with progesterone and treatment for traumatic brain injury. In this article we review the use of progesterone and VDH as biologics-based therapies along with recent studies demonstrating that the combination of progesterone and VDH may promote better functional outcomes than either treatment independently.

Identification of safe and cost-effective hemostatic treatment options remains crucial as a supplement to surgery and uterotonic agents. Objective This review summarizes the background, current evidence and recommendations with regard to the role of fibrinogen, tranexamic acid, prothrombin complex concentrate, desmopressin, and recombinant factor VIIa in the treatment of patients with postpartum hemorrhage. The benefits and evidence behind traditional standard laboratory tests and viscoelastic hemostatic assays, i.e. thromboelastography TEG? and thromboelastometry ROTEM?, are discussed. In addition we assess and elaborate on the current paradigm and evidence for transfusion of these patients. Data sources Publications between 1994 and 2014 were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and ClinicalTrial.gov. Results Viscoelastic hemostatic assays were found to provide a real-time continuum of coagulation and fibrinolysis when introduced as a supplement in transfusion management of postpartum hemorrhage. Fibrinogen should be considered when hypofibrinogenemia is identified. Early administration of 1?2 g tranexamic acid is recommended, followed by an additional dose in cases of ongoing bleeding. Uncontrolled hemorrhage requires early balanced transfusion. Conclusion Despite the lack of conclusive evidence for optimal hemostatic resuscitation in postpartum hemorrhage, the use of viscoelastic hemostatic assays, fibrinogen, tranexamic acid and balanced transfusion therapy may prove to be potentially pivotal in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

AB  - SUMMARY Objective To document blood component usage in the UK medical treatment facility, Afghanistan, over a period of 4 years; and to examine the relationship with transfusion capability, injury pattern and survival. Background Haemostatic resuscitation is now firmly established in military medical practice, despite the challenges of providing such therapy in austere settings. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of blood component use in service personnel admitted for trauma. Data were extracted from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. Results A total of 2618 patients were identified. Survival increased from 76 to 84% despite no change in injury severity. The proportion of patients receiving blood components increased from 13 to 32% per annum; 417 casualties received massive transfusion (≥10 units of RCC), the proportion increasing from 40 to 62%. Use of all blood components increased significantly in severely injured casualties, to a median (IQR) of 16 (9?25) units of red cell concentrate (P?=?0·006), 15 (8?24) of plasma (P?=?0·002), 2 (0?5) of platelets (P?<?0·001) and 1 (0?3) of cryoprecipitate (P?<?0·001). Cryoprecipitate (P?=?0·009) and platelet use (P?=?0·005) also increased in moderately injured casualties. Conclusions The number of blood components transfused to individual combat casualties increased during the 4-year period, despite no change in injury severity or injury pattern. Survival also increased. Combat casualties requiring massive transfusion have a significantly higher chance of survival than civilian patients. Survival is the product of the entire system of care. However, we propose that the changes in military transfusion practice and capability have contributed to increased combat trauma survival.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive transfusion (MTP) protocol design is hindered by lack of accurate assessment of coagulation. Rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) provides point-of-care (POC) analysis of clot formation. We designed a prospective study to test the hypothesis that integrating TEG into our MTP would facilitate goal-directed therapy and provide equivalent outcomes compared to conventional coagulation testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thiry-four patients who received more than 6 units of red blood cells (RBCs)/6 hours who were admitted to our Level 1 trauma center after r-TEG implementation (TEG) were compared to 34 patients admitted prior to TEG implementation (Pre-TEG). Data are presented as mean?±?SEM. RESULTS: Emergency department pre-TEG versus TEG shock, and coagulation indices, were not different: systolic blood pressure (94?mmHg vs.101?mmHg), temperature (35.3°C vs. 35.9°C), pH (7.16 vs. 7.11), base deficit (?13.0 vs. ?14.7), lactate (6.5 vs. 8.1), international normalized ratio (INR; 1.59 vs. 1.83), and partial thromboplastin time (48.3 vs. 57.9). Although not significant, patients with Injury Severity Score range 26 to 35 were more frequent in the pre-TEG group. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)?:?RBCs, platelets?:?RBCs, and cryoprecipitate (cryo)?:?RBC ratios were not significantly different at 6 or 12 hours. INR at 6 hours did not discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors (p?=?0.10), whereas r-TEG ?G? value was significantly associated with survival (p?=?0.03), as was the maximum rate of thrombin generation (MRTG; mm/min) and total thrombin generation (TG; area under the curve) (p?=?0.03 for both). Patients with MRTG of more than 9.2 received significantly less components of RBCs, FFP, and cryo (p?=?0.048, p?=?0.03, and p?=?0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Goal-directed resuscitation via r-TEG appears useful for management of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Further experience with POC monitoring could result in more efficient management leading to a reduction of transfusion requirements.
