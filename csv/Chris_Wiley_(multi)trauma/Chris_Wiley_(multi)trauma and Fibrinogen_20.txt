AB  - Abstract Septic shock is often associated with multiorgan failure, a life threatening clinical condition during which there is an imbalance in the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, antigens, endotoxins, procoagulant, and anticoagulant factors and also resultant effects of therapeutic intervention like volume overload. Various extracorporeal therapies have shown some positive results as adjunctive therapeutic intervention to traditional antimicrobials in an effort to bring the inflammatory mediators to a homeostatic balance and to improve poor organ perfusion caused by hypotension and thrombosis in the microcirculation. This review focuses on current information on the use of therapeutic apheresis procedures as adjunctive therapy in such clinical situations as well as the exciting prospects for the near future. The sometimes disappointing results of early phase clinical studies may, in some cases, be related to the well known barriers to successful clinical trials in critically ill patients rather than to failure of the novel concept of adjunctive extracorporeal treatment of septic shock. It should be noted that some of the specialized apheresis technologies reviewed in this article are not yet available for clinical use in the United States as they are not yet approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration.

AB  - Abstract Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most severe public health problem affecting both sexes but females are more susceptible due to the differences in urogenital and reproductive anatomy, physiology and lifestyle. As in UTI, different parts of the urinary tract are affected and morbidity due to UTI is more common in women of all ages and older men. Due to multi-drug resistant strains and high recurrence rate, UTI has become a major socioeconomic burden. The current review article was aimed to describe the natural therapeutic strategies to manage and cure the UTI. For this purpose, different databases including Google Scholar, Cochrane database, and PubMed etc. were explored. Inclusion criteria were any research article investigating the current therapy of UTI. It was found that microbial infections including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella species are the major causes of UTI with different signs and symptoms including painful urination or dysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency, burning micturition, frequent urination, nausea, and vomiting. Antibiotics like trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, quinolone etc. as the first choice of the drug are used worldwide. However, due to microbial resistance, several life-threatening side effects, repeated high doses, high cost and low efficacy of these antibiotics motivated the researchers to explore natural remedies for the treatment of UTI. Herbal medicines are effective to combat bacterial resistance with high efficacy, and easy availability with minimal or no side effects. For these reasons it has attained the attention of researchers wanting to explore the herbal treatment of UTI. Vaccinium macrocarpon, Tribulus terrestris, Trachyspermum copticum, Cinnamomum verum and Hybanthusenn easpermus are some common medicinal plants reported to have therapeutic potential for the management and cure of the UTI. Although herbal medicines have more potential over conventional medicine but more discoveries are required to explore the phytoconstituents and their mechanism of action responsible for the management and cure of UTI.

AB  - Background Complications after microvascular surgery, such as partial flap loss, and arterial/venous compromise cannot only increase morbidity for the patient but also tax the healthcare system. Thrombocytosis, both essential and reactive, can predispose patients to thrombosis and hemorrhage and thus should intuitively have an effect on the outcome of microvascular free tissue transfers. We sought to evaluate the effect of preoperative thrombocytosis on outcomes after microvascular free flap surgery. Methods A retrospective review of the 2013?2016 American Collges of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database identified 4,299 patients who had microsurgical flaps. Of these 3,744 had preoperative platelet levels recorded. Fifty-four patients had preoperative thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count >450?K/CUMM, while 3,690 did not. The groups were compared; demographics, comorbidities, and smoking status were recorded. We then examined outcomes between groups including average operative time, length of hospital stay, need for transfusion, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) postoperatively, and need for reoperation. Results When comparing the two cohorts, there was no statistical difference in comorbidities. We found a significant difference between the thrombocytosis and control cohort in need for transfusion (29.6 vs. 12.8%, p =?.0002), average days till discharge (8.36 vs. 5.75, p =?.009), and need for reoperation (27.8 vs. 13.8%, p =?.003). There was no difference in DVT occurrence (0 vs. 0.1%, p =?.46) or average operation time (535?m vs. 482?min, p =?.088). Conclusion Patients with thrombocytosis undergoing microvascular free flaps are at increased risk for complications, including the need for a blood transfusion, prolonged hospital stays, and reoperation.

AB  - Summary Hellmut Hartert was the first person to exploit the viscoelastic properties of clotting blood to measure blood coagulation in 1948. Since then, the technology has improved, allowing these analyses to be performed as point-of-care tests with immediately-available results. The addition of several activators and inhibitors to the original assay creates a panel of tests able to quantify the different aspects of blood clotting that can rival conventional laboratory assays. However, although much progress has been made, the standardization and validation of these tests still need improvement. Viscoelastic analyses of blood coagulation are mainly used to guide haemostatic therapy in bleeding patients and have proven superior to standard clotting tests in some circumstances. There is potential to extend their use to other areas, such as drug monitoring, and diagnosis and management of congenital bleeding disorders. The forthcoming cartridge-based assays are expected to improve the reliability and usability of viscoelastic assays of blood coagulation but high quality clinical trials remain urgently needed to determine their exact place, benefit and cost effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract Tissue-engineered constructs have great potential in many intervention strategies. In order for these constructs to function optimally, they should ideally mimic the cellular alignment and orientation found in the tissues to be treated. Here we present a simple and reproducible method for the production of cell-laden pure fibrin micro-fibers with longitudinal topography. The micro-fibers were produced using a molding technique and longitudinal topography was induced by a single initial stretch. Using this method, fibers up to 1?m in length and with diameters of 0.2?3?mm could be produced. The micro-fibers were generated with embedded endothelial cells, smooth muscle cell/fibroblasts or Schwann cells. Polarized light and scanning electron microscopy imaging showed that the initial stretch was sufficient to induce longitudinal topography in the fibrin gel. Cells in the unstretched control micro-fibers elongated randomly in both the floating and encapsulated environments, whereas the cells in the stretched micro-fibers responded to the introduced topography by adopting a similar orientation. Proof of concept bottom-up tissue engineering (TE) constructs are shown, all displaying various anisotropic organization of cells within. This simple, economical, versatile and scalable approach for the production of highly orientated and cell-laden micro-fibers is easily transferrable to any TE laboratory.

AB  - Summary Coumarins, identified as plant secondary metabolites possess diverse biological activities including anti-angiogenic properties. Daphnetin (DAP), a plant derived dihydroxylated derivative of coumarin has shown significant pharmacological properties such as anticancer, anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory. The present study was performed to investigate the anti-angiogenic potential of DAP, focusing on the mechanism of action. The in vivo anti-angiogenic potential of DAP was evaluated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced rat aortic ring (RAR) assay and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. For in vitro evaluation, wounding migration, transwell invasion, tube formation and apoptosis assays were performed on VEGF (8 ng/mL)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The cellular mechanism of DAP was examined on TNFα (10 ng/mL) and VEGF-induced HUVECs by extracting the mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and western blotting. Our data demonstrated that DAP inhibited the in vivo angiogenesis in the RAR and CAM assay. DAP also inhibited the different steps of angiogenesis, such as migration, invasion, and tube formation in HUVECs. DAP inhibited nuclear factor-?B signalling together including TNF-α induced I?Bα degradation; phosphorylation of I?B kinase (IKKα/?) and translocation of the NF-?B-p65 protein. Furthermore, western blotting revealed that DAP significantly down-regulated the VEGF-induced signalling such as c-Src, FAK, ERK1/2 and the related phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and VEGFR2 expressions. DAP reduced the elevated mRNA expression of iNOS, MMP2 and also, induced apoptosis in VEGF-stimulated HUVECs by the caspase-3 dependent pathway. Taken together, this study reveals that DAP may have novel prospective as a new multi-targeted medication for the anti-angiogenesis and cancer therapy.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in pregnancy is most often encountered secondary to underlying obstetrical, surgical, or medical complications. The process of DIC is initiated through the activation of tissue factor (TF), which is found in subendothelial cells, amniotic fluid, and placenta. DIC is seen in severe forms of preeclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic complication in obstetrics and is associated with significant maternal mortality. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare disease associated with massive obstetric hemorrhage. It is characterized by accumulation of microvesicular fatty infiltration in the maternal hepatocytes, leading to liver failure. The diagnosis of DIC is clinical, based upon underlying etiology, blood loss, and the general condition of the patient. The basic principles of managing obstetrical DIC are multidisciplinary approach, treatment of obstetric causes, blood and blood products, and supportive care.

Recently, numerous attempts have been made to fabricate tissues and organs by using various 3D printing techniques. However, challenges such as vascularization are yet to be solved. This article reviews the most commonly used 3D cell-printing techniques with their advantages and drawbacks. Furthermore, up-to-date achievements of 3D bioprinting in in vivo applications are introduced, and prospects for the future of 3D cell-printing technology are discussed. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding related to portal hypertension and coagulopathy is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. Complications and management of bleeding is a significant source of healthcare cost and utilization, as well as morbidity and mortality. Due to the scarcity of evidence surrounding transfusion strategies and hemostatic interventions in patients with cirrhosis, there has been significant debate regarding the best practice. Emerging data suggest that evidence supporting transfusion of packed red blood cells to a hemoglobin threshold of 7-8 g/dL is strong. thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists have shown promise in increasing platelet levels and reducing transfusions preprocedurally, although have not specifically been found to reduce bleeding risk. Data for viscoelastic testing (VET)-guided transfusions appear favorable for reducing blood transfusion requirements prior to minor procedures and during orthotopic liver transplantation. Hemostatic agents such as recombinant factor VIIa, prothrombin complex concentrates, and tranexamic acid have been examined but their role in cirrhotic patients is unclear. Other areas of growing interest include balanced ratio and whole blood transfusion. In the following manuscript, we summarize the most up to date evidence for threshold-guided, VET-guided, balanced-ratio, and whole blood transfusions as well as the use of hemostatic agents in cirrhotic patients to provide practice guidance to clinicians.

AB  - Abstract The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

AB  - Summary Since first gaining an EU license in 1996 to treat haemophiliacs with inhibitors, rFVIIa (NovoSeven?) has been used extensively for off-label indications. Between 2000 and 2008, off-label (including prophylactic) use of rFVIIa increased more than 140-fold and, in 2008, accounted for more than 97% of in-hospital use of the drug. Despite this, there is a paucity of evidence to support its off-label use. Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown general trends towards a reduction in blood product administration but not an overall mortality benefit. Furthermore, when used off-license, an increase in thromboembolic events has been demonstrated. It is unclear if there is a role for rFVIIa in the critically ill, and it is likely that only a subset of patients will benefit. It is not a panacea for uncontrolled haemorrhage and, combined with the side effect profile and economic cost, careful consideration should be given to its off-label use.

AB  - Summary General recommendations for plasma transfusion have been well described in many guidelines. Therapeutic uses of plasma, in association with bleeding and abnormalities of coagulation tests (except in emergencies) are based on pathophysiological rationale, but questions about optimal dose and schedule of plasma. A recurring theme in many settings is an overall paucity of high-level evidence to inform optimal plasma transfusion practice remain unanswered, and this particularly applies to prophylactic uses of plasma. There should be more recognition of the limitations of current standard coagulation screening tests, and appreciation that in vitro abnormalities of coagulation screening tests do not equate with an in vivo failure of clinical haemostasis and the presence of clinical coagulopathy. Newer global tests of haemostasis may be better markers of abnormal bleeding risk, but should be assessed and validated in larger clinical studies. Given current evidence, a more appropriate plasma transfusion strategy may be one that emphasises the therapeutic use of plasma in bleeding patients. The role, if any, of prophylactic plasma transfusion in non-bleeding patients with abnormalities of standard coagulation tests, which have limited value in predicting bleeding remains very uncertain. Future research should identify the constituents in plasma that are providing the most benefit (e.g. by analogy the role of ADAMTS13 in TTP). With a better mechanistic understanding of disorders with acquired deficiencies of one or more coagulation factors, replacement might also be more appropriately managed in the future with concentrates of multiple coagulation factors, and which would minimise risks of circulatory overload described when high volume plasma transfusions are given.
