AB  - Aims Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibition has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improved glucose control. This Phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of a novel MetAP2 inhibitor, ZGN-1061. Methods This clinical trial included a single ascending dose (SAD) phase in healthy subjects (BMI, 23 to <30?kg/m2) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase in otherwise healthy subjects (BMI, 27 to 40?kg/m2). SAD phase doses, administered subcutaneously (SC), were 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8?mg and the MAD phase evaluated doses of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.8?mg twice weekly SC for 4?weeks. Results The SAD phase included 39 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?28; placebo, N?=?11); 90% were male and BMI was 26.4?kg/m2. ZGN-1061 was well tolerated across all doses, with the most frequent adverse events being mild headache and procedural-related irritation. There were no severe or serious adverse events. All doses of ZGN-1061 were rapidly absorbed and cleared, resulting in short duration of exposure that is anticipated to minimize potential off-drug target risks. The MAD phase included 29 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?22; placebo, N?=?7); 76% were male and BMI was 33.5?kg/m2. Safety observations were consistent with SAD findings. Efficacy measures in the MAD phase indicated trends for weight change (?1.5?kg total ZGN-1061 vs ?0.2?kg placebo) and other biomarker changes. Conclusions ZGN-1061 was well tolerated with no safety signals in all doses tested. In addition, the desired pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy observations with ZGN-1061 support evaluation in larger and longer clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Growing evidence suggests that plasmin is involved in a number of physiological processes in addition to its key role in fibrin cleavage. Plasmin inhibition is critical in preventing adverse consequences arising from plasmin overactivity, e.g., blood loss that may follow cardiac surgery. Aprotinin was widely used as an antifibrinolytic drug before its discontinuation in 2008. Tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid, two small molecule plasmin inhibitors, are currently used in the clinic. Several molecules have been designed utilizing covalent, but reversible, chemistry relying on reactive cyclohexanones, nitrile warheads, and reactive aldehyde peptidomimetics. Other major classes of plasmin inhibitors include the cyclic peptidomimetics and polypeptides of the Kunitz and Kazal-type. Allosteric inhibitors of plasmin have also been designed including small molecule lysine analogs that bind to plasmin's kringle domain(s) and sulfated glycosaminoglycan mimetics that bind to plasmin's catalytic domain. Plasmin inhibitors have also been explored for resolving other disease states including cell metastasis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and embryo implantation. This review highlights functional and structural aspects of plasmin inhibitors with the goal of advancing their design.

AB  - ABSTRACT Premature and systemically ill infants have a high risk of developing dermatologic infectious complications, displaying the consequences of skin barrier immaturity. Opportunistic infections are an increasing concern in neonates, with cutaneous fungal infections (Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Mucor, Fusarium) observed more commonly as pathogens. Neonates are especially susceptible due to stresses of the perinatal transition to ex-utero life, stratum corneum immaturity, and medical intervention during early life including intravenous catheters, non-sterile adhesive dressings, broad spectrum antibiotic use, and systemic corticosteroids for lung disease. Cutaneous presentations of these infections encompass a broad set of morphologies: papules, vesicles, pustules, ecchymoses, and necrotic, pupuric plaques. There are many etiologies that present as ecchymoses and scaly or crusted lesions. The presentation, diagnosis, and treatment options in the neonatal patient presenting with ecchymoses and crusts will be discussed.

AB  - Summary Snake venoms are mixtures of numerous proteinacious components that exert diverse functional activities on a variety of physiological targets. Because the toxic constituents found in venom vary from species to species, snakebite victims can present with a variety of life-threatening pathologies related to the neurotoxic, cytotoxic and haemotoxic effects of venom. Of the 1·8 million people envenomed by snakes every year, up to 125 000 die, while hundreds of thousands survive only to suffer with life-changing long-term morbidity. Consequently, snakebite is one of the world's most severe neglected tropical diseases. Many snake venoms exhibit strong haemotoxic properties by interfering with blood pressure, clotting factors and platelets, and by directly causing haemorrhage. In this review we provide an overview of the functional activities of haemotoxic venom proteins, the pathologies they cause in snakebite victims and how their exquisite selectivity and potency make them amenable for use as therapeutic and diagnostic tools relevant for human medicine.

AB  - Summary? The search for a tissue adhesive which obviates the need for suture materials in the apposition of wound edges is not new. The early adhesive products lacked the required safety and efficacy. Experimental use of a new fibrin adhesive has shown that it may have potential use where inflammatory reaction to the suture material is undesirable or water-tight sealing of the anastomosis is required.
