AB  - Abstract Aims: We studied the effect of binge drinking on surgical dexterity immediately after and the morning after alcohol intake. Methods: Five surgeons (all males, age 31?42 years) were trained on laparoscopic surgical simulator (MIST-VR) to reach a desired standard of performance. Three sets of experiments were a control with no alcohol and full night's sleep, a sham night out (sleep deprived) without alcohol and a night out with alcohol ad libitum. Parameters recorded were average time taken to perform task, error rate, average diathermy time and diathermy (damage) time to main object. Comparisons between baseline readings, those in the middle of night and those of following morning were made with Wilcoxon signed ranks test (all two tailed, significance at P < 0.01). Results: The candidates consumed on an average 10.33 (range 6?15) units of alcohol and had 0.86 per cent (range 0.71?1.1 per cent) of breath alcohol levels and had an average of 3.75 (range 3?5 h) hours of sleep after a typical night out. The morning-after breath alcohol levels were 0 per cent. There was significant deterioration in the performance indicators in all the parameters immediately after alcohol consumption. The time taken to complete task and the time when the diathermy was used were still significantly worse the morning after the typical night out. The sham night out showed deterioration only on time parameters with control night out showed no changes. Conclusions: A typical night out deteriorates performance on a surgical simulator, which persists till the following morning as compared to just a ?nonalcoholic? night out.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Blood transfusion has often been shown to reduce cancer survival, however, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. We have measured antiangiogenic agent endostatin, the proangiogenic growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in various blood products and assessed their effect upon tumour and endothelial cell growth to attempt to explain this clinical finding. Methods: Blood products as supplied by the blood bank were maintained at 4 C and every 72 h was centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 15 min, the supernatant underwent measurement of endostatin, bFGF and VEGF by ELISAs. A standard MTS assay measured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) and colorectal cancer cell (Caco-2) proliferation from incubated stored blood supernatant compared to control and cancer patients plasma. Results: Endostatin in packed red blood cells (2100 pg/mL ± 810) became undetectable within one week of storage, during which time platelets increased bFGF levels by fourfold (4.4 ± 1.9 versus 17.4 ± 4.5 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Plasma from whole blood contained significantly more VEGF (73.6 pg/mL ± 5.0) than leucodepleted packed cells (22.6 pg/mL ± 1.2, P < 0.01). HUVECS and Caco-2 cells increased proliferation upon incubation with stored blood supernatant compared to patient plasma (P < 0.05); an effect inhibited by anti-VEGF antibody (P < 0.05). Conclusions: During storage, blood products become proangiogenic stimulating both cancer cells and endothelial proliferation in vitro. These findings may have clinical significance in terms of the detrimental effects blood products contribute to cancer patients survival.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Laparoscopic appendicectomy is a safe and effective procedure but concerns have been raised that the operation has taken appendicectomy away from the basic surgical trainee (BST) and into the hands of more senior surgeons (HST). We assessed the impact of laparoscopic appendicectomy as a trainee operation. Methods: This was a prospective audit of 185 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of appendicitis who were referred to a major teaching hospital over a 7-month period. Outcome measures included operative time, conversion from laparoscopic to open, complications, and length of stay. Results: Of the 120 patients who underwent surgical intervention by trainees, six had formal laparotomies, 40 patients successfully had a laparoscopic appendectomy, nine were converted (18.3 per cent), 24 patients had a diagnostic laparoscopy and 41 underwent open appendectomy. The performance of BSTs and HSTs is shown below. No significant difference was found in operative time for laparoscopic appendicectomy between trainees (BST median 65 min, HST median 60 min). The duration of laparoscopic appendectomy was significantly longer (median 60 min versus 40 min for open (P < 0.0001)). Length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group compared to open (49 h versus 72 h (P < 0.01)). There was no difference between the two groups of trainees. The complication rate was lower in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. Conclusion: In our experience laparoscopic appendectomy may fulfil a role in the training of laparoscopy that open appendectomy has traditionally provided for laparotomy.

AB  - Abstract Background: Robotic-enhanced surgery has emerged as a solution to some of the drawbacks of traditional minimal access surgery. Master?slave telemanipulator systems have been extensively used in surgical interventions, but the learning curve in this technology has not been objectively assessed. Aims: Delineate the learning curve of surgeons for a robotic task in a complex bench model. Find if there is a quantifiable learning process in a short period of exposure to the Da Vinci system. Methods: Nine surgeons completed five synthetic small bowel anastomoses (Limbs and things, UK) using the Da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, CA) in standardized conditions. All procedures were digitized and quality scored independently by three surgeons employing the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used to compare the first and last attempts. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Cronbach's-alpha was used to measure interrater reliability. Results: A learning curve was constructed using time and OSATS score of every task. Both variables showed a rapid and progressive learning process. Mean times for the first and last attempt were 3507 s and 2287 s (P < 0.008) and mean OSATS scores were 17 and 24 (P < 0.012), respectively. A high interobserver reliability was found (α = 0.894). Conclusions: This study clearly shows a significant reduction in the time taken (34 per cent) and improvement in quality (29 per cent) between the first and fifth attempt in a bench model. Therefore, we conclude that Da Vinci system allows fast adaptation and short learning process regardless previous surgical experience.

AB  - Abstract Aims: The high morbidity (28.5 per cent readmission rate) experienced whilst waiting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) after an index admission with acute cholecystitis (AC) has been reported. Since this report a provision for emergency LC service has been made available in the same DGH. This study performed over a 12-month period (October 2000?September 2001) reports the impact of those changes on the management of AC and allows comparisons between these results and those achieved in the previous study (the control period). Methods: During the study 146 patients presented as emergency with AC. Emergency cholecytectomy was performed in 75 and the rest were waitlisted. GI surgeons performed 76 per cent of the LC whilst the non-GI surgeons listed the majority of their cases for delayed LC. Seventy-one per cent of the LC was done laparoscopically with an 18.8 per cent conversion rate; 59 per cent (44/75) cholecystectomies were performed by trainees under supervision. The number of emergency LC, conversion rates, complications, median length of total (TLOS) and postop hospital stay (PLOS) were used as end points. Results: There was a seven-fold (Table) increase in the number of cholecystectomies during their index admission in the study group. Major complications and conversion rates of LC performed in the study period (5.3 and 18 per cent) were similar to those of delayed LC in the control period (6.2 and 12 per cent). Although the TLOS was less in the study group compared to the control (table), patients with AC still had a median wait of 5 days between their admission and their cholecystectomy. Conclusions: These results document that emergency cholecystectomy service can be provided with minimal complications and a shorter hospital stay. Further improvements to reduce inhospital stay require prompt ultrasound examination and rostering of laparoscopically competent surgeons.

AB  - Abstract Aim Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent commonly used for the prevention and treatment of bleeding disorders. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods From 2005 to 2014, we encountered four CKD patients who experienced severe complications related to TXA. Clinical manifestations and outcome of these patients were recorded. We then performed a qualitative literature review of published cases of TXA toxicity in CKD patients in the PubMed database from 1 January 1972 to 31 December 2015. Results In our centre, two peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients developed neurotoxicity after intravenous TXA use for surgical bleeding and one PD patient developed neurotoxicity after oral TXA use for post-polypectomy colonic bleeding. One kidney transplant recipient developed acute obstructive uropathy due to retention of blood clot at the pelvi-ureteric junction of graft kidney after taking oral TXA for menorrhagia. Dosage of TXA was not adjusted according to renal function in all cases. All of them recovered without permanent disability after TXA was stopped. From our literature search, we identified two cases of neurotoxicity (one PD, one stage 4 CKD patient), one case of retinal toxicity in a haemolysis (HD) patient, one case of ligneous conjunctivitis in a CKD patient, and one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a CKD patient. Conclusion Neurotoxicity is a very common clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in CKD patients. Thrombotic complication is rare. Dosage adjustment of TXA is essential in CKD patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review potential platelet storage options, guidelines for administration of platelets, and adverse events associated with platelet transfusions. Data Sources ? Data sources included original research publications and scientific reviews. Human Data Synthesis ? Transfusion of platelet concentrates (PCs) plays a key role in the management of patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Currently PCs are stored at 22°C under continuous gentle agitation for up to 5 days. Chilling of platelets is associated with rapid clearance of transfused platelets, and galactosylation of platelets has proven unsuccessful in prolonging platelet survival. Although approved by the American Association of Blood Banks, cryopreservation of human platelets in 6% DMSO largely remains a research technique. Pre-storage leukoreduction of PCs has reduced but not eliminated acute inflammatory transfusion reactions, with platelet inflammatory mediators contributing to such reactions. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Canine plateletpheresis allows collection of a concentrate with a high platelet yield, typically 3?4.5 ? 1011 versus <1 ? 1011 for whole blood-derived platelets, improving the ability to provide sufficient platelets to meet the recipient's transfusion needs. Cryopreservation of canine platelets in 6% DMSO offers immediate availability of platelets, with an acceptable posttransfusion in vivo platelet recovery and half-life of 50% and 2 days, respectively. While data on administration of rehydrated lyophilized platelets in bleeding animal models are encouraging, due to a short lifespan (min) posttransfusion, their use will be limited to control of active bleeding, without a sustained increase in platelet count. Conclusions ? Fresh PC remains the product of choice for control of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia. While cryopreservation and lyophilization of canine platelets offer the benefits of immediate availability and long-term storage, the compromise is decreased in vivo recovery and survival of platelets and some degree of impaired function, though such products could still be life saving.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Major general surgical operations, especially for malignancy, are associated with a high risk of venous thrombo-embolic (VTE) complications, of which about 40 per cent occur after discharge. In this systematic review we examine the value of extended thrombo-prophylaxis. Methods: Three randomized, controlled trials, which studied 1 week versus 4 weeks of thromboprophylaxis (TP) with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), were included in the analysis. We used RevMan (Version 4.1.1, Oxford  P = 0.002). The risk of bleeding was 3.5 per cent in both groups (OR 0.99, 95 per cent CI 0.47?2.06; P = 1). Conclusions: Extended TP results in significant reduction of the risk of developing VTE in patients undergoing major general surgical operations without any increase in the risk of bleeding.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Tissue repair of primary inguinal hernia using mesh relies on scar tissue bonding the mesh to give a sound repair. Collagen has the theoretical advantage of using natural collagen which will be incorporated into the repair and not be a permanent foreign body. Methods: A total of 140 patients were prospectively randomized to receive either polypropylene or collagen mesh. Performance was compared at operation, postoperatively, 3 months, 12 months. Patient's perceptions and quality of life were measured. Patients and researchers were blinded and analysis was undertaken at a separate institution. Results: A total of 78 patients received collagen and 62 received polypropylene mesh, with no difference in handling, insertion and suturing at operation. Postoperatively there was an increase in haematoma in the polypropylene group (P = 0.048). Infection and inflammation were similar postoperatively and at 3 months. There was one recurrent hernia in each group at 1 year. Activity and pain scores postoperatively were similar and were normal by 4 weeks. Quality of life was reduced in both groups at 4 weeks: Euroqol P = 0.002, SF 36: physical function P = 0.016, social function P = 0.003. At 3 months there was reduced physical function in the polypropylene group (P = 0.037). Conclusions: Initial results showed that collagen mesh is an effective method of providing tissue repair in primary inguinal hernia. The collagen mesh produced fewer haematomas postoperatively and patients recovered physical activity more quickly. Otherwise it produced results comparable to polypropylene without the risks of a permanently implanted foreign body. It is proposed to recruit 200 patients to the study and undertake follow-up for 2 years postoperatively.

AB  - Abstract Aims: A radical shift in management of abdominal sepsis from surgery to radiological drainage occurred in 20 years. This is safe and in majority it avoids the need for conventional surgery. When surgery is indicated it provides the roadmap by showing the exact nature of the abscess and its contents. This is a retrospective study from single centre to look at the outcome of management of localized intra-abdominal sepsis by using radiological guided drainage. Methods: All the patients who underwent radiological intervention for abdominal sepsis between 1995 and 2001 were included in the study. These were scanned and drains were inserted under radiological guidance under local anaesthetic. All these patients were followed up with antibiotics and drainograms when appropriate. Results: These patients were between ages of 14 and 84 years. A total of 216 procedures were performed. Twenty-four of them were diagnostic in that the patients were subjected to laparotomy or conservative management. A total of 192 patients had therapeutic aspiration or drainage. One hundred and forty-five patients had catheters inserted for continuous drainage and the rest had therapeutic aspiration. These patients included pelvic abscess (15 per cent), perinephric collections (12.4 per cent), subdiaphragmatic abscess (12 per cent), liver abscesses (8 per cent), pseudocysts (7 per cent), pericolic abscess (7.5 per cent), sub-hepatic abscess (5 per cent), psoas abscess (3.4 per cent), appendicular abscess (3.4 per cent), empyema gall bladder and pancreatic abscesses. Complications were minimal including transient sepsis, residual collection, haemorrhage into the cavity and persistent sinus. Our results include bacteriological studies of aspirates, which will be presented in detail at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Percutaneuos guided aspiration and drainage is a safe and effective alternative to conventional open surgical drainage. We recommend this as the first line of management.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Hyperhidrosis substantially impairs quality of life. Sympathectomy is often ineffective for axillary hyperhidrosis and carries a significant risk of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin injection offers a temporary but effective treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the value to patients of this treatment as judged by their voluntary, self-initiated re-attendance for further treatment. Methods: A prospective database of all patients attending for Botulinum toxin injections for hyperhidrosis has been kept since October 1997. After treatment no routine review is arranged. Patients who want further injections must self refer to the clinic when they think it is necessary. Results: From October 1997 to January 2002 60 patients have received Botulinum toxin for hyperhidrosis (54 axillary, 6 plantar). 45 received their first injections more than 12 months ago and of these 31 (69 per cent) have initiated re-attendance for further treatment at a median of 10 months (IQR 7?13 months) after initial treatment. Conclusions: Botulinum toxin injection for hyperhidrosis is of sufficient value to at least 69 per cent of patients that they self-initiate repeated therapy. The median duration of efficacy is 10 months.

AB  - Abstract The human blood coagulation system comprises a series of linked glycoproteins that upon activation induce the generation of downstream enzymes ultimately forming fibrin. This process is primarily important to arrest bleeding (hemostasis). Hemostasis is a typical example of a molecular machine, where the assembly of substrates, enzymes, protein cofactors and calcium ions on a phospholipid surface markedly accelerates the rate of coagulation. Excess, pathological, coagulation activity occurs in ?thrombosis?, the formation of an intravascular clot, which in the most dramatic form precipitates in the microvasculature as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Thrombosis occurs according to a biochemical machine model in the case of atherothrombosis on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, but may develop at a slower rate in venous thrombosis, illustrating that the coagulation machinery can act at different velocities. The separate coagulation enzymes are also important in other biological processes, including inflammation for which the rapid conversion of one coagulation factor by the other is not a prerequisite. The latter role of coagulation enzymes may be related to the old and probably maintained function of the coagulation machine in innate immunity.
