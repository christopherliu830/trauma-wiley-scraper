AB  - Summary All bleeding eventually stops, but it is a matter of timing whether the patient experiences this phenomenon dead or alive. The faster, the more complete, and the more proficient the hemostasis, the better is the patient's chance of recovery. Mere chemistry may help to achieve such timely hemostasis. Systemically administrable drugs, such as tranexamic acid, ε-aminocaproic acid, or desmopressin are available to enhance endogenous coagulation factor production, function, and release. Some drugs are able to modify fibrinolysis and enhance platelet function. There are also drugs that promote local hemostasis. This chapter introduces the reader to practical ways to use such agents to improve the patient's outcome.

AB  - Summary Neuropathic pain remains an extremely challenging condition to manage clinically, with few effective options for analgesia. The hallmark of neuropathic pain is a mixed loss and gain of function in somatosensation and pain, which is secondary to an initiating lesion to the nervous system. Clinical research into the distinctive somatosensory profiles exhibited by individuals with different types of neuropathic pain will soon improve the design of clinical trials that assess the effects of therapeutics on the different dimensions of neuropathic pain. A variety of model systems have been developed to investigate the peripheral and central nervous system pathology seen in clinical pain conditions triggered by traumatic injury, toxic neuropathy and other conditions. The biology illustrated by these models has proven difficult to translate into novel analgesic therapies. But recent evidence for a broader role of the immune system in neuropathic pain provides a new avenue for therapeutic development.

AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - Summary A low platelet count is a frequently encountered haematological abnormality in patients treated in intensive treatment units (ITUs). Although severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ? 109/l) can be associated with bleeding, even moderate-degree thrombocytopenia is associated with organ failure and adverse prognosis. The aetiology for thrombocytopenia in ITU is often multifactorial and correcting one aetiology may not normalise the low platelet count. The classical view for thrombocytopenia in this setting is consumption associated with thrombin-mediated platelet activation, but other concepts, including platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and leucocytes, platelet aggregation by increased von Willebrand factor release, red cell damage and histone release, and platelet destruction by the complement system, have recently been described. The management of severe thrombocytopenia is platelet transfusion in the presence of active bleeding or invasive procedure, but the risk-benefit of prophylactic platelet transfusions in this setting is uncertain. In this review, the incidence and mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITU, its prognostic significance and the impact on organ function is discussed. A practical approach based on the authors' experience is described to guide management of a critically ill patient who develops thrombocytopenia.

AB  - Since Haissaguerre and his colleagues demonstrated the importance of the pulmonary veins in the generation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 1998, a variety of different ablative interventions have been performed to eliminate AF. Various complications related to catheterization, ablation itself including pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial effusion, stroke, and atrioesophageal fistula have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome characterized by enhanced activation of coagulation with some intravascular fibrin formation and deposition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient whose condition was complicated by DIC after segmental ostial isolation of pulmonary veins for persistent AF. The patient has completely recovered from the DIC by hemodialysis, administration of blood constituents for 15 days.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives To investigate the impact of a dedicated cell salvage practitioner team on blood loss and allogeneic transfusion in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery. Background Cell salvage reduces allogeneic transfusion in AAA surgery, but is commonly performed by the anaesthetic nurse. At our hospital, a dedicated patient blood management practitioner is present for all elective open AAA repairs. Methods/Materials Data were collected on 171 AAA patients operated on at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford over a 3-year period, looking at the Patient Blood Management processes, including: blood loss, cell salvage, near-patient testing (thrombelastography) and transfusion rates of allogeneic blood products. Results Blood loss ranged from 3?108% of estimated blood volume (EBV) (median 25%?=?1500?mL). In seven patients who lost 70?110% of their EBV, none reached the thrombelastography intervention threshold for R time (11?min) or MA (48?mm) despite such massive blood loss. Overall, only 7/171 (4%) patients received intra-operative allogeneic blood, all of whom had a mean baseline haemoglobin concentration?<?106?g L?1 (median 98, range 95?105?g L?1). In terms of other blood products, only 4/171 (2·3%) received one unit of platelets each intra-operatively. None received FFP or cryoprecipitate. Conclusions Such low levels of allogeneic transfusion have not been reported previously. We hypothesise that this is due to the additional blood management contributions of the specialised cell salvage practitioners and collaboration with the rest of the vascular surgical team. These results support the development of pre-operative anaemia clinics. Overall the service runs at a profit to the trust.
