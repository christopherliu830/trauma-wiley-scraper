AB  - Abstract A delipid extracorporeal lipoprotein filter (DELP) system has been used to treat patients with stroke and has shown favorable prognosis. However, the mechanism for the neuronal functional recovery remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neuronal histological assessment, and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) after ischemic stroke following DELP treatment. Hyperlipidemic rabbits underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion. After 30?min, the animals received an extracorporeal apheresis treatment with a DELP filter. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of the plasma were measured. The levels of CRP, TNF-α, and oxLDL in brain tissue were also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, cresyl violet staining, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed. DELP apheresis reduced TC and LDL by >30%. The number of neurons at day 7 (P?<?0.01) and the integrated optical density of NSE at day 1 (P?<? 0.05) and day 7 (P?<?0.01) were significantly increased in the DELP group. TUNEL-positive cells were significantly decreased (P?<?0.05). Astrocytes were moderately activated, and this activation persisted up to 7 days. Gliosis was not found in the DELP group. After treatment, the level of CRP declined at day 1 (P?<?0.05); TNF-α and oxLDL declined at day 7 (P?<?0.05). DELP apheresis decreased neuronal apoptosis, reduced inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia, and improved neuronal survival.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk factors include a first idiopathic DVT, strongly suggesting the existence of undiagnosed and/or unidentified prothrombotic abnormalities. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of locally increased red blood cell (RBC) aggregation on DVT pathogenesis in a rabbit model. Methods: DVT presence, flow and aggregation were measured in situ with ultrasound. Greatly enhanced aggregation was achieved by covalent linkage of Pluronic F98 to the RBC surface; coating with Pluronic F68, which very mildly enhances aggregation, was used as a coating control. On day 1, endothelial damage and a partial stenosis were surgically created on the left femoral vein whereas the right femoral vein was not manipulated. Results: A thrombus was formed within 30?min in six out of seven left femoral veins of animals receiving a 30% volume blood exchange with F98-coated RBC, whereas a thrombus occurred in only one out of seven veins in F68-transfused controls. In vivo imaging using quantitative ultrasound confirmed increased aggregation in the thrombosed veins of the F98 group compared with the F68 group and the contralateral vessel. For each group, five animals were followed for 2?weeks before being killed. In F98-transfused animals, lysis of clots occurred and the presence of chronic thrombi totally occluding the vein in three out of five animals was confirmed by histology. Conversely, in the F68 group, a single disorganized blood clot was observed in one out of five animals. Conclusions: A marked increase in RBC aggregation promotes thrombosis in rabbit femoral veins, confirming a pathophysiological role of locally altered hemorheology in the onset of DVT.

AB  - Summary Genetic defects of platelets constitute rare diseases that include bleeding syndromes of autosomal dominant, recessive or X-linked inheritance. They affect platelet production, resulting in a low circulating platelet count and changes in platelet morphology, platelet function, or a combination of both with altered megakaryopoiesis and a defective platelet response. As a result, blood platelets fail to fulfil their haemostatic function. Most studied of the platelet function disorders are deficiencies of glycoprotein mediators of adhesion and aggregation while defects of primary receptors for stimuli include the P2Y12 ADP receptor. Studies on inherited defects of (i) secretion from storage organelles (dense granules, α-granules), (ii) the platelet cytoskeleton and (iii) the generation of pro-coagulant activity have identified genes indirectly controlling the functional response. Signalling pathway defects leading to agonist-specific modifications of platelet aggregation are the current target of exome-sequencing strategies. We now review recent advances in the molecular characterization of platelet function defects.

AB  - Summary The transfusion of platelets to patients with impaired haematopoiesis, with bone marrow aplasia induced by chemotherapy and with a variety of miscellaneous disorders of platelet number and function has provided life-saving supportive therapy. This chapter discusses the preparation and preservation of platelet concentrates and indications for platelet transfusions. The author reports three cases and experiments which furnish additional evidence to show that the blood platelets play a part in stopping haemorrhage, and that one type of haemorrhagic disease may be attributed to an extreme reduction in the number of platelets. The object of transfusing allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cells is to establish a permanent graft of transfused progenitor cells in the recipient. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) may occur when the Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains strong leucocyte antibodies.

AB  - Abstract . Secretions of the tick salivary glands are essential to the successful completion of the prolonged feeding of these ectoparasites as well as the conduit by which most tick-borne pathogens are transmitted to the host. In ixodid ticks the salivary glands are the organs of osmoregulation, and excess water from the bloodmeal is returned via saliva into the host. Host blood must continue to flow into the feeding lesion as well as remain fluid in the tick mouthparts and gut. The host's haemostatic mechanisms are thwarted by various anti-platelet aggregatory, anticoagulatory and anti-vasoconstrictory factors in tick saliva. Saliva components suppress the immune and inflammatory response of the host permitting the ticks to remain on the host for an extended period of time and, adventitiously, enhancing the transmission and establishment of tick-borne pathogens. Over the years much work has been done on the numerous enzyme and pharmacological activities found in the tick saliva. The present article reviews the most recent work on salivary gland secretionith special emphasis on how they favour pathogen transmission.
