AB  - Summary The transfusion of platelets to patients with impaired haematopoiesis, with bone marrow aplasia induced by chemotherapy and with a variety of miscellaneous disorders of platelet number and function has provided life-saving supportive therapy. This chapter discusses the preparation and preservation of platelet concentrates and indications for platelet transfusions. The author reports three cases and experiments which furnish additional evidence to show that the blood platelets play a part in stopping haemorrhage, and that one type of haemorrhagic disease may be attributed to an extreme reduction in the number of platelets. The object of transfusing allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cells is to establish a permanent graft of transfused progenitor cells in the recipient. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) may occur when the Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains strong leucocyte antibodies.

AB  - Bioadhesives and glues are widely used as an adjunct to conventional methods employed in healing the post-surgical injuries and restoration of normal tissue functions. Protein-based bioadhesives have been used for a long time, and they are a more biocompatible alternative compared with synthetic adhesives. They offer advantages such as ease of application, reduction in surgery time, improved quality and strength of the seal, and effective sealing. Also, bioadhesives are being exploited in different fields like controlled and site-specific drug delivery systems, and in tissue engineering and regeneration. There are various marketed protein-based glues that are available in different forms. Thus, all in all, it is a patient compliant system, thereby increasing its recent popularity. This article provides insight into different types and sources of protein-based bioadhesives, their history of use, mechanism of adhesion. and various products that have been approved by the regulatory authorities for clinical use. It also includes information regarding the products in clinical trials and potential applications.

AB  - Summary Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a life-threatening complication of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The clinical picture consists of DVT that causes severe swelling of the entire lower extremity with cyanosis and extremity pain, and may cause arterial insufficiency, compartment syndrome, venous gangrene, and limb amputation. Beyond acute symptoms, DVT carries long-term vascular implications related to the risk of development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). There are several patient comorbidities that may affect the interventional approach being considered for acute DVT. Aspiration thrombectomy can provide rapid restoration of flow in acute DVT. Venous stenting for acute DVT is usually performed in cases of inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis or iliac vein DVT. When deciding whether or not to proceed with venous stenting, it is critical to determine the degree of venous outflow obstruction after thrombolysis. This can be done with either multiplane venography or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Whether atherosclerotic disease predisposes to venous thrombosis is uncertain. Objective:?To determine whether subclinical atherosclerosis, manifested as increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) or presence of carotid plaque, is associated with increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients and methods:?The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study is a prospective cohort of adults aged 45?64?years, examined at baseline (1987?89) and followed for cardiovascular events. Bilateral carotid ultrasound for IMT measurements was done at baseline for portions of the common and internal carotid arteries, and carotid bifurcation and also to detect the presence of carotid plaque. Exclusion criteria included baseline anticoagulant use, history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or VTE, and incomplete data. First VTE during follow-up was validated using abstracted medical records. Results:?Among 13?081 individuals followed for a mean of 12.5?years, 225 first VTE events were identified. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of VTE across quartiles of baseline IMT were 1.0, 1.16 (0.77?1.75), 1.64 (1.12?2.40), and 1.52 (1.03?2.25). However, this association disappeared after adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity (HRs: 1.0, 1.06, 1.40, and 1.18). Further adjustment for body mass index and diabetes weakened the relative risks even further. Presence of carotid plaque at baseline also was not associated with VTE occurrence; adjusted HR?=?0.97, 95% CI?=?0.72?1.29. Conclusion:?Increased carotid IMT or presence of carotid plaque was not associated with an increased incidence of VTE in this middle-aged cohort, suggesting subclinical atherosclerosis itself is not a VTE risk factor.

AB  - Summary Platelets play a key role in primary hemostasis. After injury, exposed subendothelium interacts with platelets to activate them through a series of steps including adhesion, aggregation, and the release reaction. Activated platelets in conjunction with the coagulation system form a stable plug to control hemorrhage. Numerous inherited and acquired conditions can lead to platelet dysfunction with variable bleeding. Although rare, the pathophysiologic basis of inherited platelet disorders is better understood than that of the more prevalent acquired conditions. This chapter briefly reviews the structure and function of normal platelets, discusses the various diagnostic tests available to evaluate platelet function, describes some of the more common inherited and acquired qualitative platelet disorders, and provides an overview of their treatment.
