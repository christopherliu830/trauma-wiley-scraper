AB  - Summary This chapter explores the risk factors reported to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The most important risk factors for VTE are a history of previous VTE, recent surgery, hospital in-patient stay and cancer. Pulmonary embolism remains the most widely reported preventable cause of death in patients undergoing surgery. It is the most common cause of death within 30 days of surgery, with 40% of VTE events occurring later than three weeks post operatively. Patients undergoing lower limb surgery are among the highest risk patients (odds ratio?>?10), and this includes total hip and knee arthroplasty, hip/leg fractures, major orthopaedic trauma and spinal surgery. Lower limb immobilisation in casts, with or without surgery, increases the risk of VTE. Approximately 70-80% of fatal hospital-acquired thrombosis (HAT) occurs in medical patients. Venous thrombosis is increased in most acute medical conditions, necessitating hospital admission.

AB  - Aim Blunt injuries to visceral organs have the potential to lead to delayed pseudoaneurysm formation or organ rupture, but current trauma and surgical guidelines do not recommend repetitive imaging. This study examined the incidence and timing of delayed undesirable events and established advisable timing for follow-up imaging and appropriate observational admission. Methods Patients with blunt splenic (S), liver (L), or kidney (K) injury treated with non-operative management (NOM) in our institution were included and retrospectively reviewed. Results From January 2013 to January 2017, 57 patients were admitted with documented blunt visceral organ injuries and 22 patients were excluded. Of 35 patients (L, 10; S, 17; K, 6; L  S  S, 9; K, 1) patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization. Delayed undesirable events occurred in four patients: three patients with splenic pseudoaneurysm on hospital day 6?7 and one patient with splenic delayed rupture on hospital day 7. The second follow-up computed tomography scan carried out 1?2 days after admission did not show any significant findings that could help predict undesirable results of delayed events. The patients with delayed events had longer continuous abdominal pain than that of event-free patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions Undesirable delayed events were recognized on follow-up computed tomography scans in 11.4% of NOM patients at hospital day 6?7 and tended to be associated with high-grade splenic injuries and continuous symptoms. Repetitive screening of these patients 6?7 days after injury might be warranted because of the potential risk of delayed events.

AB  - BACKGROUND The short shelf-life of fresh platelets limits their efficient inventory management and availability during a massive transfusion protocol. Risk of insufficient availability can be mitigated by building an inventory of cryopreserved platelets (CPs). METHODS A comparative study of fresh apheresis platelets (FAPs) and CPs was performed. Type-O CPs were processed with DMSO frozen at ?80°C and reconstituted in thawed AB plasma. All patients enrolled in the study had the following parameters evaluated on admission: vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure), blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and, in trauma patients, international severity score. Several outcomes were evaluated: 30-day survival, adverse events, quantity of administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate and thromboxane (TXA), and laboratory parameters after transfusion (blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level). RESULTS Twenty-five (25) patients in the study group received transfusions totaling 81?units of CPs. Twenty-one (21) patients in the control group received a total of 67?units of FAPs. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics (p?>?0.05) between groups. Both groups were comparable in clinical outcomes (30-day survival, administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate, TXA, and adverse events). Among posttransfusion laboratory parameters, platelet count was higher in the group transfused with FAPs (97.0 ?109/L) than in the group transfused with CPs (41.5 ?109/L), p?=?0.02025. Other parameters were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION The study suggests that CPs are tolerable and a feasible alternative to FAPs. However, larger randomized studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Massive transfusion protocols became common practice between 2006 and 2010. The terminology of ?massive transfusion protocol? was improved to ?massive haemorrhage protocol (MHP)? with the astute recognition that at the start of such a protocol, it is unclear which patients will meet the definition of massive transfusion (10 U/24 h). Despite the majority of the literature being reported from the trauma population, hospitals have generally adopted a single MHP for all patients. It remains unclear whether the same protocol can be used for all patients. MHPs assist with the prevention and management of the acute coagulopathy of trauma/shock (ACOTS). The goals of a MHP are to improve haemostasis, communication and patient outcomes. The protocol must be specific for an individual hospital, depending on factors such as prehospital transport times, distance from laboratory to trauma and operating rooms, patient populations served and types of tests available. The key components of a MHP are the 6Ts: triggering of the protocol, laboratory testing, tranexamic acid, temperature maintenance, transfusion support and termination of the protocol when haemostasis is achieved. The evidence and importance of each of these steps will be discussed in detail. It is also critical that a quality assurance programme supports the MHP. Poor compliance with the institutional MHP is associated with inferior survival. Each MHP activation should be followed by a formal debrief by the team. Audits should be performed to determine compliance and to inform annual update of the MHP. Formal training and/or simulation should be a core part of the policy.

Given the importance of atherothrombotic disorders for the public health system, and the known limitations of conventional treatment on one hand and the compelling biochemical evidence and long-term safety of HELP (Heparin-mediated Extracorporeal LDL/Fibrinogen Precipitation) apheresis on the other hand, this approach provides a most valuable tool for further medical research and treatment of the various atherothrombotic and microcirculatory disorders. The present contribution reviews the recent developments in chronic and single application of apheresis in cardiology with particular emphasis on the newly discovered therapeutic possibilities for myocardial infarction, stroke, and after coronary artery bypass grafting.

AB  - Summary Massive obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality world-wide. Using the Australian and New Zealand Massive Transfusion Registry, we performed a bi-national cohort study of MOH defined as bleeding at ≥20 weeks? gestation or postpartum requiring ≥5 red blood cells (RBC) units within 4 h. Between 2008 and 2015, we identified 249 cases of MOH cases from 19 sites. Predominant causes of MOH were uterine atony (22%), placenta praevia (20%) and obstetric trauma (19%). Intensive care unit admission and/or hysterectomy occurred in 44% and 29% of cases, respectively. There were three deaths. Hypofibrinogenaemia (<2 g/l) occurred in 52% of cases in the first 24 h after massive transfusion commenced; of these cases, 74% received cryoprecipitate. Median values of other haemostatic tests were within accepted limits. Plasma, platelets or cryoprecipitate were transfused in 88%, 66% and 57% of cases, respectively. By multivariate regression, transfusion of ≥6 RBC units before the first cryoprecipitate (odds ratio [OR] 3·5, 95% CI: 1·7?7·2), placenta praevia (OR 7·2, 95% CI: 2·0?26·4) and emergency caesarean section (OR 4·9, 95% CI: 2·0?11·7) were independently associated with increased risk of hysterectomy. These findings confirm MOH as a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and indicate areas for practice improvement.

AB  - Histopathological and immune-histochemical studies were carried out in four cases with multiple lacunes of the central grey matter and in control cases without such lesions. Routine light microscopic techniques were applied on paraffin-embedded material to identify lesions that may represent developing lacunes. In addition, polyclonal antisera to human albumin, IgG, fibrinogen and fibronectin were chosen as markers for extravasated plasma proteins. The brain tissue between lacunes contained several forms of focal injuries which may represent precursors of lacunes. Such lesions included foci of status spongiosus and status cribrosus, regions with dilated extracellular spaces and astrocytic gliosis, and multi-locular cysts. These ?lacune-associated lesions? often included albumin immune-reactivity in extracellular spaces, nerve cell bodies and astrocytes. Less frequently signs of extravasated IgG, fibrinogen and fibronectin were identified. Thus, lacunes of the human brain frequently showed signs of antigenic sites to albumin. The extracellular deposits probably represent extravasated material from the blood. Vasogenic and cytotoxic oedema combined with other factors probably play important roles during the formation of some of the lacunes.

AB  - Abstract This is a population-based prospective study to identify the long-term outcome of children with inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI). Twenty-two survivors were identified and followed up. Only 2 of 22 had no developmental problems at follow-up, 20 of 22 children were having different developmental problems, among them 3 of 22 were severely handicapped. Psychological tests passed 17 of 22, 5 did not pass due to severe handicap (3 children) or were too young (2 patients). Epilepsy was found in 7 of 22, being intractable in 3 cases. Serious motor problems were identified in 5 of 22. Ophthalmologic problems were found in 4 of 22. The most important predictor of adverse outcome was young age at the time of the insult. Conclusion: the outcome of these potentially healthy children is poor. The key question is prevention. Health care professionals should be more concerned about these problems.

AB  - Abstract The outcomes of posterolateral multilevel spine fusion in difficult clinical settings, such as in an aged multi-diseased osteoporotic patient, remain unpredictable. The osteoprogenitor cells in bone marrow decrease with ageing without losing their osteogeneic potential. Autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) from iliac crest aspirate can be concentrated in the operating room and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) can be obtained from a peripheral blood as a source of autologous osteoprogenitor cells and growth factors, respectively. We present the case of an 88 year-old multi-diseased osteoporotic patient affected by cervical stenosis and subjected to C3?C7 posterior decompression, instrumentation and posterolateral fusion, using an intraoperative ?tissue-engineered? composite made of corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from iliac crest aspirate enriched with PRF from peripheral blood. Lateral dynamic X-rays and CT scan showed consolidation signs at 3 months follow-up, with solid C3?C7 fusion at 6 months follow-up. This paper describes a simple and effective method for potentially improving the fusion rate in aged osteoporotic patients by using corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from the iliac crest, enriched with PRF from peripheral blood, rapidly obtained before the surgical procedure.

AB  - Abstract In the last two decades it has become apparent that thrombin has many extravascular effects that are mediated by a family of protease-activated receptors (PARs). PAR-1, -3 and -4 are activated via cleavage by thrombin. The importance of extravascular thrombin in modulating ischemic, hemorrhagic and traumatic injury in brain has recently become clear. Thus, in?vitro, thrombin at low concentration protects neurons and astrocytes from cell death caused by a number of different insults. In?vivo, pretreating the brain with a low dose of thrombin (thrombin preconditioning), attenuates the brain injury induced by a large dose of thrombin, an intracerebral hemorrhage or by focal cerebral ischemia. Thrombin may also be an important mediator of ischemic preconditioning. In contrast, high doses of thrombin kill neurons and astrocytes in?vitro and cause disruption of the blood?brain barrier, brain edema and seizures in?vivo. This review examines the role of thrombin in brain injury and the molecular mechanisms and signaling cascades involved.

AB  - Summary Massive haemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency affecting many patient groups. 5?30% of critically ill patients with major blood loss have an accompanying coagulopathy, and this confers a poor prognosis. Successful treatment of severe bleeding is dependent upon many factors, including early identification of any at-risk patient, recognition and treatment of any accompanying coagulopathy, and the proactive delivery of red blood cells (RBC), to maintain tissue oxygenation, and blood components (FFP, platelets), to target the coagulopathy. This chapter will summarize the general haemostatic changes that occur during major blood loss and detail how this information has helped to drive recent changes to transfusion practices. It will focus on the general management of major blood loss and discuss how this may vary according to the different clinical settings.

AB  - Objectives To document the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and to assess resolution of these abnormalities following corticosteroid therapy. Materials and Methods Steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis was diagnosed based on signalment, physical examination findings, complete blood count, biochemistry and CSF analysis. Echocardiography, C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I were measured in all cases before and 10 to 14 days after commencing corticosteroid therapy. Fibrinogen was also measured in a proportion of dogs. Results Fourteen dogs were prospectively enrolled. Increased cardiac troponin I was identified in five of 14 dogs and echocardiographic abnormalities were detected in 12 of 14 dogs, including spontaneous echo contrast (12 of 14), mild pericardial effusion (five of 14) and mildly decreased fractional shortening (five of 14). All dogs had increased C-reactive protein and fibrinogen was increased in 11 of 12. Corticosteroid treatment was associated with clinical improvement and normalisation of C-reactive protein in all dogs. The cardiac troponin I levels normalised in four of five and fibrinogen had normalised in all five dogs which were retested. Spontaneous echo contrast improved or completely resolved in 12 of 12 and pericardial effusion resolved in five of five dogs. Fractional shortening normalised in two of five dogs. Clinical Significance Cardiac changes are common in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and most resolve with therapy. Further investigation into the cause and significance of these changes is necessary in determining whether antithrombotic therapy or positive inotropic therapy is indicated.

AB  - Summary Over the past 12?years, the United Kingdom Defence Medical Services have evolved an integrated ?damage control resuscitation ? damage control surgery? sequence for the management of patients sustaining complex injuries. During 2009, over 3200?units of blood products were administered as massive transfusions to severely injured UK personnel. An important part of the approach to traumatic bleeding is the early, empirical use of predefined ratios of blood and clotting products. As soon as control of bleeding is achieved, current practice is to switch towards a tailored transfusion, based on clinical and laboratory assessments, including point-of-care coagulation testing. A key goal is to provide resuscitation seamlessly throughout surgery, so that patients leave the operating room with their normal physiology restored. This article outlines the current management of haemorrhage and coagulation employed in Afghanistan from the point of wounding to transfer back to the National Health Service.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Summary The pathophysiology of bleeding, regardless of cause, is complex and ill understood. For traumatic or sudden unexpected haemorrhage, the use of transfusion packs with red cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets being given in ratios of between 1:1 and 1:3 seems reasonable. This removes the requirement for ?wait and see tests? and should be part of an overall resuscitation and stabilisation plan that may improve outcome following sudden haemorrhage. The replacement of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate with low-volume, targeted concentrates is attractive. There is increasing evidence for the efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrates as a single agent. The combination of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates could be powerful and has the possibility to the management of bleeding and improve outcome in patients but, as yet, remains unproven.

AB  - Summary Mass casualty events (MCE) present health systems with a sudden demand on key services. The overall objective of this study was to describe the experience of the National Blood Service (NBS) following the largest UK MCE in recent times. Data was collated from the NBS database and directly from the hospitals involved. All data was collected immediately following the event and included: all blood components requested, issued and transfused in relation to the bombings, blood stock levels at the time and the injury profiles of the casualties transfused. The total NBS order from hospitals for the event was 1455 units of blood components. All requests were fulfilled, this included: 978 units of red cells (RC), 36 doses of platelets, 141 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 300 doses of cryoprecipitate. The amount of blood ordered was three times that initially used and the total number of RC transfused in treating all victims from admission to discharge was approximately 440 units. The greatest use of blood components was for those casualties who had sustained traumatic amputations amongst their injury profile. Published data with which to compare these results is lacking, although the RC use was similar to the initial mean individual usage described in previous military and civilian bombings. The overall implication for any blood service remains, there is now likely to be a far greater demand for plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate in any future incidents involving victims suffering major haemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract The concept that the mammalian glycoprotein vitronectin acts as a biological ?glue? and key controller of mammalian tissue repair and remodelling activity is emerging from nearly 50 years of experimental in vitro and in vivo data. Unexpectedly, the vitronectin-knockout (VN-KO) mouse was found to be viable and to have largely normal phenotype. However, diligent observation revealed that the VN-KO animal exhibits delayed coagulation and poor wound healing. This is interpreted to indicate that VN occupies a role in the earliest events of thrombogenesis and tissue repair. VN is the foundation upon which the thrombus grows in an organised structure. In addition to sealing the wound, the thrombus also serves to protect the underlying tissue from oxidation, is a reservoir of mitogens and tissue repair mediators, and provides a provisional scaffold for the repairing tissue. In the absence of VN (e.g., VN-KO animal), this cascade is disrupted before it begins. A wide variety of biologically active species associate with VN. Although initial studies were focused on mitogens, other classes of bioactives (e.g., glycosaminoglycans and metalloproteinases) are now also known to specifically interact with VN. Although some interactions are transient, others are long-lived and often result in multi-protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes provide several advantages: prolonging molecular interactions, sustaining local concentrations, facilitating co-stimulation of cell surface receptors and thereby enhancing cellular/biological responses. We contend that these, or equivalent, multi-protein complexes facilitate VN polyfunctionality in vivo. It is also likely that many of the species demonstrated to associate with VN in vitro, also associate with VN in vivo in similar multi-protein complexes. Thus, the predominant biological function of VN is that of a master controller of the extracellular environment; informing, and possibly instructing cells ?where? to behave, ?when? to behave and ?how? to behave (i.e., appropriately for the current circumstance). ? 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(10):807-818, 2013

AB  - A novel murine experimental wound infection model was used to assess the efficacy of multi-component immunization against Staphylococcus aureus infection. Necrotic lesions were induced in mice with venom from Bothrops asper and infected with a low inoculum, 1 ? 102 CFU. The wound infection model therefore more resembles a clinical case of S. aureus infection compared with conventional infection models where far more bacteria are required. Before infection, mice were immunized with four recombinant S.aureus proteins expressed from Escherichia coli: (i) domains 1?3 of Extracellular adherence protein (Eap), (ii) Efb ? D (fusion protein combining Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb) and a fibronectin binding domain (D) of the fibronectin binding protein (FnBP) and (iii) clumping factor A (ClfA). In the immunized group, lower bacterial colonization, undisturbed crust formation and significantly faster wound healing were found compared with the unimmunized control group. Efb and Eap have previously been found to impair wound healing and neutralization of these proteins by antibodies restores a more natural wound healing process. This effect is further also enhanced by the proposed opsonic activity of antibodies against ClfA and FnBP.
