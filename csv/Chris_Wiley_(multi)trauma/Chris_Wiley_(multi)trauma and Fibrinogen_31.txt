AB  - Summary The activation and formation of a platelet plug at sites of injured vessels represent a first line defence against bleeding. A significant decrease in platelet numbers of and/or abnormalities in platelet function favour the characteristic skin and mucosal type of bleeding. This chapter deals with common and rare congenital platelet deficiencies and defects the pathogenesis of which has clarified over the last decade while their inheritance patterns and phenotypic penetrance has offered interesting genetic clues. Our classification system is hybrid, partly clinical and partly functional, and the layout of the chapter follows accordingly. A readable format balanced between the old and the new is provided, with an eye towards the future, the genetic treatment of these inherited bleeding disorders.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often considered to be a contraindication to organ donation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of DIC+ donors on kidney recipient (KR) evolution. We identified 169 KRs with DIC+ donation after brain death donors between January 1996 and December 2012 in 6 French transplant centers. Individuals were matched using propensity scores to 338 recipients with DIC? donors according to donor age and sex, whether expanded criteria for the donor existed, graft year, and transplantation center. After kidney transplantation, delayed graft function was observed in 28.1% of DIC+ KRs and in 22.8% of DIC? KRs (NS). Renal allograft survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 94.5%, 89.3%, and 73.9% and 96.2%, 90.8%, and 81.3% in DIC+ KRs and DIC? KRs, respectively (NS). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was similar between DIC+ and DIC? KRs at 3 months, 1 year, and 10 years: 45.9 vs 48.1 mL/min, 42.1 vs 43.1 mL/min, and 33.9 vs 38.1 mL/min, respectively. Delayed calcineurin inhibitor introduction or induction had no impact on delayed graft function rate or eGFR evolution at 10 years after transplantation in DIC+ KRs. Donor DIC did not seem to affect initial outcome, long-term graft function, or allograft survival.

AB  - Abstract This Progress Report reviews recent progress in applying electrospun nanofibers to the emerging field of regenerative medicine. It begins with a brief introduction to electrospinning and nanofibers, with a focus on issues related to the selection of materials, incorporation of bioactive molecules, degradation characteristics, control of mechanical properties, and facilitation of cell infiltration. Next, a number of approaches to fabricate scaffolds from electrospun nanofibers are discussed, including techniques for controlling the alignment of nanofibers and for producing scaffolds with complex architectures. The article also highlights applications of the nanofiber-based scaffolds in four areas of regenerative medicine that involve nerves, dural tissues, tendons, and the tendon-to-bone insertion site. The Progress Report concludes with perspectives on challenges and future directions for design, fabrication, and utilization of scaffolds based on electrospun nanofibers.

AB  - Abstract Desquamative gingivitis is a clinical term to describe red, painful, glazed and friable gingivae which may be a manifestation of some mucocutaneous conditions such as lichen planus or the vesiculobullous disorders. It is important to be aware of this rare clinical entity so as to distinguish desquamative gingivitis from plaque induced gingivitis which is an extremely common condition, easily recognized and treated daily by the dental practitioner. This article gives an overview of desquamative gingivitis, its presentation, the possible causes, diagnosis and treatment. Early recognition of these lesions may prevent delayed diagnosis and inappropriate treatment of potentially serious dermatological diseases.

AB  - 1 Mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented with an intra-aortic catheter, a Königsberg intraventricular pressure transducer and a Döppler flow probe around the left coronary artery. After ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium, the cardiovascular effects of bradykinin B1 and B2 receptor agonists, des-Arg9-bradykinin and bradykinin (BK), were investigated in the presence and absence of specific antagonists. The contribution of nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids to the cardiovascular effects of kinins was also examined. 2 BK (1 ?g kg?1 min?1) and des-Arg9-BK (1 ?g kg?1 min?1) both given as a 2 min i.v. infusion, produced a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP, ?34±4% for BK and ?45±2% for des-Arg9-BK) and coronary vascular resistance (CVR, ?37±5% for BK and ?50±2% for des-Arg9-BK), without affecting cardiac contractility, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and coronary velocity. BK caused a significantly greater decrease in MAP and CVR than des-Arg9-BK (P<0.05). 3 Pretreatment with the B1 receptor antagonist, des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (25 ?g kg?1) significantly inhibited the decrease in MAP and CVR produced by des-Arg9-BK but not by BK. Infusion of des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK alone also induced a significant decrease in MAP and CVR (P<0.05). In the presence of the B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (25 ?g kg?1), only the decreases in MAP and CVR caused by BK were significantly reduced (P<0.05). 4 Inhibition of NO synthase with N?-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG, 45 mg kg?1) significantly (P<0.05) prevented the decrease in CVR but not MAP induced by des-Arg9-BK, whilst responses to BK were not affected by L-NOARG pretreatment. Inhibition of prostanoid synthesis with indomethacin (25 mg kg?1) did not affect the reductions in MAP and CVR induced by des-Arg9-BK or BK. 5 In conclusion, i.v. des-Arg9-BK and BK administration induced reductions in MAP and CVR suggesting that in conscious instrumented dogs both B1 and B2 receptors are present and can affect systemic blood pressure and coronary resistance regulation. Our results also suggest that prostanoids are not involved in the vascular response to kinins and that coronary vascular B1 receptors are at least in part coupled to the release of NO.

AB  - Summary Bleeding and thrombosis are not infrequent problems in children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The exact frequency varies with age, co-morbidity and treatment schedule, but the risk is highest in the first few weeks of treatment when disease and treatment-related haemostatic abnormalities prevail. Recommendations for prevention and management are lacking due to a weak evidence base, resulting in considerable variation in practice. This article describes our personal practice in this area with reference to the available literature on the subject.
