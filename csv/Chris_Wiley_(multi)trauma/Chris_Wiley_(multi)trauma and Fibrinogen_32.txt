AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND:? The responsibilities of the blood bank on-call physician (blood bank physician from here on) encompass many aspects of transfusion medicine and physician education. This physician is available 24?hours a day to address any issues concerning the collection and transfusion of blood and blood components. The purpose of this study was to identify and categorize the issues that may confront a blood bank physician. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:? Each call received over a 4-month period was logged and the resolution documented. The calls were grouped into five categories: donor issues, therapeutic procedure issues, patient issues, physician education issues, and requests for blood components not meeting previously defined transfusion guidelines. RESULTS:? The blood bank physician received 224 calls during the study period. To resolve each issue, an additional 1 to 14 telephone calls were needed to gather further information. Number of calls by category were donor issues, 20 (8.9%); therapeutic procedure issues, 9 (4.0%); patient issues, 4 (1.8%); physician education issues, 33 (14.7%); and requests for blood components not meeting previously defined transfusion guidelines, 158 (70.6%). Requests for blood components were denied in 39.8?percent of the cases not meeting guidelines. Other forms of therapy were warranted in 20.9?percent of the cases. CONCLUSION:? This study revealed that 85.3?percent of the calls referred to the blood bank physician related to physician education and the appropriateness of blood component orders. These results emphasize the need for ongoing education of medical staff in transfusion medicine issues.

AB  - A total of 1,921 leukapheresis procedures have been performed on 532 normal and CIVIL donors at six research institutions, for the purpose of supporting granulocytopenic leukemia patients during infectious episodes. The addition of HES alone or in combination with either etiocholanolone or dexamethasone, resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of leukocytes (granulocytes) harvested by continuous and noncontinuous flow centrifugation. Normal donors participating in these programs were monitored prior to and immediately following each procedure by standard laboratory methods which revealed no serious or abnormal changes occurring as a result of the procedure in those undergoing single or multiple donations with these agents. CIVIL donors tolerated the addition of only HES well, as evidenced by the lack of toxic reactions in three donors undergoing 101 to 121 procedures.

AB  - Background Uncontrolled hemorrhage is responsible for ?80% of the potentially survivable deaths in combat and over 40% of early mortality in the under 65 age group in the United States. Providing an easily used infusible hemostatic agent to first responders could significantly reduce these fatalities. We report on an infusible lyophilized platelet-derived hemostatic agent stabilized with trehalose and polysucrose prior to and during lyophilization. Study Design and Methods Characterization included determining the particle population size range, surface marker expression GPIb, GPIIbIIIa, and Annexin V binding. Function was assessed by aggregation, thromboelastography, and thrombin generation. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and immunogenicity established using Indium111 labeled Thrombosomes in healthy New Zealand white rabbits (NZWRs), efficacy in thrombocytopenic NZWR, and safety in NZWRs, canines, and nonhuman primates. Results Thrombosomes retained GPIIbIIIa expression (98.71%?±?0.18 of the rehydrated particles), a reduced expression of GPIb (47.77%?±?6.65), and Annexin V binding (86.05%?±?2.65). Aggregation to all agonists except thrombin in buffer (78.15%?±?2.5) was <50%. Thrombin generation and thromboelastography results demonstrated a concentration gradient that was consistent from lot to lot. There were no observed adverse events in any safety study and blood loss was reduced by >80% in the thrombocytopenic ear bleed model. Conclusion Our in vitro characterization studies in conjunction with preclinical animal safety and efficacy studies demonstrated lot consistency in manufacturing, maintenance of hemostatic functions of Thrombosomes, safety at high dose concentrations, and the potential to provide an effective hemostatic agent at the site of injury.

AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism is a major public health issue, for it is responsible for an estimated 60,000 annual deaths in the United Kingdom. Up to 30% of those affected by deep vein thrombosis have post phlebitic syndrome. Of these 55% are hospital ? acquired, the majority of which can be prevented by appropriate thromboprophylaxis. The main risk factors for venous thromboembolism include immobility, venous perturbation and a prothrombotic state. This chapter covers the diagnosis and immediate management of acute venous thromboembolisms including in pregnancy and in those with an underlying malignancy. The principles of primary and secondary prevention are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.
