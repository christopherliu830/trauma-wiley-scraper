AB  - Summary This chapter addresses strategies for autologous transfusion, various blood-derived biologicals, non-blood-derived drugs and strategies to prevent haemorrhage and manage haemostatic disorders. The criteria for accepting donors for autologous transfusion need not be as strict as those for allogeneic transfusion. Preoperative assessment can identify anemia with correctable cause and contribute to avoidance of allogeneic transfusion. The major cause of anaemia in patients with end-stage renal disease is a lack of production of erythropoietin. The major side-effects of treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) are hypertension and thrombotic episodes, originally thought to be related primarily to excessive doses and too rapid correction of anaemia. Anaphylaxis, the major toxicity associated with vitamin K, is rare, but dramatic. Thrombin is a potent plasma-derived enzyme that is formed from prothrombin as a result of activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways.

AB  - Abstract Vascular anomalies (VAs) are classified as tumors or malformations depending on their clinical characteristics, pathological diagnosis, and genomic information. Diagnosis can be challenging because of the heterogeneity of clinical presentation; thus, the best diagnosis and care are provided by an interdisciplinary team of specialists. Over the past 10 years, an increasing number of pediatric hematologist/oncologists are caring for patients with VAs secondary to new medical therapy options and clinical trials. This paper focuses on complicated VA issues often seen by the pediatric hematologist/oncologist. The paper reviews clinical pearls on diagnosis, histology, radiology, and treatment options.

AB  - It has been recognized for some time that cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are, to a major extent, inflammatory disorders associated with an environment characterized by a sedentary lifestyle together with abundant intakes of calories. Systemic low-level inflammation is suggested to be a cause as well as consequence of pathological processes with local tumor necrosis factor α production as an important biological driver. It is hypothesized that physical inactivity contributes to an enhanced proinflammatory burden independently of obesity, as regular muscle contractions mediate signals with myokines/cytokines as important messengers, which suppress proinflammatory activity at distant sites as well as within skeletal muscle. Muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to possess a central role in anti-inflammatory activities and health beneficial effects in relation to physical exercise. It is discussed how this fits the consistent observation that enhanced plasma levels of IL-6 represent a strong risk marker in chronic disorders associated with systemic low-level inflammation and all-cause mortality.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.

AB  - Summary Mechanical devices used to support the failing heart or respiratory systems continue to improve and their use is continuing to increase. As outcomes have improved the number of indications for use has increased and the threshold for use continues to decline, recognizing that a persistent low cardiac output state has greater risk of organ injury or death than institution of mechanical support of the circulation. Likewise, higher pressure of mechanical ventilator support can produce greater injury to the lung than the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The most rapid area of advancement is in the long-term use of ventricular assist devices. Children with previous terminal conditions can now be supported for many months and eventually undergo heart transplantation if their heart does not recover. Echocardiography plays an essential role in determining when mechanical support of the circulation is indicated, and for accurate placement and de-airing of devices. With the smaller surface area of new mechanical devices, there is less blood exposure to artificial surface and therefore reduced need for anticoagulation; however, thromboembolic and bleeding complications remain relatively high.

AB  - Abstract Humans have long appreciated silk for its lustrous appeal and remarkable physical properties, yet as the mysteries of silk are unraveled, it becomes clear that this outstanding biopolymer is more than a high-tech fiber. This progress report provides a critical but detailed insight into the biomedical use of silk. This journey begins with a historical perspective of silk and its uses, including the long-standing desire to reverse engineer silk. Selected silk structure?function relationships are then examined to appreciate past and current silk challenges. From this, biocompatibility and biodegradation are reviewed with a specific focus of silk performance in humans. The current clinical uses of silk (e.g., sutures, surgical meshes, and fabrics) are discussed, as well as clinical trials (e.g., wound healing, tissue engineering) and emerging biomedical applications of silk across selected formats, such as silk solution, films, scaffolds, electrospun materials, hydrogels, and particles. The journey finishes with a look at the roadmap of next-generation recombinant silks, especially the development pipeline of this new industry for clinical use.

AB  - Part I was an overview of the role and function of proteoglycans and glycoproteins in the pulpo?dentin complex; part II will focus on enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors. This review will discuss current knowledge regarding matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, serum proteins, and growth factors in dentin and the related dentin?pulp complex in an attempt to better understand their nature, role, and function in the dentin extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Dentin formation in physiological and pathological conditions has been widely studied. However, the regulation and involvement of non-collageneous enzymes, serum proteins, and growth factors are still not completely elucidated. MMPs, a family of 23 endopeptidases in humans, are collectively capable of degrading virtually all ECM components, and their specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs: tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases) participate in organo- and morphogenesis, physiological tissue turnover, and pathological tissue destruction. Similarly, the lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsins) are capable of degrading ECM proteins such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. These enzymes are implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, especially in diseases involving tissue re-modeling states. Dentin also contains serum-derived proteins (such as albumin, immunoglobulins, and transferrin), and a variety of growth factors in the mineralized ECM are available for release during demineralization or other injury. A detailed description of the components of the above-mentioned dentin non-collageneous proteins will be summarized in this literature review.
