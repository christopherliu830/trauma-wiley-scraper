AB  - Abstract Bone is a dynamic tissue that remodels continuously in response to local mechanical and chemical stimuli. This process can also result in maladaptive ectopic bone in response to injury, yet pathological differences at the molecular and structural levels are poorly understood. A number of in vivo models exist but can often be too complex to allow isolation of factors which may stimulate disease progression. A self-structuring model of bone formation is presented using a fibrin gel cast between two calcium phosphate ceramic anchors. Femoral periosteal cells, seeded into these structures, deposit an ordered matrix that closely resembles mature bone in terms of chemistry (collagen:mineral ratio) and structure, which is adapted over a period of one year in culture. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction confirm that the mineral is hydroxyapatite associated with collagen. Second-harmonic imaging demonstrates that collagen is organized similarly to mature mouse femora. Remarkably, cells differentiated to the osteocyte phase are linked by canaliculi (as demonstrated with nano-computed tomography) and remained viable over the full year of culture. It is demonstrated that novel drugs can prevent ossification in constructs. This model can be employed to study bone formation in an effort to encourage or prevent ossification in a range of pathologies.

AB  - Abstract Proteomics analysis of bovine bronchoalveolar fluid (BAF) following induction of pneumonia with Mannheimia haemolytica using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) resulted in the identification of 88 unique proteins. Proteins detected in BAF included antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), complement factors, acute-phase proteins, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in oxidation?reduction. Notwithstanding biological variation, differences in relative protein abundance, determined using normalized peptide counts, were detected for select proteins in BAF from genuinely infected versus sham-infected animals. To demonstrate the applicability of using normalized peptide counts to assess protein expression trends, LC-MS/MS data for the acute-phase protein haptoglobin (HPT) were compared with ELISA data, and statistical evaluation of the relationship between the data revealed a strong measure of association. Differences were detected between sham- and genuinely infected animals for haptoglobin, as well as the AMPs cathelicidin-1 and cathelicidin-4, and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain-4, a fairly novel protein involved in the acute phase response. Though the small sample size limited the scope of the inferences, the results indicate the likely importance of AMPs and acute-phase proteins during respiratory infection, and provide additional information regarding potential mechanisms involved in the bovine mucosal barrier defense.

AB  - Summary Background Thrombotic events (TEs) are serious adverse events that can occur following administration of clotting factors (CFs). Objectives To evaluate occurrence of same-day TEs for different CF products and potential risk factors. Methods A retrospective cohort study of individuals exposed to CF products during 2008?2013 was conducted using a large commercial insurance database. CF products were identified by procedure codes, and TEs were ascertained via diagnosis codes. Crude same-day TE rates (per 1000 persons exposed) were estimated overall and by congenital factor deficiency (CFD) status, CF products, age and gender. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to control for confounding. Laboratory analysis was used to compare the procoagulant activities of FIX products. Results Of 3801 individuals exposed to CFs, 117 (30.8 per 1000) had same-day TEs recorded. The crude same-day TE rate was higher for CF users without CFD, 70.2 (102 of 1452), as compared with those with CFD, 6.4 (15 of 2349) (RR, 11.0; 95% CI, 6.4?18.9). For individuals without CFD, a significantly increased same-day TE risk was identified for factor IX complex (OR, 6.92; 95% CI, 3.11?15.40), factor VIIa (OR, 9.42; 95% CI, 4.99?17.78) and other products when compared with fibrin sealant. An increased risk of a TE was found with older age (≥ 45 years), history of TEs and underlying health conditions. The laboratory identified elevated procoagulant activity in Profilnine? and Benefix?. Conclusions The study shows an increased same-day TE risk for CF users without CFD and suggests substantial off-label CF use. The study findings also show elevated same-day TE rates for different CF products and suggest the importance of product properties and patient factors.

AB  - Abstract Patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) and haemophilia A (HA) lack, to varying degrees, the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) that are critical for normal haemostasis. These conditions in turn make patients prone to uncontrolled bleeding. Historically, patients with severe forms of VWD or HA were crippled before adulthood and their life expectancy was significantly reduced. Over the past decades, specific coagulation factor replacement therapies including Haemate?P, have been developed to help patients achieve and maintain normal haemostasis. Haemate?P is a human, plasma-derived VWF/FVIII medicinal product, which was first licensed in Germany in 1981 for the treatment of HA-associated bleeding. It has since then come to be accepted as the gold standard for both the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in VWD, especially in cases where desmopressin [1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP)] has been ineffective. Haemate?P was the first effectively virus-inactivated (pasteurisation: 60°C for 10?h in aqueous solution) FVIII product, whereby the risk of potentially threatening infective complications of plasma-derived products was reduced. Haemate?P was also shown to have a VWF multimer profile remarkably close to that of normal plasma. This bibliographic review presents previously unpublished clinical data of Haemate?P, based upon internal clinical study reports of the proprietor, CSL Behring, in addition to data already presented in other publications. The data demonstrate a predictable and well-characterised pharmacokinetic profile, and a proven record of short- and long-term safety, while effectively correcting the haemostatic defects in VWD and HA. Recently available data have also shown Haemate?P to be of haemostatic value in exceptional clinical circumstances including surgical interventions. By virtue of its plasma-derived combination of VWF and FVIII, in addition to its high VWF:FVIII content ratio (2.4:1), Haemate?P is also associated with successful immune tolerance induction in those patients developing inhibitor antibodies. Although the theoretical risk of thromboembolic complications does exist while receiving Haemate?P, as it does with any FVIII replacement therapy, the incidence of such complications has remained notably low. Given the robust data that have accumulated for the use of Haemate?P, dosing recommendations are also described in this review; the recommendations are tailored to patient-specific contexts including baseline VWF and FVIII levels in plasma and the type of surgical intervention being undertaken. A wide variety of studies have also provided data on paediatric and geriatric populations, all of which have suggested that Haemate?P can be safely and effectively used in a wide variety of clinical circumstances.

AB  - Although the physiological role of beta2-glycoprotein I (B2GPI) is unknown, in vitro evidence indicates that B2GPI may be a natural anticoagulant. In this study we have examined whether fluctuations of plasma B2GPI occur in in vivo coagulation. Serial measurements of B2GPI and other anticoagulant proteins were performed in 51 patients with thrombotic (group 1: six patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), group 2: venous (n=4) or arterial (n=17) thrombosis) and non-thrombotic disease (group 3: 24 patients undergoing elective surgery). Reductions in plasma B2GPI levels were seen in most patients which were roughly proportional to the severity of their illness. Particularly striking reductions of B2GPI, protein C (PC) and antithrombin III (AT-III) (mean ±?95% CI: 42.7?±?8.6%, 42.1?±?14.8%, 39.1?±?28.4% respectively) were seen in group 1. The reductions in plasma B2GPI were significantly greater in group 1 than in the other groups. Dilutional factors explain most of the reductions in B2GPI, PC and AT-III in groups 2 and 3, but contribute little to group 1. In conclusion, although B2GPI behaves as a ?negative acute phase reactant?, the magnitude of reduction of plasma B2GPI levels, accompanied by reductions in other anticoagulant proteins in patients with DIC, suggests specific consumption of B2GPI in in vivo coagulation. This study provides further evidence that B2GPI is an anticoagulant of physiological importance.

AB  - Abstract Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used for most severe acute respiratory distress syndrome cases in specialized centers. Hemocompatibility of devices depends on the size and modification of blood contacting surfaces as well as blood flow rates. An interventional lung assist using arteriovenous perfusion of a low-resistance oxygenator without a blood pump (Novalung, Hechingen, Germany) or a miniaturized ECMO with reduced filling volume and a diagonal blood pump (Deltastream, Medos AG, Stolberg, Germany) could optimize hemocompatibility. The aim of the study was to compare hemocompatibility with conventional ECMO. Female pigs were connected to extracorporeal circulation for 24?h after lavage induced lung injury (eight per group). Activation of coagulation and immune system as well as blood cell damage was measured. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. Plasmatic coagulation was slightly activated in all groups demonstrated by increased thrombin-anti-thrombin III-complex. No clinical signs of bleeding or thromboembolism occurred. Thrombelastography revealed decreased clotting capacities after miniaturized ECMO, probably due to significantly reduced platelet count. These resulted in reduced dosage of intravenous heparin. Scanning electron microscopy of oxygenator fibers showed significantly increased binding and shape change of platelets after interventional lung assist. In all groups, hemolysis remained negligible, indicated by low plasma hemoglobin concentration. Interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentration as well as leukocyte count remained unchanged. Both devices demonstrated adequate hemocompatibility for safe clinical application, although a missing blood pump did not increase hemocompatibility. Further studies seem necessary to analyze the influence of different blood pumps on platelet drop systematically.

AB  - Summary As perioperative transfusions account for greater than half of the more than 20 million units of blood and blood products that are administered each year in the United States, strategies to limit the use of allogeneic blood products will need to be focused on the perioperative period. Additionally, given the acuity of illness of surgical patients and the impact of a many surgical procedure on homeostasis, avoidance of perioperative transfusions may greatly alter patient outcomes including the incidence of nosocomial infections, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, length or stay and even mortality. Of the surgical procedures recognized as being associated with significant blood loss, cardiothoracic, hepatic and major orthopedic procedures especially those involving the hip, pelvis and spine lead the list with estimated losses that may exceed one-half to an entire blood volume. Given these issues, there remains a significant need to avoid or limit the use of allogeneic blood products especially during the perioperative period and in critically ill patients. The following chapter reviews several of the potential options for limiting allogeneic blood product use during the perioperative period. Techniques to be reviewed include: (1) general considerations such as the optimization of preoperative coagulation function, correction of preoperative anemia, and intraoperative anesthetic technique including fluid therapy, proper patient positioning, and maintenance of normothermia; (2) autologous transfusion therapy including preoperative donation or intraoperative collection using acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) with or without the use of erythropoietin as well as intraoperative and postoperative blood salvage; (3) pharmacologic manipulation of the coagulation cascade with anti-fibrinolytic agents, desmopressin (DDAVP), recombinant coagulation factors (VII and XIII) or novel agents undergoing phase II and III trials; and (4) controlled hypotension. In many instances, the performance of major surgical procedures without the use of allogeneic blood products can only be accomplished by combining several of these techniques.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? To study the incidence, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in breast cancer patients using a PICC catheter for chemotherapy. Methods:? The data of the incidence, diagnosis and treatment of PICC-related upper extremity DVT in 187 breast cancer patients using a PICC catheter for chemotherapy, from August 2009 to July 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Results:? In total 188 PICC were inserted between August 2009 and July 2011 and followed up for a total of 14?399 catheter-days (median placement, 76.6?days; range, 1 to 170?days). Four (2.1%) of 188 PICC were removed as a result of PICC-related upper extremity DVT in 14 to 112 catheter-days, at a rate of 0.28/1000 catheter-days. Conclusion:? The use of PICCs in breast cancer patients for chemotherapy is safe and effective. However, some patients may develop catheter-related upper extremity DVT. In order to minimize complications, we should pay attention to its early symptoms and signs, as well as the timely removal of the catheter and appropriate anti-coagulant treatment.

AB  - Summary The haemostatic or coagulant system is designed primarily to prevent bleeding and haemorrhage following injury to blood vessels, although some of its constituent proteins have additional roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. This chapter describes the function and components of the haemostatic system and its role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It explores the effect of variants in genes coding for proteins in the haemostatic system on cardiovascular risk. The chapter describes the effect of dietary components on the haemostatic system, both directly and via the development of chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Platelets have a key function in normal haemostasis and are activated by a number of agonists, particularly thrombin, collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and also adrenaline and serotonin, some of which act synergistically in vivo with other agonists. The fibrinolytic system regulates the degradation of the fibrin matrix. It consists of fibrinolytic factors and fibrinolysis inhibitors.

AB  - Abstract A randomized, controlled clinical study of the management of diffuse bleeding with CoStasis? surgical hemostat, a new hemostat containing bovine thrombin and collagen with the patient's own plasma, included patients undergoing cardiac, hepatic, iliac, and general surgery. Sera from 92 patients treated with CoStasis and 84 control patients were collected preoperatively and at a post surgical follow-up of 8 weeks. Among the control group, 57 patients were treated with Instat? collagen sponge in noncardiac indications. Results showed that antibody responses in the CoStasis clinical study were similar to the reported literature for all antigens screened and were not associated with any adverse reactions. The bovine thrombin preparations in CoStasis and other commercially available thrombins were compared with the use of SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. Within this clinical study, CoStasis was shown to be a safe and effective hemostatic product containing bovine thrombin and bovine collagen and no pooled human blood products. ? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
