AB  - Abstract A randomized, controlled clinical study of the management of diffuse bleeding with CoStasis? surgical hemostat, a new hemostat containing bovine thrombin and collagen with the patient's own plasma, included patients undergoing cardiac, hepatic, iliac, and general surgery. Sera from 92 patients treated with CoStasis and 84 control patients were collected preoperatively and at a post surgical follow-up of 8 weeks. Among the control group, 57 patients were treated with Instat? collagen sponge in noncardiac indications. Results showed that antibody responses in the CoStasis clinical study were similar to the reported literature for all antigens screened and were not associated with any adverse reactions. The bovine thrombin preparations in CoStasis and other commercially available thrombins were compared with the use of SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. Within this clinical study, CoStasis was shown to be a safe and effective hemostatic product containing bovine thrombin and bovine collagen and no pooled human blood products. ? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Due to advances in caring for critically ill children and those with chronic diseases, rates of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are increasing in children. Risk factors consist of central venous catheters, chronic medical conditions, thrombophilia, and various medications. Compression Doppler ultrasonography is the method most commonly used to diagnose DVT, and patients will usually present with pain and swelling of the affected limb. Anticoagulation via subcutaneous injection is the most common treatment regime for children with DVT, and the new, direct oral anticoagulants are currently under investigation. Prevention techniques are not established, but clinical studies are addressing this need.

AB  - Bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules and the clinical consequences have been recognized for over a century. However, while many components of the infected dentinal tubule microflora have been identified, it is likely that there are etiological agents involved in endodontic infections that have not yet been recognized. Bacterial invasion of coronal dentinal tubules occurs when the dentine is exposed to the oral environment and of radicular dentinal tubules subsequent to infection of the root canal system or as a consequence of periodontal disease. The content and architecture of a dentinal tubule can influence bacterial invasion, with tubule patency being important. This can account for regional variations in bacterial invasion and is particularly seen with dentinal sclerosis, where more advanced sclerotic changes in apical radicular tubules, especially in elderly individuals, limit bacterial invasion in this area. While several hundred bacterial species are known to inhabit the oral cavity, a relatively small and select group of bacteria are involved in invasion of dentinal tubules. Gram-positive organisms dominate the tubule microflora in both carious and non-carious dentine. The relatively high numbers of obligate anaerobes present, such as Eubacterium spp., Propionibacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus micros, and Veillonella spp., suggests that the environment favors the growth of these bacteria. Gram-negative obligate anaerobic rods, e.g. Porphyromonas spp., are less frequently recovered; however, with time, fastidious obligately anaerobic bacteria become established as principal components of the microflora and can be found within the deep dentine layers. In the early stages of infection, Gram-positive bacteria dominate the microflora. The identification of adhesins that mediate these initial interactions of bacteria with dentine is important for understanding the development of tubule infection and in designing adhesion-blocking compounds. Recent evidence suggests that streptococci and enterococci may recognize components present within dentinal tubules, such as collagen type I, which stimulate bacterial adhesion and intra-tubular growth. Specific interactions of other oral bacteria with invading streptococci may then facilitate invasion of dentine by select bacteria. It is important therefore that the mechanisms of invasion and inter-bacterial adhesion are understood to assist development of novel control strategies.

AB  - Recent studies describe families with both elevated plasma HRG levels and thrombosis. In order to study the possibility that allelic variants of the HRG locus are associated with differences in HRG level, we studied linkage between HRG levels and a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in a Dutch family which was selected on the presence of both thrombosis and elevated plasma HRG levels. No other known risk factors from thrombosis were found in this family. Linkage was calculated between the dinucleotide repeat and the HRG level considering the HRG level as a quantitative phenotype assuming a population prevalence of elevated HRG of 5%. Two classes of HRG levels were defined by a mean and a variance: one class with normal HRG levels and a second class with high HRG levels. Using a mean HRG level of 99% for individuals with a normal HRG level and 145% for individuals with high HRG, a maximum lod score of 4.17 (odds in favour of linkage of 22 000:1) was found at a recombination fraction of 0, indicating linkage. Considering the pedigree, an association was found between the presence of a specific allele (no. 6) of the dinucleotide repeat polymorphism and plasma HRG levels. Family members carrying allele 6 were found to have higher HRG plasma levels compared with family members lacking allele 6 (149% v 109% respectively). We conclude that in this family, linkage is found between the HRG locus and the HRG level, and that a HRG gene coupled to allele 6 of the dinucleotide polymorphism is associated with elevated plasma HRG levels. No evidence was found for a causal relationship between elevated plasma HRG levels and thrombosis in this family.

AB  - Introduction Previous guidelines recommend that FXI:C levels should be used to monitor FXI replacement in factor XI (FXI) deficiency. However, FXI:C levels do not correlate with bleeding tendency in this disorder and may not be the optimal test by which to monitor and determine further treatment in the postoperative period. Aim To assess whether the thrombin generation assay (TGA) and rotational thromboelastometry can be used to monitor FXI replacement peri-operatively in FXI deficiency and to determine if changes in FXI:C levels correlate with changes in thrombin generation and clot formation parameters following treatment with solvent-detergent fresh frozen plasma (SD-FFP). Methods The TGA and rotational thromboelastometry were used to measure thrombin generation and clot formation in 11 adults with FXI deficiency who were treated with either SD-FFP (n = 8) or FXI concentrate (n = 3) as prophylaxis peri-operatively. Blood samples were taken pre- and 30 min post-treatment. Results Global haemostasis assays can be used to measure the effect of FXI replacement with SD-FFP or FXI concentrate in FXI deficiency. Both treatment types improved thrombin generation and clot formation. However, the remaining response to treatment at 24 h post SD-FFP was variable and changes in FXI:C levels were not predictive of changes in thrombin generation/thromboelastometry parameters after treatment with SD-FFP. Conclusion Global haemostasis assays may provide a more reliable means of monitoring SD-FFP treatment with the potential to prevent individuals receiving unnecessary treatment, however, their clinical use in decision making needs to be tested in a larger prospective study.

AB  - Abstract This review focuses on hydrogels and their patterning techniques in relation to central nervous system applications, with emphasis on synthetic and natural materials and chemical and topographical patterning techniques. We describe the properties of hydrogel materials and various techniques used in hydrogel patterning methods. Also, the applicability and utilization of patterned hydrogels with neural cells is discussed. Surface chemistry and topography significantly affect cell behaviour, including cell attachment, migration and maturation. Although several patterning techniques are described in the literature, a review of techniques applicable to hydrogel materials is needed. Use of these patterned cell?hydrogel constructs might provide novel ways to treat central nervous system deficits in the future. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary.? This review describes the background for the development of recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa; NovoSeven) for use in haemophilic patients with inhibitors. The first proof of principle for using pharmacological doses of FVIIa as a haemostatic agent was obtained by producing small amounts of pure plasma-derived FVIIa, which showed encouraging effect in two patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors. To make pure FVIIa available for use in a larger number of patients, rFVIIa was produced that was approved for use in patients with inhibitors against coagulation factors (congenital haemophilia and acquired haemophilia) in 1996 (EU), 1999 (USA) and 2000 (Japan). The efficacy rate in severe bleedings and in major surgery including major orthopaedic surgery has been found to be around 90% in controlled studies, and no serious safety concerns have been demonstrated. The availability of rFVIIa has facilitated the performance of elective major surgery in haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Further steps along the vision of providing a treatment for inhibitor patients similar to non-inhibitor patients have been the efficacy of rFVIIa in home-treatment and recently the encouraging experience in prophylaxis. The concept of using pharmacological doses of rFVIIa as a haemostatic agent is a new one, which has caused difficulties in finding the correct dose. A step forward has been the demonstration that similar efficacy can be achieved after one single dose of 270??g?kg?1 instead of three injections of a dose of 90??g?kg?1. The higher clearance rate in children suggests that higher doses may be beneficial in children. The availability of rFVIIa has made advances in the understanding of coagulation processes possible. In a cell-based in vitro model, it has been shown that rFVIIa binds to preactivated platelets if present in concentrations of 30?nm or higher. By doing so, it activates FX into FXa and enhances the thrombin generation on the activated platelet surface in the absence of FVIII/FIX. Through the increased thrombin generation, a firm, well-structured fibrin haemostatic plug, which is resistant to premature lysis, is formed. By exploiting this mechanism of action, rFVIIa may also be effective in situations other than haemophilia, characterized by an impaired thrombin generation.

AB  - The course; of nine pigs which died shortly after liver transplantation was compared with that of the other nine which survived in a series of 18 consecutive transplants. The only significant differences were found to be the development of an inexorable metabolic acidosis, and the recognition of focal hepatic necrosis observed histologically in the non-survivors. The suggestion is made that progressive hepatic damage may develop, and may cause death in some animals which is not explained on obvious mechanical grounds.

AB  - Summary Background Patients undergoing major cardiothoracic surgery are subjected to dilution, owing to massive fluid infusion and blood component transfusion. These patients may experience bleeding perioperatively, and are frequently treated with the endothelium-activating agent desmopressin. Objectives To investigate the effect of desmopressin administration on von Willebrand factor (VWF)-dependent coagulant and platelet functions under flow conditions. Patients/methods Blood from 16 patients with postoperative bleeding was obtained before and after desmopressin treatment (0.3 ?g kg?1 body weight), and assessed for coagulant properties and platelet function. Furthermore, VWF antigen levels and multimer composition were determined in both samples. Results Desmopressin treatment did not change thrombin generation in plasma or whole blood thromboelasticity. Also coagulation factor levels (other than factor VIII) and coagulation times were unchanged, suggesting that desmopressin treatment did not have a major effect on the coagulant activity. On the other hand, desmopressin treatment raised the already high plasma levels of VWF from a median of 116 IU mL?1 (interquartile range [IQR] 102?154 IU mL?1) to a median of 160 IU mL?1 (IQR 126?187 IU mL?1) (P = 0.007), owing to accumulation of the high molecular weight VWF multimers. Furthermore, desmopressin treatment caused an increase in collagen-dependent thrombus formation and platelet phosphatidylserine exposure. Markers of thrombus formation correlated with the plasma levels of VWF. In vitro control experiments confirmed a major contribution of VWF to thrombus formation and procoagulant activity under conditions of blood dilution. Conclusions Desmopressin treatment of patients with bleeding complications after cardiothoracic surgery induces the release of high molecular weight VWF multimers, which enhance platelet activation and thrombus formation under flow conditions.
