AB  - Measurement of blood viscoelasticity during clotting provides a direct metric of haemostatic conditions. Therefore, technologies that quantify blood viscoelasticity at the point-of-care are invaluable for diagnosing coagulopathies. We present a new approach, Optical Thromboelastography (OTEG) that measures the viscoelastic properties of coagulating blood by evaluating temporal laser speckle fluctuations, reflected from a few blood drops. During coagulation, platelet-fibrin clot formation restricts the mean square displacements (MSD) of scatterers and decelerates speckle fluctuations. Cross-correlation analysis of speckle frames provides the speckle intensity temporal autocorrelation, g2(t), from which MSD is deduced and the viscoelastic modulus of blood is estimated. Our results demonstrate a close correspondence between blood viscoelasticity evaluated by OTEG and mechanical rheometry. Spatio-temporal speckle analyses yield 2-dimensional maps of clot viscoelasticity, enabling the identification of micro-clot formation at distinct rates in normal and coagulopathic specimens. These findings confirm the unique capability of OTEG for the rapid evaluation of patients' coagulation status and highlight the potential for point-of-care use. (? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co.

AB  - Abstract Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2-CDG) is the most common congenital disorder of N-glycosylation and is caused by a deficient PMM2 activity. The clinical presentation and the onset of PMM2-CDG vary among affected individuals ranging from a severe antenatal presentation with multisystem involvement to mild adulthood presentation limited to minor neurological involvement. Management of affected patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, a systematic review of the literature on PMM2-CDG was conducted by a group of international experts in different aspects of CDG. Our managment guidelines were initiated based on the available evidence-based data and experts' opinions. This guideline mainly addresses the clinical evaluation of each system/organ involved in PMM2-CDG, and the recommended management approach. It is the first systematic review of current practices in PMM2-CDG and the first guidelines aiming at establishing a practical approach to the recognition, diagnosis and management of PMM2-CDG patients.

AB  - Abstract The new oral anticoagulants may prove to be one of most significant innovations in clinical practice in the past 60 years. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct inhibitors of Factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits Factor IIa. The predictable pharmacological profile of these new agents allows physicians to prescribe these drugs without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, which is the mainstay of warfarin therapy. In addition, these new agents have not been shown to have any food interactions and minimal drug?drug interactions, interactions are limited to the p-glycoprotein (p-Gp) transporter or cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system, each drug is unique in its drug interaction profile, as will be discussed below. These unique pharmacokinetics profiles may usher in for clinicians a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. In this article, the pharmacology of these new oral anticoagulants will be reviewed along with the major clinical trials evaluating the use of these agents for thromboembolic prophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplastic surgery, the treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The antiplatelet drugs, aspirin and clopidogrel, are widely prescribed for cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. It is recommended that these drugs should be ceased 5 days prior to elective surgery. If patients on these drugs require emergency non-cardiac surgery, the peri-operative risk of haemorrhage and thrombosis causes management dilemmas. Current guidelines are limited to the management of patients with coronary stents who are on antiplatelet drugs and require elective surgery. There is no universal evidence-based consensus, for the indications, method, timing or endpoints of treatment to reverse the antiplatelet action of clopidogrel in patients requiring emergency non-cardiac surgery. Aim To report two cases where emergency abdominal surgery was required in patients on concomitant clopidogrel and aspirin. Clinical details and outcome Two patients who were on concomitant aspirin and clopidogrel required urgent abdominal surgery. The two cases were managed differently. In the first case, no pre-operative platelets or fresh frozen plasma were administered and surgery was complicated by major bleeding. The second patient received pre-operative platelet transfusion and encountered no significant bleeding or thrombotic complications. Conclusion There is an urgent need for the development of guidelines to manage patients receiving antiplatelet drugs requiring emergency non-cardiac surgery.

AB  - Summary These guidelines address developmental aspects of neonatal haemostasis and thrombosis, the laboratory investigation of the neonate, and the diagnosis and clinical management of haemostatic and thrombotic conditions occurring in this period (defined as the first 4?weeks of life following birth). Relevant scientific papers were identified by a systematic literature review from Medline 1975?2000 using index terms which incorporated the various component subjects of these guidelines. Further publications were obtained from the references cited and from reviews known to the members of the working party and to the Haemostasis and Thrombosis Task Force. Evidence and graded recommendations presented in these guidelines are in accordance with the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, as described in the Appendix. It will be noted that there is a lack of a strong evidence base for many of the recommendations suggested, as the appropriate clinical and laboratory trials have not been and perhaps never will be undertaken in neonates. Most of the recommendations are therefore of Grade C evidence levels IV: higher levels are mentioned specifically throughout the document when relevant.

AB  - Abstract Acute limb ischaemia poses a threat to both the limb and life of a patient. Until recently, attempted revascularization by thrombo-embolectomy or vascular reconstruction held the best chance of limb salvage. Thrombolytic techniques afford an alternative method of management for this condition and are effective in selected patients. Low-dose intra-arterial streptokinase is the most established method of thrombolysis, although the recently developed tissue plasminogen activator offers a promising alternative. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is not an easy option, being labour intensive and requiring close co-operation between surgeon and radiologist. Thrombolytic and surgical techniques are not mutually exclusive but are best used to complement each other. Ideally patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by surgeons with knowledge of, and access to, optimal current surgical and non-surgical techniques.

AB  - Abstract Engineering complex tissues requires a precisely formulated combination of cells, spatiotemporally released bioactive factors, and a specialized scaffold support system. Injectable materials, particularly those delivered in aqueous solution, are considered ideal delivery vehicles for cells and bioactive factors and can also be delivered through minimally invasive methods and fill complex 3D shapes. In this review, we examine injectable materials that form scaffolds or networks capable of both replacing tissue function early after delivery and supporting tissue regeneration over a time period of weeks to months. The use of these materials for tissue engineering within the craniofacial complex is challenging but ideal as many highly specialized and functional tissues reside within a small volume in the craniofacial structures and the need for minimally invasive interventions is desirable due to aesthetic considerations. Current biomaterials and strategies used to treat craniofacial defects are examined, followed by a review of craniofacial tissue engineering, and finally an examination of current technologies used for injectable scaffold development and drug and cell delivery using these materials.
