AB  - Summary. Background:? Orthopedic surgery, especially total knee and total hip arthroplasty, is considered a risk factor for peri-operative venous thromboembolism. Objectives:? This study evaluates how accelerated inflammatogenic cellular interactions and the subsequent production of tissue factor and CD40 ligand play an important role in the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism. Patients and methods:? Twenty-four patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to groups with (Ti; n?=?12) and without (Tn; n?=?12) pneumatic tourniquet inflation. Results:? Numbers of leukocyte-platelet aggregates, especially those comprising monocytes-platelets in central venous blood from the Ti group, were increased during the peri-operative period (P?<?0.01), and returned to the baseline level at 24?h after starting surgery. Levels of PAC-1, P-selectin, CD40 ligand, tissue factor, Mac-1 expression on monocytes including monocyte-platelet aggregates, and the number of microparticles including those of endothelial cell origin were noticeably increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Whole blood coagulability was also obviously increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Furthermore, the concentrations of venous plasma tissue factor antigen, CD40 ligand, platelet factor 4, ?-thromboglobulin, the soluble fibrin monomer complex and prothrombin fragment 1+2 were also increased (P?<?0.05). Conclusions:? This study showed that platelet, leukocyte and endothelium activities as well as their interactions are enhanced during the peri-operative period of total knee arthroplasty, particularly in venous blood from the lower half of the body, which consequently augments blood coagulability. Further, tourniquet inflation during surgery exaggerates these responses.

AB  - Abstract Engineering complex tissues requires a precisely formulated combination of cells, spatiotemporally released bioactive factors, and a specialized scaffold support system. Injectable materials, particularly those delivered in aqueous solution, are considered ideal delivery vehicles for cells and bioactive factors and can also be delivered through minimally invasive methods and fill complex 3D shapes. In this review, we examine injectable materials that form scaffolds or networks capable of both replacing tissue function early after delivery and supporting tissue regeneration over a time period of weeks to months. The use of these materials for tissue engineering within the craniofacial complex is challenging but ideal as many highly specialized and functional tissues reside within a small volume in the craniofacial structures and the need for minimally invasive interventions is desirable due to aesthetic considerations. Current biomaterials and strategies used to treat craniofacial defects are examined, followed by a review of craniofacial tissue engineering, and finally an examination of current technologies used for injectable scaffold development and drug and cell delivery using these materials.

AB  - Summary Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent disease that has a major genetic component of risk. However, known identified genetic risk factors account for <30% of idiopathic (without any environmental origin) VTE cases. This article aims to review the lessons learnt during recent decades in the field of the genetics of VTE, describe the present state-of-art methods and discuss promising themes for finding new susceptibility loci.

AB  - Abstract There is strong evidence that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. This elevated risk is independent of classical risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and hypertension. The risk of coronary heart disease, put simply, is proportional to the severity of the depression. Also conclusively demonstrated is the adverse effect of depression in patients following myocardial infarction, which materially increases mortality. The mechanism of increased cardiac risk attributable to MDD is at present uncertain, but activation of the sympathetic nervous system, altered baroreflex sensitivity, and/or exaggerated platelet reactivity and endothelial dysfunction are likely to be of prime importance.
