AB  - Background In preclinical studies with cynomolgus macaques, it is common to have one or more females presenting with menses. Published literature indicates that the blood lost during menses causes decreases in red blood cell mass variables (RBC, HGB, and HCT), which would be a confounding factor in the interpretation of drug-related effects on clinical pathology data, but no scientific data have been published to support this claim. Objectives This investigation was conducted to determine if the amount of blood lost during menses in cynomolgus macaques has an effect on routine hematology and serum chemistry variables. Methods Ten female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), 5 to 6.5 years old, were observed daily during approximately 3 months (97 days) for the presence of menses. Hematology and serum chemistry variables were evaluated twice weekly. Results The results indicated that menstruation affects the erythrogram including RBC, HGB, HCT, MCHC, MCV, reticulocyte count, RDW, the leukogram including neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, and chemistry variables, including GGT activity, and the concentrations of total proteins, albumin, globulins, and calcium. The magnitude of the effect of menstruation on susceptible variables is dependent on the duration of the menstrual phase. Macaques with menstrual phases lasting ≥ 7 days are more likely to develop changes in variables related to chronic blood loss. Conclusions In preclinical toxicology studies with cynomolgus macaques, interpretation of changes in several commonly evaluated hematology and serum chemistry variables requires adequate clinical observation and documentation concerning presence and duration of menses. There is a concern that macaques with long menstrual cycles can develop iron deficiency anemia due to chronic menstrual blood loss.

AB  - Abstract Several new oral anticoagulants have been studied in the past decade, and have now started to enter the market. These drugs are reported to be as effective as, or more effective than, warfarin. In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban. The use of these newer anticoagulants is likely to increase in time, and it is important for dentists to have a sound understanding of the mechanisms of action, reversal strategies, and management guidelines for patients taking oral anticoagulants. This article discusses the process of coagulation, available anticoagulants and their monitoring and reversal, and provides clinical advice on the management of patients on anticoagulants who require dental treatment.

AB  - Summary:? The caspase family of cysteine proteases becomes activated in response to diverse cellular insults and coordinates apoptosis through proteolysis of hundreds of cellular substrates. Cytotoxic lymphocytes are adept at promoting apoptosis of virally infected or transformed cells through delivery of cytotoxic enzymes, such as granzyme B, into target cells via the granule exocytosis pathway. Granzyme B promotes apoptosis of target cells through direct processing of certain caspases, which leads to their autoactivation. Granzyme B can also activate caspases indirectly through proteolysis of Bid, a protein that promotes mitochondrial permeabilization and consequent activation of the apoptosome pathway to caspase activation. Evidence also indicates that granzyme B may contribute to antiviral immunity by directly suppressing viral replication through direct proteolysis of viral proteins that are essential for pathogenicity. Recent reports also suggest that granzyme B may have additional non-cytotoxic roles under certain circumstances and may also function in the extracellular space. Here, we discuss the cytotoxic and putative non-cytotoxic functions of granzyme B within the immune system.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Fibrin sealants have had applications in hemostasis, cohesion, and promotion of healing in plastic surgery. In this article, we review cases where fibrin sealant was used to stabilize microvascular pedicles and compared with previous free flaps performed without fibrin sealant. Methods Between 2008 and 2010, 62 consecutive patients underwent free tissue transfer for reconstruction; this involved 33 latissimus dorsi perforator flaps, 14 thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps, 9 latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, 3 lateral thoracic artery perforator flaps, and 3 transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps, used in head and neck reconstruction, lower limb reconstructions, breast reconstructions, and facial palsy reconstruction. Following microvascular anastomosis, the microvascular pedicles were placed in the optimal position, and fibrin sealant was used to fix and stabilize them. The complications, such as venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, hematoma, and vascular pedicle kinking, were compared with that of 672 previous free flaps without fibrin sealant for stabilizing microvascular pedicles. Results Among the 62 free tissue transfers using fibrin sealant, there was only one complication involving flap failure (1.6%), in this case due to venous thrombosis. Analysis of 672 free flaps performed without application of fibrin sealant revealed 24 complications (3.6%), due to 3 venous thrombosis, 1 arterial thrombosis, 4 vascular pedicel compression due to hematoma, and 16 pedicle kinking. However, the comparison of complications between the free flap using fibrin sealant and the free flap without fibrin sealant were not statistically significant (P?=?0.65). Conclusions Fibrin sealant can be used to prevent vascular kinking and to position anastomosed vessels after successful micro-anastomosis and allow the reconstructive surgeon to overcome challenging situations of vascular pedicle related complications ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Approximately one in four patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given anticoagulation and compression therapy develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Accelerated removal of thrombus by thrombolytic agents may increase patency and prevent PTS. Objectives: To assess short-term efficacy of additional catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) compared with standard treatment alone. Patients and methods: Open, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Patients (18?75?years) with iliofemoral DVT and symptoms <?21?days were randomized to receive additional CDT or standard treatment alone. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was investigated using duplex ultrasound and air-plethysmography assessed by an investigator blinded to previous treatment. Results: One hundred and three patients (64?men, mean age 52?years) were allocated additional CDT (n?=?50) or standard treatment alone (n?=?53). After CDT, grade III (complete) lysis was achieved in 24 and grade II (50%?90%) lysis in 20?patients. One patient suffered major bleeding and two had clinically relevant bleeding related to the CDT procedure. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was found in 32 (64.0%) in the CDT group vs. 19 (35.8%) controls, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction (RR) of 28.2% (95% CI: 9.7%?46.7%; P?=?0.004). Venous obstruction was found in 10 (20.0%) in the CDT group vs. 26 (49.1%) controls; absolute RR 29.1% (95% CI: 20.0%?38.0%; P?=?0.004). Femoral venous insufficiency did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: After 6?months, additional CDT increased iliofemoral patency from 36% to 64%. The ongoing long-term follow-up of this study will document whether patency is related to improved functional outcome.
