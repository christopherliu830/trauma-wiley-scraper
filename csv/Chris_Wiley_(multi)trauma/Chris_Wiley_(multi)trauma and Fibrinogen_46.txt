AB  - Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a major cause of maternal deaths worldwide, and is estimated to cause the death of a woman every 10 minutes. This review presents the latest clinical advice, including new evidence on controlled cord traction, misoprostol, and oxytocin. The controversy around the diagnosis of PPH, the limitations of universal prophylaxis, and novel ways to provide obstetric first aid are also presented. It ends with a call to develop high-quality front-line obstetric services that can deal rapidly with unexpected haemorrhages as well as minimising blood loss at critical times: major abruption, placenta praevia, and caesarean for prolonged labour.

Conclusion Abstract In tissue engineering cell cultures play a crucial role besides the matrix materials for the end of substituting lost tissue functions. The cell itself is situated at the cross-roads leading to different orders of scale, from molecule to organism and different levels of function, from biochemistry to macrophysiology. Extensive in vitro investigations have dissected a vast amount of cellular phenomena and the role of a number of bioactive substances has been elucidated in the past. Further, recombinant DNA technologies allow modulation of the expression profiles of virtually all kinds of cells. However, issues of vascularization in vivo limit transferability of these observations and restrict upscaling into clinical applications. Novel in vivo models of vascularization have evolved inspired from reconstructive microsurgical concepts and they encompass axial neovascularization by means of vascular induction. This work represents a brief description of latest developments and potential applications of neovascularization and angiogenesis in tissue engineering.

Am J Reprod Immunol 2010; 64: 113?125 Problem? The amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) syndrome is a catastrophic complication of pregnancy frequently associated with maternal death. The causes and mechanisms of disease responsible for this syndrome remain elusive. Method of study? We report two cases of maternal deaths attributed to AFE: (1) one woman presented with spontaneous labor at term, developed intrapartum fever, and after delivery had sudden cardiovascular collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to death; (2) another woman presented with preterm labor and foul-smelling amniotic fluid, underwent a Cesarean section for fetal distress, and also had postpartum cardiovascular collapse and DIC, leading to death. Results? Of major importance is that in both cases, the maternal plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α at the time of admission to the hospital and when patients had no clinical evidence of infection was in the lethal range (a lethal range is considered to be above 0.1?ng/mL). Conclusion? We propose that subclinical intraamniotic infection may be a cause of postpartum cardiovascular collapse and DIC and resemble AFE. Thus, some patients with the clinical diagnosis of AFE may have infection/systemic inflammation as a mechanism of disease. These observations have implications for the understanding of the mechanisms of disease of patients who develop cardiovascular collapse and DIC, frequently attributed to AFE. It may be possible to identify a subset of patients who have biochemical and immunological evidence of systemic inflammation at the time of admission, and before a catastrophic event occurs.

AB  - Background:Liver biopsies taken with an automatic Tru-Cut biopsy gun device caused unexpected fatal shock reactions in cats. The goal of the present study was to determine if this biopsy device caused more frequent fatal complications than did a semiautomatic device. Animals: All cats referred to the Utrecht University, between October 1, 2002, and October 31, 2004, in which ultrasound-guided Tru-Cut liver biopsies were taken. The indications for liver biopsy were increased liver enzyme activity, increased bile acid concentrations, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the liver, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the bile ducts, or some combination of these findings. Coagulation parameters were normal. Methods: From October 1, 2002, until October 31, 2003, 26 cats were biopsied with an automatic biopsy device. Between November 1, 2003, and October 31, 2004, 19 cats underwent liver biopsy with a semiautomatic biopsy device. Results: In the first period, 5 of the 26 cats (19%) developed severe shock within 15 minutes. Resuscitation was not successful. In the second period, none of the 19 cats experienced any major adverse effect. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to diagnosis, clinical signs, clinicopathologic findings, or the use of anesthetics. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: We conclude that the difference in complication rate is explained by the biopsy technique used. The pressure wave, which occurs when firing the automatic device, may have caused intense vagotonia and shock. Use of this automatic biopsy device should be avoided in cats because of the high risk of fatal complications.

AB  - Abstract Musculoskeletal reconstruction is an ongoing challenge for surgeons as it is required for one out of five patients undergoing surgery. In the past three decades, through the close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists, several regenerative strategies have been proposed. These have emerged from interdisciplinary approaches that bridge tissue engineering with material science, physiology, and cell biology. The paradigm behind tissue engineering is to achieve regeneration and functional recovery using stem cells, bioactive molecules, or supporting materials. Although plenty of preclinical solutions for bone and cartilage have been presented, only a few platforms have been able to move from the bench to the bedside. In this review, we highlight the limitations of musculoskeletal regeneration and summarize the most relevant acellular tissue engineering approaches. We focus on the strategies that could be most effectively translate in clinical practice and reflect on contemporary and cutting-edge regenerative strategies in surgery.

Additionally, a summary of pheochromocytoma and the idiosyncrasies of perioperative management of a pheochromocytoma are provided. Summary: A 7-year old male, neutered, Dalmation was presented for acute collapse, abdominal pain and tachycardia. Physical examination findings were consistent with hypoperfusion concurrent with multiple cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound revealed retroperitoneal effusion and a right adrenal mass intimately associated with the caudal vena cava. Incomplete right adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed a pheochromocytoma. Unique information provided: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first definitive report of acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage as the initial clinical manifestation of histologically confirmed adrenal pheochromocytoma in the dog.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) using superpulsed near-infrared light can penetrate deeper in the injured tissue and could allow non-pharmacological treatment for chronic wound healing. This study investigated the effects of superpulsed laser (Ga-As 904 nm, 200 ns pulse width; 100 Hz; 0.7 mW mean output power; 0.4 mW/cm2 average irradiance; 0.2 J/cm2 total fluence) on the healing of burn wounds in rats, and further explored the probable associated mechanisms of action. Irradiated group exhibited enhanced DNA, total protein, hydroxyproline and hexosamine contents compared to the control and silver sulfadiazine (reference care) treated groups. LLLT exhibited decreased TNF-α level and NF-kB, and up-regulated protein levels of VEGF, FGFR-1, HSP-60, HSP-90, HIF-1α and matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 compared to the controls. In conclusion, LLLT using superpulsed 904 nm laser reduced the inflammatory response and was able to enhance cellular proliferation, collagen deposition and wound contraction in the repair process of burn wounds. Photomicrographs showing no, absence inflammation and faster wound contraction in LLLT superpulsed (904 nm) laser treated burn wounds as compared to the non-irradiated control and silver sulfadiazine (SSD) ointment (reference care) treated wounds

One-hundred-and-twenty-four (19%) of patients with acute myocardial infarction seen in a three year period from 1975 to 1978 were considered low risk patients suitable for rapid mobilisation, early discharge, and early exercise testing. Their mean long term Norris Prognostic Index was 3.2; the mean date of discharge was 9.6 days, and the mean date of exercise testing was 10.5 days. There were seven deaths and nine non-fatal recurrenf myocardial infarctions in a mean follow up time of 14.2 months. These events were best predicted by a history of angina prior to myocardial infarction or radiological cardiomegaly detected in the CCU. Altogether 98 (80%) of the patients returned to work at a median time of six weeks after their infarct. The nett effect of the team activity has been to reduce the need for referral to the National Heart Foundation Assessment Centre from an average of 15 patients per year to an average of two per year

AB  - ABSTRACT In the present study, an attempt has been made to improve cell supportive property of chitosan/nano beta tri-calcium phosphate (?-TCP) composite scaffolds by modification of scaffold surface with fibrin using ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide (EDC) as crosslinking agent. The developed fibrin conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP composite scaffolds possess desired pore size and porosity in the range of 45?151 µm and 81.4?±?4.1%, respectively. No significant change in compressive strength of scaffolds was observed before and after fibrin conjugation. The calculated compressive strength of fibrin conjugated and non-conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP scaffolds are 2.71?±?0.14 MPa and 2.67?±?0.11 MPa, respectively. Results of cell culture study have further shown an enhanced cell attachment, cell number, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization on fibrin conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP scaffold. The uniform cell distribution over the scaffold surface and cell infiltration into the scaffold pores were assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, higher expression of osteogenic specific genes such as bone sialo protein, osteonectin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin (OC) on fibrin conjugated scaffolds was observed when compared to scaffolds without fibrin. Altogether, results indicate the potentiality of developed fibrin conjugated composite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.
