AB  - Introduction: Thermal injury to the female breast is one of the most challenging aspects of aesthetic burn surgery today. As the ability to provide coverage for large body surface injuries has progressed greatly in recent years; attention can now be directed towards achieving aesthetically pleasing results. Breast reconstruction in the burn patient can be accomplished in several ways. In planning the reconstruction, one must account for gender, age, and stage of breast development at the time of injury. The following is the treatment protocol utilized at our institution. After determining the level of injury the injured area is cleansed and treated with topical anti-microbial agents such as Silvadene. If the decision is made to excise and graft the injured area one of two algorithms is followed. The first choice involves excising the burn and placing a split thickness skin graft to the area involved. This is done by placing a sheet graft and using aerosolized fibrin sealant to affix it to the wound bed. If the burn involves deeper elements of tissue then a second approach is taken which includes excision of the burn down to the level of fascia with preservation of the breast mounds and the nipple areola complex (NAR). The (NAR) is spared excision and allowed to heal. Reconstruction of the (NAR) can be deferred for a secondary procedure depending upon the response to primary healing. A split thickness skin graft is then applied to the area of injury. Again a sheet graft is preferred and fibrin sealant is utilized to improve graft fixation and contour. We attribute our excellent results to the sheet grafts and fibrin sealant used. It should be noted that the increased vascularity of the breast fat when compared to fat located elsewhere in the body allows the grafts to adhere and survive on this generally difficult to graft surface. Methods: We identified five female patients at our institution over the last 18 months with thermal injuries to the breasts. Each patient was placed into one of the two treatment algorithms. Results: The five patients had excellent outcomes. Breast mounds and symmetry were preserved. Further development of the breast was allowed in each patient. One patient even underwent a breast augmentation after surviving a 50% TBSA injury. Proper use of fibrin sealant and sheet grafts account for the excellent results seen at this institution. Conclusion: Following careful evaluation of the burned female breast cosmetically and functionally acceptable results can be attained when following our institution?s protocol for breast reconstruction in the female burn victim.

AB  - Aim: To document successful healing of a recalcitrant venous ulcer with adjunctive use of Dermagraft Materials and Methods: A 74-year-old Hispanic male presented with a chronic venous ulcer at the medial aspect of his right ankle. Biopsy failed to reveal malignancy and confirmed stasis changes. Treatment was ongoing including compression therapy, local debridements, and moist wound healing, off-loading, and nutritional support. The wound remained free of infection. Due to the continued recalcitrant nature of the lesion multiple applications of Dermagraft were utilized to augment healing. Results: The researcher observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue. Conclusions: Dermagraft appears to augment healing in patients with venous ulcers and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgements: Smith & Nephew Wound Management, Largo, Fl.

AB  - The use of adjunctive peri-wound, ultrasound with either a 1?MgHz or 3?MgHz frequency has been reported on in the literature with variable results. MIST ultrasound therapy is a novel application of direct wound bed application of kilohertz ultrasound waves utilizing a normal saline mist as the coupling mechanism, allowing for no direct patient contact. The mist generated by the system is of relative uniform particle size and acts as a conduit of ultrasound energy. Unlike ultrasonic baths, which dissipate the vibrational energy over a large area, the transducer horn focuses the energy into a smaller area of application. The MIST? system consists of an ultrasonic power supply (generator), a transducer (or alternately referred to as the converter), and an applicator coupled to the transducer. The generator converts voltage to high frequency electrical energy. This electrical energy is transmitted to the piezoelectric transducer within the converter, where it is changed to mechanical vibrations. The generator is designed to operate the converter at 40?kHz with a distal displacement of 60 microns. Published reports have described various biological effects of low frequency ultrasound including VEGF and PDGF production, increased protein synthesis, improved bone and wound healing. Other authors have published abstracts demonstrating clinical efficacy of this device on a broad range of patients with recalcitrant wounds. This report describes the clinical results of a prospective, non-randomized, efficacy trial, adding MIST ultrasound therapy to current treatment protocols in recalcitrant wounds. Wound healing trajectories before and after treatment will be evaluated and wound healing will be assessed with laser Doppler image analysis and trans-cutaneous oximetry.

AB  - Background: More than three quarters of patients with a connective tissue disorder will develop secondary Raynauld?s disease. This more severe form of the Raynauld?s can lead to digital ischemia, tissue loss and may even result in the need for amputation of one or more digits. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor currently approved for use in vascular disease of the lower extremities. Case History: In August of 2002 a 62 year old female pianist with scleroderma presented to the wound clinic with a two year history of intractable digital pain secondary to ischemic ulcerations of the index, long and ring fingers of the right hand. She suffered from secondary Raynauld?s disease. Prior unsuccessful treatments included warming the hands, calcium channel blockade, anticoagulation, topical xylocaine and narcotic analgesics. In August of 2002 cilostazol was started at 100mg BID. Wound care consisted of serial debridement, moist wound healing and topical rhPDGF. Results: Four weeks into treatment the patient?s narcotic requirement decreased substantially and the fingers had a pink appearance. The ring finger healed after eight weeks. At three months the patient discontinued narcotic pain medication. Nine months into treatment the index finger had healed and she resumed playing the piano. The long finger finally healed one year after she initially presented to the wound clinic. Conclusion: Cilostazol may be an important adjunct in the treatment of secondary Raynauld?s disease particularly when digital ischemia has developed.

AB  - Hydration of keratinocytes modifies the levels of cytokines they secrete, which in turn impacts the secretory behaviour of dermal fibroblasts. In an in vitro coculture model, conditioned media (CM) collagen content was decreased 44% when keratinocytes were hydrated. We hypothesized that this is partly due to increased MMP-activity. We used the same coculture model to study changes in MMP-activity and TIMP secreted by keratinocytes as well as by fibroblasts in monoculture and in coculture in relation to air-treatment or hydration of keratinocytes. Stratified human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) and confluent human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were cocultured for 72?h under serum-free conditions. HEK were either kept at the air-interface or hydrated. CM was assayed for MMP-1, ?2, ?9, TIMP-1 and ?2 were assayed using zymograms, western blotting, and ELISA. MMP-1, secreted by both cell types, increased significantly in cocultures compared to monocultures (4-fold in the air-treated group, 26-fold in the hydrated group). MMP-2, secreted mainly by HDFs, was significantly increased by coculture (hydration: 2.4-fold, air: 2.8-fold). MMP-9, predominantly secreted by air-treated HEKs and was significantly decreased in hydrated monoculture (76%) and coculture. HEK-monoculture hydration also significant decreased MMP-1 (86%) and MMP-2 (81%) activity. HDF-secreted TIMP-1 expression was significantly increased by coculture and was unaffected by hydration. Our findings demonstrate that paracrine interactions between HEK and HDF modify MMP activity and that HEK hydration significantly effects on MMP activity. The findings provide insight into the role of hydration on HEK and HDF ctivity during the wound healing process.

AB  - Introduction: Burn depth, based on the hemodynamic alterations that occur following a thermal insult, can be assessed in a rapid, non-invasive, and nondestructive fashion using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR has the capability to determine the difference between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. Methods: Sixteen burn patients admitted to an adult regional burn center were studied and evaluated with the NIR point and imaging devices. Non-burned skin adjacent to the burn site was used as the control. NIR measurements were compared between superficial (8 wounds), full thickness (8 wounds) burn wounds and control sites. Results: NIR was able to easily detect an increase in oxyhemoglobin (68.3%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (4.8%, p?<?0.05%) and total hemoglobin (91.3%, p?<?0.05) which typically occurs with superficial burn injuries. Full thickness injuries experienced a substantial drop in oxyhemoglobin (88.8%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (79.1%, p?<?0.05) and total hemoglobin (77.5%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to control sites. Conclusions: These results confirm that NIR spectroscopy can successfully distinguish between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. The second phase of this study will involve determining the depth of indeterminant burn wounds and this preliminary data will also be presented. Acknowledgement: National Research Council of Canada

AB  - Introduction: Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures at the ends of each chromosome. Due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the full length of the chromosome, up to 50?200 base pairs of the telomere are lost during each successive round of cell division. In adult human somatic cells, telomerase is not active resulting in progressive loss of telomere length and entry into replicative senescence as observed in cell culture. hTERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme which maintains telomere length. Transfection of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) by hTERT has been shown to reverse the senescent phenotype seen in aging HDFs in vitro. ERK (p44/42) is a MAP kinase which functions as a critical intermediary in the determination of cell growth and differentiation. Activation of ERK occurs through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues. ?Methods: In order to delineate some of the cellular mechanisms by which hTERT functions, we treated adenoviral hTERT (Ad-hTERT) transfected HDFs with TGFB1, and assayed phosphorylated ERK activity by Western blotting.?Results: Ad-hTERT treated HDFs demonstrated a 2?3 fold increase in phospho-ERK activity. In addition, our preliminary findings show that Ad-hTERT transfected HDFs have increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression by real-time rtPCR. ?Conclusions: Increased phosphor-ERK activity as well as increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression is seen in hTERT transfected HDF?s. Further studies will focus on defining other intermediary changes resulting from Ad-hTERT tranfection. Funding source: Geron Corporation

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem. p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, blocks cell cycle progression and attenuates proliferation of various cell types. Our in vitro rAd-p21 dose response studies of primary human dermal fibroblasts showed a 3?80 fold reduction of cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation at doses of 1???108?3???109?PN/mL, respectively. Further, rAd-p21 at 3???109 PN/mL showed a 2-fold less procollagen I (PIP) production when compared to control virus. These in vitro data demonstrate that rAd-p21 significantly attenuates fibroproliferation and procollagen production in the target cells. In vivo, a rat PVA sponge model was used. rAd-p21, at doses of 1???109, 1???1010 and 5???1010 PN was delivered into sponges that had previously been treated with a granulation tissue stimulator, rAd-PDGF-B. Results showed that sponges receiving rAd-PDGF-B alone had the highest % granulation fill (40?60% fill area). Sponges that were treated with rAd-PDGF-B for the first injection followed by rAd-p21 on a second injection showed a dose-dependent decrease in % granulation fill as rAd-p21 doses increased (p?<?0.001). On day 5 post-injection, IHC staining identified p21 protein expression only in sponges receiving rAd-p21. In addition, the quantitative measurement of cells labeled by BrdU or Ki67 demonstrated that rAd-p21 significantly attenuated cell proliferation when compared to rAd-PDGF alone in this model (p?<?0.01). In another in vivo experiment, a rabbit excessive scar model was used. rAd-p21, at a dose of 2???109?PN/wound was intradermally injected into the rabbit ear wounds that had previously been treated with PDGF-BB protein. Preliminary data showed that scar thickness in rAd-p21 treated wounds was significantly decreased in comparison to wounds treated with the control virus (p?<?0.05). These data suggest that rAd-p21 is effective in attenuating scars in the rabbit ear excessive scar model. Our in vitro and in vivo data support the further exploration of rAd-p21 as a useful therapeutic candidate for hyperproliferative diseases in patients.

AB  - Intro: Pathophysiology of hypertrophic scar formation remains unclear, potentially involving mechanical strain, burns, or infection. We sought to specifically examine the role of mechanical strain in hypertrophic scars. To do so, we developed and characterized a novel murine model which uses mechanical strain to produce hypertrophic scars in mice. Methods: Paired incisions were created on C57BL6 mice (n?=?20). After closure, mechanical strain was applied across one wound using a novel device; the other wound was a control. Starting at day 3, mechanical strain was increased every other day over 4?wks. Wounds were harvested each week, and examined histologically using Sirius red, DAPI, BrdU for proliferation, and caspase 3 for apoptosis. Results: Strained wounds showed features of hypertrophic scars: raised borders, loss of rete pegs and adnexal structures in the epidermis overlying scars, blood vessels that were perpendicular and fibrillary collagen that was parallel to skin surface. Features persisted beyond 6 months. Wound collagen deposition in strained wounds increased 6-fold at 1 wk and over 12-fold at 2?4?wks, in parallel to an increase in number of stromal cells within scar (28-fold). This resulted in an increase in number of cells per unit area of collagen (over 42%). In all wounds, there was no significant difference in proliferation. There was a significant reduction in blood vessel (4-fold) and fibroblast (3-fold) apoptosis at 1?4?wks in strained wounds. Conc: Mechanical strain alone is sufficient to produce hypertrophic scars in this model that are indistinguishable from human scars. Notably, hypertrophic scars appear to result from a marked reduction in apoptosis, rather than from a significant proliferation and upregulation of cellular collagen deposition, validating previous in vitro studies.

AB  - Previous investigations have demonstrated that cutaneous healing in red Duroc pigs (RD) differs from healing in Yorkshire pigs (Y). Specifically, RD animals heal with the formation of hypercontracted, hyperpigmented scars, features which are not observed in Y animals. Further, this abnormal scarring may be genetically mediated, as demonstrated by the partial transmission of this phenotype to RD???Y offspring (F1). To further determine the degree of transmission of this phenotype, this study examined the effect of wound depth upon the healing response of F1 animals. Ten full thickness (FT) and ten deep dermal (DD, 1.8?mm) skin wounds (2?cm???2?cm) were created on the backs of juvenile female F1 animals (N?=?8) using previously published procedures. Biopsies (4?mm) were taken from FT and DD wounds on days 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Samples were used for histology and molecular analysis using RT-PCR. There were no detectable differences between the FT and DD wounds on the gross or histologic level. However on a molecular level, there were numerous differences between the FT and DD wounds. Several genes investigated demonstrated increased expression levels in the DD wounds as compared to the FT wounds. Further, DD wounds demonstrated a unique pattern of expression for several other genes that differed from that observed in either the F1 FT wounds or in any RD or Y wounds. Given that previous investigations have shown that FT and DD wounds are nearly identical within each of the RD and Y strains, this represents a novel finding. These results indicate that the healing phenotype of the F1 animals may be regulated both by genetics and by the wound size/depth, suggesting that human wound healing may be similarly influenced by genetics, wound depth and potentially, environmental factors.

AB  - Major burn wounds are often complicated by sepsis which currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in these patients. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in body?s defence by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. They also chemoattract immature dendritic cells and T and B-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and act as an adjuvant and enhance adaptive immunity. Our prior studies using RT-PCR suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin-2 (HBD-2) in burn wounds. Furthermore we demonstrated remnants of HBD-2 in the dermis. Our current study, using fluorescence deconvolution microscopy, has clarified that HBD-2 is present in the surviving hair follicles. The peptide was also located in the eccrine and apocrine sweat gland acini but absent in the sweat ducts, in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns. HBD-2 was also notably absent from the vascular endothelium and fat cells. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression and sepsis.

AB  - Bone marrow is an important supply for many progenitor cells, among them endothelial precursor cells. They have been already considered as potential therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic hindlimb. In this work we performed an unilateral chronic ischemic hindlimb model in 20 dogs, we were dissected and ligated the middle sacra artery and external right iliac artery preserving the internal iliac artery, after one week we removed de femoral artery performing a proximal and distal ligation and inserted into the gracilis muscle 3 Silastic tubes (0.8?mm diameter) in a middle circle form in order to created fibrocollagenous tunnels. Fifteen days later, we obtained bone marrow (30?mL) and mononuclear cells were separated; at the same time, all tubes were removed and bone marrow cells were transplanted into the fibrocollagenous tunnels, only in the third and fourth groups. During the 8 at 12 days we administered subcutaneously saline solution to the first and third groups and G-CSF to the second and fourth groups. Finally, after 30 days we performed contrasted angiographies from both limbs and was calculated mean angiographic score (MAS) from the number of vascular intersections, also was taken a biopsy from the central portion of right gracilis muscle for vascular assessment, as well as for vascular proliferating cells by immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated that white bone marrow cell transplantation enrichment by G-CSF administration stimulates angiogenesis in ischemic hindlimb, twice than controls, and it is better than white bone marrow cell transplantation alone. White bone marrow cell is a potential therapy for ischemic hindlimb, because stem cells are growth factor provider, as well as an important source for endothelial precursors capable to form vessels de novo, mainly when this stem cells are deposited in an appropriate extracellular matrix, such as the fibrocollagenous tunnels in this model.

AB  - The inability to experiment in humans creates a great need to develop culture systems that mimic human tissues/organs. Skin is arguably the simplest human tissue and therefore provides an excellent prototype for tissue engineering. Moreover, skin is the body?s first line of defense. Currently available skin replacements have been classified into four categories: (i) those that are composed completely of epidermal cells; (ii) those consisting of dermal components derived from processing of cadaver skin or from collagen and other matrix molecules; (iii) those containing both dermal and epidermal components and (iv) those that contain dermal, epidermal and vascular components. All of these substitutes have drawbacks. Therefore, there is a need for skin replacements that: (a) are prepared with pertinent primary human cells but yet can be ready ?off? the shelf; (b) can be prepared rapidly; (c) contain stable structures in particular microvessels that can rapidly connect with the patient?s vasculature in this manner establish circulation in the ?graft? increasing the chances of survival; (d) can be tailored for specific wound impairments (e) are long lasting. We have developed a new generation human ?skin? that can fulfil these requirements and can potentially be used as a ?living bandage?. We start with three primary human cell types and a collagen matrix that self-assemble into a connective tissue containing a network of mature microvessels, is covered with a stratified epidermis, expresses biochemical markers, matrix molecules, and cytokines characteristic of normal human skin and matures in 10?15 days. Moreover, two additional cell types, pericytes and monocytes, differentiate in situ adjacent to and within microvessels, respectively providing stability to the micriovessels and the epidermis expresses keratins that are typical of mature skin and not those characteristically produced in response to injury such as keratins 6, 16, 17. This tissue can potentially be developed into a skin replacement for patients with impaired healing. In addition, this tissue responds normally to bological stimuli, providing a powerful vehicle to investigate mechanisms of skin development and regeneration, understand pathological processes, and test drugs and treatments for skin diseases

AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used adjunctively to treat chronic, non-healing wounds. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production during HBO is suggested as an important mechanism that promotes enhanced wound healing. The purpose of this study is the documentation of NO production during and following HBO treatments (txs). Diabetic and non-diabetic patients receiving HBO therapy (20?txs; 2.0ATA???90?min) provided wound fluid and fasting plasma and urine specimens for nitrate (NOx) determinations. Nitrate measurements were obtained prior to HBO (baseline), after 10 and 20?txs, and at one and four weeks following HBO completion. In patients healing after HBO baseline plasma NOx ranged between 17.7 and 33.20??M. At 10?txs plasma NOx increased >50% to between 35.8?43.5??M. At 20?txs plasma NOx decreased to between 22.3?35.5??M. Healing diabetic patient plasma NOx increased after HBO reaching 170% of baseline at one month (57.8?±?0.15??M). Plasma NOx of healing non-diabetic patients decreased to baseline levels at one month after HBO. Urine NOx values mirrored those of plasma NOx; wound fluid NOx elevations were delayed compared to plasma and urine. Conversely, non-healing HBO patients did not demonstrate the early, significant elevations of plasma NOx after 10?txs. This study documents, for the first time, an early (10?txs), significant elevation of plasma and urine NOx after HBO that is associated with successful healing in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. A similar early increase in plasma and urine NOx was not observed in patients not responding to HBO therapy. These findings suggest that HBO-mediated increased NO production plays a critical role in the correction of impaired wound healing in selected patients. Furthermore, early plasma and urine NOx determinations after HBO therapy may prove valuable in the prediction of the clinical outcome of treatment.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium cultured from infected wounds. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral arterial disease would be patient predictors of severe outcomes, defined as amputation, sepsis, or death, and infections caused by resistant strains would be bacterial predictors of severe outcomes. Methods: With IRB approval, 50 S. aureus strains (45 wound, 5 central line) were isolated during routine clinical care. Investigations included antibiotic resistance (>5?mcg/ml), and PCR for STAR elements. Chart review included wound type, location, relevant comorbidities, antibiotic resistance, and outcome. Results: Outcome n(%of outcome total) Severe All others Total Diabetic 7 (70) 6 (17) 13 (29) Non-diabetic 3 (30) 29 (83) 32 (71) MRSA STAR groups 2 (20) 8 (23) 10 (22) All other STAR 8 (80) 27 (77) 35 (78) MRSA 4 (40) 8 (23) 12 (27) MSSA 6 (60) 27 (77) 33 (73) Total patients 10 (22) 35 (78) 45 No non-DM patient with arterial disease (n?=?6) had a poor outcome. Conclusions: The strongest predictor of outcome was the presence of DM. Patients with severe outcomes were slightly more likely to have MRSA infection, although only 33% of patients with MRSA had severe outcomes. Although STAR/arsRBC groups have been shown previously to predict antibiotic resistance, in this collection there was no correlation between these molecular markers and outcome. This study shows that the strongest predictor of clinical outcome in wound infection is patient-dependent, while bacterial factors appear to play a lesser role.

AB  - Caspases are a family of at least 14 highly conserved aspartate proteases that are the major effector arm of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Previous immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have implicated two of the family members, caspase 3 and caspase 14, as having a role in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation. Reepithelialization of epidermal defects after wounding requires coordination between signals that initiate growth and migration as well as signals that initiate differentiation. We therefore examined the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 14 in the epidermis of early (up to 48 hour) human wounds. Two excisional wounds were created on the inner arm using a 3?mm biopsy punch and allowed to heal via secondary intention. Wounds were excised at 24 and 48 hours using a 6?mm biopsy punch, placed in OCT, frozen, cryosectioned and immunohistochemically labeled using affinity purified antisera for caspases 3, 9 and 14. At 24 hours, the distribution of caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression was unchanged from non-wounded skin. Caspase 3 was found in the upper differentiating cells of the granular layer, while caspase 9 was expressed in scattered dendritic cells in the epidermis. At 48 hours, caspase 3 expression was lost in the epithelial tongue, while caspase 9 expression was found in keratinocytes at the tip of the migrating tongue. Caspase 14 expression at 24 hours was noted at the tip of the migrating epithelial tongue, while at 48 hours, the normal expression of caspase 14 in the granular layer was lost. These results suggest that in 48 hour wounds, loss of caspase 3 and 14 expression in the migrating epithelium reflects the activated state of this tissue. The onset of caspase 9 expression at 48 hours in the leading edge of the wound suggests a role for caspase 9 in wound remodeling, as caspase 9 is known to participate in tissue remodeling during development. Characterization of the caspases involved during wound healing may lead to future therapies utilizng caspases or caspase inhibitors in situations of poor or aberrant wound healing.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.
