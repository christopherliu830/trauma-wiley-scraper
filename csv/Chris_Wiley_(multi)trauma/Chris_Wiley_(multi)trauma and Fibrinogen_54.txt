AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.

AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.

AB  - Background:? Cardiovascular complications due to atherosclerosis (AS) are the major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Inflammation may play an important role in the development of AS. Several studies have demonstrated the association of acute-phase proteins and cytokines with AS in the general population and in HD patients. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of study was to compare serum levels inflammatory and anti-inflammatory indicators in HD patients according to the presence or absence of AS. Methods:? Thirty-three HD patients were enrolled. AS was defined as the detection of plaques by Doppler ultrasonography. The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of plaques. Serum levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The factors for AS such as age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and HD duration were also evaluated. Results:? We found that the patients with AS had significantly higher hs-CRP and lower IL-10. Blood pressure values were also increased in patients with AS. Additionally, there was an increased correlation between CRP and IL-10. Conclusions:? AS(+) patients undergoing HD had low serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high serum levels of hs-CRP. These results may suggest that the limitation of anti-inflammatory response in atherosclerotic uremic patients is a triggering or contributing factor for AS.

AB  - Introduction:? The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) has established target hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11?12?g/dL for all dialysis patients. For patients who leave an inpatient hospitalization with an Hb under this target, it is hypothesized that several factors contribute to the length of time required to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL after hospitalization. Objective:? To identify factors contributing to a decreased likelihood of reaching this target Hb. Methods:? Using the first hospitalization of patients who initiated HD in 1999 and who were regularly treated with EPO, we identified those with a mean Hb of less than 11?g/dL on EPO claims during the same month as their index hospitalization. Patients were then followed up to see how long it took them to achieve an Hb of 11?g/dL, censored at death, re-hospitalization, a switch of modality, or suspension of EPO treatment. Results:? A total of 6050 HD patients were identified. 3 months after hospitalization, 70% had achieved 11?g/dL, and 12% had been censored. For the remaining patients who eventually reached 11?g/dL, the average number of additional months required was 2.69 (SE of 0.09). From proportional hazards regression on the time (in months) to achieving an Hb of 11?g/dL, factors that significantly decreased the likelihood of reaching a target Hb included: a diagnosis on the index hospitalization of CHF or hepatic disease, a low Hb prior to the hospitalization, a high dose of EPO prior to the hospitalization, and a longer hospital stay. Conclusions:? Patients with anemia after hospitalization are at high risk of both persistent anemia and rehospitalization. It is important to address patient comorbidities, to ensure adequate medication usage, and to monitor patient progress to prevent hospitalizations and potential impact on Hb levels.

AB  - Clinical manifestation of overt vascular disease may be preceded for years by endothelial dysfunction. Objective:? This study was undertaken to evaluate endothelial function in ESRD patients and correlation between endothelial function and clinical and biochemical parameters. Methods:? 32 stable ESRD patients (male?:?female?=?16?:?16, average age: 55.2?±?13.0) on hemodialysis were included. A 10-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to image the brachial artery. Brachial artery diameter was measured, and reactive hyperemia was induced by inflation to 250?mmHg for 5?min and then deflation of a pneumatic cuff. After release of the cuff, brachial artery diameter was measured. Results:? In the entire study population and non-diabetic group, the %FMD (% flow-mediated dilatation, % change of brachial artery diameter between before and after cuff inflation) did not show any significant correlation with duration of dialysis, age, hypertension, albumin, CRP, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, the %FMD of diabetic patients was lower than that of non-diabetics. Among the patients with diabetes, the group of patients with FMD of <5.2% showed significant lower serum albumin and significantly higher ln(CRP) levels compared to the group of patients with FMD ≥5.2%. The %FMD showed significant positive correlation with serum albumin level and significant negative correlation with ln(CRP) in diabetic patients. Conclusion:? These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction, estimated by FMD, was significantly more prominent in diabetic ESRD, especially with low serum albumin and high CRP levels.

AB  - Background:? Daily hemodialysis (DHD) markedly ameliorates cardiovascular instability (CVI) and discomfort (DIS) during dialysis, but patients continue to have some of these problems during DHD. We studied what contributed to these problems during 4445 DHD in 23 patients. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR), maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP), and a subjective score of patients' overall evaluation of the quality of dialysis (OEQ), adding a score of 14 symptoms (0 best, 40 worst). Independent variables were ultrapure dialysate and biocompatible dialysis (UP) (1626 dialyses) vs. conventional dialysis (CONV) (2819 dialyses), ultrafiltration (Uf) as percentage of body weight (BW), pre?post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1 kg?BW?1), and target??post-dialysis BW (Ta-Po BW). Relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased by 1.6?±?13/min; MAX BP fall was 25?±?20?mmHg; OV BP fall was 13?±?22?mmHg; OEQ?=?0.6 ±?1.2. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=??BUN???0.12?+?Ta-Po BW?????1.8?+?K/V???1.1???5 r?=?0.13, p?<?0.0001 MAX BP?=?CONV???8?+?T???0.2???Ta-Po BW ?????6?+?Uf???2.7??13 r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001 OV BP?=?CONV???11?+?Uf???4???Ta-Po BW ????4?+??BUN???0.3???9 r?=?0.35, p?<?0.0001 OEQ?=?K/V???0.3???Ta-Po BW???0.1???0.2 r?=?0.20, p?<?0.0001 Conclusion:? To minimize drop in BP and hypotensive crashes, use of ultrapure dialysate and a biocompatible membrane (UP) was by far the most important factor, followed by slowing dialysis. To avoid post-dialysis tachycardia and discomfort during dialysis, slow dialysis was most important. Overall, ?fast? dialysis and use of ?impure? regular dialysate appear to be the major dialysis factors causing CV instability and discomfort during daily hemodialysis.

AB  - Starting any new program, especially one without a proven track record, raises questions about cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Purpose:? This research investigated how long patients should be expected to remain as daily/nocturnal hemodialysis patients in order to justify the initial investment in sending them home. Methods:? Costs for 10 short-hour daily (SHD) and 12 slow nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) were compared with the savings incurred by switching those patients from conventional hemodialysis (CHD). One-time expenses were divided by net savings to determine the minimum length of time the patients should be expected to remain at home on these modalities. Results:? One-time training, installation, and home equipment expenses were comparable for the SHD and NHD patients. NHD patients without monitoring noticed that these costs recovered in 1 year. NHD patients with monitoring took approximately 16 months to recover these costs, while initial SHD costs were offset in 20 months. Conclusions:? Patients selected for home NHD and SHD should be expected to be able to remain at home for at least 12?20 months. Subsequent investigation indicates that these costs and time periods may be further reduced.

AB  - Introduction:? A bioartificial kidney, which consists of a continuous hemofilter and a bioartificial tubule device using proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), is desired to develop for preventing long-term complications in hemodialysis patients. A bioartificial tubule device should function for a long duration in terms of the simplicity and the economy. Continuous hemofiltration with 10?L/day of filtrate could maintain plasma urea, creatinine and ?2-microglobulin in patients at low levels compared to those in standard hemodialysis patients. Methods:? 6 bioartificial tubule devices, in which LLC-PK1 cells were grown on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber capillaries (membrane area: 0.4?m2, 1600 fibers), were used to evaluate the transport ability of H2O, glucose and Na+, and leak rates of urea and creatinine for 2 weeks when the medium containing 50?mg/dL of urea and 5.0?mg/dL of creatinine was perfused inside of the cell-attached membranes and another medium containing 2.5?g/dL of albumin was perfused outside of the membranes. Scanning electron micrograph of cross-sectional findings of the hollow fibers was taken at 6, 10, and 14 days after formation of confluence. Results:? By conversion into 1?m2 of membrane area, transport of H2O, glucose, and Na+ was 6266?± 995?mL/day, 22832?±?7240 mg/day, and 941.3?±?180 mEq/day, respectively at 6 days after confluence. Leak rates of urea and creatinine across the cell-attached membranes were 22?±?6.1% and 19.2?±?4.9 with albumin addition, whereas 13.1?±?1.9% and 12.2?±?1.6 without albumin addition. Transport capacity of these components and the leak rates had continued for 10?13 days, and decreased thereafter because of the formation of the multilayers. Bioartificial tubule devices with membrane area 1.0?m2 can reach the targeted amounts of H2O, glucose, and Na+ transports when 6?L of 10?L/day of hemofiltrate has to be regenerated, substituting 4?L with meal and drinks.

AB  - Many synthetic polymeric membranes have been widely used for blood purification therapies. Among them polyester polymer alloy (PEPA) membrane shows unique blood compatibility and filtration characteristics. Objective:? To evaluate blood compatibility and filtration characteristics of 3 different PEPA membranes, including FLX (PEPA only), FDX (PEPA with polyvinylpyrrolidone, (PVP) as a hydrophilic agent), and FDY (PEPA with PVP) that has larger pore diameter. Methods:? Ultrafilters with 3 PEPA membranes (FLX, FDX, FDY, Nikkiso, Tokyo) were compared with those with polysulfone (PS; NK-PS, Nikkiso, Tokyo) for blood compatibility in vivo. Also, ultrafilters with PEPA, PS, and cellulose triacetate (CTA; FB-110GA, Nipro, Osaka) membranes were also investigated for filtration characteristics of albumin in aqueous in vitro. Results:? FDY, the latest version of the three PEPA, showed excellent small changes in C5a concentration during the treatment right after switching from PS membrane, leaving no significant changes in other biocompatible indices. First 60?min of the time course of s.c. for albumin were shown below taken under aqueous low albumin concentration, i.e., 2.42???10?3?kg/dm3. The time-dependent patterns were totally different from each other in 5 filters. Generally speaking, PS takes a peak value 20?40?min after starting the experiment, depending on the flow conditions. Since PEPA is a hydrophobic material, it showed high s.c. for albumin in FLX (PEPA with no PVP) and never reached plateau. With a hydrophilic agent (PVP), the s.c. greatly reduced in FDX and showed little time-dependent change. By enlarging the pore diameter in FDY, the s.c. increased in accordance with the enlargement. Conclusion:? Newly developed PEPA with PVP has excellent blood compatibility and has unique separation characteristics for albumin.

AB  - A decrease in hepatitis C viral load in HD patients along HD sessions has been described. It has also been proposed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation by HD could have some protective effect in hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease outcome. Aims:? (i) Measurement of HCV viral load variation and quantitation of HGF stimulation in CKD patients (HCV+ and HCV?) on HD, along the HD session. (ii) Study whether albumin HD (MARS) decreases HCV viral load and stimulates HGF, compared to HD sessions. Methods:? We performed two MARS and two HD sessions in vitro by using an extracorporeal circuit with blood bag contaminated with HCV serum with a known HCV viral load. (We used only a single blood bag for each testing.) In vivo we performed three MARS sessions. The total number of treatments was 6 in 2 patients (3 treatments each) and one HD session in 2 HCV+ patients and 5 HCV? patients (included in HD program in our center), taking samples at the start of the following HD session, to compare the results with those obtained in vitro. We took samples at the beginning, middle, and at the end of MARS sessions in vivo and in vitro and starting (15?min) and at the end and before starting the following HD session in vivo. (The interval between 2 HD sessions in HCV+ patients was 2 days.) We determined HCV viral load using Amplicor (Roche) and HGF using ELISA (R 15?min, 1537; final, 1981 HD in vitro: start, 476; 15?min, 677; final, 1236 HD in vivo: start, 2808.57; ?15?min, >8000; final, ??2605.28; ?start the following session, 2299.5 MARS in vivo: HGF starting (first session, 4633; second session, ??4390; third session, 4775); at 4?h (first session, 5443; second session, 4167; third session, 5178); final (first session, 4477; second session, 6167; third session, 5078). Conclusions:? MARS and HD sessions decreased HCV viral load and stimulated HGF both in vitro and in vivo. It is necessary to confirm these results because it could offer protective effect for HCV chronic liver disease outcome. HD seems to be the best option for patients with HCV hepatopathy. On the other hand, patients with liver disease who need to be treated with MARS could obtain not only a good clearance of toxin binding to albumin, but also the positive effects described.

AB  - Healthy nutritional status is crucial for obtaining favorable hemodialysis (HD) and transplantation results in chronic renal failure (CRF), because there is a high incidence of malnutrition in these patients. In addition, there is a remarkable loss of amino acids (AAs) during HD. Purpose:? This study examined changes in the serum AA profiles of pre- and post-HD in order to plan a strategy for providing nutritional support to patients on HD. Method:? Twenty-nine stable male patients on HD were enrolled in this study. The criteria for patient selection were urine output less than 200?mL/day, 3 times HD a week, and HD treatment for more than 12 months. Results:? Total plasma AA concentrations of pre- and post-HD were 2948.4?±?543.1 and 2279.2?±?400.8?mol/L, the difference being highly significant (p?<?0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in the level of essential AAs (EAAs, 774.4?±?163.8 vs. 643.4?±?142.5??mol/L, p?<?0.0005) and non-EAAs (2019.0?±?411.7 vs. 1539.6?±?278.3 ?mol/L, p?<?0.0001) after HD. The ratio of the EAAs to the non-EAAs increased after HD (0.39?±?0.07 vs. 0.42?±?0.07??mol/L). The level of branched chain AAs (BCAAs) of pre- and post-HD was 323.3?±?73.7 vs. 286.7?±?71.2??mol/L and that of aromatic AAs (AAAs) was 180.9?±?56.2 vs. 137.5?±?42.6??mol/L (p?<?0.0005), and the BCCA to AAA ratio increased after HD (1.8?±?0.41 vs. 2.2?±?0.57??mol/L, p?=?0.01). Among the abnormal AAs which appear in CRF, the concentrations of ?-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, 1-methyl histidine, phophoserine, and taurine decreased significantly after HD. Conclusion:? Patients revealed a large loss of AAs including abnormal-appearing AAs during HD. The ratios of EAA to non-EAA and BCAA to AAA increase significantly, which indicates the beneficial effect of HD on the metabolic recovery of the AA profile. But replacing AAs, especially EAAs with high BCAAs, is essential for maintaining nutritional status to compensate the significant loss of AAs during HD.

AB  - Serum level of nitrite plus nitrate (NO2 plus NO3), endothelin-1 (Et-1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been estimated in 20 patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment in a trial to explain the hypotension occurring in some of these patients. According to the incidence of hypotension, patients were divided into GI (n?=?10) hypotension prone patients and GII (n?=?10) hypotension resistant patients (normotensive). Clinical examination with measurement of systolic and mean arterial blood pressure was performed in all cases before and after hemodialysis (HD) settings. After HD, GI showed significant increase in the serum levels of (NO2 plus NO3), IL-1, and TNF-α, whereas a significant decrease in serum Et-1 level was noticed. GII showed no significant change in serum level of the 4 parameters mentioned above. In hypotensive patients, there was a significant positive correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and the duration of dialysis, and a significant negative correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and post dialysis systolic blood pressure, also between IL-1 and Et-1. From the previous results, it could be concluded that the vascular endothelial factors studied (NO and Et-1) together with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α contribute to the development of HD-induced hypotension in ESRF subjects which is evidenced by: (1) the coupling of decrease of blood pressure and increase in NO2 plus NO3 level after HD in group I; (2) Et-1, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor, showed a significant decrease postdialysis; and (3) levels of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) (which are potent NO inducers) were found to be significantly increased postdialysis in group I.

AB  - Kinetics of urea extraction during a single dialysis session in children are unknown, because analysis of solutes in dialysate is difficult due to their extreme dilution. >Objective:? A novel urea monitor of the Gambro Company might be of help in studying urea kinetics also in children. Methods:? We studied 107 urea kinetics in 5 adolescents aged 13?19 years, weighing 26?58?kg, and looked for influences of membrane size, blood flow, and duration of one dialysis session. Urea measurement applies to the change of electric dialysate conductivity due to ionization because of urea splitting by urease. Bicarbonate dialysis regimen was 4?5?h each, 3 times a week, using polysulfone high-flux dialyzers (Fresenius F60 or F80, depending on body size). Results:? Average 4-h urea Kt/V values for F60 (n?=?85) were 1.69±0.53 and for F80 (n?=?21) 1.63±0.25, extracted urea mass was 16.0±5.4?g and 32.5±5.4?g, respectively (p?<?0.05); Kt/V urea results for blood flows of 180?220?mL/min were 1.36±0.52 and for <180?mL/min 1.10±0.43; extracted urea mass was 17.3±8.0 and 11.7±4.9?g, respectively (p?<?0.05). Total average urea extraction ratio after 2?h of dialysis (n?=?107) was 64.8±5.6%. Extraction ratio during the 4th h of dialysis was only 15.3±4.1% and during the 5th h not more than 9.0±3.6% of total urea extraction. Conclusion:? Kinetics of urea extraction helps understanding dialysis processes in children. Adapting the size of the dialyzer according to body size raises urea extraction and maintains urea clearance Kt/V at the desired quality level. An inadequate blood flow lowers both urea extraction and urea clearance Kt/V. Prolonging dialysis beyond 4?h is, at least in concern of urea kinetic modelling, a rather ineffective means. We speculate that children with blood flow problems should be dialysed more often.

AB  - Heparin is almost universally used as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis. Rare but serious side effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anaphylaxis, and these may lead to significant mortality and morbidity if left unrecognized. We are reporting a patient who developed HIT followed by an anaphylactoid reaction. This 8-year-old girl with Joubert's syndrome developed end-stage renal disease secondary to nephronophthisis. She had a Permacath double-lumen hemodialysis catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein and was started on hemodialysis using an Asahi B10 65 Dialyzer on 1/28/03. The platelet count at that time was 246???103/mL. Beef lung heparin was used for anticoagulation. She was admitted for living related donor renal transplant on 2/10/03 but was found to be thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 49???103/mL. The transplant was postponed, a sepsis work-up was performed, and she was started on antibiotics pending culture results. Hemodialysis was continued with heparin anticoagulation, and despite an improvement in the platelet count she had an acute anaphylactoid reaction 2 days later. The reaction occurred 20?min after starting her hemodialysis treatment and presented as acute onset of bronchospasm, agitation, and chest discomfort. She improved with nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous epinephrine. A review of her records revealed that she had received 6 hemodialysis treatments. The platelet count on 2/3/03, after 3 hemodialysis treatments, had been 242???103/mL and on 2/8/03 after 5 treatments the platelet count was 72???103/mL. HIT with anaphylaxis was suspected. Heparin was discontinued and the platelet count had returned to normal within 2 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive heparin-associated antibody test. While HIT is recognized as a complication in 1?5% of patients treated with heparin and has been well described in the literature, we could only find 2 reported cases of heparin-induced anaphylaxis and in both cases there was accompanying thrombocytopenia. This patient further illustrates a possible linkage between these two phenomena. HIT is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialysis and continued exposure to heparin may induce anaphylaxis.

AB  - Quality control of dialysis treatment has received wide attention since inadequate dialysis dose was an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Each 0.1 decrease in Kt/V less than 1.2 is estimated to increase the relative risk of death by 5?7%. A higher Kt/V can be achieved by increasing treatment time, using a larger dialyzer or increasing blood or dialysate flow rates. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to know, using online conductivity monitor (OCM) routinely, whether a certain subgroup of patients is being treated inadequately. 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFI and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Inadequate dialysis dose was considered at OCM Kt/V less than 1.2. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Watson volume (Wv) to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The OCM Kt/V weekly was inversely related to Wv (r?=??0.833, p?<?0.001). 20.8% of our patients are at risk of inadequate dialysis dose, and it reflects our current practice of dialysis prescription. All of them are anuric young men with a Wv?>?40?L. Specific efforts are required to deliver an adequate dialysis dose in this kind of patients. This can be achieved by altering dialysis frequency, increasing membrane surface, and/or increasing dialysis flow. OCM Kt/V device permits a daily dialysis dose delivery and, consequently, an individualized prescription. Prospective studies are required to establish whether adequate dialysis dose in patients with Wv?>?40?L may further improve their survival.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the ability of tissue engineered cartilage to adhere to and integrate with porous polyethylene (PPE) in vivo and to evaluate the biomechanical integrity of the bond formed at the interface. Porcine auricular, articular, and costal chondrocytes were suspended in fibrin gel polymer and placed between discs of PPE to form tri-layer constructs. Controls consisted of fibroblasts suspended in gel or gel alone between the discs. Constructs were implanted into nude mice for 6, 12, and 18 weeks. Upon harvest, specimens were evaluated for neocartilage formation and integration into the PPE, using histological, dimensional (mass, thickness, diameter), and biomechanical (adhesion strength, interfacial stiffness, failure energy and failure strain) analyses. Neotissue was formed in all experimental constructs, consisting mostly of neocartilage integrating with discs of PPE. Control samples contained only fibrous tissue. Biomechanical analyses demonstrated that adhesion strength, interfacial stiffness, and failure energy were all significantly higher in the chondrocyte-seeded samples than in fibroblast-seeded controls, with the exception of costal constructs at 12 weeks, which were not significantly greater than controls. In general, failure strains did not vary between groups. In conclusion, porous polyethylene supported the growth of neocartilage that formed mechanically functional bonds with the PPE. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
