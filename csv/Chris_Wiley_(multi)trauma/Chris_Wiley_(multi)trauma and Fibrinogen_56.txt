AB  - Heparin-free anticoagulation in hemodialysis (HD) is advocated for patients with clotting abnormalities and risk of bleeding. Objective:? First publication on regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in children. RCA is free from systemic effects, guarantees excellent dialyzer life, but requires careful monitoring. Methods:? We report on 3 patients treated by intermittent RCA HD (4?h each, high-flux dialyzer F40, Fresenius): (1) 17-year-old boy (renal transplant failure, access via cubital Cimino fistula) after hypertensive intra-cerebral hemorrhage (2 sessions); (2) 13-year-old girl (hemolytic uremic syndrome, access via jugular vein Shaldon catheter) after abdominal surgery and bleeding (8 sessions); and (3) 7-year-old boy (hyperoxaluria, access via PermCath? jugular vein catheter) after renal transplant biopsy (3 sessions). Sodium citrate 30% was infused into the extra corporeal circuit (blood flow 150?mL/min) before dialyzer (initial flow 30?mL/min) and calcium gluconate 10% for antidote into venous line near of catheter or fistula (initial flow 40?mL/min). Post-dialyzer extracorporeal serum Ca++ (aim?<?0.3?mmol/L) and pre-dialyzer intra-corporeal Ca++ (aim?>?0.9) were measured for every 30?min. Serum Na+, K+, base excess (BE), blood flow, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood out-flow and in-flow pressure were also monitored. Results:? For adequate RCA (mean extracorporeal serum Ca++ 0.24?±?0.04?mmol/L), a mean citrate flow of 36.1?±?5.9?mL/h and a mean calcium substitution rate of 40.8?±?3.4?mL/h were needed. Intra-corporeal Ca++ was kept at 1.10?±?0.07?mmol/L. Extracorporeal activated clotting time (ACT) was 194?±?41 and intra-corporeal ACT 90?±?12?sec. Serum Na+, K+, and BE during HD were 138?±?2, 3.5?±?0.3, and ?0.6?±?1.1?mmol/L, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressures of patients 1?3 were 117?±?5, 103?±?5, and 102?±?6?mmHg. All patients were stable and without any bleeding during HD. The only adverse event was 1 episode of hypocalcemia (Ca++?<?0.6?mmol/L) cured by stopping dialysis. Conclusions:? Local anticoagulation with sodium citrate during intermittent HD can be applied safely in children and adolescents.

AB  - Atherosclerotic lesion of coronary artery frequently accompanies intimal hyperplasia of radial artery. We have reported that the lesion of radial artery (intimal hyperplasia) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is associated with early access failure (EAF) as well as ischemic heart disease (IHD) (Am J Kidney Dis. 2003; 41: 422?428). Objective:? This study was designed to determine the impact of IHD on the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 125 nondiabetic HD patients who received radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula operation for the first time. We evaluated IHD before the operation through clinical symptoms and electrocardiography and then investigated EAF within 1 year after the operation. We analyzed the access patency rates between the patients with and without IHD, using Kaplan?Meier method and log-rank test. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors of the EAF. Results:? The mean age of the patients was 48?±?14 years, and the number of females was 54 (43.2%). Of the total 125 patients, 19 patients (15.4%) had IHD before the operation. The EAF developed in 23 patients (18.4%) within 1 years after the operation. The access patency rate in the patients with IHD was lower than that in the patients without IHD (39.7 vs. 88.3%, p?<?0.001). IHD and old age were independent risk factors of the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. But sex, smoking history, hypertension, and the levels of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, albumin, and total cholesterol checked before the operation were not associated with the EAF. Conclusion:? This study suggests that IHD is closely associated with EAF in nondiabetic HD patients.

AB  - The Dialysis Outcome and Quality Initiative has guidelines for vascular access and states that the dialysis catheter (DC) should be limited to less than 20% of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Our center has found this target difficult to achieve. Objective:? We wondered what the reasons for use of a DC might be. Methods:? We noted the number of patients with a DC in place and assessed the reasons why the DC was being used on 8/1/03. Results:? 73 of the 170 (42.9%) patients had a DC on 8/1/03. 24 (32.9%) of the patients refused to have initial arteriovenous fistulae or grafts (AVF/G) or a secondary AVF/G revision or replacement procedure performed after initial AVF/G failure. 15 (20.5%) patients had a maturing AVF/G, 12 (16.4%) had significant medical and/or surgical contraindications for AVF/G placement, 9 (12.3%) patients were awaiting surgical thrombectomy, revision or placement of AVF/G, 6 patients (8.2%) were awaiting transfer to CPD therapy, 4 (5.5%) patients were undecided about having an AVF/G placed, and 1 (1.4%) had acute renal failure and early ESRD recovery was expected. Only 2 (2.7%) patients had no access plan by the nephrology team. Conclusions:? Patients' refusal for an AVF/G placement and patients with a maturing AVF/G or awaiting surgical revision or placement were the most common reasons for the use of a DC in our center. To significantly impact on the high use of the DC, it would be crucial to better understand the reasons for patients? refusals.

AB  - Substantial morbidity occurs within the hemodialysis population due to complications of vascular access, most frequently manifests as thrombotic events. An access management goal was the reduction of thrombotic events and associated morbidity. Intra-dialytic vascular access blood flow (ABF) measurements using Crit-Line Delta H ABF have been previously shown to provide objective and accurate access flow data and were our primary method of evaluating access function. A designated ?access manager? was assigned responsibility to track all issues related to vascular access. Each patient's ABF was measured monthly and the flow ?trend? was graphed using Crit-Line Access Manager software. Additional data, including auscultation, cannulation difficulties, failing URR, and increased venous pressures were also recorded. These data and ABF trends were used to establish an angiography ?hot list?. Following angioplasty, ABF was again measured to confirm a successful intervention. The ?hot list? led to 43 angiography referrals of which 83.7% (36/43) required subsequent intervention resulting in significant reductions of thrombosis events in PTFE grafts and native fistulae. The annual incidence of thrombotic events decreased from 1.6 to 0.4 events/patient year in grafts and 0.5?0.0 events in fistulae. Additionally, the percentage of URR's?>?70 increased from 82.3 to 90.1% over the same time period. Use of the Crit-Line Delta H ABF device in conjunction with a vascular access management program can significantly reduce the number of thrombotic events per patient year.

AB  - Dialysis adequacy indexed by Kt/V in hemodialysis (HD) patients is recommended as a single-pool Kt/V of at least 1.2 per session thrice weekly. But many patients cannot achieve this adequacy target. Although dialysis time is the most important as a factor influencing Kt/V, it is difficult to prolong dialysis time in practice because of its economic impact and poor patient compliance. Objective:? The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of increasing blood flow rate on dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V. Methods:? This study enrolled 36 HD patients with single-pool Kt/V <1.2 per session thrice weekly, which was measured in dialyzer blood flow rate of 230?mL/min. We increased 15% of blood flow rate in patients <65?kg of body weight and 20% in patients >65?kg. And then we compared Kt/V and urea reduction ratio (URR) between before and after increasing blood flow rate. Results:? The mean age was 48?±?11 years (23?73 years), and the number of males was 25. Of the total patients, 24 patients had dry weight <65?kg. Mean dialysis duration was 52?±?50 months (3?216 months). Mean Kt/V before increasing blood flow rate was 1.02?±?0.09. It increased to 1.14?±?0.12 after increasing blood flow rate (p?<?0.001). Of the total 36 patients, 13 patients (36.1%) achieved adequacy target (Kt/V?≤?1.2). Mean URR before increasing blood flow rate was 56.9?±?4.0%. It also increased to 60.8?±?4.1% (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that increasing blood flow rate by 15?20% of previous flow rate is effective in achieving dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V.

AB  - In March 2003, a series of cases of sudden respiratory disease syndrome (SARS) has been reported to be spreading in Toronto. With limited knowledge of the causative agent, an immediate strategy that would help contain and prevent the dissemination of the disease especially among our immunosuppressed hemodialysis patients was required. Objective:? To share the precautionary measures implemented in our unit in containing or preventing the spread of the virus among our hemodialysis patients. Methods:? Retrospective analysis of the impact of the implementation of strict measure of disease control and education of all staff. Other data were gathered through interviews of some Microbiologists in Toronto, St. Michael's Hospital Infection Control Department and Health, Canada. Result:? The precautionary measure implemented has been successful. None of our dialysis patients or health care workers were affected. Conclusion:? The measures implemented has not been proven 100% effective in protecting our dialysis patients and our staff, but we hope that the data will help prepare other health care professionals and other dialysis institutions in the event of another outbreak.

AB  - Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. The incremental elastic modulus (Einc) measurement is a good marker of arterial wall stiffness. Arteriosclerosis is characterized by stiffening of arteries. Metabolic, inflammatory, and hemodynamic alterations cause structural changes and vascular complications in end-stage renal disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors that may affect the development of arteriosclerosis by measurement of Einc in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Thirty-two patients (16 men and 16 women) on chronic HD with a mean age of 42.2?±?19.3 (range, 15?80) were included in the study. The carotid Einc was measured to determine arteriosclerosis by high-resolution echo-tracking system. Einc measurement was calculated from transcutaneous measurements of carotid arterial internal diameter and wall thickness and carotid pulse pressure. Common carotid compliance (CCC) and distensibility (CCD) were determined from changes in carotid artery diameter during systole and simultaneously measured carotid pulse pressure. Serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), predialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP), predialysis diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), age, HD duration, CCC, and CCD were correlated with Einc in all patients. A significant positive correlation was found between Einc and age (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), SBP (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.02), PP (r?=?0.40, p?<?0.02), Ca (r?=?0.43, p?<?0.01), CRP (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.02). As expected, Einc was correlated inversely with CCD (r?=??0.77, p?<?0.0001). The correlation between Einc and HD duration, DBP, ferritin, P, PTH, and CCC was not significant. In conclusion, the stiffening of carotid artery in HD patients is related not only to hemodynamic changes (increased SBP and PP) but also to metabolic (increased Ca) and inflammatory (increased CRP) responses. Carotid Einc is an accepted independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Because of the positive correlation between Einc and serum Ca, vitamin D and Ca-containing P binder should be used carefully in HD patients.

AB  - Background:? Renal failure in elderly patients often generates an ethical question ?should dialysis be initiated?? The nephrologists are faced with the dilemma of conveying the prognosis of renal failure in elderly patients and also explain the pros and cons of offering a renal replacement therapy (RRT). Methods:? We report a retrospective study conducted between 6/2001 and 6/2003 to evaluate the clinical situations where initiating RRT was considered inappropriate. All patients who opted for not initiating/withdrawal of RRT were included in the study. Results:? Twenty-four patients were included in the study. All patients were males with average age 70.7 years. 17/24 were in the intensive care unit. Complex medical illnesses with poor quality of life were the major reasons for opting out of RRT. 20/24 patients opted for not initiating RRT and 3/24 patients opted for withdrawal. 1/24 opted for a trial of RRT before taking long-term decisions. 3/20 who opted against initiating RRT had advanced directives. 18/20 who opted for not initiating RRT died within 3 days of the need for RRT, 2/20 are alive without RRT after 6 and 4 months with estimated GFR of 14 and 12?mL/min, respectively. Patient who opted for a trial of RRT died eventually, 4 months after a prolonged bedridden stay in a nursing home. 3/3 ESRD patients died within a week after withdrawing dialysis. Conclusion:? The decision to initiate RRT should be made considering the overall prognosis. A decision to not initiate or withdraw RRT is possible in critically ill patients and if taken judiciously can reduce physical and mental stress of both patient and their family members.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) survival in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis (HD) has been reported to be shortened due to the oxidative damage of RBC membrane. The use of antioxidants might help in the control of anemia and reduce the erythropoietin (EPO) dose needed. Objective:? The objective was to determine the effects of vitamin E-bonded dialyzer membrane (VEM) on anemia and EPO requirements in chronic HD patients. Patients and methods:? We prospectively studied 19 stable patients on HD (8 males, age 58.47, range 31?76 years) who were shifted from other dialyzer membranes to VEM for 6 months. At baseline they were given a mean dose of EPO of 90.6?±?51?U?kg?1 BW?1?week?1. Clinical data, dry body weight corrected pre-dialysis RBC, hemoglobin, reticulocytes, serum iron and ferritin, complete biochemistry, iPTH, and CRP were studied at 3 and 6 months, while therapy scheme was reevaluated monthly. Results:? A significant rise, compared to the baseline, was found in hemoglobin and in RBC at 3 months of treatment (12.44?±?1.16?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?=?0.002; and 4.01?± 0.53???106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05) and at the end of follow-up (12.17?±?1.33?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?<?0.05; and 4.03?±?0.53 ??106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05). No significant change in serum iron and ferritin, reticulocytes, EPO dose used, iPTH, Kt/V, or CRP was found at the end of follow-up compared to the baseline (68.8?±?17?mg/dL vs. 67.9 ±?18?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 421?±?296?mg/dL vs. 478?± 359?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 3.76?±?0.89???104/?L vs. 3.82?±?0.78 ??104/?L, p?=?NS; 90.2?±?53?U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1 vs. 90.6?±?51 U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1, p?=?NS; 157?±?43?pg/dL vs. 148?±?56?pg/dL, p?=?NS; 1.21?±?0.22 vs. 1.2?±?0.17, p?=?NS; 7.15?± 5.42?mg/L vs. 15.38?±?29.8?mg/L, p?=?NS, respectively). Conclusions:? Despite the small number of patients and the short time interval of treatment, an antioxidant effect of VEM apparently achieved early a better control of anemia in HD patients.

AB  - Several types of dialyzers with enhanced internal filtration have been introduced in order to increase solute clearance, especially in relatively larger molecular solutes. In these dialyzers, enhanced internal filtration increased convective transport of the solute in addition to diffusive transport. The internal filtration flow rate (QIF) has not, however, been measured in clinical situations, because none of monitoring techniques can measure this value. Herein, the QIF value was estimated during an experimental and an analytical study. Namely, we measured blood flow velocity in a cross-sectional plane of the dialyzer by pulse Doppler ultrasonography. An in vitro study with bovine blood was carried out to determine the local blood flow velocity profile with a newly designed probe slider that enables parallel movement of the probe along the dialyzer. Furthermore, an analytical model was newly introduced to calculate changes in flow rate and pressure of blood and dialysate streams and solute concentrations along the dialyzer. The QIF value could be estimated by a simulation analysis to the experimental data using the analytical model.

AB  - Some authors suggest that inflammation can be one of the reasons of erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. The purpose of the study was to follow-up some laboratory markers of inflammation in 21 dialysis patients, all treated with adequate anaemia doses EPO, divided in 2 groups: first one adequately responding to EPO treatment (with Hb higher than 9?g/L) and second one resistant to it (with Hb lower than 9?g/L). Some acute phase proteins and markers of inflammation were measured as follow: C-reactive protein (CRP), α1-AGT, α1-antitrypsine, and haptoglobine (HP), as some anti-acute phase proteins, transferrin (TF). WBC count, some enzymes: ASAT, ALAT, and substrates: urea, creatinine, albumins (Albs), lipid profile, glucose, phosphate, iron, electrolytes, and parathyroid hormone were tested as well. The study found significant higher CRP, HP, Tg, P, and Alb in the second group than in the first. TF was lower in all patients, which may be connected to the chronic inflammatory status (uremia), and there was no iron deficit or severe parathyroid hyperfunction to be convinced for EPO resistance. The study suggests that EPO resistance may be related to some inflammatory factors and treatment of the inflammation possibly will overcome the problem.

AB  - During the last decade, the number of patients starting renal replacement therapy has increased for all ages, but the increase for patients over 65 years old has been particularly dramatic. Objective:? The aim of our study was the analysis of the outcome of all the patients who were over 65 years of age at the time they started chronic hemodialysis, in our Center (n, 52). Methods:? A total of 76 patients were treated by the chronic hemodialysis program of 251 Hellenic Air Force and VA General Hospital, between 1992 and 2002, while totally 309 patients were offered dialysis at this time. We found that 52 of them (68.4%) were over 65 years old [40 male (76.9%), 12 female (23.1%)]. Results:? Elderly patients manifest more often intradialytic complications, such as hypotensive episodes (28.8%) and arrhythmias (23.1%), due to their hemodynamic instability. Polypharmacy is a big deal for dialysis patients, especially elderly ones. Each patient was taking 9.1 PO and 1.9 IV medications on average, per day. Most of them (84.6%) required recombinant human erythropoietin. The most common co-morbid factors we observed in this population were cardiovascular diseases (36.5%), neurological problems, respiratory failure, bone disease, malignancy (17.3%), depression, malnutrition, and infections (30.8%). Deaths were often associated with more than one morbid factors. Survival and the quality of life in the elderly patients on hemodialysis are frequently acceptable. The 1, 3 and 5-year patient survival rates during 1990?2000 were 63.4%, 56.1%, and 26.8%. Conclusion:? We believe that if there are no extracontraindications, elderly patients can benefit from hemodialysis, taking into consideration that we should adapt the therapy to the geriatric special needs.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the use of daily dialysis since long-term experiences have shown good results. Online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is an HDF technique that combines diffusion with high convection in which the ultrapure dialysis fluid itself is used as a reinfusion solution. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the more effective dialysis schedule (daily dialysis) with the dialysis modality that offers the highest uremic toxin removal (OL-HDF). Five children with left ventricular hypertrophy, mean age 12.3?±?6.2 years, on standard 3??4?h 3 times a week OL-HDF at least during the last 6 months, were switched to D-OL-HDF, 3??4?h 6 times per week with a minimal follow up of 6 months. Dialysis parameters were similar during both periods and only frequency of each session was changed. Tolerance, anemia control, phosphatemia, and phosphate binders, need of blood pressure medications, and left ventricular hypertrophy were evaluated. Only 3 of the 5 enrolled children could be followed 12 months, 1 was transplanted after 3 months, the other after 5 months D-OL-HDF. For all the children the disappearance of postdialysis fatigue was rapidly reported. There was a significant decrease in predialysis levels of phosphatemia (from 1.67±0.23 to 1.28±0.29?mmol/L) despite phosphate binders reduction of more than 50%. Hemoglobin significantly increased (from 11.8±0.9 to 13.4±1.3?g percentage ml) allowing EPO doses reduction. Left ventricular hypertrophy disappeared after 6 months D-OL-HDF, fractional shortening increased, allowing registration on transplantation list for 1 child. Our results clearly demonstrate that daily online HDF is able to offer to children on chronic dialysis a marked reduction of the cardiovascular risk factors. Is it ethical to reserve this dialysis modality only to selected children?

AB  - Purpose:? To analyze survival and causes of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) diabetic patients treated by hemodialysis. Methods:? Data of 1203 ESRD hemodialyzed patients between 1975 and 2002 were analyzed, 116 patients were excluded and 1087 patients included in the study. We studied the prevalence of the diabetic nephropathy, the rate of survival and causes of death by comparing diabetic patients with a control group of patients without diabetes. Results:? Among the 1087 patients requiring dialysis, 272 (25%) were diabetic and 815 non-diabetic whose causal nephropathy was nephroangiosclerosis 32%, glomerulonephritis 15%, chronic interstitial nephropathy 14%, and others 14%. The diabetics were older at the beginning of dialysis than non-diabetic patients: 60.33?±?11.39 years vs. 52.23?±?17.20 years, p?<?0.001. Average time on dialysis is more important in non-diabetic than diabetic group [5.90?±?5.73 years vs. 2.71.?±?2.48 years, p?<?0.001]. The rate of death was higher in diabetics than in control group [71.7% vs. 55.8%, respectively, p?<?0.003]. The difference in survival between the two groups remains significant for the same age. Death caused by cardiovascular disorders is higher in diabetics (68.8%) than non-diabetics (31.2%) (p?<?0.05). Among death causes, stroke is the most frequent cause in diabetics (18.4% vs. 11.6%) in non-diabetics, p?<?0.05. Death by heart failure and infections is higher in diabetics but the difference is not statistically significant (12.3% in diabetics vs. 9.4% in non-diabetics for heart failure and 13.8% vs. 11.4% for infections). Death due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetics (4.39% vs. 1.02% in diabetics, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? In our cohort, mortality in diabetic patients is higher than in non-diabetic patients. Cardio-vascular disorders are the most cause of death in diabetics and above all stroke, whereas mortality due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetic patients. Diabetes is an important risk factor of mortality in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Abstract An approximately 2-year-old female Doberman Pinscher was referred for the evaluation of bilateral, chronic proliferative conjunctivitis. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral thick, opaque pseudomembranes originating from the conjunctivae that prevented visualization of the cornea and interior structures of the eye. Histopathological findings of biopsies of the pseudomembranes were consistent with ligneous conjunctivitis. Serum plasminogen activity levels were within the normal range. Treatment with topical and systemic anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs did not improve the conjunctival lesions. The pseudomembranes were surgically excised, and the conjunctival surfaces were reconstructed with amniotic membrane. At final re-examination two years postsurgery, there was no evidence of recurrence of the pseudomembranes. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of the successful treatment of canine ligneous conjunctivitis with amniotic membrane transplantation.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) frequently occurs in hemodialysis (HD) patients. But, clinical characteristics of UGIB in HD patients are not well reported yet. Objective:? This study was designed to compare the clinical characteristics of UGIB between HD patients and normal population with intact renal function. Methods:? This study enrolled 24 HD patients with UGIB. Age- and sex-matched 26 patients with UGIB and normal renal function were selected as control group during the same period. Of the cases with UGIB, esophageal variceal bleedings due to liver cirrhosis were excluded in this study. We investigated the results of treatment and UGIB-associated mortality for 3 months after the event and then compared previous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Sx), endoscopic findings, treatment results, and mortality between HD patients and control. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. HD patients (n?=?24) Control (n?=?26) p value Age (years) 60±11 61±11 0.702 Sex [male/female (%)] 62.5/37.5 53.8/46.2 0.536 Previous GI Sx ??[asymptomatic/??symptomatic (%)] 33.3/66.7 65.3/34.7 0.024 Endoscopic diagnosis ??[vascular ectasia/others (%)] 45.8/54.2 15.3/84.7 0.020 Primary treatment ??[endoscopic/medical (%)] 70.8/29.2 61.5/38.5 0.488 Results of treatment ?Success/rebleeding (%) 75.0/25.0 92.4/7.6 0.095 ?Patient survival/UGIB- ??related death (%) 83.3/16.7 100/0 0.046 Conclusion:? Previous gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent in HD patients than normal population with intact renal function. In contrast, HD patients had higher incidence of vascular ectasia and mortality than normal population with intact renal function.

AB  - Survival has been defined as an index of adequacy of dialysis. These hard data are the basis for comparing results obtained by different schedules or policies. The aim of the study was to assess mortality rate recorded within a system of tailored dialysis (1?6 dialysis per week in out-of-hospital settings: home hemodialysis, self- and limited care dialysis). Data recorded in a single center (1998?2003) were compared with data gathered in the Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation in the whole Region (1998?2000). Methods:? Out-of-hospital dialysis unit is active since 1971, in which a new program integrating self- and limited care and home dialysis started since 1998. Patients:? Incident dialysis patients starting renal replacement therapy within the program and all further patients starting dialysis in the Region in the same period were compared in an historical prospective cohort study. Results:? 55 patients in the Unit and further 1443 patients in the whole Region started RRT since 1998. Main features of 55 patients were 32 males 23 females; median age 51 years, range 20?76; 72.7% displaying at least 1 comorbid factor. Throughout the period gross mortality rate was 4/125 patient-years in the Center. Kaplan?Meier curves showed a 1-year survival of 100% vs. 91%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region, and a 2-year survival of 95.5% vs. 76.6%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region (p?=?0.001). The main demographic features were remarkably different in both settings (for the whole Region median age 66 years, range 2.2?101, at least 1 comorbidity in 56.9% of patients). In an attempt to correct for the different baseline characteristics, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The whole model resulted in statistically significant value (p?=?0.000) and an increasing mortality risk resulted for age at starting dialysis, diabetes, and collagenopathy. In conclusion, tailored, high-efficiency dialysis policy may allow superior survival results. A longer follow up is needed to confirm our approach; in larger cohorts, the finding of a low mortality rate in a relatively young population with high comorbidity may underline the need to review our current concepts on dialysis adequacy.

AB  - One of the main symptoms of terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. One of the best applicable methods correcting anemia is using recombinant human erythropoietin preparation. Using recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of events had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patient had refraction to erythropoietin, which has spurred the search for new efficient methods correcting anemia. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of the laser on erythropoiesis and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency. In the course of the study, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocytes in blood, and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) were determined. At the beginning of the treatment, all hematological parameters 5 and 15 days after marrow stimulation were defined. 15 days after marrow stimulation with laser, increasing amounts of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were observed. The initial erythrocyte count was 2.22?±?0.1???1012/L, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/L and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During the laser treatment, erythrocyte count increased up to 2.9?±?0.8???1012/L, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/L and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3% (p?<?0005).

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula
