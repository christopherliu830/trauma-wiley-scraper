AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a pathophysiological syndrome characterized by clinical manifestations of generalized bleeding together with laboratory features of severe coagulopathy. Thus, DIC is a failure of haemostatic homeostasis. In DIC there is unregulated and uncontrolled activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets resulting in blockage of the microvascular system of critical organs. In addition, there is activation of the fibrinolytic cascade generating plasmin and consequently fibrin and fibrinogen degradation, together with depletion of components of the natural anticoagulant pathway which contribute to the systemic bleeding diathesis. The diagnosis of DIC is made in the presence of a predisposing cause, the clinical manifestations of systemic bleeding and multiorgan dysfunction and from appropriate laboratory investigations. The first principle of management of DIC should be toward resuscitation of the patient to achieve adequate oxygenation, blood pressure, circulation and renal perfusion. Treatment of the underlying cause and other strategies are discussed.

AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cimicoxib (Cimalgex?; Vétoquinol SA) for the control of perioperative pain in dogs. Methods A double-blind, randomized, controlled multi-centre field study was conducted in 237 dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery. Pain was monitored by the attending veterinarian over the 7 days following the surgical procedure using two pain-scoring systems and a visual analogue scale. An enhanced monitoring protocol for postoperative pain was utilized during the first 24 hours after surgery. The dog owner's assessment of perceived analgesia during this time period was also recorded. Results Cimicoxib demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority compared to carprofen. These findings were confirmed by owners? assessments and by the evolution of the pain scores. Both drugs were well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Significance Cimicoxib had non-inferior efficacy and tolerability when compared to carprofen for the control of perioperative pain in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.

AB  - Summary.? The biphasic waveform is an early marker of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Neutrophil elastase (NE) cleaves coagulation factors; thus, elevated elastase levels or its dysregulation by α-1-protease inhibitor (?1PI) may be linked to DIC. Time courses over a period were determined for factors associated with NE and coagulation in 14 Intensive Care Unit patients with a biphasic waveform who developed DIC. The data were analyzed using a random coefficient linear regression model to predict the variables' mean values on day 0 and their mean rates of change over the period in which the biphasic waveform appeared. The biphasic waveform was normal on day 0, maximized on day 1, and approached normal again by day 4. ?1PI/NE complex levels were 2.5-fold greater than normal for the entire period. The A1PI activity, antigen, and specific activity levels were normal on day 0 and increased thereafter by 21.0, 10.5, and 8.9% of normal per day, respectively. Factor II, V, VII, IX, and X activity levels were, respectively, 57, 46, 46, 77, and 46% of normal on day 0, whereas factor VIII and fibrinogen levels were normal. All coagulation factor levels trended upward with time but not significantly. The prothrombin time, but not the activated partial thromboplastin time, was prolonged, and the platelet counts and hematocrits were below normal on day 0 and remained so thereafter. We conclude that events associated with neutrophil activation, elastase release, and perturbations of coagulation precede both the appearance of the biphasic waveform and the diagnosis of DIC in these patients.

AB  - Abstract HZ/su is an investigational recombinant subunit vaccine for the prevention of shingles, a disease resulting from the reactivation of varicella zoster virus. The vaccine is composed of recombinant varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE), and liposome-based Adjuvant System AS01. To evaluate the potential local and systemic effects of this vaccine, three studies were performed in rabbits. In the first two studies, rabbits received a single intramuscular (IM; study 1) or subcutaneous (SC; study 2) dose of gE/AS01, AS01 alone (in study 2 only) or saline, and the local tolerance was evaluated up to 3?days after administration. Under these conditions, only local inflammatory reactions at the injection sites were detected by microscopic evaluation. In the third study, gE/AS01, AS01 alone or saline, were injected SC or IM on four occasions at 2?week intervals. General health status, local tolerance, ophthalmology, haematology and blood chemistry parameters were monitored. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were performed after termination of the study. The only treatment-related changes included a transient increase in neutrophils, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels and microscopic signs of inflammation at the injection sites, which are expected observations related to the elicited inflammatory reaction. The SC and IM routes of administration produced similar systemic effects. However, microscopic findings at the injection sites differed. One month after the last injection, recovery was complete in all groups. In conclusion, the single and repeated SC and IM administration of the gE/AS01 vaccine were locally and systemically well-tolerated in rabbits and support the clinical development of the vaccine.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the role of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in probiotics while also referring to other moonlighting proteins as the need arises. Probiotics do not produce toxic substances such as ammonia, indole, phenol, and nitrosamine, while probiotics can assimilate ammonia, inhibit the growth of toxic-substance-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and adsorb and eliminate these substances. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is one of the best-studied probiotic strains and many beneficial effects have been reported. LGG has been commercialized and consumed in a wide variety of food products and dietary supplements throughout the world for long time. Most reports about the multiple moonlighting functions of surface GAPDH in probiotics refer to adhesins. GAPDH has multi-binding properties. GAPDH may relate to stress response because some reports show expression of moonlighting proteins such as GAPDH increase under various stress conditions.

AB  - Abstract We have developed an organotypic culture system that allows the production of bone tissue features on a centimeter scale. A composite, calcium phosphate?strained fibrin gel system is able to organize itself in the presence of osteoblastic cells, creating basic hierarchical units as seen in vivo, and can be modified to produce a range of other tissues that require such directional structuring. Constructs evolve over time into multi-compositional structures containing a high mineral content and terminally differentiated, osteocyte-like cells. These tissues can be cultured over extended durations (exceeding 1 year) and are responsive to a variety of chemical and biological agents. The platform can reduce the number of animals used in experimentation by acting as an intermediate stage in which more personalized research conditions can be generated. We provide a thorough description of the protocol used to successfully culture and modify this system, as well as guidance on compositional characterization. ? 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The presence of persistently high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels is well known to be associated with a state of inflammation, malnutrition, and erythropoietin resistance in hemodialysis (HD) population. Meanwhile, a substantial group of patients present with intermittent elevations of CRP levels, and its clinical consequences are unclear. We designed this study to compare the inflammatory and nutritional parameters and erythropoietin requirements in HD patients with persistent or intermittent CRP elevation and those with CRP levels in without. We included 100 HD patients [age: 48.4?±?14.3 years; HD duration: 69.3?±?49.0 months (minimum 12 months)]. The 6-month retrospective clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the patient records, and those with chronic inflammatory disease, malignancy, infectious complications, and surgery were excluded. The monthly determined CRP levels (at least 6 for each patient) were reviewed, and the patients were grouped according to their CRP levels as those with persistent (group 1), intermittent (at least one level of CRP?10?mg/L) (group 2), and those with CRP in normal ranges set by the laboratory (group 3). We compared the fibrinogen, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, albumin, prealbumin, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct results of the patient groups. The patient groups revealed significant differences in terms of fibrinogen (p?<?0.001), albumin (p?<?0.0001), prealbumin (p?<?0.007), ICAM-1 (p?<?00.2) levels and nPCR (p?<?0.03), IDWG (p?<?0.02), and rHuEPO/kg/Hct (p?<?0.03) values. Group 2 presented to be in risk of inflammation and malnutrition with a decrease in albumin levels and nPCR and presence of rHUEpo resistance when compared to patients in group 3. We conclude that, similar to HD patients with persistently high CRP levels, those with intermittent elevation of CRP must also be considered to be in a state of chronic inflammatory response associated with malnutrition and erythropoietin resistance. This signifies the importance of regulatory monitoring of CRP in HD population.

AB  - Abstract Colloids have been used for many years in resuscitation yet few studies have thoroughly examined their usefulness. Colloids and a combination of crystalloids and colloids continue to be used without any real scientific basis. Scrutiny of review articles, experimental studies, and clinical investigations reveals conflicting and confusing data. There are too many variables to accurately interpret findings, cross species problems with animal studies, different fluids used making comparisons difficult if not impossible, and confounding variables that include: 1 Health status of the patients 2 Severity/type of injury 3 Complications (especially sepsis) 4 Varying grades of shock 5 Variable time scale of administration of fluids 6 Variable volumes administered 7 Differing methods of determining fluid volume depletion 8 Inconsistent monitoring 9 Differing endpoints 10 Different techniques to measure endpoints 11 Comparison of delayed treatment of traumatic shock with blood loss occurring during surgery of questionable validity. One of the areas that has been studied reasonably well is the allergic effects associated with colloid use and more recently the adverse effects associated with the use of dextrose solutions in patients with head injuries. The continued effort to develop satisfactory resuscitation solutions including the recent development of hypertonic saline solutions (usually in combination with a colloid) highlights the uncertainty that exists in relation to the true role of the colloid and crystalloid agents available. Recent studies question the use of fluids to resuscitate patients with penetrating torso injuries. The aim of this paper is to review what is known about the use of colloids and crystalloids in resuscitation and to recommend guidelines as to which fluid should be used in differing clinical situations.

AB  - Background? Continued haemorrhage remains a major cause of mortality in massively transfused patients, many of whom develop coagulopathy. When reviewing transfusion practice for these patients at our hospital, more than 10% received a suboptimal transfusion therapy and survivors had a higher platelet count than non-survivors. We therefore speculated whether the blood bank could improve its service and hence improve the outcome. Methods? The blood bank introduced monitoring the delivery of blood products and contacted the clinician provided there was an imbalance in the transfusion practice. For massively bleeding patients, transfusion packages, encompassing 5 red blood cells, 5 fresh frozen plasma and 2 platelet concentrates was introduced to improve haemostatic competence. The thrombelastograph (TEG) was implemented, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy. Results The fraction of suboptimally transfused patients declined from > 10% to < 3%. The transfusion package administered intraoperatively to patients operated for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in decreased postoperative transfusion requirements and improved 30-day survival (66% vs. 44%) compared to controls. ?Only performing TEG in patients with a significant bleeding as judged by the anaesthetist reduces the number of analyses by ~85%, whereas those patients with coagulopathy remain identified. The TEG showed 97% predictability in identifying a surgical cause of bleeding in postoperative patients. Ten percent of the massively bleeding trauma patients had hyperfibrinolysis as the major cause of bleeding, whereas 45% were hypercoagulable. Conclusion? The initiatives from the blood bank has improved the transfusion practice and, hence, survival in massively transfused patients at our hospital.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - Summary.? Pregnancy, labour and delivery present intrinsic haemostatic challenges to women with and carriers of bleeding disorders and their offspring. Deficiency of fibrinogen and factor XIII are associated with miscarriage, placental abruption and foetal loss. The risk of antenatal complications including antepartum haemorrhage is unknown in women with other bleeding disorders. There is a significant risk of postpartum haemorrhage (primary and secondary) in women with all types of bleeding disorders. This can be serious and life threatening in those with severe defects such as Bernard Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann?s thrombasthenia. Three to four percent of infants with haemophilia experience cranial bleeding that occurs during labour and delivery. The safest method of delivery for affected babies remains controversial. However, the rate of planned Caesarean section is increasing among known carriers of haemophilia. If vaginal delivery is planned, prolonged labour and difficult delivery especially vacuum extraction are associated with the highest risk of cranial bleeding and should be avoided. The optimal management of pregnancy in women with inherited bleeding disorders requires a multidisciplinary approach and advanced individualized management plan taking into consideration obstetric and bleeding risk factors. Women with mild or moderate bleeding disorders can be managed at their local maternity unit in close collaboration with a tertiary centre. However, those with severe or rare disorders or carrying an affected infant should be managed in a tertiary centre with an onsite Haemophilia centre.

Single lung transplantation and fatal fat embolism acquired from the donor: management and literature review.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 133?138. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Fat embolism (FE) is a consequence of skeletal trauma that occurs in more than 90% of cases of severe trauma. However, most of these emboli are clinically insignificant. We report the case of a 59-yr-old man with massive progressive fibrosis who died from widespread FE after a single-lung transplantation (SLT). The lung donor was a 22-yr-old woman who died from traumatic cerebral injury. She had sustained a closed fracture of the tibia, fibula and pelvis. The PaO2/FiO2 before procurement was 452?mmHg. A left SLT using cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. In the immediate postoperative period, profound pulmonary edema in the transplanted lung developed, with overinflation of the native lung and systemic hypotension. Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) was suspected and nitric oxide (NO) and independent lung ventilation (ILV) initiated. Over the next 24?h the patient?s condition deteriorated and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. The patient died 45?h after transplantation as cardiovascular and respiratory function continued to decline and massive thoracic bleeding secondary to coagulopathy appeared. Post-mortem examination revealed both massive FE in the non-transplanted donor lung and in the allograft lung. Only two previous cases of donor-acquired FE and PGD after lung transplantation (LT) have been reported. Occult pulmonary FE in a traumatized donor should be considered a cause of PGD.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the transfusion, hemostasis, and coagulation. In patients receiving massive transfusion, studies show a survival advantage in patients who received a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cell (PRBC) during initial resuscitation. Studies originating from the military and civilian experience found that the optimal ratio of FFP:PRBC transfusion may be as high as 1:1. A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 FFP:platelet:PRBC versus a 1:1:2 ratio demonstrated improved hemostasis and fewer deaths from hemorrhage by 24 hours in the 1:1:1 group. There was no increase in respiratory complications in the 1:1:1 group, despite prior retrospective associations between increased FFP transfusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread microvascular thrombosis with activation of the coagulation system and impaired protein synthesis, leading to exhaustion of clotting factors and platelets.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) included patients who received off-licence recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for critical bleeding from 2000 to 2009. Approximately 1.3% of the ANZHR patients were Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs). We compared them with the non-JW patients in the registry. Methods Patient characteristics (e.g. gender, context of bleeding), factors influencing rFVIIa use (e.g. body temperature and pH) and outcomes (e.g. bleeding response (stopped/attenuated or unchanged) to rFVIIa, mortality) were compared between JW and non-JW patients using Fisher's exact chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results A total of 42 JW and 3134 non-JW patients were included in the analysis. Approximately 99% (n = 3098) of non-JWs received blood products compared with only 30% (n = 13) of JWs (P < 0.01). The distribution of gender and contexts of critical bleeding in the two groups was significantly different. Approximately 17% of the non-JW patients were hypothermic (T < 35°C) and about 19% were acidotic (pH < 7.2) at the time of initial rFVIIa administration. Conversely, none of the JWs were hypothermic and only one was acidotic. The proportion of positive responders to rFVIIa (stopped/attenuated bleeding following rFVIIa use) was similar in both groups (75% non-JWs, 74% JWs; P = 1.0). Approximately 28% of non-JW and 17% of JW patients were deceased by day 28 following rFVIIa use (P = 0.16). Discussion Several factors were observed to be significantly different between JW and non-JW patients, yet the proportions of responders to rFVIIa were similar in both groups. The actual factors influencing response to rFVIIa are yet to be determined.

AB  - Summary As the survival rate of the intestinal and multi-visceral transplant recipients continues to improve, an increasing number of these patients present for either elective or emergency surgery related or unrelated to transplantation. The aim of this review is to focus on clinical issues related to the anesthetic and perioperative management of the intestinal or multi-visceral transplant recipient for nontransplant surgery. Specific issues concerning perioperative assessment and medications, choice of anesthetic drugs and techniques, and postoperative care management are reviewed.

AB  - Objective To report clinical, laboratory and diagnostic imaging features and prognostic factors in dogs with leptospirosis from North-East Germany. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 99 dogs. At initial presentation, the most common clinical signs were lethargy (96%), anorexia (88%), vomiting (85%), painful abdomen (39%), diarrhoea (38%), oliguria (27%) and tachypnoea (26%). Abnormal laboratory findings included anaemia (63%), thrombocytopenia (63%), leucocytosis (57%), increase of plasma urea (84%) and creatinine concentrations (81%), increased liver enzyme activities (80%), hyperbilirubinaemia (69%), hyperphosphataemia (67%), hyponatraemia (64%), hypoalbuminaemia (55%) and hypokalaemia (29%). Radiological pulmonary changes were detected in 57% of the dogs initially or during the course of disease. Severe dyspnoea, oliguria, azotaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and severe radiological pulmonary changes were more often found in dogs that did not survive. There was renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement in 95, 92 and 58% of the dogs, respectively, and multi-organ lesions in 98 dogs (98%); 32 dogs died or were euthanased. Conclusion Several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were associated with a negative outcome; severe lung involvement was specifically associated with high mortality.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current knowledge of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and describes emerging markers of inflammation in CVD. It examines whether individuals identified on the basis of elevated serum high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP) benefit from clinical intervention. The chapter reviews existing guidelines relating to hs-CRP and highlights limitations in the use of hs-CRP in risk assessment. It evaluates the prognostic value of other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, serum amyloid A, albumin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, circulating immune complexes, heat-shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), paraoxonase-1, and myeloperoxidase in CVD. The chapter reviews the influence of chronic inflammatory disease and infectious burden on CVD, and discusses relevant data regarding pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory effects in CVD. It evaluates the influence of dietary patterns, wholegrains, dietary fat, antioxidants, phytochemicals, plant sterols, alcohol, micronutrients, physical activity, genetics, and family history on inflammatory markers associated with CVD.

AB  - Abstract A prospective randomized study has been performed, comparing a semisynthetic polysulphated xylan of vegetable origin (mol. wt ? 4000) with Dextran 70 as prophylactic agent against postoperative thromboembolic complications following elective abdominal surgery. A total of 109 patients entered the trial and the analysis after exclusions is based on 86 patients. The overall frequency of125 I -labelled fibrinogen test-detected thrombosis was 2·9 per cent in the polysaccharide group against 19·2 per cent in the Dextran 70 group (P < 0·05). There was no difference in haemorrhage or different complications.

AB  - Summary Splenectomy is performed for primary or, less frequently, metastatic malignant tumors, spleen torsion, splenomegaly associated to infiltrative disease, traumatic rupture, and immune-mediated diseases. Splenectomy may be performed as 'open surgery' or laparoscopically. The most common early complication of splenectomy is hemorrhage, associated or not with hemostatic abnormalities. Early complications also include damage to the left pancreatic lobe and gastric wall because of devascularization and acute infection. Arrhythmias are abnormal rhythms of the heart, causing a less effective cardiac output. Arrhythmias, usually in form of rapid ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular arrhythmia, are reported in dogs undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors, torsion, and benign splenomegaly. Continuous monitoring is acceptable when neither significant pulse deficit nor clinical signs are evident. Only symptomatic dogs with no perceptible femoral pulse, multifocal ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia, and hypoperfusion or preexisting cardiac disease should receive medical therapy.

AB  - Tenascin-C (TN-C) is a hexabrachion-shaped extracellular matrix (ECM) protein which has very restricted expression in normal musculoskeletal tissues, but is expressed in large quantities in these tissues during embryogenesis as well as during regenerative and healing processes. TN-C is an elastic protein which has a number of binding sites for other extracellular matrix proteins as well as for cell membrane adhesion receptors. In addition, it can be stretched to several times its resting length, the ability of which is attributed to the stretch-induced unfolding of its fibronectin type III domains. In the musculoskeletal tissues, TN-C is present in the regions where high mechanical forces are transmitted from one tissue component to another, such as the myotendinous and osteotendinous junctions. Not surprisingly, it was recently presented that the expression of TN-C in the musculoskeletal tissues is regulated by the mechanical strain applied to their cells. Thus, taking into account the flexible structure of the TN-C and its site-specific expression pattern at sites exposed to heavy mechanical loads, TN-C is likely to play an important role in providing elasticity to the musculoskeletal tissues. This feature has a special significance in the degenerative and regenerative processes where the normal biomechanical environment of the musculoskeletal tissue is temporarily interrupted by injury. The rapidly increasing understanding of the structure and function of the ECM protein TN-C may well bring important insights into the clinical treatment of sports injuries in the future.
