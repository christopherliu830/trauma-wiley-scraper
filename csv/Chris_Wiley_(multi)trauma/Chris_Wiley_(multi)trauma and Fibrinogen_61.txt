AB  - Summary This chapter explains syndromes produced by the transfusion of incompatible blood. It considers haemolytic reactions due to causes other than incompatibility. By convention, red cell destruction is classified as either intravascular, characterized by rupture of red cells within the bloodstream and liberation of haemoglobin (Hb) into the plasma, or as extravascular, characterized by phagocytosis of red cells by macrophages of the mono-nuclear phagocyte system (MPS), with subsequent liberation of bilirubin into the plasma. Intravascular destruction may be produced by antibodies such as anti - A and anti - B that are readily lytic in vitro , although not all of the red cells are lysed in the plasma; some are sensitized and removed from the circulation by erythrophagocytosis, mainly in the liver. To ensure that haemolysis has not occurred ex vivo , the supernatant plasma of the unit or units of transfused blood should be inspected for free haemoglobin (Hb).

AB  - Summary The aim of this survey was to establish whether ENT departments in England follow British Medical Journal guidelines on thromboprophylaxis. A telephone survey of doctors in 80 ENT departments was used to present six clinical scenarios. The participants were asked what their local department routinely did. They were also asked whether they were aware of a local or national thromboprophylaxis policy. For patients undergoing procedures other than major head and neck procedures, compliance was poor and ranged between 7.5% and 37.5%. For laryngectomy, the rate was 82.6%. There was no statistical difference in answers given by doctors of different levels of seniority. Where local thromboprophylaxis guidelines exist, compliance is found to be statistically better. These results suggest that most ENT departments do not follow national or local guidelines on thromboprophylaxis. Greater awareness of existing guidelines is required.

AB  - Abstract Women with antithrombin (AT) III deficiency are prone to pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism. We report 2 cases with genetically confirmed ATIII deficiency, one with a mutation in exon 3A and the other with an exon 4 deletion, in whom the pregnancies were successfully managed with prophylactic therapies for thrombosis. A 35-year-old pregnant woman was treated with intravenous infusions of ATIII concentrate alone, and the other 22-year-old pregnant woman was mainly treated with subcutaneous injections of heparin and oral low-dose aspirin therapy. Both pregnancies resulted in vaginal deliveries of healthy neonates. The literature concerning prophylactic therapies for thrombosis in ATIII deficiency-complicated pregnancy is reviewed, and the clinical problems, including the adverse effects of the therapies, are discussed.

AB  - Several major physio-pathological processes, including cancer, inflammatory states and thrombosis, are all strongly dependent upon the fine regulation of proteolytic enzyme activities, and dramatic are the consequences of unbalanced equilibria between enzymes and their cognate inhibitors. In this perspective, the discovery of small-molecule ligands able to modulate catalytic activities has a massive therapeutic potential and is a stimulating goal. Numerous recent experimental evidences revealed that proteolytic enzymes can be opportunely targeted, reporting on small ligands capable of binding to these biological macromolecules with drug-like potencies, and primarily with comparable (or even higher) efficiency with respect to their endogenous binding partner. In particular, natural occurring polyphenols and their derivatives recently disclosed these intriguing abilities, making them promising templates for drug design and development. In this review, we compared the inhibitory capacities of a set of monomeric polyphenols toward serine proteases activity, and finally summarized the data with an emphasis on the derivation of a pharmacophore model.

AB  - Summary Treatment of haemophilia A patients with inhibitors is challenging, and may require individually tailored regimens. Whereas low titre inhibitor patients may respond to high doses of factor VIII (FVIII), high-responding inhibitor patients render replacement therapy ineffective and often require application of bypassing agents. Thrombin generation (TG) assays may be used to monitor haemostasis and/or predict patients' response to bypass agents. In this study we defined by TG, the potential contribution of FVIII to recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa)-induced haemostasis in inhibitor plasma. Based upon results, prospectively designed individual regimens of coadministration of rFVIIa and FVIII were applied. Plasma samples from 14 haemophilia patients with inhibitors (including high titre inhibitors) were tested. The response to increasing concentrations of FVIII, rFVIIa or both was assayed by TG. Eight patients, chosen following consent and at physician's discretion, comprised the combined FVIII?rFVIIa therapy clinical study cohort. Combined spiking with FVIII/rFVIIa improved TG induced by rFVIIa alone in all inhibitor plasmas. Combined rFVIIa and FVIII therapy was applied during bleeding or immune tolerance to eight patients, for a total of 393 episodes. Following a single combined dose, 90% haemostasis was documented and neither thrombosis nor any complications evolved. During study period decline of inhibitor levels and bleeding frequency were noted. Pre-analytical studies enabled us to prospectively tailor individual therapy regimens. We confirmed for the first time that the in vitro advantage of combining FVIII and rFVIIa, indeed accounts for improved haemostasis and may safely be applied to inhibitor patients.
