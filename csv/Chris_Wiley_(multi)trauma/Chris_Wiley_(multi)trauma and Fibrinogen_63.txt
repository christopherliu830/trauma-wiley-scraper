AB  - Allostatic load (AL) is a complex clinical construct, providing a unique window into the cumulative impact of stress. However, due to its inherent complexity, AL presents two major measurement challenges to conventional statistical modeling (the field's dominant methodology): it is comprised of a complex causal network of bioallostatic systems, represented by an even larger set of dynamic biomarkers; and, it is situated within a web of antecedent socioecological systems, linking AL to differences in health outcomes and disparities. To address these challenges, we employed case-based computational modeling (CBM), which allowed us to make four advances: (1) we developed a multisystem, 7-factor (20 biomarker) model of AL's network of allostatic systems; (2) used it to create a catalog of nine different clinical AL profiles (causal pathways); (3) linked each clinical profile to a typology of 23 health outcomes; and (4) explored our results (post hoc) as a function of gender, a key socioecological factor. In terms of highlights, (a) the Healthy clinical profile had few health risks; (b) the pro-inflammatory profile linked to high blood pressure and diabetes; (c) Low Stress Hormones linked to heart disease, TIA/Stroke, diabetes, and circulation problems; and (d) high stress hormones linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Post hoc analyses also found that males were overrepresented on the High Blood Pressure (61.2%), Metabolic Syndrome (63.2%), High Stress Hormones (66.4%), and High Blood Sugar (57.1%); while females were overrepresented on the Healthy (81.9%), Low Stress Hormones (66.3%), and Low Stress Antagonists (stress buffers) (95.4%) profiles. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The risk of post-operative bleeding is a daily concern for many general dental practitioners. A thorough medical and medication history must be taken in order to consider all risk factors, particularly drugs, that contribute to bleeding risk. While the risk from drugs such as aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel are well-known, the extent to which new anti-platelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants affect bleeding risk is less well understood. In addition, there are drugs other than anti-thrombotics, such as antidepressants and complementary medicines that also impair haemostasis. The aim of this paper is to provide dentists with an updated overview of the drugs commonly encountered in general dental practice that can contribute to a patient?s post-operative bleeding risk.

AB  - Abstract Osteogenic Protein-1 (OP-1, BMP-7) acts locally on connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) to induce bone formation. The response to OP-1 and similar agents is potentially limited by the number of local CTPs. This study tested the hypothesis that supplementing local CTPs using autogenous bone marrow will enhance bone formation at an OP-1 implant. Four 1.0-cm diameter unicortical cylindrical defects in the left proximal femur were grafted in each of seven dogs. Radial ingrowth of new bone formation was assessed at 4 weeks using micro CT. The OP-1 (3.5 mg rhOP-1 in 1 g bovine collagen I matrix) was implanted in each site combined with either clotted blood or aspirated bone marrow (BM). Bone formation was increased in the group augmented with transplanted marrow. These data suggest that increasing the local population of cells and CTPs using aspirated bone marrow can enhance the performance of OP-1, but may not eliminate the effects of site variation on the response to OP-1 and similar agents. The canine multiple femoral defect model defined in this study is well suited to quantitatively evaluate strategies for augmenting bone repair using local cell targeting and cell transplantation strategies. ? 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The role of donor, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors in predicting patient survival after liver transplantation was evaluated by the Bio Medicus data package on a database containing 162 variables filled with records from 100 consecutive first-liver transplant cases. Donor data did not predict outcome. Recipient preoperative data (Child status, HCV status) were predictive using life table and Cox regression methods. Recipient intraoperative data (by-pass time, warm ischemia time, delay in arterial revascularization, and packed red blood cell requirements) were predictive of outcome using life table analysis. Recipient postoperative data (rejection, sepsis, primary dysfunction, and hepatic artery thrombosis) were predictive of outcome.

AB  - Thrombogenic and inflammatory activity are two distinct aspects of platelet biology, which are sustained by the ability of activated platelets to interact with each other (homotypic aggregation) and to adhere to circulating leucocytes (heterotypic aggregation). These two events are regulated by distinct biomolecular mechanisms that are selectively activated in different pathophysiological settings. They can occur simultaneously, for example, as part of a pro-thrombotic/pro-inflammatory response induced by vascular damage, or independently, as in certain clinical conditions in which abnormal heterotypic aggregation has been observed in the absence of intravascular thrombosis. Current antiplatelet drugs have been developed to target specific molecular signalling pathways mainly implicated in thrombus formation, and their ever increasing clinical use has resulted in clear benefits in the treatment and prevention of arterial thrombotic events. However, the efficacy of currently available antiplatelet drugs remains suboptimal, most likely because their therapeutic action is limited to only few of the signalling pathways involved in platelet homotypic aggregation. In this context, modulation of heterotypic aggregation, which is believed to contribute importantly to acute thrombotic events, as well to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis itself, may offer benefits over and above the classical antiplatelet approach. This review will focus on the distinct biomolecular pathways that, following platelet activation, underlie homotypic and heterotypic aggregation, aiming potentially to identify novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract: Aims: To retrospectively review our liver transplant performance to identify factors that influenced early outcomes and to prospectively test their validity in predicting outcomes. Methods: Clinical records from 190 patients with liver transplants (LT; n?=?200) performed between 1991 and 1997 were reviewed and the data evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses regarding clinical outcome. The prognostic model thus obtained was prospectively evaluated in 55 patients undergoing transplant between 1999 and 2000. Results: Main indication for transplant was post-necrotic cirrhosis (61%), mostly HCV(+). The majority of patients were Child-Pugh C status (46%). Post-operative mortality at 3?months was 15.3%. Risk factors predicting death were: Child-Pugh C status (OR 1.3), pre-LT renal insufficiency (OR 5.8), malnutrition (OR 2.9) and technically complex surgery requiring cross-clamping with or without bypass (OR 4.9). None of the donor factors was significant. Prospectively applied to predict outcome in the 55 patients, the model had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88.8% with a higher-than-anticipated accuracy with a positive predictive value of 61.5% and a negative predictive value of 95.3%. Conclusions: Pre-LT renal insufficiency is the most significant risk factor for early mortality and suggests that LT should be performed before evidence of irreversible renal insufficiency becomes manifest.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? A promoting effect of thyroid hormones has been established on the maturation of central and peripheral nervous systems. However, effects on autonomic nerves have never been experimentally investigated. Aim.? To assess the effect of a local treatment combining silicone guides and local administration of Triiodothyronine (T3) on the erectile function and the histological neuroregeneration of crushed cavernous nerves (CNs) in rats. Methods.? Forty-five rats were divided into five equal groups: SHAM surgery, guide without crush, crush, crush?+?guide, crush?+?guide?+?T3. All surgical procedures were bilateral. CNs were crushed with microvascular bulldog clamp of 100?g/cm2. A silicone guide was placed around the nerves. The guides were filled with T3 neuroregenerative solution. Main Outcome Measures.? Erectile function was assessed 10 weeks post-operatively. Intra-cavernous pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored during electrical stimulation of CNs at various frequencies. The main outcome was hardness of erection defined as ?ICP/MAP. Fluorescent immunohistochemical analysis of CNs was performed to assess regeneration of nerves morphologically. Results.? Electrophysiological data showed increased recovery of erectile function in the group with guide?+?T3 neuroregenerative solution compared with the empty guide. Immunohistochemical analysis of cavernous nerves demonstrated in morphology that regenerated axons were straighter in nerves with guide and more regular if guides had been filled with T3. Conclusion.? The use of guides prevented axonal sprouting, facilitated functional neuroregeneration and enabled a local delivery of thyroid hormones. Triiodothyronine improved neuroregeneration and recovery of erectile function after a nerve-sparing?like injury in a rat model.

AB  - Abstract: A unique hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (IVOX) has been developed, which is inserted into the vena caval blood stream to transfer O2/CO2 to/from circulating blood in an intact subject without involving the natural lungs. Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated that the device can transfer significant quantities of O2 and CO2 for up to 3 weeks without significant harmful sequelae or complications. Clinical trials are in progress under FDA supervision, in which IVOX has been utilized to date in 56 patients with ARDS. Preliminary findings indicate that risks and hazards from IVOX are nil, and evidence of benefit to the patient has been demonstrated in 86% of the patients. At this time, clinical utilization of IVOX is in the experimental, data collecting mode to determine its proper role or niche as a method for temporary augmentation of blood gas transfer in patients with advanced acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Adult multipotent stem/progenitor cells, with remarkable regenerative potential, have been isolated from various components of the human periodontium. These multipotent stem/progenitor cells include the periodontal ligament stem/progenitor cells (PDLSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), the gingival mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (G-MSCs), and the alveolar bone proper stem/progenitor cells (AB-MSCs). Whereas inflammation is regarded as the reason for tissue damage, it also remains a fundamental step of any early healing process. In performing their periodontal tissue regenerative/reparative activity, periodontal stem/progenitor cells interact with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environmental, through their expressed receptors, which could influence their fate and the outcome of any periodontal stem/progenitor cell-mediated reparative/regenerative activity. The present review discusses the current understanding about the interaction of periodontal stem/progenitor cells with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environment, elaborates on the inflammatory factors influencing their stemness, proliferation, migration/homing, differentiation, and immunomodulatory attributes, the possible underlying intracellular mechanisms, as well as their proposed relationship to the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.
