AB  - Abstract Platelets are essential for maintaining vascular integrity. Given the anucleate nature of platelets, definition of their proteome is essential for understanding platelet pathophysiology. We describe here a detailed MS-based proteomic analysis of the platelet membrane/cytoskeletal sub-proteome from purified, normal, non-activated human platelets. In contrast to previous platelet proteomic purification strategies, the buffy-coat method was utilized in this study to isolate and purify minimally activated platelets, yielding significantly reduced contaminants for leukocytes (0.02?±?0.007?106/L) and erythrocytes (0.21?±?0.02%). Using a false discovery rate of 1%, 203 proteins were identified and characterized with respect to their subcellular localization, biological function, and cellular processes. Of these, 16 have not been identified in previous human platelet proteome studies. As a first approach towards understanding the dynamic platelet-plasma protein composition nexus, we re-analysed the entire HUPO plasma proteome project dataset (647 plasma proteins identified) and compared these data with our platelet proteome dataset. Co-identified proteins (41) were further analysed with respect to their relative abundances (exponentially modified protein abundance index) and functional enrichment in these two proteomes, as well as their correlation with the platelet transcriptome. Both platelet membrane/cytoskeletal and plasma proteome reference datasets, comprising both processed and unprocessed MS/MS spectra, are publicly accessible (http://www.ludwig.edu.au/archive/).

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating, and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the Committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Seventh Edition, like its predecessor, has consistently applied the category and grading system definitions in the fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was used since the fourth edition has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. The Seventh Edition discusses 87 fact sheets (14 new fact sheets since the Sixth Edition) for therapeutic apheresis diseases and medical conditions, with 179 indications, which are separately graded and categorized within the listed fact sheets. Several diseases that are Category IV which have been described in detail in previous editions and do not have significant new evidence since the last publication are summarized in a separate table. The Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue serves as a key resource that guides the utilization of therapeutic apheresis in the treatment of human disease. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract The development of electronics capable of interfacing with the nervous system is a rapidly advancing field with applications in basic science and clinical translation. Devices containing arrays of electrodes can be used in the study of cells grown in culture or can be implanted into damaged or dysfunctional tissue to restore normal function. While devices are typically designed and used exclusively for one of these two purposes, there have been increasing efforts in developing implantable electrode arrays capable of housing cultured cells, referred to as biohybrid implants. Once implanted, the cells within these implants integrate into the tissue, serving as a mediator of the electrode?tissue interface. This biological component offers unique advantages to these implant designs, providing better tissue integration and potentially long-term stability. Herein, an overview of current research into biohybrid devices, as well as the historical background that led to their development are provided, based on the host anatomical location for which they are designed (CNS, PNS, or special senses). Finally, a summary of the key challenges of this technology and potential future research directions are presented.

AB  - ABSTRACT ?MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH) usually is triggered during or after administration of commonly used general anesthetics, and it can result in death if left untreated. ?THE ONLY DEFINITIVE diagnostic test for MH is the caffeine halothane contracture test. A new molecular genetic diagnostic blood test may offer a less-invasive alternative for some patients. ?HYPERTHERMIA, the cardinal sign of MH, is a relatively late symptom. Other clinical signs include tachyarrhythmias, tachypnea, and acidosis. ?PERIOPERATIVE NURSES should perform MH risk assessments during routine preoperative interviews to identify patients at risk for MH crisis. Perioperative nurses must respond rapidly and ensure the cooperation of the OR team when dealing with MH. AORN J 83 (January 2006) 151?164.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious complication of sepsis that is associated with a high mortality. Objectives:?Using the adapted International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) diagnostic scoring algorithm for DIC, we evaluated the treatment effects of high-dose antithrombin (AT) in patients with severe sepsis with or without DIC. Patients and Methods:?From the phase III clinical trial in severe sepsis (KyberSept), 563 patients were identified (placebo, 277; AT, 286) who did not receive concomitant heparin and had sufficient data for DIC determination. Results:?At baseline, 40.7% of patients (229 of 563) had DIC. DIC in the placebo-treated patients was associated with an excess risk of mortality (28-day mortality: 40.0% vs. 22.2%, P?<?0.01). AT-treated patients with DIC had an absolute reduction in 28-day mortality of 14.6% compared with placebo (P?=?0.02) whereas in patients without DIC no effect on 28-day mortality was seen (0.1% reduction in mortality; P?=?1.0). Bleeding complications in AT-treated patients with and without DIC were higher compared with placebo (major bleeding rates: 7.0% vs. 5.2% for patients with DIC, P?=?0.6; 9.8% vs. 3.1% for patients without DIC, P?= 0.02). Conclusions:?High-dose AT without concomitant heparin in septic patients with DIC may result in a significant mortality reduction. The adapted ISTH DIC score may identify patients with severe sepsis who potentially benefit from high-dose AT treatment.
