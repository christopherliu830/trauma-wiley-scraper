AB  - Summary.? Background:?Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious complication of sepsis that is associated with a high mortality. Objectives:?Using the adapted International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) diagnostic scoring algorithm for DIC, we evaluated the treatment effects of high-dose antithrombin (AT) in patients with severe sepsis with or without DIC. Patients and Methods:?From the phase III clinical trial in severe sepsis (KyberSept), 563 patients were identified (placebo, 277; AT, 286) who did not receive concomitant heparin and had sufficient data for DIC determination. Results:?At baseline, 40.7% of patients (229 of 563) had DIC. DIC in the placebo-treated patients was associated with an excess risk of mortality (28-day mortality: 40.0% vs. 22.2%, P?<?0.01). AT-treated patients with DIC had an absolute reduction in 28-day mortality of 14.6% compared with placebo (P?=?0.02) whereas in patients without DIC no effect on 28-day mortality was seen (0.1% reduction in mortality; P?=?1.0). Bleeding complications in AT-treated patients with and without DIC were higher compared with placebo (major bleeding rates: 7.0% vs. 5.2% for patients with DIC, P?=?0.6; 9.8% vs. 3.1% for patients without DIC, P?= 0.02). Conclusions:?High-dose AT without concomitant heparin in septic patients with DIC may result in a significant mortality reduction. The adapted ISTH DIC score may identify patients with severe sepsis who potentially benefit from high-dose AT treatment.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Numerous case?control studies have reported higher prevalence of non-O blood type among venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients than controls, but potential mechanisms or effect modifiers for the association are not fully established. Patients/methods:?Using a nested case?control design combining the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities and the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort, ABO blood type and other VTE risk factors were measured on pre-event blood samples of 492 participants who subsequently developed VTE and 1008 participants who remained free of VTE. Results:?A total of 64.4% of cases and 52.5% of controls had non-O blood type. Among controls, mean values of factor VIIIc (FVIIIc) and von Willebrand factor among the non-O blood type group were higher than among the O group. Compared with O blood type, the age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of VTE for non-O blood type was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.32?2.05) and was similar for the two parent studies and race groups. Further adjustment for sex, race, body mass index, diabetes mellitus and FVIIIc reduced the OR: 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02?1.68). Factor V Leiden (FV Leiden) appeared to modify the non-O blood type association with VTE in a supra-additive fashion, with an age-, sex- and race-adjusted OR of 6.77 (95% CI, 3.65?12.6) for having both risk factors. Conclusions:?Non-O blood type was independently associated with risk of VTE, and added to the risk associated with FV Leiden.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the clinical course of a dog presented with peliosis hepatis and hemoperitoneum in concert with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Case summary: A 7.75-year-old spayed female Shetland Sheepdog presented with clinical signs consistent with hypovolemia, hemoperitoneum, and a history of bright green stool 3 days before the onset of clinical signs. Initial packed cell volume/total solids were consistent with acute hemorrhage. A coagulation profile showed prolongation in activated clotting time and prolongation of both prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time, suggesting abnormal coagulation. Abdominal hemorrhage persisted in the face of normalization of the hemodynamic status and coagulation profile, and treatment with Vitamin K1. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple patchy hypoechoic areas throughout the caudate liver lobe. An exploratory laparotomy was performed 24 hours after presentation and revealed the caudate liver lobe as the source of the hemorrhage. Histopathologic examination of a specimen of the liver was consistent with peliosis hepatis. Toxicologic testing identified diphacinone levels in the blood consistent with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and within 48 hours the dog was discharged. The dog returned to full function and a hepatic ultrasound performed 15 months postoperatively showed no significant abnormalities. New or unique information provided: Exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides may be associated with the development of peliosis hepatis in dogs.

AB  - Abstract. The diagnosis infective endocarditis describes infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and indicates the presence of micro-organisms in the lesion. In most cases, the heart valves are affected, but the disease can also occur on septal defects or on the mural endocardium. The disease has been classified as acute or subacute based on the progression of the untreated disease. The acute form has a fulminant course with high fever and leukocytosis with death in less than 6 weeks. It is most often associated with infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes. The subacute (death within 6 weeks to 3 months) and chronic (death more than 3 months) forms are mostly described together. These forms usually occur in patients with prior valvular disease and are characterized by a slow, indolent course with low-grade fever, night sweats, and weight loss. This form is usually caused by the viridansstreptococci. The above mentioned classification does not include the nonbacterial forms of endocarditis and enterococci often give rise to a disease interrcediate between acute and subacute endocarditis. It is preferable to have a classification based on the micro-organism responsible since this classification has implications for the course followed and the appropriate antimicrobial agent to use. The clinical manifestations of the disease are so varied that they may be encountered in most medical subspecialties. Successful management is also dependent on the close cooperation of medical and dental disciplines.

AB  - Summary Oral medicine relates to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of nonsurgical and mostly nonodontogenic problems of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region, principally including oral mucosal diseases, salivary gland disorders, and orofacial pain. These problems can be subdivided into those that are local vs. those that represent oral manifestations of systemic disease and medical therapy. All oral medicine problems fall under one or more subjective complaints and/or objective signs. Patients may present with one or more of the following nine symptoms (i.e., subjective indicators): altered mucosa, pain/altered sensation, xerostomia/dry mouth, malodor, slow healing, swelling, bleeding, altered oral function (opening, eating, speaking, swallowing, etc.), or problems with teeth. This chapter serves as a problem-oriented approach to the more common oral medicine problems, and the approach is a categorization of these problems based upon presenting signs and symptoms.

AB  - Summary In 2008 and 2009 a large number of cases of haemorrhagic diathesis (HD) in neonatal calves were reported in different European countries. In Flanders, 84 cases of neonatal HD in 30 herds were reported in this period. The disease typically affects calves younger than 1?month old from different breed and gender. Prominent clinical signs are cutaneous bleeding, petechiae on all mucosae, melena and often high fever. Early in the disease, the mental state of the animals is uncompromised. The typical haematological finding is pancytopenia, with severe to complete thrombocytopenia being the cause of the increased susceptibility to bleeding. In seven of the affected herds blood samples of calves of the same age group as the clinical case were collected and on six of those farms at least one subclinical case could be identified. Necropsy findings were generalized petechiae, ecchymoses or haemorrhages and variable lymphadenopathy. Histopathology of haemorrhagic lesions revealed multifocal extravasation of red blood cells (haemorrhage) with preservation of tissue architecture and absence of other abnormalities. Total bone marrow aplasia and depletion of all lymphoid tissue was the most prominent finding on histology. Activated macrophages and haemophagocytosis were seen on bone marrow cytology from two live calves. Polymerase chain reaction for bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus was negative. Several attempts to isolate a viral agent were unsuccessful.

AB  - Abstract Tapirs have unique nutritional needs, as well as anatomical, physiological, behavioral and ecological adaptations that must be considered when managing their health, both in the wild and in captivity. Information about how tapirs live in their natural habitats can provide crucial knowledge to prevent many of the health problems found in captivity such as infectious and parasitic diseases, reproductive issues and nutritional and behavioral disorders. Likewise, proper management in captivity can significantly contribute to in situ conservation programs. Conservation medicine is a science created to address the global health crisis that jeopardizes biodiversity causing imbalances among ecosystem, human, animal and vegetal health. In this context, common threats to tapir health and conservation, such as isolated and small populations surrounded by human activity, chemical pollution, domestic animals and their pathogenic agents, need to be better understood. This manuscript provides information about the health of tapirs both in captivity and in the wild and aims to encourage tapir conservationists worldwide to gather information about pathogen and disease dynamics and manifestation, as well as implications for tapir conservation.
