AB  - Background Free tissue transfers performed in patients with hematological diseases represent significant challenges for micro-surgeons. There are rare literatures that address the outcome in these patients. Therefore, we collected our database, analyzed the outcome, reliability, and related-management of microsurgical technique in the patients with hematological diseases. Methods A retrospective chart review of 20 patients with hematological disorders who received free tissue transfers during 20-years period in a single microsurgical center was done. Eleven patients who received head and neck reconstruction were found to have hyperfibrinogenemia. Seven patients with reactive thrombocytosis after trauma, and two patients with leukemia had soft tissue defects in the upper and lower extremities. Twenty-six flaps were used for free tissue transfers. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion. Anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) was given postoperatively. Results Twenty-three of the 26 free flaps survived without vascular compromise. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion, and anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 was given to the patients postoperatively. The three failed cases were found in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and needed further reconstruction with another flap. The overall success rate was 88.5% (23/26). Conclusions Hematologic disorder is not a predicted factor of free flap failure. The key factors for success flap survival in patients with hematologic disorders include preoperative knowledge of the medical condition and monitoring potential post-operative complications, aggressive hematologist consultations, and meticulous non-traumatic surgical anastomosis. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary The use of thrombolysis in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) began with the use of systemic thrombolytic therapy, but has evolved substantially to include both pharmacological and mechanical methods, of which some are delivered via a small catheter. The goal of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in most patients with extensive lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is to remove the thrombus and restore physiological and anatomical venous flow, to decrease the inflammatory changes, increase the likelihood of vessel patency, preserve venous valvular function and, ultimately, limit post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) development. In recent years, the use of ultrasound-accelerated CDT for patients with massive or sub-massive pulmonary embolism (PE) has been studied with somewhat more rigour. With this method, a specialised catheter that emits low-power ultrasound is used to achieve the intra-thrombus drug delivery and to enhance thrombolysis via ostensibly improved drug dispersion.

AB  - Abstract Various micro-organisms have been implicated as causative agents for bacterial endocarditis, including lactobacilli and in particular the viridans streptococci which are more commonly associated with dental caries. Of these, the most frequently isolated one has the descriptive name Streptococcus sanguis. The disease is characterized by growth of microorganisms within a platelet-fibrin thrombus protruding from a valve leaflet. An understanding of the pathogenesis involves knowledge of the mechanisms of conversion of the normal vascular surface to a thrombogenic one and the adhesion of micro-organisms to such surfaces. Model systems to study this interaction include experimental animals, mammalian epithelial cells and platelets, and proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen. Microbial protein surface components (adhesins) and lipoteichoic acid have also been implicated. Capsular polysaccharides may be involved, but the role of dextrans formed from sucrose has been overemphasized as the polymers are not formed in situ. Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk is based on bacteriostatic or bactericidal action. However, bacterial cell surface components involved in adhesion may also be affected, and knowledge of such reactions could provide a more rational basis for antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To collate and describe emergency admissions to a large animal tertiary university referral hospital during a 12-month period. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Large animal tertiary university referral hospital. Animals: Large animal emergency patient admissions. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Information obtained from the medical record included the presenting complaint, clinical problem, admission time, duration of clinical signs before presentation, diagnostic procedures performed, therapies administered, and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission, and survival to discharge. The most common category listed for the presenting complaint and clinical problem categories was gastrointestinal. Most emergency cases were admitted during the evening and in late spring, summer, and early fall. Most cases had a duration of clinical signs before presentation of >2 hours and ≤8 hours (27%) or >8 hours and ≤24 hours (29%). The most common diagnostic procedures performed during the first 24 hours were palpation per rectum, ultrasonographic examination, radiographs, and abdominocentesis. Antimicrobials, fluids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common therapies administered. Approximately 25% of cases required surgery. An exploratory celiotomy was performed in approximately 15% of cases. Enterotomy, intestinal resection and anastomosis, cesarean section, or joint or sheath lavage was each performed in <5% of cases. Overall survival to discharge was 74%. Conclusions: Large animal emergency clinicians are required to have knowledge on a wide range of diseases and should be proficient at performing numerous procedures on an emergency basis. Gastrointestinal disease is the most common type of emergency and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission are a reflection of this type of case. Only 25% of cases required surgery. Additional research in the form of a multicenter study and surveying both private and university practitioners needs to be performed to further define the necessary skills for an ?ideal? large animal emergency clinician.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa/NovoSeven?) has been advocated in the treatment of life-threatening haemorrhage, but appropriate clinical indications remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to detect factors predictive of outcome and to incorporate them into a prognostically significant scoring system. Materials and Methods? Thirty-six patients received rFVIIa for uncontrolled surgical, traumatic or obstetric bleeding in the Northern Region of the UK over a 45-month period. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were examined. Characteristics of survivor and non-survivor groups were compared. A prognostic scoring system was evaluated retrospectively according to the presence of coagulopathy, renal impairment, hypothermia, greater than 10 units of red cell transfusion, advanced age and obstetric indication, with patients allocated to low, intermediate and high-risk groups. Results? Clinical response occurred in 26 patients (72%) with a reduction in prothrombin time and blood product requirements. Death occurred in 19 (53%). Four patients (11%) suffered thrombotic events. Survivors were younger than non-survivors and less likely to have coagulopathy, renal impairment or hypothermia at the time of administration. Survivors were more likely to have had an initial clinical response in terms of an immediate reduction in haemorrhage. Non-survivors were transfused a greater number of red cell units prior to administration. Survival varied according to prognostic score; low-risk patients had a survival rate of 85%, intermediate-risk patients had a survival rate of 50% and high-risk patients had a survival rate of 18%. Conclusions? FVIIa has a role in the cessation of haemorrhage, but may not improve survival. Use of a clinical scoring system may help to predict outcome.

AB  - Abstract While electrospinning had seen intermittent use in the textile industry from the early twentieth century, it took the explosion of the field of tissue engineering, and its pursuit of biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) structures, to create an electrospinning renaissance. Over the past decade, a growing number of researchers in the tissue engineering community have embraced electrospinning as a polymer processing technique that effectively and routinely produces non-woven structures of nanoscale fibers (sizes of 80 nm to 1.5 µm). These nanofibers are of physiological significance as they closely resemble the structure and size scale of the native ECM (fiber diameters of 50 to 500 nm). Attempts to replicate the many roles of native ECM have led to the electrospinning of a wide array of polymers, both synthetic (poly(glycolic acid), poly(lactic acid), polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, etc.) and natural (collagen, fibrinogen, elastin, etc.) in origin, for a multitude of different tissue applications. With various compositions, fiber dimensions and fiber orientations, the biological, chemical and mechanical properties of the electrospun materials can be tailored. In this review we highlight the role of electrospinning in the engineering of different tissues and applications (skin/wound healing, cartilage, bone, vascular tissue, urological tissues, nerve, and ligament), and discuss its potential role in future work.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the extent to which inflammatory markers explain the association between handgrip strength and mortality. Methods Analyses of data from The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Handgrip strength and inflammatory marker data (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) were collected at baseline (2004/5) and inflammatory marker data at follow-up (2012/13). Participant data were linked with death records. General linear models were used to explore associations between handgrip strength and inflammatory markers at follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine associations between grip strength and risk of death. Models were estimated with the covariates age, sex, wealth, physical activity, smoking, depressive symptoms, long-standing illness, and adiposity. Results The sample comprised of 5,240 participants (mean age 65.9 (SD 9.4) years; 53.8% female). Over an average 9.7 ± 1.4 years follow-up, there were 650 deaths. Inverse associations were evident between handgrip strength and change in inflammatory markers in women only. There was an association between grip strength and lower risk of mortality in women (hazard ratio = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74, 0.98) after adjusting for age and wealth. The association was attenuated after adjustment for clinical and behavioral risk factors (0.92; 0.79, 1.07), and further attenuated after adjusting for inflammatory markers (0.95; 0.82, 1.11). Conclusion Higher grip strength is associated with lower levels of inflammation at 8-year follow-up, and inflammatory markers partly explained the association between handgrip strength and mortality.

AB  - Abstract The expression of the immunoglobulin superfamily member myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R (TN-R) by oligodendrocytes overlaps in time and space. The two molecules can be neurite outgrowth- inhibitory or -promoting depending on the neuronal cell type and the environment in which they are presented. Here we show that the two molecules directly bind to each other in vitro and that binding sites on TN-R localize to two domains, the fibrinogen domain and the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain with the N-terminal cysteine-rich stretch. We further show by a functional assay, namely the repulsion of MAG-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) cells from a TN-R substrate, that MAG is part of the signalling pathway of TN-R for cell repulsion. When coated as a uniform substrate, MAG was inhibitory for neurite outgrowth of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons in vitro, when compared to poly-l-lysine, while TN-R enhanced neurite outgrowth. When added to MAG, TN-R neutralized the neurite outgrowth-inhibitory effects of MAG, presumably by blocking the neurite outgrowth-inhibitory domain of MAG. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:?Although there are two major scoring systems for the clinical diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the validity of these systems for leukemia-associated DIC remains to be confirmed. Methods:?By analyzing 125 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients, we investigated clinical and laboratory features of leukemia-associated DIC, and determined the validity of the two established criteria. Results:?A total of 36 patients (29%) were diagnosed with DIC according to expert opinion, a method regarded as the de facto gold standard. Leukemia-associated DIC is characterized by rare manifestation of organ failure because of thrombosis and no relevance of the platelet count for the diagnosis. The results of receiver operating characteristics analysis favored fibrin degradation product (FDP) rather than D-dimer as the fibrin-related marker test. Although prothrombin time, plasma fibrinogen, and serum FDP levels were significantly different for patients with and without DIC, multivariate analysis identified FDP levels to be the only factor associated with DIC diagnosis. The cut-off level of 15??g/mL for FDP was found to be the most effective to differentiate DIC from non-DIC, resulting in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 96%, respectively. The diagnostic results for our patients produced with this FDP-based system were at least comparable with or superior to those obtained with the two currently available scoring systems. Conclusions:?Our findings suggest that an FDP-based criterion may be applicable for the diagnosis of leukemia-associated DIC. Although it appears to be simple and practicable enough for clinical use, prospective validation of this criterion is needed.

AB  - Abstract Microcirculatory dysfunction is a critical element of the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock. In this Bench-to-Bedside review, we present: 1) the central role of the microcirculation in the pathophysiology of sepsis; 2) new translational research techniques of in vivo video microscopy for assessment of microcirculatory flow in human subjects; 3) clinical investigations that reported associations between microcirculatory dysfunction and outcome in septic patients; 4) the potential role of novel agents to ?rescue? the microcirculation in sepsis; 5) current challenges facing this emerging field of clinical investigation; and 6) a framework for the design of future clinical trials aimed to determine the impact of novel agents on microcirculatory flow and organ failure in patients with sepsis. We specifically focus this review on the central role and vital importance of the nitric oxide (NO) molecule in maintaining microcirculatory homeostasis and patency, especially when the microcirculation sustains an insult (as with sepsis). We also present the scientific rationale for clinical trials of exogenous NO administration to treat microcirculatory dysfunction and augment microcirculatory blood flow in early sepsis therapy.

AB  - In order to closely mimic the actual mechanism of wound debridement by an enzymatic debriding agent, a synthetic wound eschar substrate (SWES) has been developed. The SWES is prepared by the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of fibrous bovine collagen and elastin, to form an insoluble planar matrix composed of the three major proteins present in wound eschar. Each of the proteinaceous components is uniquely labeled prior to formation of SWES with different dye, and the debridement test is conducted using a Franz Diffusion System. The debriding agent is applied to the SWES mounted on the donor compartment of the cell, and the digested hydrolysate containing dye-labeled peptide fragments is sampled from the receptor compartment. Accordingly, the progress of digestion is obtained in real time. Since the three proteins are labeled with spectrally distinct dyes, data on the hydrolysis of the substrates can be collected simultaneously. This method facilitates the testing of formulated debriding products in a manner that closely mimics application to a wound and provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of formulated enzymatic debriding agents.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - Summary Sutures play an important role in wound repair by supporting healing tissues. Understanding the various characteristics of suture materials enables appropriate selection. However, no single suture material is ideal, and compromises must be made. Proper suture placement, using specific patterns, generally ensures a predictable progression of wound healing and of scar formation. Drains, when properly applied, may help to prevent or at least lessen complications during healing. Sutures and drains are not substitutes for proper wound management because they cannot compensate for poor cleansing, debridement, and wound irrigation. Moreover, inappropriate use of sutures and drains may delay healing and may lead to scarring.

AB  - Summary.? Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

AB  - Background Apixaban and rivaroxaban are approved for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and embolic stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The aim of this study was to find appropriate methods of monitoring the anticoagulant effects of are direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and establish on-therapy ranges using conventional tests. Methods A total of 184 samples were collected from 91 patients receiving DOACs. Concentrations of apixaban and rivaroxaban in plasma were accessed by an anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay. PT, APTT, antithrombin, D-dimer, dRVVT screen/confirm, FDP, and fibrinogen levels were measured. On-therapy ranges were calculated by substituting previously reported trough plasma concentrations of DOACs. Results Anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay-based DOACs levels were 26.0-279.5 (115.9 ± 56.5) ng/mL for apixaban at 2.5 mg BID, 19.9-565.1 (205.3 ± 162.4) ng/mL for apixaban at 5 mg BID, 2.3-395.3 (205.3 ± 162.4) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 15 mg OD, 3.6-494.8 (119.6 ± 95.1) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 20 mg OD, and 9.6-431.4 (140.8 ± 113.6) ng/mL for rivaroxaban at 15 mg BID. PT (%), antithrombin, and dRVVT confirm tests showed good correlation with plasma apixaban levels. Plasma rivaroxaban concentrations were correlated well with PT (sec), PT (%),and dRVVT confirm results. On-therapy ranges established for dRVVT confirm test by linear regression were as follows: 1.32-1.52 for apixaban 2.5 mg BID, 1.12-1.75 for apixaban 5 mg BID, 1.11-1.78 for rivaroxaban 15 mg OD, 1.09-1.64 for rivaroxaban 20 mg OD, and 1.22-1.81 for rivaroxaban 20 mg BID. Conclusions Apixaban concentrations were well correlated with PT (%), antithrombin, and dRVVT confirm test. Rivaroxaban concentrations showed good correlation with PT (sec), PT (%), and dRVVT confirm test.

AB  - Abstract Assessment of nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula commonly relies on the determination of CSF markers in an aqueous rhinorrhea, such as the ?2-transferrin immunofixation assay. While generally reliable, false positive and false negative results have been reported for most of the laboratory tests yet available. Based on the hypothesis that the simultaneous assessment of several CSF markers may yield an increased sensitivity and specificity, we used a proteomics, two-dimensional electrophoresis 2-DE based approach to study samples of nasal secretions obtained from 18 patients suspected of CSF rhinorrhea. Since CSF, nasal mucus and plasma may coexist in the nasal cavities, we first defined five specific markers for each of these biological fluids (transferrin, prostaglandin-D synthase, transthyretin, and two unknown trains of spots for CSF, immunoglobulin A (IgA) S-chain, lipocortin-1, lipocalin-1, prolactine-inducible protein and palatal lung nasal epithelium clone protein for mucus, haptoglobin α1/2- and ?-chains, fibrinogen α-, ?- and ?-chains for plasma). Gels from the rhinorrhea patients were then compared to these 2-DE reference maps to determine the presence or absence of the defined markers, and clinical data were independently compared to the results of the 2-DE study. In all cases, the biological fluid(s) anticipated to be present in the nasal secretions based on clinical data were correctly identified by 2-DE. Moreover, an excellent correlation was found in nine patients who underwent extensive workup for suspected CSF rhinorrhea, since CSF was found by the 2-DE method in four patients in whom a CSF fistula was confirmed, whereas the test was negative in five patients in whom a CSF fistula was excluded. In the remaining patients, mucus, sometimes contamined with blood, was found to be the major component of the nasal secretions, confirming that clear mucus may mimick CSF rhinorrhea. These preliminary results suggest that a 2-DE-based multimarker approach is a valid, sensitive, and specific method to assess the presence of CSF in occult rhinorrhea.

AB  - Abstract Background Vorapaxar is indicated with standard antiplatelet therapy (APT) in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Objectives To evaluate the comparative effects of vorapaxar on platelet-fibrin clot characteristics (PFCC), coagulation, inflammation, and platelet and endothelial function during treatment with daily 81 mg aspirin (A), 75 mg clopidogrel (C), both (C + A), or neither. Methods Thrombelastography, conventional platelet aggregation (PA), ex vivo endothelial function by ENDOPAT, coagulation, platelet activation/inflammation marked by urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (UTxB2) and safety were determined in patients who were APT naïve (n = 21), on C (n = 8), on A (n = 29), and on A + C (n = 23) during 1 month of vorapaxar therapy and 1 month of offset. Results Vorapaxar had no effect on PFCC, ADP- or collagen-induced PA, thrombin time, fibrinogen, PT, PTT, von Willebrand factor (vWF), D-dimer, or endothelial function (P > .05 in all groups). Inhibition of SFLLRN (PAR-1 activating peptide)-stimulated PA by vorapaxar was accelerated by A + C at 2 hours (P < .05 versus other groups) with nearly complete inhibition by 30 days that persisted through 30 days after discontinuation in all groups (P < .001). SFLLRN-induced PA during offset was lower in APT patients versus APT-naïve patients (P < .05). Inhibition of UTxB2 was observed in APT-naive patients treated with vorapaxar (P < .05). Minor bleeding was only observed in C-treated patients. Conclusion Vorapaxar had no influence on PFCC measured by thrombelastography, coagulation, or endothelial function irrespective of APT. Inhibition of protease activated receptor (PAR)-1 mediated platelet aggregation by vorapaxar was accelerated by A + C and offset was prolonged by concomitant APT. Vorapaxar-induced anti-inflammatory effects were observed in non-aspirin-treated patients.
