AB  - Summary Oral medicine relates to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of nonsurgical and mostly nonodontogenic problems of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region, principally including oral mucosal diseases, salivary gland disorders, and orofacial pain. These problems can be subdivided into those that are local vs. those that represent oral manifestations of systemic disease and medical therapy. All oral medicine problems fall under one or more subjective complaints and/or objective signs. Patients may present with one or more of the following nine symptoms (i.e., subjective indicators): altered mucosa, pain/altered sensation, xerostomia/dry mouth, malodor, slow healing, swelling, bleeding, altered oral function (opening, eating, speaking, swallowing, etc.), or problems with teeth. This chapter serves as a problem-oriented approach to the more common oral medicine problems, and the approach is a categorization of these problems based upon presenting signs and symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Tapirs have unique nutritional needs, as well as anatomical, physiological, behavioral and ecological adaptations that must be considered when managing their health, both in the wild and in captivity. Information about how tapirs live in their natural habitats can provide crucial knowledge to prevent many of the health problems found in captivity such as infectious and parasitic diseases, reproductive issues and nutritional and behavioral disorders. Likewise, proper management in captivity can significantly contribute to in situ conservation programs. Conservation medicine is a science created to address the global health crisis that jeopardizes biodiversity causing imbalances among ecosystem, human, animal and vegetal health. In this context, common threats to tapir health and conservation, such as isolated and small populations surrounded by human activity, chemical pollution, domestic animals and their pathogenic agents, need to be better understood. This manuscript provides information about the health of tapirs both in captivity and in the wild and aims to encourage tapir conservationists worldwide to gather information about pathogen and disease dynamics and manifestation, as well as implications for tapir conservation.

AB  - Summary Pre-operative nutrition therapy is increasingly recognised as an essential component of surgical care. The present review has been formatted using Simon Sinek's Golden Circle approach to explain ?why? avoiding pre-operative malnutrition and supporting protein anabolism are important goals for the elective surgical patient, ?how? peri-operative malnutrition develops leading in part to a requirement for pre-operative anabolic preparation, and ?what? can be done to avoid pre-operative malnutrition and support anabolism for optimal recovery.

Effects of inhalable particulate matter on blood coagulation. This issue, pp 662?8. Summary.? Background:?Ambient air pollution is a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, possibly because of alterations in coagulation that influence the arterial circulation. Whether air pollution influences diseases associated with peripheral venous thrombogenesis remains largely unknown. Objectives: To determine the association between air pollution and venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) in a sample of the general population. Methods: A time-series analysis was used to test the association between daily air pollution and VTE hospitalizations in Santiago between 2001 and 2005. Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day of the week and average daily humidex. Results: From a population of 5.4?million, there were, on average, 2.3 admissions for VTE per day. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of hospitalization for venous disease were: 1.07 (1.05, 1.09) for a 58.4?p.p.b. increase in ozone (O3); 1.06 (1.02, 1.09) for a 5.85?p.p.b. increase in sulphur dioxide (SO2); 1.08 (1.03, 1.12) for a 29.25??g/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and 1.05 (1.03, 1.06) for a 20.02??g/m3 increase in particulate matter ≤?2.5??m in mean aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). For pulmonary embolism (PE) results were: 1.10 (1.07, 1.13) for O3; 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) for SO2; 1.07 (1.04, 1.09) for NO2; and 1.05(1.03, 1.06) for PM2.5, respectively. Conclusion: Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis and PE, a disease with a significant fatality rate.

AB  - Summary Therapeutic apheresis is one of the few areas of Transfusion Medicine involving direct patient care. This can involve exchange transfusions of plasma or red cells, therapeutic cytoreduction in clinical situations with abnormal accumulations of blood cells, usually myeloid or platelets, selective removal of offending molecules such as lipoproteins, or treatment of mononuclear cells with photochemical technology to treat immune diseases. Plasma exchange is used in a variety of immune diseases while red cell exchange is almost exclusively done in patients with sickle cell disease. The mechanism of action of photopheresis in not well understood but it is used in one lymphoid malignance, graft rejection and GVHD. The processes of therapeutic apheresis can be complex especially since some of the patients are quite ill. This chapter reviews the techniques and the clinical use of these procedures.

AB  - Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have been drawing considerable attention as an aid to promote regeneration of injured axons across damaged peripheral nerves. Ideally, NGCs should include physical and topographic axon guidance cues embedded as part of their composition. Over the past decades, much progress has been made in the development of NGCs that promote directional axonal regrowth so as to repair severed nerves. This paper briefly reviews the recent designs and fabrication techniques of NGCs for peripheral nerve regeneration. Studies associated with versatile design and preparation of NGCs fabricated with either conventional or rapid prototyping (RP) techniques have been examined and reviewed. The effect of topographic features of the filler material as well as porous structure of NGCs on axonal regeneration has also been examined from the previous studies. While such strategies as macroscale channels, lumen size, groove geometry, use of hydrogel/matrix, and unidirectional freeze-dried surface are seen to promote nerve regeneration, shortcomings such as axonal dispersion and wrong target reinnervation still remain unsolved. On this basis, future research directions are identified and discussed.

AB  - Abstract. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common primary vasculitis of adults. The incidence of this disease is practically nil in the population under the age of 50?years, then rises dramatically with each passing decade. The median age of onset of the disease is about 75?years. As the ageing population expands, it is increasingly important for ophthalmologists to be familiar with GCA and its various manifestations, ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic. A heightened awareness of this condition can avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is well known that prompt initiation of steroids remains the most effective means for preventing potentially devastating ischaemic complications. This review summarizes the current concepts regarding the immunopathogenetic pathways that lead to arteritis and the major phenotypic subtypes of GCA with emphasis on large vessel vasculitis, novel modalities for disease detection and investigative trials using alternative, non-steroid therapies.

AB  - Background: Due to the high prevalence of obesity in adults, nutrition support clinicians are encountering greater numbers of obese patients who require nutrition support during hospitalization. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity. Method: A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding management of nutrition support in patients with obesity was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process, that includes consideration of the strength of the evidence together with the risks and benefits to the patient, was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. Questions: (1) Do clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non?intensive care unit (ICU) patients? (2) How should energy requirements be determined in obese critically ill or hospitalized non-ICU patients? (3) Are clinical outcomes improved with hypocaloric, high protein diets in hospitalized patients? (4) In obese patients who have had a malabsorptive or restrictive surgical procedure, what micronutrients should be evaluated?
