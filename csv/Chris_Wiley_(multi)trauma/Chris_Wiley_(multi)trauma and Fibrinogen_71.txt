AB  - Abstract. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common primary vasculitis of adults. The incidence of this disease is practically nil in the population under the age of 50?years, then rises dramatically with each passing decade. The median age of onset of the disease is about 75?years. As the ageing population expands, it is increasingly important for ophthalmologists to be familiar with GCA and its various manifestations, ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic. A heightened awareness of this condition can avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is well known that prompt initiation of steroids remains the most effective means for preventing potentially devastating ischaemic complications. This review summarizes the current concepts regarding the immunopathogenetic pathways that lead to arteritis and the major phenotypic subtypes of GCA with emphasis on large vessel vasculitis, novel modalities for disease detection and investigative trials using alternative, non-steroid therapies.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is challenging for the lack of a specific diagnostic test. Recent researches in quantitative proteomics, however, offer new opportunities for biomarker discovery and the study of disease pathogenesis. To find more potential protein biomarkers, we used two technologies, 2-dimensional fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromato-graph coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS), to quantitatively analyse differential proteomic expression in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between patients with MS (the experiment group) and patients with other neurological diseases (ONDs; the control group). Analysis by the former technology identified more than 43 different protein spots (39 proteins), of which 17 spots (13 proteins) showed more than 1.5-fold difference in abundance as analysed by DeCyder software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway. NJ, USA) between the MS and the ONDs groups. The expression of five protein spots was elevated and the expression of 12 protein spots was decreased in the MS group. Meanwhile, the latter method, UPLC/Q-TOF MS showed 68 different proteins. There were 45 proteins with a difference of more than 1.5 folds between the two groups, in which the expression of 20 proteins was elevated and the expression of 25 proteins was decreased in the MS group. Data provided by the two methods indicated that the proteins overlapped ratio was 27% in the 26 significant proteins that had the same regulation tendency. The differential CSF proteins were analysed further by biological network and it revealed interaction of them. The subsequent ELISA measuring the concentration of cystatin C (P < 0.01), which was one of the proteins discovered simultaneously with the two technologies, confirmed the results of the two quantitative proteomic analysis. The combination of the two quantitative proteomic technologies was helpful in discovering differentially expressed proteins that may have a connection with MS disease physiology and serve as useful biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of MS diseases.

AB  - Summary Thrombophilia can be identified in about half of all patients presenting with venous thrombosis. Testing has increased tremendously for various indications, but whether the results of such tests help in the clinical management of patients has not been settled. Here, we review the most commonly tested thrombophilic abnormalities, i.e. protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiencies, the F5 R506Q (factor V Leiden) and F2 G20210A (prothrombin G20210A) mutations, and elevated levels of coagulation factor VIII, and their association with venous and arterial thrombosis as well as pregnancy complications. We conclude that testing for hereditary thrombophilia generally does not alter the clinical management of patients with venous or arterial thrombosis or pregnancy complications. Because testing for thrombophilia only serves limited purpose this should not be performed on a routine basis.

AB  - Background: Due to the high prevalence of obesity in adults, nutrition support clinicians are encountering greater numbers of obese patients who require nutrition support during hospitalization. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity. Method: A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding management of nutrition support in patients with obesity was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process, that includes consideration of the strength of the evidence together with the risks and benefits to the patient, was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. Questions: (1) Do clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non?intensive care unit (ICU) patients? (2) How should energy requirements be determined in obese critically ill or hospitalized non-ICU patients? (3) Are clinical outcomes improved with hypocaloric, high protein diets in hospitalized patients? (4) In obese patients who have had a malabsorptive or restrictive surgical procedure, what micronutrients should be evaluated?

AB  - A poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold filled with fibrin gel, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly (L-lysine) (PEO-b-PLL)/pDNA-TGF-?1 complexes was fabricated and applied in vivo for synchronized regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone. The PEO-b-PLL/pDNA-TGF-?1 complexes could transfect MSCs in vitro to produce TGF-?1 in situ and up regulate the expression of chondrogenesis-related genes in the construct. The expression of heterogeneous TGF-?1 in vivo declined along with the prolongation of implantation time, and lasted for 3 and 6 weeks in the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. The constructs (Experimental group) of PLGA/fibrin gel/MSCs/(PEO-b-PLL/pDNA-TGF-?1 complexes) were implanted into the osteochondral defects of rabbits to restore the functional cartilages, with gene-absent constructs as the Control. After 12 weeks, the Experimental group regenerated the neo-cartilage and subchondral bone with abundant deposition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and type II collagen. The regenerated tissues had good integration with the host tissues too. By contrast, the defects were only partially repaired by the Control constructs. qRT-PCR results demonstrated that expression of the chondrogenesis-marker genes in the Experimental group was significantly higher than that of the Control group, and was very close to that of the normal cartilage tissue. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary. Endothelial cells (ECs) derived from human umbilical veins were cultured in order to study the physiological control of factor VIII synthesis and release. The culture media were studied from multiple replicate cultures at confluence. Factor VIII related antigen (VIIIR:Ag) and factor VIII coagulant antigen (VIII:CAg) were measured by sensitive immunoradiometric assays. De novo synthesis of factor VIII related protein (VIII:R) was quantitated by incorporation of labelled amino acids into specific protein subunits. The following agents were added to the culture medium in a range of concentrations from physiological to pharmacological: adrenaline, 5 hydroxytryptamine, 2,3-DPG, cyclic AMP, thyroxine, hydrocortisone, and human growth hormone. None of them had any effect at any concentration on the rate of accumulation of VIIIR:Ag in the culture medium. Addition of exogenous factor VIII had no effect on do novo synthesis of VIII:R. VIII:CAg was found to be stable under the conditions of culture but none was released from the ECs. Long-term monocyte cultures also failed to release VIII:CAg. It appears that VIII:R is a constitutive gene product of umbilical vein endothelial cells and that VIII:CAg is not made by these cells.

AB  - In preoperative haemodilution, blood is withdrawn before surgery while normovolaemia is maintained by infusion of cell free fluid. A surgical bleeding then entails a smaller loss of red cells. Reinfusion of the saved blood maintains normovolaemia, raises hematocrit and decreases the need for donor blood. Dilutional anaemia may endanger the oxygenation of the tissues. Tissue oxygenation can be upheld by an augmented and redistributed cardiac output and by a raised oxygen extraction. These compensatory mechanisms are less efficient in the presence of vascular stenosis, in particular in the myocardium which relies virtually exclusively on coronary vasodilatation. Major contraindications to preoperative haemodilution are, apart from coronary insufficiency, ventricular failure and valvular disease. Deleterious increases in cardiac oxygen consumption and/or heart rate may result from e. g. hypovolaemia, arterial desaturation and painful stimuli. The haemodilution procedure requires knowledge and vigilance in all involved personnel and gives best results if combined with other blood saving measures, like blood predeposit and intraoperative red blood cell salvage.

AB  - Abstract Sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLUs) are a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients who develop ulcers appear to have a more severe haemolysis-associated vasculopathy than individuals who do not develop them, and manifest other complications such as priapism and pulmonary hypertension. SCLUs are slow to heal and often recur, affecting both the emotional and physical well-being of patients. Here we summarise what is known about the pathophysiology of SCLUs, describe available treatment options and propose a treatment algorithm.
