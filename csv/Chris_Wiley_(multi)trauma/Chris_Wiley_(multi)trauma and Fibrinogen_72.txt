AB  - Introduction Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM?) and thromboelastography (TEG?) are increasingly used in the perioperative and emergency assessment of bleeding tendencies. The diagnostic value of ROTEM and TEG for von Willebrand disease (VWD) remains to be established. Aim To investigate whether ROTEM and TEG can discriminate patients with VWD from healthy controls. Methods Rotational thromboelastometry and TEG whole blood coagulation profiles were compared between VWD patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 89). Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated, including sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Prolonged TEG R-time had a positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) of 0.84 and 0.68 respectively. TEG clotting index (CI) had a PPV of 1.00 and an NPV of 0.60. Both R-time and CI had a high specificity and accurately discriminated VWD patients from healthy controls, with an ROC area under the curve of 0.85 and 0.99 respectively. In multivariate analysis, low FVIII levels, but not von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen or activity, determined hypocoagulable TEG R (R2 = 0.35) and CI levels (R2 = 0.51). The ROTEM coagulation profiles of VWD patients did not differ from healthy controls. Conclusions Thromboelastography R and CI accurately discriminated VWD patients from healthy controls, partly through the detection of low FVIII levels. The test's performance may be improved through adjustment of the test thresholds to a local reference population. Both intrinsic pathway-activated (INTEM) and tissue factor pathway-activated (EXTEM) ROTEM were of limited diagnostic value in VWD.

AB  - Abstract Chronic non-healing wounds show delayed and incomplete healing processes and in turn expose patients to a high risk of infection. Treatment currently focuses on dressings that prevent microbial infiltration and keep a balanced moisture and gas exchange environment. Antibacterial delivery from dressings has existed for some time, with responsive systems now aiming to trigger release only if infection occurs. Simultaneously, approaches that stimulate cell proliferation in the wound and encourage healing have been developed. Interestingly, few dressings appear capable of simultaneously impairing or treating infection and encouraging cell proliferation/wound healing. Electrospinning is a simple, cost-effective, and reproducible process that can utilize both synthetic and natural polymers to address these specific wound challenges. Electrospun meshes provide high-surface area, micro-porosity, and the ability to load drugs or other biomolecules into the fibers. Electrospun materials have been used as scaffolds for tissue engineering for a number of years, but there is surprisingly little literature on the interactions of fibers with bacteria and co-cultures of cells and bacteria. This Review examines the literature and data available on electrospun wound dressings and the research that is required to develop smart multifunctional wound dressings capable of treating infection and healing chronic wounds.

AB  - Summary Background Staphylococcus aureus has important implications for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). In some patients S. aureus can be eradicated from the skin during anti-inflammatory treatment, while in others bacterial colonization is persistent. Potential mechanisms and features of these two distinct groups of patients are not known. Objective Accordingly, we studied relationships between the ability to eliminate S. aureus during an anti-inflammatory treatment and selected clinical and immunological features. Methods Quantitative assessment of S. aureus on the skin, in nasal vestibule and throat, serum IgE levels, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, lymphocyte proliferation and phagocyte oxidative burst were determined during the exacerbation and after 4 and 12 weeks of the treatment using topical steroid and oral antihistamine in 34 patients with AD. Results S. aureus was found on the skin of all 34 patients during exacerbation. Disease severity scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) correlated with the density of bacteria. Treatment with oral antihistamine and topical steroid resulted in a significant alleviation of symptoms, which correlated with the elimination of S. aureus from the skin in 70% of patients. In the remaining 30% of patients, dense (more than 1010/cm2) S. aureus skin colonization, persisted despite the treatment. Patients with persistent S. aureus presented with higher serum IgE levels, lower lymphocyte proliferation in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin B, phytohaemagluttinin and anti-CD3. Persistence of S. aureus was more common in men. Conclusions Patients with AD differ in the ability to clear S. aureus from the skin during anti-inflammatory treatment, which appears to be related to the abnormalities in immunological parameters. Local antibiotic therapy should be considered only in patients with persistent S. aureus colonization.

AB  - Summary Increasing number of patients presenting for ophthalmic surgery are using oral anti-coagulant and anti-platelet therapy. The current practice of discontinuing these drugs preoperatively because of a presumed increased risk of bleeding may not be evidence-based and could pose a significant risk to the patient?s health. To provide an evidence-based review on the peri-operative management of ophthalmic patients who are taking anti-thrombotic therapy. In addition, we briefly discuss the underlying conditions that necessitate the use of these drugs as well as management of the operative field in anti-coagulated patients. A semi-systematic review of literature was performed. The databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, database of abstracts of reviews of effects (DARE), Cochrane controlled trial register and Cochrane systematic reviews. In addition, the bibliographies of the included papers were also scanned for evidence. The published data suggests that aspirin did not appear to increase the risk of serious postoperative bleeding in any type of ophthalmic surgery. Topical, sub-tenon, peri-bulbar and retrobulbar anaesthesia appear to be safe in patients on anti-thrombotic (warfarin and aspirin) therapy. Warfarin does not increase the risk of significant bleeding in most types of ophthalmic surgery when the INR was within the therapeutic range. Current evidence supports the continued use of aspirin and with some exceptions, warfarin in the peri-operative period. The risk of thrombosis-related complications on disruption of anticoagulation may be higher than the risk of significant bleeding by continuing its use for most types of ophthalmic surgery.
