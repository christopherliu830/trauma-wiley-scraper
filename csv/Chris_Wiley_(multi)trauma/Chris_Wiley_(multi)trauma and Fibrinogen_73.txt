AB  - Summary The preoperative period is a critical step in the care of children and adults with congenital heart disease. This chapter reviews the essential goals of the preoperative visit in preparing the child and family for the upcoming intervention, obtaining appropriate consent, and understanding the child's cardiac condition and other medical issues. This chapter will discuss the role of history and physical examination, various investigations including laboratory tests and imaging studies, and evaluation of compensatory status. We discuss the options for premedication, fasting guidelines, and infective endocarditis prophylaxis. We also describe a method for anesthetic risk stratification in children with congenital heart disease presenting for cardiac as well as non-cardiac interventions.

AB  - Abstract Pseudoaneurysms in the coronary circulation are an uncommon occurrence that can develop spontaneously in the setting of atherosclerosis or can develop after catheter-based coronary interventions. The natural history, clinical outcome, and optimal therapy for pseudoaneurysms in the coronary circulation are not clearly established. Recent advances in the techniques and technologies used for endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms may be applicable to the management of coronary aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. We present a case of spontaneous coronary pseudoaneurysm formation after paclitaxel drug-eluting stent implantation and a case of pseudoaneurysm formation in a saphenous vein graft that were both successfully treated with stent-assisted detachable coil embolization. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract. Fluid from 41 non-keratinizing jaw cysts was examined by cellulose acetate membrane (CAM) electrophoresis. Improved separation with more regular protein profiles was obtained after digestion with bovine testicular hyaluronidase of two cyst contents exhibiting pronounced viscosity. CAM electrophoretograms of cyst fluid and serum contained the same protein fractions, with the exception of the ?2globulin band which was clearly demonstrated in only one cyst fluid, that from a median palatine cyst. Quantitation by scanning of the CAM eleclrophorelograms yielded contents of albumin, α1-, and α2-globulins which usually were proportionately lower in cyst fluid than in autologous serum while the ?1-globulin fraction was roughly similar. Relative concentrations of ?-globulins were significantly higher in cyst fluid than in autologous scrum, rising to as much as 56% of the total cyst fluid protein content. The ?-globulin band of cyst fluid generally was broad-based (?polyclonal? pattern). Within these broad ?-zones discrete, narrow, but well demarcated bands were occasionally seen (?oligoclonal? pattern). One cyst fluid exhibited a narrow-based ?-globulin band (?monoclonal? pattern). The electrophoretic patterns as well as other observations provide indirect evidence for the view that the bulk of the cyst fluid proteins are derived from the plasma and indicate that the ?-globulin fraction is a mixture of extravasated arid locally produced immunoglobulins.

AB  - Summary. It is well established that debris tends to accumulate in banked blood, the amount of debris increasing with storage time. If such a blood is transfused to a patient, it will be filtered by the capillary network of the lungs and could cause various intensities of microemboli. These can be prevented by microfiltration?the Swank IL200 transfusion filter made of Dacron wool is perfectly suitable. It removes more than 70% of the debris 29-100 ?m size from four blood units and its efficiency for particle removal is greatly increased by lactate priming.

AB  - Abstract Due to a processing error, this manuscript was inadvertently published online in Head & Neck on January 16, 2004, without Table 1. The publisher has replaced the incorrect version of the published article with the correct version containing Table 1. For archival purposes, the earlier version is available by contacting the publisher at headandneck@wiley.com. This should be considered the definitive version of this article. Background. The detection of the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in nasal secretions contaminated with blood and mucus remains a challenging clinical problem. Methods. A prospective study was conducted from November 1998 to February 2002, including 42 patients. Samples (250 ?L) of nasal secretions were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Plasma, mucus, and CSF were identified by specific proteins markers corresponding to characteristic trains of spots. Intrathecal injection of fluorescein followed by the detection of fluorescein on endoscopic examination of the nasal cavities was considered a positive reference for CSF rhinorrhea. Results. In all cases of positive fluorescein test, we unambiguously observed the presence of several specific CSF markers onto the 2-DE gels. Conversely, all negative fluorescein tests were associated with the absence of CSF-specific spots. Conclusions. Two-DE analyses of biologic fluids of nasal origin should be considered as a reliable diagnostic tool in case of suspicion of CSF leak. ? 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 464?469, 2003

AB  - Abstract Aim Periodontal disease is a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor but few studies have considered the relationship between periodontal disease and venous thromboembolism (VTE). We hypothesized that periodontal disease is independently associated with increased risk of incident VTE. Materials and methods We used data from 8,092 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study to examine periodontal disease in 1996?1998 and incident VTE through 2011. Periodontal disease was determined using self-reported tooth loss due to gum disease and dental examinations. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for VTE and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for relevant confounders. Results and conclusions Participants were on average 62.7 years old at baseline and 13.9% self-reported tooth loss from gum disease. Over a mean of 12.9 years of follow-up, there were 313 incident VTE events. Self-reported tooth loss due to gum disease was associated with 30% higher VTE risk (HR = 1.29 (0.96, 1.73) after adjusting demographic factors, SES, periodontal risk factors, oral hygiene, and access to dental care variables. No statistically significant associations between clinical measures of periodontitis and VTE were observed after adjustment. Further research is needed to elucidate whether a relationship between periodontal disease and VTE exists.
