AB  - Summary This section discusses therapy for infectious diseases of the dog and cat. There are a number of infectious diseases listed in this section as chapters. These include Acanthamoeba, Acinetobacter, Actinomyces and Aelorostrongylus abstrusus. This chapters presents details such as the description, zoonotic potential, microbiology/epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, drug therapy and drug therapy alternatives of each infection discussed environmental exposure to Acanthamoeba is common and typically does not result in infection. Acanthamoeba from corneal samples of cats with refractory conjunctivitis and keratitis. Dogs may present with clinical signs similar to distemper. Mild ocular discharge, anorexia, lethargy, and fever may occur early. Acinetobacter is a gram negative coccobacillus. Aelorostrongylus abstrusus is the most common lungworm of cats and is found worldwide. Diagnosis of A. abstrusus should be considered in any cats with respiratory signs, particularly outdoor cats that hunt. Treatment is difficult and not always required.

AB  - Abstract Subgaleal haemorrhage (SGH) is an important cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the neonate. Its increased prevalence in recent years has coincided with the rise in the number of births assisted by vacuum extraction. Three deaths in Australia within the last 7 years have been the subject of two coronial inquests. Subsequent coronial reports have highlighted that neonatal death from SGH can be prevented if appropriate attention is paid to identification of risk factors, early diagnosis, close observation and aggressive treatment. To prevent unnecessary deaths, all involved in the care of the baby after birth need to be aware of the importance of prompt diagnosis, monitoring and early treatment of SGH.

AB  - Summary Background Although recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) is a widely used novel anticoagulant agent for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in Japan, its clinical efficacy in sepsis-induced DIC has not been demonstrated convincingly. Objective To assess the benefits and harms of rhTM in sepsis-induced DIC patients. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of rhTM therapy for sepsis-induced DIC for both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (retrospective case-control studies and/or prospective cohort studies) separately. All-cause mortality (28?30 days) as efficacy and serious bleeding complications as adverse effect were measured as primary outcomes. We assessed body of evidence quality at the outcome level by using the Grading of Evidence, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results We analyzed 12 studies (838 patients/3 RCTs; 571 patients/9 observational studies). Pooled relative risk was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.62?1.06) in the RCTs, indicating non-significant reduction in mortality, and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.45?0.77) in the observational studies. Meta-regression analysis revealed a significant negative slope between effect size of rhTM therapy and baseline mortality rate in individual studies (P = 0.012), suggesting that probability of a beneficial effect with rhTM therapy increases with increasing baseline risk. Risk of serious bleeding complications was not significantly different between rhTM and control groups. We judged the quality of evidence as moderate for mortality and serious bleeding. Conclusions The rhTM was associated with a trend in reduction of mortality at 28?30 days in sepsis-induced DIC patients. Further large rigorous trials are needed to confirm or refute these findings before implications for practice are clear.

AB  - Summary The primary goal of regionalized perinatal care is for women and neonates at high risk to receive care in facilities that provide the required level of specialized care. This chapter reviews the increasing need for and rationale, logistics, and components of a successful transport program. Many fields of medicine have recognized the importance of regionalizing medical care to achieve better clinical outcomes by healthcare facilities with predefined designated levels of care. There are three types of perinatal patient transport: maternal-fetal or maternal transport. neonatal transport, and return transport. The chapter focuses primarily on maternal-fetal transport. Maternal transport is the process of transport of a pregnant woman during the antepartum or intrapartum period for special care of the woman, the fetus/neonate, or both. Logistical considerations in maternal-fetal transport include mode of transport, personnel, equipment, supplies, and fetal monitoring. The chapter discusses condition-specific considerations, such as preterm labor, hemorrhage, preeclampsia, and sepsis, for common transport indications.

AB  - Abstract Objective To examine the association between perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric surgical patients. Methods Retrospective cohort study using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Pediatric, a validated registry of 118 United States children's hospitals. Patients under 19 years of age undergoing a surgical procedure between 2012 and 2017 were included, with the main exposure being RBC transfusion in the perioperative period (48 hours prior to operation to 72 hours after operation). The primary 30-day outcome of interest was a postoperative VTE requiring therapy. Risk-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated using multiple logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were performed across multiple surgical specialties. Sensitivity analyses were performed after (a) imputation for missing variables and (b) propensity score matching. Results During the study years, 482 867 pediatric patients (56.7% male; median age, 6 years [interquartile range, 1?12 years]) underwent an operation. Of these, 30 879 (6.4%) received at least one perioperative RBC transfusion. Postoperative VTE requiring therapy occurred in 618 patients (0.13%). After adjustment for multiple risk factors, perioperative RBC transfusion was associated with an increased risk of VTE (aOR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9?3.0). The increased VTE risk persisted after imputation of missing demographic and clinical data as well as after 1:1 propensity score matching (29 811 matched pairs, aOR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7?2.8). Conclusions Perioperative RBC transfusion is associated with an increased, albeit still very low, risk of postoperative VTE in pediatric patients. Patients receiving blood in the perioperative period may benefit from additional monitoring or VTE prophylaxis.

AB  - The experience of burnout has been the focus of much research during the past few decades. Measures have been developed, as have various theoretical models, and research studies from many countries have contributed to a better understanding of the causes and consequences of this occupationally-specific dysphoria. The majority of this work has focused on human service occupations, and particularly health care. Research on the burnout experience for psychiatrists mirrors much of the broader literature, in terms of both sources and outcomes of burnout. But it has also identified some of the unique stressors that mental health professionals face when they are dealing with especially difficult or violent clients. Current issues of particular relevance for psychiatry include the links between burnout and mental illness, the attempts to redefine burnout as simply exhaustion, and the relative dearth of evaluative research on potential interventions to treat and/or prevent burnout. Given that the treatment goal for burnout is usually to enable people to return to their job, and to be successful in their work, psychiatry could make an important contribution by identifying the treatment strategies that would be most effective in achieving that goal.
