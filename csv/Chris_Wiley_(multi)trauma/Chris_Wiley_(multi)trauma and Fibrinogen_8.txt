AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Retinal haemorrhages (RH) in a young child suggest child abuse, yet other causes merit consideration. This systematic review addresses non-traumatic causes of RH in children with one or more overlapping clinical features of abuse (bruising, fractures, intracranial haemorrhage). Searching 12 databases (1950?2009) identified 338 studies for review by two reviewers. Inclusion criteria included: children?<?15?years examined by an ophthalmologist detailing retinal findings, confirmed organic cause and exclusion of abuse. Exclusion criteria included: diagnosed coagulopathy, ocular mass lesion and post-mortem cases. Twenty included studies identified nine relevant conditions (metabolic diseases, bony dysplasias, bleeding disorders and vascular malformations). Where detailed, the RH were bilateral and involved only one area of the retina (the posterior pole). Among proposed confounders of RH, no child with a cough (100 children) or acute life-threatening event (184 cases) had RH. Just two of 217 children with seizures had posterior pole RH, one unilateral and one bilateral. One cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) study (43 cases) was included where a child with co-existent clotting abnormalities had tiny (bilateral dot) RH after 60 minutes? resuscitation. Child abuse remains the commonest cause of RH in young children, although rarer disorders merit consideration. There are insufficient data to conclude that CPR is a confounder in children with RH. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ?Searching 12 databases (1950?2009) identified 338 studies for review? ?There are insufficient data to conclude that CPR is a confounder in children with RH? Key Practitioner Message Retinal Haemorrhages are strongly associated with Abusive Head Trauma, but have been described in certain medical conditions. Neither cough nor ALTE are associated with RH, which have been found in <?3% of children with seizures. There are inadequate data to conclude that CPR is associated with RH. Case series have reported RH in children who also have clinical features that may overlap with physical abuse, namely certain metabolic, vascular, haematologic disorders and bony dysplasias (specifically osteogenesis imperfecta).

AB  - Summary Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) can cause complications, including pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The majority of primary UEDVTs are caused by abnormalities of the costo-clavicular junction. Central venous catheter (CVC)/peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) are the most significant cause of secondary UEDVT, and are present in about half of all cases. Goals of therapy of UEDVT include reduction or elimination of symptoms, prevention of DVT progression, or embolisation and reduction of the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Anticoagulation, using the same approach as used for lower extremity DVT (LEDVT), is the mainstay of therapy for UEDVT. Anticoagulants do not result in fibrinolysis. Therefore, vein recanalisation depends on endogenous fibrinolytic processes. Various interventional therapies have been evaluated as a means of attempting to accelerate the process of recanalisation, with the goal of reducing the risk of PTS and, perhaps, the risk of DVT recurrence.

AB  - Abstract Background Adult primary mesenchymal cells of different origin which can be obtained with minor donor site morbidity are considered for articular cartilage repair. This study aims at a comparison of their chondrogenic potential. Methods Mesenchymal cells were isolated from perichondrium/periosteum, bone marrow or fat of adult rats and found to be positive for the stem-cell-related antigens Sca-1, c-Kit, CD10, CD13 and CD90 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chondrogenic differentiation was induced by applying recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or adenoviral vectors carrying BMP-2 cDNA, followed by micromass culture. The stimulated cells were characterized by RT-PCR, cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Expression of aggrecan, collagen type I, II, IX and X and alkaline phosphatase genes was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in comparison with unstimulated control cells. Adenovirally stimulated cells were transplanted into mechanically generated partial-thickness cartilage lesions in the patellar groove of the rat femur. Quality and integration of the repair tissues were assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Results Stimulation with BMP-2 or AdBMP-2 led to an up-regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression in all three cell populations studied, most rapidly and prominently in the perichondrial/periosteal cells, which showed a 3200-fold increase of type II collagen mRNA and reached the highest absolute levels of type II and IX collagen transcripts after stimulation. Similar results were obtained for the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), while the respective transcript levels in fat stromal cells declined after an initial more than 30-fold elevation. Following transplantation in vivo, AdBMP-2-infected perichondrial/periosteal cells produced a proteoglycan-rich, type II collagen-positive matrix with only faint staining for type I collagen. The repair tissue originating from AdBMP-2-infected BMSC showed less intense type II collagen staining, but a relatively proteoglycan-rich matrix, weakly positive for type I collagen. Transgene-activated fat stromal cells formed rather fibrous tissue mainly composed of type I collagen. Unstimulated cells of the three different populations gave only rise to fibrous tissue. Conclusions Perichondrium/periosteum-derived cells and BMSC seem superior to cells isolated from fat with respect to forming hyaline cartilaginous tissue. A chondrogenic stimulus, e.g. by transfer of BMP-2 cDNA, appears to be required for initiation and support of chondrogenic differentiation. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - Summary This report describes a case of a multiple-drug resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii associated with bronchopneumonia in a horse. A 6-month-old Thoroughbred colt was examined for a chronic lower respiratory tract disease. Prior to presentation to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UVTH), the colt had been treated intensively in a private equine hospital for presumed antimicrobial-induced enterocolitis following treatment with azithromycin and rifampin, and had been discharged on treatment of doxycycline for continued lower airway abnormalities. At the UVTH, investigation of the lower airway disease included a culture of a percutaneous transtracheal wash, which identified a multiple-drug resistant strain of A. baumannii as the causative agent with sensitivity only to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim sulphonamides. Following treatment with marbofloxacin there was full resolution of the bronchopneumonia. A. baumannii is a major nosocomial pathogen associated with infections in both animals and man and reports of multiple-drug resistant strains have been documented worldwide. Outbreaks of A. baumannii infections have been reported to occur in very ill human patients housed in healthcare settings such as intensive care units, and are characterised by the rapid development of resistance to the majority of antimicrobials. The difficulties in the treatment of such cases as well as the potential risk of transmission within a veterinary clinical setting are discussed.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - Background Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods Prospective study of a population-representative 1972?1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Results Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (N = 837, 50.5% male). suPAR (mean 2.40 ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, p < .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; p = .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; p < .001). Conclusions Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden.

AB  - Several hemostatic strategies rely on the use of blood components such as fibrinogen and thrombin, which suffer from high cost and short shelf-life. Here, a cost-effective synthetic biomaterial is developed for rapid local hemostasis. Instead of using thrombin, thrombin-receptor-agonist-peptide-6 (TRAP6) is covalently engineered in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. Soluble PVA-TRAP6 is first prepared by covalent attachment of cysteine-containing TRAP6 onto the backbone of PVA-norbornenes (PVA-NB) through photoconjugation. Cytotoxicity studies using C2C12 myoblasts indicate that PVA-NB and PVA-TRAP6 are nontoxic. Thromboelastography reveals that hemostatic activity of TRAP6 is retained in conjugated form, which is comparable to free TRAP6 solutions with equal concentrations. A 0.1% PVA-TRAP6 solution can shorten the clotting time (CT) to ca. 45% of the physiological CT. High platelet-activating efficiency is further confirmed by platelet aggregation assay and flow cytometry (FACS). For potential clinical applications, TRAP6-presenting hydrogel particulates (PVA-TRAP6-P) are developed for local platelet activation and hemostasis. PVA-TRAP6-P is prepared by biofunctionalization of photopolymerized PVA-NB hydrogel particulates (PVA-NB-P) with TRAP6. It is demonstrated that PVA-TRAP6-P can effectively shorten the CT to ca. 50%. FACS shows that PVA-TRAP6-P can activate platelets to a comparable extent as soluble TRAP6 control. Altogether, PVA-TRAP6-P represents a promising class of biomaterials for safe hemostasis and wound healing.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - Summary Inherited coagulation disorders constitute a broad spectrum of coagulation factor deficiencies that include X-linked factor (F)VIII or FIX deficiency that causes haemophilia, and autosomal recessive disorders producing heterogeneous deficiencies in fibrinogen (FI), prothrombin (FII), FV, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII and combined FV+FVIII. Significant advances in treatments for patients with congenital haemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) and B (FIX deficiency) over the last two decades have resulted from improvements in the production, availability and patient access to factor replacement products. Translation of advances in biotechnology, namely recombinant protein technology, targeted protein modifications to improve function and potentially reduce immunogenicity, and advanced formulations to optimize bioavailability and sustain activity offer promisingly new treatments for haemophilia as well as recessively inherited bleeding disorders in patients who otherwise have few therapeutic options. Though a theoretical risk remains for blood-borne viral infections with pooled plasma-derived products, this concern has diminished with breakthroughs in purification and viral inactivation methods. Development of inhibitory antibodies is still the most daunting problem for patients with inherited bleeding disorders, complicating treatment approaches to control and prevent bleeding, and posing risks for allergic and anaphylactic reactions in susceptible patients. The objectives of this review are to (i) highlight emerging advances in hemostatic therapies that are bioengineered to improve pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability, sustain functional activity, and possibly eliminate immunogenicity of recombinant factor proteins; and (ii) present an overview of key clinical trials of novel factor products currently in the development pipeline.

AB  - SUMMARY Coagulation involves the regulated sequence of proteolytic activation of a series of zymogens to achieve appropriate and timely haemostasis in an injured vessel, in an environment that overwhelmingly favours an anticoagulant state. In the non-pathological state, the inciting event involves exposure of circulating factor VII/VIIa to extravascularly expressed tissue factor, which brings into motion the series of steps which results in amplification of the initial stimulus, culminating in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and clot formation. The precisely synchronized cascade of events is counter-balanced by a system of anticoagulant mechanisms, which serve to ensure that the haemostatic effect is regulated and does not extend inappropriately. Conversely, in pathological states, these events can escape normal control mechanisms, due to either inherited or acquired defects, which lead to thrombosis. Current anticoagulant therapy, although based on medications that have been in existence for upwards of 80?years, is moving towards targeted therapy for specific coagulation factors and events in the coagulation cascade, based on the current knowledge of the main triggers and key events within the series of reactions that culminates in haemostasis. It remains to be seen whether these newer medications will become first-line therapies for thrombosis in the coming decade. This review aims to elucidate the main events within the coagulation cascade as it is currently understood to operate in vivo, with a brief discussion focusing on hypercoagulable states, and also a short review of the history of anticoagulants as they relate to this model.

AB  - Medical records of 68 horses with urolithiasis were examined. Calculi were in the bladder in 47 horses, urethra in 11 horses, kidneys in 15 horses, and ureter in two horses. They occurred at several sites in six horses. Common clinical signs included hematuria, altered micturition (pollakiuria, dysuria, urinary incontinence), and tenesmus. Weight loss, possibly attributable to chronic renal failure and colic, was associated more commonly with renal and ureteral calculi. Weight loss also occurred in 13% of horses with cystic calculi only. In male horses, most cystic calculi were removed by perineal (ischial) urethrotomy under epidural anesthesia. Although there were few surgical complications with urethrotomy, seven of 15 horses with follow-up suffered recurrent urolithiasis.
