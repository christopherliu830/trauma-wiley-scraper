AB  - Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has found substantial clinical utility as a commercially available wound matrix. In the present study, the utility of two natural, nonsynthetic and noncrosslinked ECMs, porcine renal capsule material (RCM) and SIS, were compared to no-fill controls in a rat full thickness skin wound model. Groups of rats had surgically created wounds filled with SIS, RCM, or left unfilled (ten/treatment/time point). Wound diameters periodically measured at 3?30 days after wound creation and sites sampled at 3?56 days after wound creation were numerically graded for degree of histologic change including the formation of adnexa and for collagen content based on intensity of trichrome staining. Wounds in both ECM groups had statistically significant (P?<?0.001) greater wound diameters than unfilled controls at days 7, 12, and 17 with no differences between RCM- and SIS-treated wounds at any time point. At 56 days, SIS-filled and RCM-filled wounds were completely closed with cornified epithelium covered by a keratinized layer. Healing was largely complete, with normal numbers of adnexal structures present in most sections, while unfilled control wounds were similar though fewer adnexal structures were present. Though histology scores suggested more robust healing with either RCM or SIS, no significant differences with unfilled control wounds were found. From this study, it appears that RCM and SIS enhance wound healing in terms of wound tissue collagenization and maturation of adnexal structures while clearly impeding wound contraction. Natural ECMs have utility for dermal wound repair and may lessen clinical contracture formation caused by rapid wound contraction. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Introduction:? Myofibroblasts are a subtype of fibroblasts, which appear temporally during wound healing. Young hypertrophic scar contains a large number of myofibroblasts and the number declines over time. It has been shown that deep partial-thickness wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars, which is similar to hypertrophic scar. As part of our validation of the Duroc model of hypertrophic scarring, we evaluated myofibroblasts in wounds on the Duroc pigs. Methods:? Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of 12 Durocs. Biopsies were taken at weeks 1, 2, 4, 15, and 21 postwounding. Samples were analyzed by immunochemical staining for alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA, for myofibroblasts) and heat-shock protein (HSP47, for fibroblasts). HSP47 positive cells were counted at 40X and the fraction of a-SMA positive cells out of fibroblasts was evaluated at 10X. Statistical significance was calculated with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results:? The counts of HSP47 and a-SMA positive cells are shown in the table below. In brief, in deep wounds most of the HSP47 positive cells were a-SMA positive at 1 and 2 weeks but this declined rapidly thereafter. In shallow wounds there were far fewer cells positive for a-SMA and the decline was even more rapid. 1W 2W 4W 15W 21W Number Shallow 105?±?22 151?±?59 106?±?23 ?57?±?20 44?±?4 HSP47 Deep 524?±?45 449?±?35 231?±?73 108?±?30 55?±?8 P value <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Percent Shallow 23% 3% 0 0 0 a-SMA Deep 90% 74% 10% 0 0 P value <0.05 <0.05 Conclusions:? a-SMA positive fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) are present in deep Duroc wounds and the temporal pattern is similar to that reported for human hypertrophic scar. This further validates the female red Duroc model of human hypertrophic scarring.

AB  - There are only a few models for studying epidermal migration in vitro, and their interpretation is made difficult by reliance on cell monolayers and the choice of a specific substrate. In this study, the process of keratinocyte migration and epiboly were investigated by using a bilayered bioengineered skin construct, consisting of human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (Apligraf, Organogenesis, Canton, MA). At baseline, 6-mm punch biopsies of the construct were placed in serum-free media (AIM-V) or DMEM with or without 10% FBS. At varying time points the bioengineered skin samples were processed and analyzed by histology and immunostaining. By 72 hours, in a time-dependent manner, the epidermis had migrated over and enveloped the entire dermis (full epiboly). Full epiboly was partially inhibited by serum and was maximal in serum-free medium. Epiboly was preserved 5 days after stated expiration date and was equivalent to that seen in unexpired construct when stored at room temperature. The process of epiboly was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by neutralizing antibodies to EGF and TGF-beta 1. The migrating epithelium was characterized by decreased keratinocyte proliferation (as per Ki67 immunostaining) and increased expression of vitronectin (epibolin). Increasing concentrations of antibodies of vitronectin blocked the process of epiboly, as did antibodies to the alpha5-betaV integrin receptor, which mediates vitronectin-driven keratinocyte locomotion. Interesting, epiboly was also blocked by preseeding human dermal fibroblasts on the dermal side of the construct. We propose that the process of epiboly in this model can be used to better understand and assess the mechanisms involved in keratinocyte migration and may be used as an assay for establishing construct functional viability.

AB  - We find that the ELR-negative CXC chemokines, CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11(IP-9), expressed during wound repair, with IP-9 being produced by redifferentiated keratinocyte. Immunohistochemical analysis for IP-9 on human full thickness wound tissues collected from day 5 confirmed that IP-9 is a wound response protein. We have shown in in vitro coculture systems that IP-9 can serve as an autocrine factor promoting motility in keratinocyte while limiting motility in dermal fibroblasts. These effects occur via modulation of the intracellular proteases calpain isoforms that regulate cell adhesion during motility. Thus, the function of these chemokines in vivo is not obvious. To probe this, we have explored wound repair in mice lacking the receptor for these ligands, CXCR3. Quantitative analysis of IP-9 expression in wounds of these mice collected from day 2 to day 20 showed a significant increase in IP-9 levels in CXCR3-/- mice compared to wild type, which is expected if receptor-mediated feedback attenuation is lost. Full and partial thickness wound healing experiments on these mice showed a significant delay in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Histochemical analysis of tissues collected from both full and partial thickness wounds demonstrated differences in epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and angiogenesis in CXCR3-/- mice when compared to wild type. Collagen, the major extracellular matrix protein organization were analyzed by trichrome and picrosirus red staining methods. We are also examining the effect of this lost receptor on promotility signaling from EGF receptors. These in vivo and in vitro studies confirm the pathophysiologic role of the chemokines IP-9 and IP-10 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 during wound repair.

AB  - SUMMARY Liver transplantation is often associated with substantial blood loss and coagulopathy that requires the need for transfusion of large amounts of blood products with increased morbidity and mortality. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was originally developed for the treatment of hemophilia patients with antibodies to factors VIII or IX. More recently rFVIIa has been studied as a prohemostatic agent in a variety of clinical and surgical conditions including liver transplantation. A review of the literature reveals a total of 96 cases of liver transplantation including recipient infants and adults. The doses of rFVIIa have been variable, as well as the results. The largest study was a randomized, double blind, parallel group placebo controlled trial with 83 patients who received a single dose of rFVIIa or placebo. No statistical correlation was seen between the use of rFVIIa and transfusion requirement. The overall incidence of adverse events has been low in all the reported cases. Further large controlled studies should be performed before the widespread use of rFVIIa in the surgical setting is advocated.

AB  - Introduction:? Using peptide growth factors to improve upon natural wound healing provides promise, but topical application of growth factors has found limited clinical success. Gene therapy has been limited by low transfection efficiency. We are investigating the use of electroporation (EP)in vivo to enhance transfection efficiency and improve wound healing with DNA expression vectors for growth factors. Methods:? To assess plasmid transfection and wound healing, gWIZ luciferase vector and PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector were used, respectively. Cutaneous wounds were produced via 8?mm-punch biopsy in Sprague Dawley rats. Healing was impaired by cecal ligation induced sepsis. We used NIH image analysis software and histologic assessment to assess wound closure. Results:? Plasmid Transfection: EP effectively increased expression of gWIZ luciferase vector 53-fold compared to vector without EP (p?<?0.001). We demonstrated that transfection was localized to skin when transfected skin was reflected to reveal underlying muscle. We found that EP-assisted transfection lasted for 30 days, which is appropriate for treatment of wound healing. Wound Healing:? Using PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector and EP wounds were 60% smaller on day 12 versus vector without EP (p?<?0.009). We assessed quality of healing with a histologic scoring system grading quality of epithelial coverage, organization of scar and resolution of inflammation. KGF vector?+?EP score of 3.0 +/? 0.3 was better than that of 1.8 +/? 0.3 for treatment with vector alone (p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? These results demonstrate the capacity of electroporation-facilitated transfection with DNA plasmid expression vector for growth factor to improve wound healing. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and its murine homolog spi2 are serine protease inhibitors present in plasma, that are locally up-regulated during wound healing. Ad-spi2 and Ad-ACT expression vectors were constructed to address the biological activity of locally expressed serpins. The condition medium of infected COS-1 cell at 2?d postinfection contained 1.23?ng/ml spi2 and 2.61?ng/ml ACT. Ad-LacZ or Ad-spi2 108?pfu was injected into the sponges after 3?d subcutaneous implantation in rats. Histological analysis showed that overexpression of spi2 improves granulation tissue organization and collagen deposition at d7 implantation. Moreover, overexpression of spi2 increases the contents of tissue DNA (23.8%, p?<?0.05) and protein (25.3%, p?<?0.05) in sponge implantation model in rats. In incisional wound models in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats, Ad-spi2 increases tensile strength by 26%(p?=?0.011) and 29%(p?=?0.022) as well as Ad-ACT increases by 10.3%(p?=?0.037) and 32%(p?=?0.004), respectively. In adriamycin-induced wound model in rats, histological analysis displayed less inflammatory cells infiltrating in Ad-ACT injected wound than in Ad-LacZ after 21?d injection of adriamycin. Inflammation enzymes MPO and elastase levels were decreased by 32.3% and 29.2% in Ad-ACT injected wound tissue. Our data concluded that overexpression of spi2 and ACT improves wound healing in rats probably via inflammatory resolution. (Supported by Switch Biotech and the Department of Veterans Affairs)

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Tissue ischemia is a common occurrence in many disease processes including chronic wounds, stroke, solid tumors, and myocardial infarction. The application of gene delivery for healing of wounds has demonstrated increasing therapeutic promises in animal models. Adenoviral vectors have been successfully used for gene delivery to the ischemic wound. However, these vectors typically demonstrate short, transient transgene expression while eliciting significant cytotoxic immune response. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) do not have those limitations; however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. The goal of this study was to compare AAV vector with adenoviral vector in terms of relative efficiency of gene delivery and cytotoxic immune response in ischemic wounds. Reporter constructs Ad5-LacZ and AAV-LacZ (108?pfu/wound) were injected onto the dermis of rabbit ear prior to creation of ischemic wounds. Wounds were harvested at postoperative day 10. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with an in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed with both vectors; however, transduction rates with AAV vector was approximately 10-fold lower than Adenovirus. Unlike Adenovirus, no noticeable inflammatory cell infiltration was observed with AAV injection. Even when the dosage of AAV was increased to 109?pfu/wound inflammatory cell infiltration remained negligible. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and adenoviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in ischemic tissues. The particular advantage of AAV is the ability to transfect with higher doses while at lower dose maximal transfection rate seems to be more with Adenovirus.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. In vitro cell culture bioactivity experiments are planned. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated.

AB  - Wound repair is described as a delicately balanced and well-orchestrated progression of events, which ultimately results in healing in the majority of acute cases. However, time taken to complete healing can vary greatly between patients and any alteration in this physiological process could delay healing further. Thus, a wound treatment, which facilitates healing independent of wound type and in patients where healing is compromised or impeded, would be extremely advantageous. Previous studies suggest a beneficial role for biomaterials such as collagen/ORC in modifying the chronic wound environment; however, their effect on the acute wound environment is unknown. While it is generally accepted that acute wounds heal at an optimum rate due to a positive wound environment, we wanted to determine if current advanced wound healing treatments could augment or impact this healing rate. In this study we evaluated the effect of advanced wound therapies in the presence of acute wound fluid on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. We hypothesize that an enhanced effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid may be indicative of a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute wounds. Results demonstrate that of the wound treatments tested only collagen/ORC containing therapies exhibited a positive effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid. We conclude, therefore, that collagen/ORC biomaterials, already shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wounds, may also be a valuable therapy in the treatment of acute wounds.
