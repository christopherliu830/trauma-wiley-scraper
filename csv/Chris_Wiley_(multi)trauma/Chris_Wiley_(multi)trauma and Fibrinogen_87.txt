AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are present in saliva and may impact wound healing within the oral cavity. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that psychosocial factors such as elevated depression scores are associated with delayed oral wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between salivary levels of EGF and VEGF and depression and loneliness scores. Whole saliva was collected from 43 individuals in groups aged 18?35 years and 50+?years. On the same day, volunteers were asked to complete the Beck?s Depression Inventory (BDI) and the UCLA loneliness scale. Salivary concentrations of EGF and VEGF were determined by standard ELISA. Mean concentrations of EGF and VEGF were 2860?pg/ml and 421?pg/ml, respectively. In the younger age group, significant negative correlations were found between scores on the BDI and UCLA indices and salivary levels of EGF. A median split, based upon BDI scores, similarly revealed that more depressed or lonely individuals exhibited significantly lower EGF levels. A similar trend was observed for VEGF. These preliminary results indicate that psychosocial factors such as depression and loneliness may be related to growth factor expression in saliva. This, in turn, may play a part in the delayed mucosal wound healing observed in depressed individuals. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - Wound healing is a complex biological event orchestrated by various resident and infiltrating cell types spanning multiple stages. Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease released upon wounding, stimulates fibroblasts and macrophages at the sites of wounds to express, chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). We have used cellular and molecular approaches to investigate the mechanisms involved in thrombin induces IL-8 expression in human macrophages. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR show that thrombin stimulates IL-8 in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. Various inhibitors for signal transduction proteins were used to delineate the pathways involved. We found that, at nanomolar concentrations, inhibitors for both c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and NFÉ»B strongly inhibited the thrombin-induced production of IL-8 suggesting that they are major regulators of this stimulation. JNK was shown to be phorsphorylated in a time-dependent manner in response to thrombin treatment confirming its involvement. In order to identify the mediator of JNK and the thrombin receptor, we use affinity pull down and found that Rho GTPase was activated by thrombin suggesting that Rho may be the mediator of JNK activation. In addition, we found that PKC is a negative regulator of thrombin-induced IL-8 expression. Our study broadens the horizon of how IL-8 is regulated in wound healing and may help develop pharmaceutical methods to manipulate this process in pathological conditions.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate the effects of hibernation drugs on early wound sepsis in severely scalded rats. Methods:? Sprague-Dawley rats inflicted 30% TBSA deep thickness were randomly divided into A (immediate resuscitation) and B (immediate resuscitation and lytic cocktail). After infusion of 108?CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wound on third postburn day, survival was compared between two groups. Local tissue samples and plasma were collected and the plasma level of IL-2 mRNA, IL-4 mRNA, IL-10 mRNA, and IFN-? mRNA were assayed by fluorescence PCR. Results:? Compared with Group A, host survival significantly increased (0.663?±?0.026, P?<?0.01), viscera injury decrease in group B after infusion bacteria. The plasma Th1 cytokine mRNA (IL-2, IFN-?) levels in B group were significantly increased compared with A group. However, the plasma Th2 cytokine mRNA (IL-4, IL-10) levels in group B were not as significantly increased as group A. Conclusions:? Immediate resuscitation with hibernation drugs can decrease viscera injury after sepsis, increase host survival and improve host immune system by preventing Th1 cell from over activation and decrease Th2 cytokines.

AB  - Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process that ends with scar formation in adult skin. In contrast, fetal skin within the first and second trimesters of development heals without a scar. One of the most important aspects of scarless fetal wound repair appears to be the lack of inflammation in these wounds, suggesting that acute inflammation can promote scar formation in the skin. While it is well accepted that inflammation causes scar formation in the fetus, it is not known what specific factors produced during inflammation are responsible for these effects. The present experiments tested the possibility that oxidants released by activated inflammatory cells can contribute to scar tissue production by inducing inflammation in the fetus. Using a murine fetal wound repair model we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide increased E15 (embryonic day 15) fibroblast proliferation and ultimately interfered with scarless healing in E15 skin, possibly through the induction of TGF-?1. Defining the factors produced during the inflammatory response that contribute to scar formation could be important for the development of new therapies designed to minimize adult scarring.

AB  - An initiative to bring wound care ?back to the bedside? was introduced in a large teaching hospital. Wound consultation was available from either a nurse or physician member of a hospital-based wound team. Confusion over whom to consult coupled with multiple product options led to decreased critical thinking at the bedside. The volume of consultations precluded follow-up visits by the team, further fragmenting care. The proposed solution included partnering with a sole vendor to standardize wound products and assist with education on product selection and function. New policies and procedures were created. Each patient unit was staffed by a Nurse clinical specialist as part of a hospital-wide ?Magnet? application process. This individual assumed the role of ?skin care leader? and was required to attend two in-depth educational programs. All skin care leaders were required to become part of a hospital-wide quarterly prevalence and incidence project. The wound nurse assumed a more ?consultative? role for the skin care leaders who subsequently assisted the end user in this model; the bedside nurse. This paradigm shift in care did not result in any statistically significant changes in wound incidence and reintroduced skin care as an integral component of the assessment and care for the bedside nurse. This presentation will describe the process in detail. Acknowledgments:? This study was supported with an educational grant from Smith and Nephew, Largo, FL.

AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the importance of diabetes as a major complication of obesity, starting with examining the epidemiological relationship between diabetes and obesity. It is clear from the epidemiological data reported that obesity is strongly associated with onset and, in particular, the premature onset, of type 2 diabetes. However, in established heart disease and heart failure, obesity is associated with lower mortality. The chapter considers the epidemiological evidence linking adiposity with the development of cancer, and describes the proposed mechanisms by which excess body fat may impact on cancer risk. The global prevalence of osteoarthritis continues to rise, both because of an ageing population as well as because of the current obesity epidemic, with obesity in the elderly becoming an increasing problem. The chapter explains individual psychosocial factors and views them as part of a vicious circle, including personal beliefs. The combination of binge eating and obesity is particularly problematic with regard to comorbidity and risk.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemorrhage due to elective or emergency surgery results in significant patient morbidity and mortality and consumption of scarce transfusion resources. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been proposed as a universal hemostatic agent which may be beneficial in reducing blood loss and in treating unexpected massive hemorrhage in surgical patients. In elective surgery, a small number of randomized studies have shown a limited benefit for rFVIIa in the reduction of transfusion requirements. In massive hemorrhage associated with surgery, two case series and a growing number of case reports suggest that rFVIIa is successful as salvage therapy. However, a number of questions remain regarding the optimal dose, the true rate of thromboembolic complications and the overall survival and cost benefit when rFVIIa is used for this indication. In this review, the role of rFVIIa in managing blood loss in surgical patients is assessed in the light of current evidence.

AB  - Abstract The results of the treatment of 43 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (PML) are reported: 27 were treated initially with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), whereas 16 were treated with conventional chemotherapy. All patients received myelosuppressive chemotherapy after the initial treatment. Respectively, the complete remission rate was 92% and 37% (P < 0.01), the 5-day mortality rate was 0% and 44% (P < 0.001), and the 28-day mortality rate was 4% and 44% (P < 0.001). The median disease-free survival was 12 and 1 months (P < 0.01), whereas the 12-month disease-free survival was 50% and 13% (P < 0.01) and the 36-month disease-free survival was 41% and 9% (P < 0.01). Thirteen of the patients treated with ATRA were given the treatment fully as outpatients. ATRA given as initial therapy decreased significantly early mortality in promyelocytic leukemia patients; because some promyelocytic leukemia patients given ATRA as initial therapy can be treated as outpatients, the costs of this treatment modality may be diminished.
