AB  - The treatment of venous ulcers must start with compression and if the ankle brachial index is greater than 0.8 high compression bandages can be applied. Despite edema control, there are a number of venous ulcers that do not heal at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers of greater than 4 weeks duration were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under the 4 layer bandage, Profore for 12 weeks, or until healing. Biopsies were obtained from the ulcer base at week 0 for histology and bacterial burden. Duplicate biopsies for quantitative bacteriology were performed with one submitted whole and the second bisected into superficial and deep components. The paired biopsies were then repeated after a median of 6.5 weeks (range 2 to 12 weeks). The histological specimens were examined by the histopathologist (SR). Inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the superficial, middle and deep segments of the biopsies. Acute infiltrates were identified through the concentration of neutrophils and chronic infiltrates by the presence of lymphocytes. Each biopsy and each segment was graded for infiltrates on a four point semi quantitative score. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There were 12 sets of paired biopsies that were analyzed. There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Analysis of the histology and bacteriology data demonstrated that the presence of a high neutrophilic infiltrate in skin biopsies was associated with high bacterial counts (superficial compartment of the quantitative biopsies) at week 4 and delayed healing (p?=?0.037). In the week 0 biopsy, increased lymphocytic infiltrates within the superficial and middle segments were associated with accelerated healing in the first 4 weeks (p?=?0.26 and 0.09). The nanocrystalline silver dressing has demonstrated an anti-bacterial and permissive but selective anti-inflammatory action allowing lymphocytic infiltrates to increase associated with an accelerated reduction in ulcer size.

AB  - Introduction:? Fibrocytes are a unique bone marrow origin leukocyte subpopulation which display fibroblast-like properties and are antigen-presenting cells that are up-regulated systemically after burn injury. This study investigated their role in FPD of the skin using leukocyte-specific protein-1 (LSP1) specific for fibrocytes in HTS, keloids, and mature scar. Materials and Methods:? Fibrocytes were cultured from PBMC isolated from burn patients and normal individuals. Skin biopsies were taken from burn patients with hypertrophic (3) and mature scar (3) and normal skin (20) as well as patients with keloids (3). Double immunostaining (IHC) with antibodies to LSP1 and to the C-propeptide of type I collagen were performed on cryosections to identify fibrocytes in tissue. Extraction of fibrocytes from keloids, HTS, mature scar, and normal skin allowed quantification of fibrocytes by flow cytometry. Results:? LSP1 was found in both fibrocytes and lymphocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that LSP1 expression was significantly higher in fibrocytes than in lymphocytes obtained from all five patients examined. Fibrocytes in hypertrophic scar were seen as duallabeled spindle-shaped cells. In normal skin, fibrocytes were present in the upper layers of the dermis and <1% of cells extracted, whereas, approximately threefold more fibrocytes were found in HTS and primarily in the papillary dermis. Preliminary data suggests that normal dermis contains 0.51%?±?0.35 fibrocytes, mature scar 0.30%?±?.031, keloids 1.18?±?0.22, and HTS 1.12%. Conclusions:? Fibrocytes are up-regulated systemically after injury and in FPD in skin where they appear to be up-regulated contributing to the development of keloids and hypertrophic scarring. More investigation is required to determine the functional roles of these bone marrow derived cells in fibroproliferative disorders.

AB  - Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising cell resource of osteoprogenitor cells for bone tissue engineering. However, the diverse characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells within the bone marrow of individual subjects require varying treatments to stimulate osteogenic differentiation. Thus, an effective monitoring system is needed to identify the progression of osteogenesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy was used in the present study to monitor osteogenesis of tissue engineering (TE) constructs prepared by human bone MSCs seeded on scaffolds of gelatin sponges. The characteristics of MR images and parameters corresponded to osteogenic progression of TE constructs exposed to differentiation medium, significantly differing from control groups exposed to basic medium. Upon quantification, MR image and parameters correlated well to cell seeding densities and alkaline phosphatase activities of various TE constructs. In conclusion, MR can effectively detect the biochemical cascades of osteogenic differentiation of TE constructs and may be a promising, noninvasive monitoring system to provide three-dimensional information for bone tissue engineering.

AB  - Introduction:? Healing wounds are characterized by high lactate levels. In the past, the shift to an anaerobic energy metabolism was thought to be the main source for increased lactate concentration. Lactate is also generated by leukocytic NADPH-linked oxygenase using oxygen and glucose as one of its substrates, a mechanism called aerobic glycolysis. We hypothesize that hyperbaric oxygen therapy by increasing oxygen availability enhances wound lactate production by aerobic glycolysis. Material and methods:? Four wire mesh wound cylinders (n?=?142) were implanted underneath the dorsal skin in each of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (312?±?11?g). Animals were randomized to two groups: The first group (n?=?18) received 100% oxygen with 2.1 ATA for 90 minutes twice a day for a total of 7 days. The second group (n?=?18) was treated with 21% oxygen with 1 ATA for the same time schedule. Hyperbaric treatments were administered in a hyperbaric chamber designed for small animals. Wound fluid from the cylinders was aspirated between the two treatment cycles at day 2 and 5 and analysed for lactate using a lactate analyser. Additionally, at day 10 (after 2 days of treatment with 21% oxygen in 1 ATA in both groups) lactate concentrations in wound fluid were measured again. Data are expressed as mean?±?SD. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results:? Wound lactate concentration was significantly increased both in control and hyperbaric rats at day 5 and day 10 compared to day 2 (controls 4.5?±?1, 5.9?±?0.8, 6.7?±?1.2?mmol/l; p?=?0.04 and hyperbarics 4.4?±?1.2, 6.5?±?1.3, 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). At day 2 and day 5 there was no significant difference in lactate levels between control and hyperbaric rats. However, at day 10 lactate concentration was significantly higher in the hyperbaric group compared to the control group (6.7?±?1.2 vs. 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). Conclusion:? This investigation provides evidence for the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen action since lactate is known to stimulate collagen production and angiogenesis.

AB  - Background:? Bilayered cell therapy (BLCT) is a significant advancement in the field of wound healing. BLCT expresses multiple growth factors found in normal skin, and provides a biologically active matrix in chronic wounds. Antibiotic-resistant bacterium continues to be a major problem in chronic wounds. The use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents could be one of the first steps in prevention of wound infection, although their use with BLCT is limited due to reported toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Objectives:? This study was designed to see whether a topical antimicrobial agent is able to permeate through the BLCT and inhibits the growth of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin was used because of its lack of toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Methods:? MRSA (ATCC# 33591) strain was used for these studies. The entire surface of blood agar plates were covered with a high inoclum of MRSA. BLCT specimens were placed on the agar plates and mupirocin was then applied on the top surface. As a positive control, mupirocin was applied directly on the agar plate, while BLCT specimens alone were used as negative control. The plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours after which the zones of inhibition were assessed. Results:? Placing mupirocin on top of BLCT gave a 41.9?±?17.2?mm inhibition zone diameter. Although it was smaller than the inhibition zone diameter produced by direct administration of mupirocin (26.3?±?9.4?mm), this difference was not statistically significant. BLCT by itself did not create a zone of inhibition. Conclusion:? Mupirocin is able to permeate BLCT and inhibit the bacterial growth underneath it. This study may have important clinical implications.

AB  - Various matrices containing both synthetic or natural polymers are currently used for local regional drug delivery to a number of disease locations such as chronic cutaneous wounds, joints, bone, muscle, and nerves. Insert Therapeutics has developed a novel synthetic matrix which consists of a copolymer of ?-cyclodextrin and polyethylene-glycol (PEG). Addition of di- or multifunctionalized adamantane-PEG molecules results in noncovalent cross-linking through inclusion complex formation. The resulting hydrogel showed rheological characteristics amenable to topical application or local-regional injection into a variety of tissues (Bellocq et al. (2004) Bioconjug Chem 15(6): 1201?1211). This matrix was shown to be biocompatible, allowing for cellular growth and migration in vitro. It also allowed for efficient delivery of an adenovirus gene therapy vector to dermal fibroblast cells. In vivo, the matrix demonstrated efficient delivery of biotherapeutics such as recombinant adenovirus and non-viral gene therapy vectors after intradermal injection. The matrix was well tolerated and was as efficient as collagen in promoting wound healing when an adenoviral gene therapy vector expressing PDGF-bb was delivered to cutaneous wounds of diabetic mice. The matrix can additionally be modified to incorporate therapeutic small molecules, peptides, or proteins, either through inclusion complex formation or chemical linkage. Using biodegradable linker chemistry, the release rate of covalently attached molecules can be controlled. The cyclodextrin-PEG matrix is therefore an attractive alternative to existing matrices that is biocompatible, biodegradable, tunable with regard to its physicochemical properties, and can be designed to deliver multiple therapeutic agents to a variety of tissues in a controlled fashion.

AB  - Introduction:? Open wounds following oncologic reresection of skin cancer of the hand can be problematic from a soft tissue reconstructive perspective. First, these wounds must often await definitive coverage until permanent negative margin clearance is obtained. This results in the morbidity of chronic painful dressing changes and possible infection. Secondly, for defects of the first web space, the reconstructive options are often limited to skin grafting which can yield functional hazards with contracted healing. Acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold for subsequent skin grafting. Hypothesis:? We proposed to use acellular dermis for wounds stemming from reresection of skin cancers of the first web space to: 1)? obviate dressing changes until permanent histology was confirmed 2)? provide a soft tissue platform that enhances subsequent skin graft take and healing and ameliorates potential graft contracture Methods:? The resected wound area of two patients, 11???5 and 5???4?cm in size, were transiently covered with acellular dermis in the first stage. After confirmation of final histologic clearance of tumor at the margins, split thickness skin graft was placed on the granulating wound bed. Subsequent clinical examination and DASH questionnaires were used to assess outcome. Results:? After 6 months, wounds had healed with good cosmetic result. No contracture of the web space was noted. Average DASH score was 20.5 and no recurrences were noted. Conclusion:? Our observations suggest that acellular dermis is a useful adjunct for covering wounds of the hand, especially for functionally important locations such as the first dorsal web space.

AB  - Background:? Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as an important hospital-acquired pathogen, especially in surgery, burn, and intensive care units. Due to its ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials, wound infection with A. baumannii is difficult to treat, and can lead to septicemia and even death. Use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents in these circumstances could be one of the first steps in prevention of A. baumannii wound infection. Objectives:? In this study, we will discuss the in vitro effects of seven common topical antimicrobial creams and dressings on A. baumannii. Methods:? A. Baumannii ATCC# 6919 was subjected to sensitivity tests against mupirocin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, a double antibiotic combination of polymyxin and bacitracin, a triple antibiotic combination of Neomycin, bacitracin and polymyxin, and two silver-containing dressings. Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 hours incubation period. Results and Conclusion:? Of the evaluated antimicrobial agents, mafenide acetate was the most efficacious followed by mupirocin, triple and double antibiotic combinations in decreasing order. The silver-containing dressings yielded a lesser zone of inhibition as compared to the previously mentioned, and no zone of inhibition was observed using silver sulfadiazine. Further in vivo studies on the effect of antimicrobial agents against A. Baumannii are necessary to substantiate these findings and determine the potential clinical relevance of these therapies.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are major components of the innate defense system that present microbicidal activity against gram positive and negative bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses. The human cathelicidin LL-37 is expressed in skin upon wounding and, in addition to its role in antimicrobial defense, it has also been previously demonstrated that this peptide might be involved in reepithelization. We have generated an adenoviral vector containing the complete sequence of LL-37 along with an Ires-GFP expression cassette. The efficacy of this vector was probed by testing the conditioned medium from adenoviral transduced keratinocytes in preventing bacterial growth. We have studied the in vitro effects of LL-37 on HK migration and proliferation. In addition, we have efficiently transduced human skin grafts (in immunodeficient mice) using an in vivo gene transfer approach and we are currently testing the involvement of this peptide in wound repair.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Cortisol has been shown to impact upon wound healing through its immunosuppressive properties, and its release is modulated by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which is involved in fear and stress reactions. This study assessed the role of the CeA in modulating proinflammatory chemokine expression following wounding, under both stress and nonstress conditions. Bilaterally CeA-lesioned rhesus monkeys and nonoperated controls received separate dermal wounds on 3 consecutive days. Six hours postwounding, tissue biopsies were obtained from each wound. Following this, animals were subjected to 2?h of confinement as a stressor. Thus, examination of tissues on day 1 represented a nonstressed condition, and on days 2?3 a stressed condition. Using real-time PCR, we determined mRNA expression for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] in wounded and unwounded tissue, two chemokines critical in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in response to tissue injury. Analyses revealed that tissue mRNA levels for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] were increased in both groups following wounding. However, these rises were significantly greater in CeA-lesioned animals than controls. Repeated stress (confinement) attenuated these increases in mRNA expression equally in both groups (days 2?3). These results indicate that the inflammatory response to skin wounds is modulated, in part, by the amygdala. However, stress-induced alterations in inflammation are not CeA dependent for this particular stressor. Importantly, this finding indicates that a lesion of a central brain structure can impact upon peripheral wound healing parameters. (Supported by P50 DE-13749, MH46729, MH52354, MH61083)

AB  - Background:? Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important inflammatory mediator, which has been shown to regulate fibroblast chemotaxis and extracellular matrix production through four G-coupled protein receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4). Previous studies have linked abnormal PGE2 signaling with the development of improper damage repair and tissue fibrosis in the airway. This study begins to address the role of PGE2 in dermal fibrosis, particularly keloid formation. Such an analysis is consistent with data indicating inflammatory/immune abnormalities associated with keloids. Hypothesis:? Keloid fibroblasts respond to PGE2 appropriately, but in a quantitatively diminished manner. Methods:? Cultured fibroblasts from normal human skin and keloid lesions were used for these studies. Fibroblast migration was assayed using a well established two dimensional motility assay. Collagen production was analyzed using Western blot and commercial ELISA methodology. Results:? Administration of PGE2 decreased keloid fibroblast migration in a dose-dependent manner, via a mechanism which appears to involve the EP2/EP4-cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway. PGE2 reversed the transforming growth factor ?-1-induced increase in collagen type I in both normal and keloid fibroblasts. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results, which show that the response of keloid fibroblasts to PGE2 is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to normal fibroblasts. PGE2 decreases the rates of migration and collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts, raising the possibility that exogenous PGE2 may have potential therapeutic applications to reduce keloid formation.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, inducing angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis, all processes essential to wound healing. However, the same mediators have been implicated in pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, vascular occlusion, and necrotic tissue damage. We have previously shown that hyperbaric oxygen caused a prolonged elevation of VEGF and delayed wound healing in a rat model of tissue ischemia. In this study we examine the effect of the ROS scavenger, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), on ischemic wound healing. NAC is a virtually nontoxic free radical scavenger that has been used in many experimental studies to block ROS-mediated signaling. Methods:? Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the ischemic flap previously validated by this laboratory. This model provides two ischemic and two nonischemic excisional wounds. Rats were treated daily with HBO for 90 minutes at 2.4?atm, HBO plus 150?mg/kg NAC intraperitoneal, or control (neither HBO nor NAC). Wounds were analyzed for surface area, lactate, and VEGF. Results:? The HBO/NAC-treated animals had markedly impaired healing of their ischemic wounds at day 7 (0.105?±?.005?cm vs. 0.068?±?.002?cm for ctl and 0.064?±?.006 for HBO) and a twofold elevation of VEGF (120?pg/mg protein vs. 60?pg/mg protein). Lactate levels were not altered by NAC treatment and non-ischemic wounds showed no difference in healing, lactate, or VEGF. Conclusion:? Reactive oxygen species are required for wound healing. Our initial hypothesis was that the delay in wound closure with HBO treatment was due to excess ROS and that NAC would improve healing. The finding of elevated VEGF and delayed wound healing in the presence of a potent free radical scavenger suggests that blocking ROS signaling prevents the normal mitogenic response to VEGF. Additional studies to examine the VEGF receptor and tyrosine kinase activation will further elucidate the mechanism of ROS signaling in response to HBO treatment.

AB  - Clinical Problem:? An 89-year-old white male presented to his dermatologist with a pressure ulcer on his left medial foot. He was not a surgical candidate (CHF, pacemaker, edema) and not diabetic. Past Management:? For 2 years the dermatologist provided standard of care therapies treating the wound with regular debridements and Regranex therapy. The wound remained unhealed. At the age of 91 the patient developed osteomyelitis. Antibiotic therapies were initiated. Current Clinical Approach:? In addition to antibiotic therapy the patient agreed to have a continuous supply of oxygen delivered transdermally to the wound at a rate of 3?ml/hour from a device that derived pure oxygen from atmospheric air (EpiFLOSD) as the patient ambulated. 24/7 oxygen therapy was used in conjunction with a fully occlusive Johnson & Johnson 3????4? island dressing. Patient Outcomes:? After 3 weeks of continuous oxygen and antibiotic therapies the patient was able to ambulate without pain. The planned amputation was canceled. The wound bed was characterized by new granulation tissue and reepithelialization. The antibiotic treatment was discontinued after 30 days, but the tiny, 2 ounce oxygen therapy device was continued until full wound closure 11 weeks later. The wound remained closed for 36 months, the remainder of the patient?s life. Conclusions:? The effectiveness of the antibiotics in this patient as well as other oxygen-sensitive wound healing processes may have been potentiated and enhanced by the continuous availability of oxygen at this dosage. Further carefully controlled studies of transdermal sustained oxygen delivery for the treatment of chronic wounds with osteomyelitis are needed to clarify the underlying scientific mechanisms of this beneficial effect. The support of Ogenix Corporation in supplying EpiFLOSD for this project is appreciated.

AB  - We have previously reported that local injection of small doses of long-acting insulin-zinc suspension maintained sufficiently high insulin concentration in the wound fluid and accelerated the healing. The present experiment was to measure the rates of cell proliferation (reflected by DNA synthesis) and protein metabolism in the wound. These are the underlying metabolic processes responsible for the healing. Partial thickness skin donor wound was created on the back and indwelling catheters were placed in the carotid artery and jugular vein in adult rabbits under general anesthesia. The wound was covered with Aquaphor gauze, OpSite membrane, and surgical gauze. On day 7 after wounding, the wound was either injected with 0.2 units of insulin-Zn, Zn alone, or no injection; stable isotopes were infused into the jugular vein catheter in conscious rabbits for measurement of DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and breakdown in the wound. The local insulin-Zn injection raised wound insulin concentration to 168?±?39??U/ml. In contrast, in the control and Zn groups wound insulin concentrations were below the detectable level. The local injection of insulin-Zn suspension increased (p?=?0.03) DNA synthesis in the wound with minor changes in blood glucose concentration which did not require exogenous glucose replacement. In the Zn group, whereas the rate of DNA synthesis tended to increase (p?=?0.051 vs. control), the protein net balance (synthesis ? breakdown) was lower (p?<?0.05) than those in the control and insulin-Zn (Table 1). We conclude that local injection of a small dose (0.2 units insulin) long-acting insulin-Zn suspension stimulated wound DNA synthesis without major systemic side effects thereby providing an effective and safe approach to accelerate wound healing. Although local Zn injection might also stimulate wound DNA synthesis, the benefit on the healing process was limited by decreased net protein deposition. 1 Wound DNA and protein metabolism.

AB  - Impaired wound healing is a problem for immobilized patients, diabetics, and the elderly. The 43 amino acid angiogenic peptide thymosin ?4 has previously been found to promote accelerated dermal wound repair in rats, aged mice and db/db diabetic mice, and corneal repair in normal rats. It has been found in great abundance in wound fluid. Here, we hypothesized that thymosin ?4 may regulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in cells that are involved in wound repair. Western blot analysis of keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts that were treated with increasing concentrations of thymosin ?4 showed changes in the expression of the MMP-1, ?2, and ?9. Zymographic analysis of whole excised mouse wounds taken after homogenization also showed changes in MMP-2 and-9 expression over a 3-day period. These results were confirmed in 2-day-old wounds by RT-PCR. We conclude that part of the wound healing activity of thymosin ?4 resides in its ability to increase protease activity. Since thymosin ?4-induced protease activity can be further controlled by inflammatory cytokines, a regulatory role for thymosin ?4 is proposed in wound healing. These studies suggest that thymosin ?4 may play a pivotal role in extracellular matrix remodeling during wound repair and may be effective in the treatment of chronic wounds in humans.

AB  - Sepsis remains a common and serious complication of major burn injury and currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in burn patients. Burns have been associated with high levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppression which promotes systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, for which no effective treatment is currently available. Defensins and cathelicidins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides, are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in the body?s defense by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. Our prior studies using RT-PCR and fluorescence deconvolution microscopy suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin 2 (HBD2) in burn wounds. In this study we have characterized cathelicidin (LL-37) protein levels using in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns and in unburned skin. Our results show that in unburned skin, the majority of LL-37 was located in the malphigian layer and was concentrated on the stratum corneum as well as colocalized with sweat ducts. In burned skin, in which the epidermis was destroyed, this pattern of LL-37 was absent. The surviving dermal and subcutaneous layers revealed LL-37 presence in very high concentrations colocalized with sweat duct epithelia. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression, and sepsis.

AB  - Diabetic wounds are characterized by disruption of the normal wound repair responses, particularly at the inflammatory and proliferative stages. Inadequate levels of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), play a significant role in the impaired healing of these wounds. PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemotactic agent, and is released from platelet alpha-granules during the acute inflammatory phase of wound healing. It has been shown to promote the deposition of collagen and granulation tissue, and improves healing in diabetic animals. Although previous studies have shown some success with topically applied PDGF, results in clinical practice have been moderate. In this study, we investigated whether gene therapy with lentiviral vectors carrying the gene for PDGF can improve wound healing in an animal model. Full thickness 2?cm???2?cm dermal wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vectors containing the human PDGF-beta gene (lenti-PDGF) were injected into the wound margins and along the wound base. Control experiments were performed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections. Mice were sacrificed after 21 days, and wound tissues were harvested for histological analyses. Lenti-PDGF-treated animals demonstrated significantly smaller residual epithelial gaps compared to PBS controls (0.77 +/? 0.07?cm vs. 1.22 +/? 0.30?cm; P?<?0.001), as well as a greater degree of wound closure (85 +/? 3% vs. 57 +/? 22%; P?<?0.05). Lentiviral gene therapy with PDGF is effective in promoting wound healing in genetically diabetic animals, and warrants further investigation.
