AB  - Abstract The incidence of stroke and dementia are diverging across the world, rising for those in low- and middle-income countries and falling in those in high-income countries. This suggests that whatever factors cause these trends are potentially modifiable. At the population level, neurological disorders as a group account for the largest proportion of disability-adjusted life years globally (10%). Among neurological disorders, stroke (42%) and dementia (10%) dominate. Stroke and dementia confer risks for each other and share some of the same, largely modifiable, risk and protective factors. In principle, 90% of strokes and 35% of dementias have been estimated to be preventable. Because a stroke doubles the chance of developing dementia and stroke is more common than dementia, more than a third of dementias could be prevented by preventing stroke. Developments at the pathological, pathophysiological, and clinical level also point to new directions. Growing understanding of brain pathophysiology has unveiled the reciprocal interaction of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration identifying new therapeutic targets to include protection of the endothelium, the blood-brain barrier, and other components of the neurovascular unit. In addition, targeting amyloid angiopathy aspects of inflammation and genetic manipulation hold new testable promise. In the meantime, accumulating evidence suggests that whole populations experiencing improved education, and lower vascular risk factor profiles (e.g., reduced prevalence of smoking) and vascular disease, including stroke, have better cognitive function and lower dementia rates. At the individual levels, trials have demonstrated that anticoagulation of atrial fibrillation can reduce the risk of dementia by 48% and that systolic blood pressure lower than 140 mmHg may be better for the brain. Based on these considerations, the World Stroke Organization has issued a proclamation, endorsed by all the major international organizations focused on global brain and cardiovascular health, calling for the joint prevention of stroke and dementia. This article summarizes the evidence for translation into action.

AB  - Summary Focal cerebral ischemia, caused by a sudden occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel or sometimes just by low blood flow, initiates a series of events which can lead to irreversible neuronal damage and death (i.e. infarction) in the part of the brain supplied or drained by that vessel. Several pathophysiological cascades run in sequence (and in parallel). In the vascular system, rapid changes in platelet and coagulation factors, the vessel wall (particularly the endothelium) and in the thrombus itself interact to produce a very dynamic state, not only at the site of vessel occlusion, but also more remotely, in both the macro- and microcirculation. In brain tissue, changes occur in neurons, glial cells, and other structural components in differing degrees and at different times after the onset of ischemia, which means that cerebral infarction is a dynamic and highly unstable process, not a discrete ?one-off? event. In other words, infarction is not an ?all-or-nothing? episode which is instantaneous in onset, maximal in severity at the moment of onset, and irreversibly complete within 6 hours. This chapter begins with a review of pathophysiology, particularly aspects which relate to the specific treatments that are described later in the chapter. As far as possible, we base the decision whether or not to use a particular treatment, not merely on its putative physiological effects, but on the evidence from randomized controlled trials in patients which demonstrate the balance of clinical risk and benefit associated with its use. In view of this, the section on each of the specific treatments will assess the strength of evidence available and, where possible, base any recommendations on the results of a systematic review (and meta-analysis) of all the relevant randomized controlled trials of that particular treatment.

AB  - Summary Anticoagulant therapy in obstetrics and gynecology is required in the management of venous thromboembolism, in women with mechanical heart valve replacement, thrombophilia, after prolonged surgeries and malignancies. Without anticoagulation therapy, these conditions carry a high morbidity and mortality. Management includes early mobilization, graduated compression stockings low dose heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression pumps. The most effective tools are thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, warfarin or fondaparinux. The later agents are associated with higher risk of bleeding, cost and more laboratory monitoring. This chapter gives an overview of anticoagulant therapy in obstetrics and gynecology.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews therapeutic phlebotomy and specialized apheresis procedures that target, for processing, specific fractions of the plasma or cellular compartment of the blood. Therapeutic red cell exchange can be performed manually or with programmable automated blood-processing (apheresis) instruments. Clinical studies related to transfusion management of sickle cell disease (SCD) focuses on simple transfusion or manual exchange transfusion. In clinical practice, therapeutic phlebotomy is an evidence-based intervention for disorders such as polycythemia vera and hemochromatosis. The chapter provides diagnostic elements of hereditary hemochromatosis. Thrombocytosis with thromboembolic complications is a feature common to chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP or photopheresis) describes a procedure in which circulating mononuclear cells are collected by centrifugal apheresis. Immunoadsorption systems employ the principle of affinity chromatography and make use of immobilized sorbents or ligands that have enhanced or specific binding affinity for a specific antigen, antibody, immune complex, or other substance in the patient's circulation.
