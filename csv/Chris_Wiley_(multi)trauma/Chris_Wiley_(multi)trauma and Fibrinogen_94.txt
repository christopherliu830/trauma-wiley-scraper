AB  - Abstract Failure of soft tissue implants has been largely attributed to the influence of biomaterial surface properties on the foreign body response, but some implant complications, e.g. macrophage accumulation and necrosis, are still not effectively addressed with surface treatments to minimize deleterious biomaterial effects. We explored an alternative explanation for implant failure, linking biocompatibility with implant micromotion-induced pressure fluctuations at the tissue?biomaterial interface. For this purpose, we used a custom in vitro system to characterize the effects of pressure fluctuations on the activity of macrophages, the predominant cells at a healing implant site. Initially, we quantified superoxide production by HL60-derived macrophage-like cells under several different pressure regimes with means of 5?40 mmHg, amplitudes of 0?15 mmHg and frequencies of 0?1.5 Hz. All pressure regimes tested elicited significantly (p?<?0.05) reduced superoxide production by macrophage-like cells relative to parallel controls. Notably, pressure-sensitive reductions in superoxide release correlated (r2?=?0.74; p?<?0.01) only with pulse pressures. Based on the connection between superoxide production and cell viability, we also explored the influence of cyclic pressure on macrophage numbers and death. Compared to controls, adherent macrophage-like cells exposed to 7.5/2.5 mmHg cyclic pressures for 6 h exhibited significantly (p?<?0.01) reduced cell numbers, independent of cell death. A similar effect was observed for cells treated with 10 U/ml superoxide dismutase. Collectively, our results suggest that pressure pulses are a putative regulator of macrophage adhesion via a superoxide-related effect. Pressure fluctuations, e.g. due to implant micromotion, may, therefore, potentially modulate macrophage-dependent wound healing. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The tenascin-X (TNX) deficient type Ehlers?Danlos syndrome (EDS) is similar to the classical type of EDS. Because of the limited awareness among geneticists and the challenge of the molecular analysis of the TNXB gene, the TNX-deficient type EDS is probably to be under diagnosed. We therefore performed an observational, cross-sectional study. History and physical examination were performed. Results of serum TNX measurements were collected and mutation analysis was performed by a combination of next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Included were 17 patients of 11 families with autosomal recessive inheritance and childhood onset. All patients had hyperextensible skin without atrophic scarring. Hypermobility of the joints was observed in 16 of 17 patients. Deformities of the hands and feet were observed frequently. TNX serum level was tested and absent in 11 patients (seven families). Genetic testing was performed in all families; 12 different mutations were detected, most of which are suspected to lead to non-sense mRNA mediated decay. In short, patients with the TNX-deficient type EDS typically have generalized joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and easy bruising. In contrast to the classical type, the inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive and atrophic scarring is absent. Molecular analysis of TNXB in a diagnostic setting is challenging.

AB  - Summary This chapter includes HGNC entries for proteins that are expressed on the cell surface, namely receptors for different ligand classes, transporters and ion channels. Targets for existing drugs are strongly over-represented in this group; for example, approximately 40% of current medicines affect G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and hundreds of these molecules are listed with annotations that indicate pharmaceutical potential. The chapter also discusses targets that involve protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions. These are cytokines and their receptors, adhesion molecules and host defence molecules; the allocation of entries in these three sections is less clear-cut than with the GPCRs. The last group of entries that is discussed is the transporters and channels. The ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier families are not only primary therapeutic targets but also contain proteins that contribute to drug resistance.

AB  - The gradual accumulation of collagen and associated proteins of the extracellular matrix is a crucial myopathological parameter of many neuromuscular disorders. Progressive tissue damage and fibrosis play a key pathobiochemical role in the dysregulation of contractile functions and often correlates with poor motor outcome in muscular dystrophies. Following a brief introduction into the role of the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscles, we review here the proteomic profiling of myofibrosis and its intrinsic role in X-linked muscular dystrophy. Although Duchenne muscular dystrophy is primarily a disease of the membrane cytoskeleton, one of its most striking histopathological features is a hyperactive connective tissue and tissue scarring. We outline the identification of novel factors involved in the modulation of the extracellular matrix in muscular dystrophy, such as matricellular proteins. The establishment of novel proteomic markers will be helpful in improving the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy monitoring in relation to fibrotic substitution of contractile tissue. In the future, the prevention of fibrosis will be crucial for providing optimum conditions to apply novel pharmacological treatments, as well as establish cell-based approaches or gene therapeutic interventions. The elimination of secondary abnormalities in the matrisome promises to reduce tissue scarring and the loss of skeletal muscle elasticity.

AB  - Summary Two detailed reviews of the management of neonatal thrombosis were published in 2012; one was an up-dated version of guidance first issued in 2004 and the other was a comprehensive review. Both of these publications gave very similar advice regarding the practical aspects of the indications, dosage and management of antithrombotic therapy. The authors stated that the evidence supporting most of their recommendations for anti-thrombotic therapy in neonates remained weak and so the therapy for a neonate with a thrombosis has to be based on an individualized assessment of estimated risk versus potential benefit. The aim of this present review is to give the treating physician an outline of the unique physiology of neonatal coagulation and how this affects the monitoring, dosing and even the choice of therapeutic strategy for the management of thrombosis in the neonate.
