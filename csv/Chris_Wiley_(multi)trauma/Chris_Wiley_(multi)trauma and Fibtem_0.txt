AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Background? A balanced transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets are recommended for massively bleeding trauma patients. Fibrinogen concentrates could potentially lessen or replace the need for FFP and/or platelet transfusions. Aim? To provide a review of the literature covering the application of fibrinogen concentrates in trauma care. Methods? PubMed and Cochrane database search: fibrinogen and (concentrate or trauma), not congenital, published between 2000 and 2012. Results? Six papers were identified. None were randomized controlled trials. The main conclusion of these papers was that administration of fibrinogen sometimes together with prothrombin complex concentrate might improve haemostasis in trauma patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Data regarding the effect of fibrinogen concentrate together with a more physiological resuscitation fluid, i.e. FFP, or as the only intervention in bleeding trauma patients is lacking. Conclusions? Evidence for the use of fibrinogen concentrate to trauma patients with massive bleeding is sparse, of poor quality and confined to patients resuscitated with synthetic colloids. Well-designed prospective, randomized, double-blinded studies evaluating the effect of fibrinogen concentrate, as the only intervention, are urgently needed.

AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.

AB  - Summary Over the past 12?years, the United Kingdom Defence Medical Services have evolved an integrated ?damage control resuscitation ? damage control surgery? sequence for the management of patients sustaining complex injuries. During 2009, over 3200?units of blood products were administered as massive transfusions to severely injured UK personnel. An important part of the approach to traumatic bleeding is the early, empirical use of predefined ratios of blood and clotting products. As soon as control of bleeding is achieved, current practice is to switch towards a tailored transfusion, based on clinical and laboratory assessments, including point-of-care coagulation testing. A key goal is to provide resuscitation seamlessly throughout surgery, so that patients leave the operating room with their normal physiology restored. This article outlines the current management of haemorrhage and coagulation employed in Afghanistan from the point of wounding to transfer back to the National Health Service.

AB  - Summary Thromboelastometry point-of-care coagulation testing facilitates optimised management of bleeding. Previous thromboelastometry systems required the blood sample and liquid reagents to be pipetted in several manual steps by trained personnel. The ROTEMsigma coagulation analyser is a fully automated point-of-care device. We aimed to assess the reference ranges of the new device and to compare the results with those of the predecessor device, the ROTEMdelta. We took blood from healthy volunteers and from hyper- or hypocoagulable patients; blood samples from healthy volunteers served to determine reference ranges for the most important parameters for the ROTEMsigma: CTEXTEM 48?61 s; A5EXTEM 30?51 mm; MCFEXTEM 54?70 mm; CTINTEM 138?174 s; MCFINTEM 51?67 mm and MCFFIBTEM 5?24 mm. We then used blood samples from patients to compare the results obtained between the old and the new device. We found a strong correlation between the same tests performed on two ROTEMsigma devices and between the ROTEMsigma and the ROTEMdelta with respect to the determination of thromboelastometry parameters of hyper- and hypocoagulable patients (all p < 0.001 and R > 0.8). Performance evaluation for the ROTEMsigma device showed very high precision (R > 0.99, p < 0.001). Our reference ranges can serve as an important aid for other hospitals using this new device.

AB  - Summary We report four years of observational data from a large UK hospital and tertiary referral unit, following the introduction of a rotational thromboelastometry-guided algorithm for treatment of coagulopathy in major obstetric haemorrhage. Fibrinogen concentrate was used to treat acquired hypofibrinogenaemia as defined by a FibTEM A5 value of < 7 mm, or 7?12 mm with ongoing or high risk of haemorrhage. Of 32,647 deliveries over 4 years, 893 (2.7%) women had an estimated blood loss ≥ 1500 ml. Two-hundred and three (23%) of these had a FibTEM A5 ≤ 12 mm and 110 received fibrinogen concentrate. We compared clinical outcomes and blood product use with 52 patients who met the same criteria, over a 12-month pre-intervention period during which shock packs were used. In the algorithm group, there was a significant reduction in the number of units (p < 0.0001) and total volume (p = 0.0007) of blood products transfused, with a reduction in transfusion-associated circulatory overload (p = 0.002). Women with placental abruption exhibited more severe coagulopathy and required higher doses of fibrinogen concentrate than women who bled due to other causes. Analysis of rotational thromboelastometry results demonstrated that coagulopathy is not observed in all women who suffer obstetric haemorrhage and cannot be predicted solely by blood loss. Therefore, formulaic treatment with blood products is not justified. When coagulopathy does occur, it appears to be multifactorial and can be severe. Point-of-care testing allows early identification and individualised treatment of coagulopathy. This is supported by the improved outcomes reported.

AB  - Summary The past few decades have seen major advances in multidisciplinary obstetric care and management of gynecological conditions in women with bleeding disorders. Awareness of the impact of bleeding disorders has improved among the obstetric and gynecological community. Undiagnosed bleeding disorders can be the underlying cause for a significant proportion of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. They may also be the cause or a contributory factor for other gynecological problems, such as dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, and endometriosis. Hemostatic assessment should be considered in women referred for menstrual abnormalities if they have a positive bleeding history as quantified by bleeding assessment tools. The reproductive choices and options for prenatal diagnosis are also expanding for families with hemophilia with a drive toward achieving a non-invasive approach. Current non-invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques are limited to identification of fetal gender. Research is ongoing to overcome the specific diagnostic challenges of identifying hemophilia mutations, utilizing free fetal DNA circulating in maternal plasma. The management of obstetric hemorrhage has recently evolved to include a greater focus on the identification of and early treatment for coagulation disorders. Deficiencies in certain hemostatic variables are associated with progression to more severe bleeding; therefore, specific interventions have been proposed to target this. Evidence is still lacking to support such strategy, and future research is required to assess the efficacy and the safety of these hemostatic interventions in women with persistent PPH.

AB  - Summary.? An obstetric hemorrhage may occur before or after delivery, but more than 80% of cases occur postpartum. Worldwide, a massive obstetric hemorrhage, resulting from the failure of normal obstetrical, surgical and/or systemic hemostasis, is responsible for 25% of the estimated 358?000 maternal deaths each year. Most women will not have identifiable risk factors. Nonetheless, primary prevention of a postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) begins with an assessment of identifiable risk factors. Women identified as being at high risk of a PPH should be delivered in a center with access to adequately trained staff and an onsite blood bank. A critical feature of a massive hemorrhage in obstetrics is the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which, in contrast to DIC that develops with hemorrhage from surgery or trauma, is frequently an early feature. Data from clinical trials to guide management of transfusion in PPH are lacking. There are likely to be similarities in the management of transfusion in severe PPH to that of major bleeding in other clinical situations, but the pathophysiological processes that contribute to a massive PPH may necessitate different transfusion strategies such as the ratio of red blood cells to plasma components, in particular fibrinogen. Caution should be exercised when considering the appropriate place for recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in the management of a major PPH. An early hysterectomy is recommended for severe bleeding as a result of placenta accreta or uterine rupture. However, in women with uterine atony who have ongoing bleeding in spite of an adequate transfusion, it may be reasonable to consider a trial of rFVIIa before a hysterectomy.

AB  - Summary Thromboelastography (TEG) was first described by Hartert in 1948, and was designed to monitor viscoelastic clot strength in whole blood in real time. The current TEG method and Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were subsequently developed from the original principles. Both of the modern methods provide data by measuring changes in the viscoelastic strength of a small sample of clotting blood in response to a constant rotational force. The important advantage of these techniques is to visually observe and quantify blood coagulation including the propagation, stabilization and dissolution phases of clot formation under low shear conditions. Analysis of the results provides detailed kinetic data on fibrin generation, clot strength and fibrinolysis. These TEG/ROTEM analyses therefore enable evaluation of global clotting function and the monitoring of haemostatic treatment in various clinical situations, not only in patients with genetic bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia, but also in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, liver transplantation or suffering from traumatic injury. Some evidence suggests that haemostatic management using TEG/ROTEM leads to a reduction in total transfusions of whole blood or clotting factors. Wider clinical application of this technology seems likely.

AB  - Summary Hellmut Hartert was the first person to exploit the viscoelastic properties of clotting blood to measure blood coagulation in 1948. Since then, the technology has improved, allowing these analyses to be performed as point-of-care tests with immediately-available results. The addition of several activators and inhibitors to the original assay creates a panel of tests able to quantify the different aspects of blood clotting that can rival conventional laboratory assays. However, although much progress has been made, the standardization and validation of these tests still need improvement. Viscoelastic analyses of blood coagulation are mainly used to guide haemostatic therapy in bleeding patients and have proven superior to standard clotting tests in some circumstances. There is potential to extend their use to other areas, such as drug monitoring, and diagnosis and management of congenital bleeding disorders. The forthcoming cartridge-based assays are expected to improve the reliability and usability of viscoelastic assays of blood coagulation but high quality clinical trials remain urgently needed to determine their exact place, benefit and cost effectiveness.

AB  - Summary The pathophysiology of bleeding, regardless of cause, is complex and ill understood. For traumatic or sudden unexpected haemorrhage, the use of transfusion packs with red cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets being given in ratios of between 1:1 and 1:3 seems reasonable. This removes the requirement for ?wait and see tests? and should be part of an overall resuscitation and stabilisation plan that may improve outcome following sudden haemorrhage. The replacement of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate with low-volume, targeted concentrates is attractive. There is increasing evidence for the efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrates as a single agent. The combination of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates could be powerful and has the possibility to the management of bleeding and improve outcome in patients but, as yet, remains unproven.

AB  - Abstract Background Postpartum hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening albeit preventable condition that persists as a leading cause of maternal death. Identification of safe and cost-effective hemostatic treatment options remains crucial as a supplement to surgery and uterotonic agents. Objective This review summarizes the background, current evidence and recommendations with regard to the role of fibrinogen, tranexamic acid, prothrombin complex concentrate, desmopressin, and recombinant factor VIIa in the treatment of patients with postpartum hemorrhage. The benefits and evidence behind traditional standard laboratory tests and viscoelastic hemostatic assays, i.e. thromboelastography TEG? and thromboelastometry ROTEM?, are discussed. In addition we assess and elaborate on the current paradigm and evidence for transfusion of these patients. Data sources Publications between 1994 and 2014 were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and ClinicalTrial.gov. Results Viscoelastic hemostatic assays were found to provide a real-time continuum of coagulation and fibrinolysis when introduced as a supplement in transfusion management of postpartum hemorrhage. Fibrinogen should be considered when hypofibrinogenemia is identified. Early administration of 1?2 g tranexamic acid is recommended, followed by an additional dose in cases of ongoing bleeding. Uncontrolled hemorrhage requires early balanced transfusion. Conclusion Despite the lack of conclusive evidence for optimal hemostatic resuscitation in postpartum hemorrhage, the use of viscoelastic hemostatic assays, fibrinogen, tranexamic acid and balanced transfusion therapy may prove to be potentially pivotal in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.

AB  - Summary Despite current recommendations on the management of severe peri-operative bleeding, there is no pragmatic guidance for the peri-operative monitoring and management of cardiac surgical patients taking direct oral anticoagulants. Members of the Transfusion and Haemostasis Subcommittee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology, of their own volition, performed an independent systematic review of peer-reviewed original research, review articles and case reports and developed the following consensus statement. This has been endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology. In our opinion, most patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy presenting for elective cardiac surgery can be safely managed in the peri-operative period if the following conditions are fulfilled: direct oral anticoagulants have been discontinued two days before cardiac surgery, corresponding to five elimination half-live periods; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or a high risk of bleeding, a pre-operative plasma level of direct oral anticoagulants has been determined and found to be below 30 ng.ml?1 (currently only valid for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban). In cases where plasma level monitoring is not possible (e.g. assay was not available), discontinuation for 10 elimination half-live periods (four days) is required. For FXa inhibitors, a standard heparin-calibrated anti-Xa level of < 0.1 IU.ml?1 should be measured, indicating sufficient reduction in the anticoagulant effect. Finally, short-term bridging with heparin is not required in the pre-operative period.

AB  - Abstract Preclinical Research Point of Care testing in the perioperative arena is a high priority topic, specifically in cardiac surgery where a majority of perioperative blood transfusions occur. Platelet function in particular is of interest in cardiac surgery as cardiopulmonary bypass itself creates known platelet dysfunction, but also because more and more patients are on antiplatelet agents due to coronary stenting procedures. This review will focus on presenting current data relating to platelet function in the perioperative setting, along with a brief review of general coagulation concepts.
