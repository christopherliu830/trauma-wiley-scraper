AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury is a worldwide health issue and a significant cause of preventable deaths and disabilities. We aimed to describe population-based data on intensive care treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland over 15 years period. Methods Retrospective review of all intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury at The National University Hospital of Iceland 1999?2013. Data were collected on demographics, mechanism of injury, alcohol consumption, glasgow come scale upon admission, Injury Severity Scoring, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, length of stay, interventions and mortality (defined as glasgow outcome score one). All computerized tomography scans were reviewed for Marshall score classification. Results Intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury were 583. The incidence decreased significantly from 14/100.000/year to 12/100.000/year. Males were 72% and the mean age was 41 year. Majority of patients (42%) had severe traumatic brain injury. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from low heights (36.3%). The mortality was 18.2%. Increasing age, injury severity score, Marshall score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score are all independent risk factors for death. Glasgow coma scale was not an independent prognostic factor for outcome. Conclusions Incidence decreased with a shift in injury mechanism from road traffic accidents to falls and an increased rate of traumatic brain injury in older patients following a fall from standing or low heights. Mortality was higher in older patients falling from low heights than in younger patients suffering multiple injuries in road traffic accidents. Age, injury severity score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and Marshall score are good prognostic factors for outcome. Traumatic brain injury continues to be a considerable problem and the increase in severe traumatic brain injury in the middle age and older age groups after a seemingly innocent accident needs a special attention.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to determine those factors which contribute to a poor outcome and to propose a management plan that is complementary to trauma systems in common use. Methods: A prospective study of 110 consecutive patients with moderate head injury (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 9?13) was carried out. Results: A total of 75% of the patients sustained multisystem trauma, generally of minor or moderate grade according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However, the death rate increased with the severity of the injury as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The initial cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was abnormal in 61% and no patient with a normal scan developed a delayed intracranial haematoma or neurological worsening. Those patients who developed a delayed intracerebral haematoma had a worse outcome. Sixteen patients underwent craniotomy for haematoma. The intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured selectively in 20 patients and exceeded 20 mmHg in half, requiring treatment. Nine patients died, four as a result of head injury and all those had an intracranial haematoma. As a group, those who died were older and had a higher ISS. Conclusions: A plan for care of patients with moderate head injury is proposed, complementary to the Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) protocol and the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia guidelines for neurotrauma management in rural and remote locations.

AB  - Background: Severe truncal multi trauma patients often develop coagulopathy, acidosis and hypothermia that makes major reparative trauma surgery dangerous. It was aimed to try to develop physiological indicators that would predict a poor outcome when conventional reparative surgery was applied. These indicators may help in the decision to switch from conventional reparative surgery to surgery limited to the control of major haemorrhage or organ disruption: so-called ?damage-control? surgery. Method: A retrospective review was conducted of 40 patients with severe multivisceral trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 35) who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Waikato Hospital and who underwent conventional reparative surgery. Results: Survival was strongly associated with base deficit (BD), core temperature and ISS. Using multiple logistic regression on these indices, outcome could be predicted with 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 92%, positive predictive value for death = 96%). Either severe hypothermia (< 33°C) or severe acidosis (BD > 12 mEq/L), or a combination of moderate core temperature < 35.5°C, and a BD of > 5 mEq/L were strong predictors of death if conventional reparative surgery was practised. Conclusions: At the abovementioned levels of physiological compromise, patient survival after conventional trauma surgery can be predicted to be very unlikely. Damage-control measures would be worth attempting.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To develop a scoring system model that predicts mortality within 30?days of admission of patients older than 80?years admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING A total of 306 ICUs from 24 European countries. PARTICIPANTS Older adults admitted to European ICUs (N?=?3730; median age?=?84?years [interquartile range?=?81-87 y]; 51.8% male). MEASUREMENTS Overall, 24 variables available during ICU admission were included as potential predictive variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Model sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS The 30-day-mortality was 1562 (41.9%). In multivariable analysis, these variables were selected as independent predictors of mortality: age, sex, ICU admission diagnosis, Clinical Frailty Scale, Sequential Organ Failure Score, invasive mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. The discrimination, accuracy, and calibration of the model were good: the area under the curve for a score of 10 or higher was .80, and the Brier score was .18. At a cut point of 10 or higher (75% of all patients), the model predicts 30-day mortality in 91.1% of all patients who die. CONCLUSION A predictive model of cumulative events predicts 30-day mortality in patients older than 80?years admitted to ICUs. Future studies should include other potential predictor variables including functional status, presence of advance care plans, and assessment of each patient's decision-making capacity.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience with the retrievable Cook Celect inferior vena cava (IVC) filter (William Cook, Europe) with regard to insertion, efficiency, ease of retrieval, and any associated complications. A retrospective review was performed of 115 patients (41 female, 74 male, mean age 47.97?years) who underwent Cook Celect IVC filter insertion between December 2005 and October 2007. Filter insertion was successful in all patients. Of the 115 filters inserted, 57 have been successfully retrieved (49.6%) to date. The successful retrieval rate from attempted retrieval was 93.4%. The mean dwell time of successfully retrieved filters was 114.9?days (range 14?267?days). Failed retrievals were due to a thrombosed vena cava (n?=?1) and endothelialisation of the filter (n?=?3). In the failed retrieval group the mean implantation time was 142?days (range 78?211?days). While this is the first retrospective clinical study on the Cook Celect filter, results to date are promising. We demonstrated an efficacious filter with a high successful retrieval rate of 93.4% and a low complication rate. The filter was assessed with extended dwell times (range 14?267?days). Failed retrieval secondary to hook endothelialisation continues to be an issue with this filter. We recognize that a limitation of our study was the lack of systematic follow-up for clinically silent complications. Further studies to evaluate longer term outcomes and effectiveness of this filter are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Background Early medical and surgical intervention in acute spinal cord injuries can improve long-term functional outcomes. This study aims to observe the effects of the New Zealand (NZ) Spinal Cord Impairment Action Plan on timing to acute decompression and comparing this to the period prior to the policy change. Method Data were collected in the form a retrospective audit from medical records of 12 patients admitted to Middlemore Hospital from 2010 to 2013 prior to the NZ Spinal Cord Impairment Action Plan, and 11 patients from 2014 to 2015 following the policy change. Time of decompression is defined as either closed reduction or open reduction plus decompression. Patients were transferred from an initial regional hospital to Middlemore Hospital or directly to Middlemore Hospital following injury. Important time points were compared before and after the NZ Spinal Cord Impairment Action Plan. Results Cox regression modelling was used to compare statistical data. Following the regional policy change, patients had a shorter time of transfer between hospitals, pre-surgical work up, and hence shorter time to decompression. The mean time of injury to decompression before the policy change is 57.8 and 24.9 h after. Conclusion Since implementing the NZ Spinal Cord Impairment Action Plan, time to decompression has been significantly reduced compared with the same group prior.

AB  - Abstract Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increases the risk of mortality in trauma patients. To decrease the occurrence of VTE, low dose anticoagulants are commonly prescribed. This may be unacceptable in trauma patients who have a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be employed as an alternative strategy to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Insertion of an IVC filter is an invasive procedure that has a range of complications. The benefits of IVC filter insertion must be compared to its risk of complications in each individual patient. A search of the literature since 2005 was conducted on MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The clinical question posed was does prophylactic IVC filter insertion decrease the risk of PE in trauma patients? The available evidence was low level and unable to definitively answer this question. The majority of articles infer that IVC filter insertion is safe and may decrease the risk of PE. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to be conducted in this area.

AB  - Summary Low donor supply and the high demand for transplantable organs is an international problem. The efficiency of organ procurement is often expressed by donor conversion rates (DCRs). These rates differ among countries, but a uniform starting point for defining a potential heart-beating donor is lacking. Imprecise definitions cause confusion; therefore, we call for a reproducible method like imminent brain death (IBD), which contains criteria in detail to determine potential heart-beating donors. Medical charts of 4814 patients who died on an ICU in Dutch university hospitals between January 2007 and December 2009 were reviewed for potential heart-beating donors. We compared two starting points: ?Severe Brain Damage? (SBD) (old definition) and IBD (new definition), which differ in the number of absent brainstem reflexes. Of the potential donors defined by IBD 45.6% fulfilled the formal brain death criteria, compared with 33.6% in the larger SBD group. This results in a higher DCR in the IBD group (40% vs. 29.5%). We illustrated important differences in DCRs when using two different definitions, even within one country. To allow comparison among countries and hospitals, one universal definition of a potential heart-beating donor should be used. Therefore, we propose the use of IBD.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To review emergency sedation intubation as practised in the Melbourne-based ambulance helicopter. Specifically, to describe patient profiles, drug dosage, difficulties encountered, success rate and patient outcomes. Methods: Retrospective review of all helicopter primary and secondary retrieval patients, who received application of the emergency sedation intubation protocol using morphine and diazepam during a 3 year period (January 1995 to December 1997). Data were collected from an audit of patient care records completed by flight paramedics and from hospital records. Results: Emergency sedation intubation was performed on 128 patients: 103 adults and 25 children. The median dose of drugs required for emergency sedation intubation by adult patients was 20 mg morphine and 20 mg diazepam. The overall success rate for emergency sedation intubation was 94.5%, with 73.6% of these being successful intubations at the first attempt. On intubation, 54.1% of patients were fully relaxed, while a gag reflex was still present in 45.9% of patients during or just after emergency sedation intubation. Twenty-two per cent of patients had a change in blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg. The maximum rise in blood pressure was 60 mmHg and the maximum fall was 80 mmHg. Conclusions: Flight paramedics achieved a high success rate for intubation with the morphine/ diazepam emergency sedation intubation protocol. However, there was still a significant percentage of patients for whom more than one attempt was required to achieve emergency sedation intubation and, in almost half the patients, gag reflexes remained present either during or immediately after intubation. Additionally, some patients experienced blood pressure changes following intubation that may have potential adverse consequences in terms of compromised cerebral perfusion or rises in intracranial pressure. Consideration should be given to revision of the protocol to allow the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and alternative airway management techniques, such as cricothyroidotomy, for specified circumstances in the aeromedical environment.

AB  - Objective To detail the 9-year experience of renal trauma at a modern Level 1 trauma centre and report on patterns of injury, management and complications. Patients and methods We analysed 338 patients with renal injuries who presented to our institution over a 9-year period. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, management and complications were recorded. Results Males comprised 74.9% of patients with renal injuries and the highest incidence was amongst those aged 20?24 years. Blunt injuries comprised 96.2% (n = 325) of all the renal injuries, with road trauma being the predominant mechanism accounting for 72.5% of injuries. The distribution of injury grade was; 21.6% grade 1 (n = 73), 24.3% grade 2 (n = 82), 24.9% grade 3 (n = 84), 16.6% grade 4 (n = 56), and 12.7% grade 5 (n = 43). Conservative management was successful in all grade 1 and 2 renal injuries, and 94.9%, 90.7% and 35.1% of grade 3, 4 and 5 injuries respectively. All but one of the 13 patients with penetrating injuries were successfully managed conservatively. Conclusions Road trauma is the greatest cause of renal injury. Most haemodynamically stable patients are successfully managed conservatively.

Young adults are over-represented in this patient group, with the highest economic impact due to years of productive life lost. Regional trauma system planning as well as specific, organised, in-hospital trauma team responses are required to ensure that experienced reception, investigation, decision-making and intervention are both timely and optimised. Trauma guidelines and protocols are the best means of ensuring a thorough and safe approach to injured patients overall, although none of these can function as an alternative to the on-site presence of a clinician with surgical experience. In total, all these approaches are essential for minimising avoidable in-hospital deaths and morbidity in severely injured patients.

Acta Neurol Scand: 2010: 122 (Suppl. 190): 51?57. ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objective??? To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.
