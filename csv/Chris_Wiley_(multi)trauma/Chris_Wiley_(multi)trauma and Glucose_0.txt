AB  - Abstract Background Functional recovery is an important outcome for those who survive critical illness. The present study aimed to assess nutrition provision and nutrition-related outcomes in a multi-trauma cohort following intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Methods The present study investigated a prospective cohort of patients discharged from an ICU, who had been admitted because of major trauma and required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h. Nutrition-related outcomes, including body weight, quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT), handgrip strength and subjective global assessment, were recorded on ICU discharge, days 5?7 post-ICU discharge and then weekly until hospital discharge. Nutrition intake was recorded for 5 days post-ICU discharge. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the mean (SD). Results Twenty-eight patients [75% males, 55 (22.5) years] were included. Intake met 64% (28%) of estimated energy and 72% (32%) of protein requirements over the 5 days post-ICU discharge, which was similar to over the ICU admission. From ICU admission to hospital discharge, the mean reduction in weight was 4.2 kg (95% confidence interval = 2.2?6.3, P < 0.001) and after ICU discharge, the mean reduction in weight and QMLT was 2.6 kg (95% confidence interval = 1.0?4.2, P = 0.004) and 0.23 cm (95% confidence interval = 0.06?0.4, P = 0.01), respectively. Conclusions Patients received less energy and protein than estimated requirements after ICU discharge. Weight loss and reduction in QMLT also occurred during this period.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report summative data from the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) registry. Design Multi-institutional veterinary trauma registry data report. Setting VetCOT identified veterinary trauma centers (VTCs). Animals Dogs and cats with evidence of trauma presented to VTCs with data entered in the VetCOT registry September 1, 2013?March 31, 2017. Interventions VetCOT created a standardized data collection methodology for dog and cat trauma. Data were input to a web-based data capture system (REDCap) by data entry personnel trained in data software use and operational definitions of data variables. Data on demographics, trauma type (blunt vs penetrating), preadmission care, hospitalization and intensive care requirement, trauma severity assessment at presentation (eg, modified Glasgow coma scale and animal trauma triage score), key laboratory parameters, necessity for surgical intervention, and case outcome were collected. Summary descriptive data for each species are reported. Measurements and Main Results Twenty-nine VTCs in North America, Europe, and Australia contributed information from 17,335 dog and 3,425 cat trauma cases during the 42-month reporting period. A large majority of cases presented directly to the VTC after injury (80.4% dogs and 78.1% cats). Blunt trauma was the most common source for injury in cats (56.7%); penetrating trauma was the most common source for injury in dogs (52.3%). Note that 43.8% of dogs and 36.2% of cats were reported to have surgery performed. The proportion surviving to discharge was 92.0% (dogs) and 82.5% (cats). Conclusions The VetCOT registry proved to be a powerful resource for collection of a large dataset on trauma in dogs and cats seen at VTCs. While overall survival to discharge was quite high, further evaluation of data on subsets of injury types, patient assessment parameters, interventions, and associated outcome are warranted.

AB  - Abstract There are accumulating data describing the association between diabetes and cancer mortality from Westernised populations. There are no data describing the relationship between diabetes and cancer mortality in African or South Asian populations from developing countries. We explored the relationship of abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes on cancer mortality risk in a large, multi-ethnic cohort from the developing nation of Mauritius. Population-based surveys were undertaken in 1987, 1992 and 1998. The 9559 participants comprised 66% of South Asian (Indian), 27% of African (Creole), and 7% of Chinese descent. Cox's proportional hazards model with time varying covariates was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk of cancer mortality, after adjustment for confounding factors. In men, but not women, cancer mortality risk increased with rising 2h-PG levels with HR for the top versus bottom quintile of 2.77 (95%CI: 1.28 to 5.98). South Asian men with known diabetes had a significantly greater risk of cancer mortality than those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) HR: 2.74 (95%CI: 1.00-7.56). Overall, impaired glucose tolerance was associated with an elevated risk of cancer mortality compared to NGT (HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.98?2.19), though this was not significant. We have shown that the association between abnormal glucose tolerance and cancer extends to those of African and South Asian descent. These results highlight the importance of understanding this relationship in a global context to direct future health policy given the rapid increase in type 2 diabetes, especially in developing nations.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The pathogenetic mechanisms causing a dementing brain disease after temporary ischemia, heat shock, or brain trauma are surveyed. These lesions increase beta amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) synthesis. This process is potentiated by an ischemic glutamate release that opens cellular Ca2+ channels, inhibiting glucose turnover and ATP production, which is, under these conditions, accompanied by the generation of beta amyloid (beta A), even in young persons. Beta amyloid starts a vicious circle by inactivating the glycolytic key enzyme, phos-phofructokinase, which, with age, exhausts the functional reserve capacity of the brain. This demonstrates that beta A is an epiphenomenon of a dementing brain disease, triggered by the disturbance of glucose turnover and oxidative phosphorylation. Clinical studies have shown that a dementing brain disease can be clearly objectified and monitored by 18F-2-deoxyglucose PET studies. This paper looks briefly a pharmacologic approaches to this disease using models of temporary ischemia, the testing of 14C-deoxyglucose turnover, or examination with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. In conclusion, the key process of all dementing brain diseases of the Alzheimer type is a decreased glucose turnover and subsequently decreased oxidative phosphorylation, linked directly to a secondary amyloid formation and nerve cell atrophy.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most misdiagnosed and underreported types of head trauma. The potential long-term impact of undiagnosed or incorrectly identified concussions and other head injuries are potentially devastating, as evidenced by the increasing societal burden exhibited by soldiers returning from combat and athletes in contact sports. Concussions and TBI are notoriously difficult to correctly diagnose and prognosis for these injuries is poorly understood. In order to increase the likelihood of successful diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of outcomes, a definitive differential diagnosis will need to be established. The establishment of a ?trauma?specific profile? or a panel of known trauma markers will significantly aid in this goal. Small membrane vesicles called exosomes have been shown to contain proteins and injury-specific biomarkers. In the future it is possible that they could become an important tool, utilized for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

AB  - Abstract. The authors have recently demonstrated that increased gene expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase) in hemorrhagic hypotension (HH) and following lactated Ringer's resuscitation (LR) is associated with a decrease in insulin and an increase in corticosterone concentrations. Objective: To evaluate the in-vivo role of hormones the authors used insulin (IN), phentolamine and propranolol (PP) as an adrenergic blocker, and cyclic somatostatin (CS) as a glucagon blocker to prevent the induction of Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney following HH and LR. Methods: Hemorrhage was induced in fasted anesthetized rats, and the reduction of blood pressure to 40 mm Hg for a duration of 30 minutes was accomplished by withdrawal or infusion of shed blood. The resuscitated group underwent hemorrhage followed by fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. Results: Neither PP nor CS treatment could block the induction of Glu-6-Pase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) following either HH or LR. However, the administration of IN significantly prevented the increase of Glu-6-Pase mRNA level and activity in both liver and kidney following HH and LR. This was associated with a normalization of plasma glucose, corticosterone, and glucagon levels and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in liver and kidney toward prehemorrhage levels. Conclusions: These results indicate that in-vivo treatment with insulin during hemorrhagic hypotension and resuscitation is capable of preventing the increase in Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney responsible for the observed hyperglycemia.

AB  - Summary It is important to remember that while trauma is the most common cause for deaths in childhood, the majority of paediatric trauma results only in minor injury, but may be associated with long-term morbidity that stretches into adulthood. Here, injury prevention is the best strategy. This chapter discusses the ways to lessen or prevent childhood injury, and the mechanism of injury. It talks about the initial assessment and management of childhood injury. Patient management consists of a rapid primary survey and resuscitation of vital functions, followed by a more detailed secondary assessment, then stabilisation and transfer to definitive care centre where required. There are various scoring systems, which exist to allow the quantification of the magnitude of single or multiple injuries, for example, the Champion Trauma Score and Paediatric Trauma Score (PTS). These scores can be a useful predictor of outcome and allow comparison of groups of trauma patients.

AB  - Though first introduced more than 130 years ago, the concept of stress diabetes or stress hyperglycemia has gained tremendous attention in recent years in view of the landmark article by van den Berghe and colleagues in 2001. As opposed to earlier work that suggested that hyperglycemia in the acute clinical setting may be beneficial, it now appears that lower glucose levels are associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms behind the improved outcomes are numerous and seem to be tied to the inflammatory process. Both lower glucose values and insulin therapy seem to be anti-inflammatory, whereas hyperglycemia increases the proinflammatory process and negatively affects the innate immune system. Despite the numerous approaches to achieve normoglycemia described in the literature, only modest success has been achieved. Understanding the pathophysiology driving stress hyperglycemia?the stress response and modulation of the inflammatory process?seems to be the key to improving the care of the most critically ill and injured patients.

AB  - Summary Blood Glucose Awareness Training is a psycho-educational intervention designed for patients with type 1 diabetes. Its purpose is to improve patients' ability to recognise, predict, avoid and respond to extreme fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Training focuses on learning how to use internal and external cues to improve blood glucose awareness. Blood glucose symptomatology is highly idiosyncratic and symptoms are often not specific to hypo- or hyperglycaemia, making them hard to recognise accurately. Patients may still estimate their blood glucose level using external cues, such as information about the timing and amount of recent insulin, food and physical activity. This ability has been investigated and the results have been incorporated into the current format of Blood Glucose Awareness Training. The intervention is described, with results from both early and recent studies. The implications for future applications are discussed.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Tools and criteria to evaluate and understand glucose metabolism are essential to optimise equine energy utilisation for exercise performance and reduced metabolic health risks. Objectives: To re-evaluate models of glucose kinetics in the horse at rest and during endurance type exercise using a single injection technique and compartmental modelling. Methods: Twelve exercise trained Arabian geldings received a bolus of 100?µmol/kg bwt [6,6-2H]glucose i.v. while at rest and while running at ?4?m/s on a treadmill. Tracer and tracee glucose curves from 4?150?min after the bolus dose (while the subject maintained its resting or exercising state) were described by a 2 term exponential decay curve. Compartmental modelling was performed simultaneously for each horse's resting and exercise curves using an ?exercise effect? parameter for each compartmental exchange rate during exercise. Results: Exercise increased all rate constants and transport flows for glucose between compartments by 110?145% (P≤0.004). Total glucose transport through the system increased from 8.9 ± 0.6?µmol/min/kg/bwt at rest to 25.0 ± 1.1?µmol/min/kg bwt during exercise (P<0.001). Exercise decreased the volume of the primary glucose compartment by 8% (P = 0.006) and increased plasma glucose clearance rate by almost 200% (P<0.001). Turnover times and mean residence times were decreased approximately 60% by exercise (P<0.001), whilst turnover rates were increased 125% (P<0.001). Conclusions: Single-injection tracer kinetics and compartmental modelling represent a valuable tool to quantify tracee availability to and use by tissue. Potential relevance: This technique could represent a beneficial tool for future studies exploring the role of glucose metabolism in equine exercise performance and metabolic disease.

AB  - Purpose In clinical conditions trauma is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of multiple organ failure after trauma Experimental design To have a detailed understanding of the neutrophil activation at primary stages after trauma, neutrophils are isolated from control and surgical trauma rats in this study. Extracted proteins are analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results A total of 2924 rat neutrophil proteins are identified in our analysis, of which 393 are found differentially regulated between control and trauma groups. By using functional pathways analysis of the 190 proteins up-regulated in surgical trauma, we found proteins related to transcription initiation and protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, among the 203 proteins down-regulated in surgical trauma we found enrichment for proteins of the immune response, proteasome degradation and actin cytoskeleton. Overall, enzyme prediction analysis revealed that regulated enzymes are directly involved in neutrophil apoptosis, directional migration and chemotaxis. Our observations are then confirmed by in silico protein?protein interaction analysis. Conclusions and clinical relevance Collectively, our results reveal that neutrophils drastically regulate their biochemical pathways after the early stages of surgical trauma, showing lower activity. This implies higher susceptibility of the trauma patients to infection and bystander tissues damage.

AB  - Summary The main purpose of this study was to describe the effect of glucose infusion on selected physiological variables and on the duration of treadmill exercise to fatigue. Six, 3?4 year old, clinically normal, Standardbred fillies were used in a randomised and balanced crossover design. The treatments were either an infusion of glucose (an initial bolus followed by an infusion rate adjusted during exercise to maintain glucose at approximately 9.0 mmol/l) or an infusion of a similar volume of normal saline. Saline was also infused during the first 30 min of recovery in both treatments. Treadmill speed and grade were 6.0 m/s and 2°. All horses underwent an exercise and dietary control period for 3 days prior to each treatment. A period of 7?10 days separated the treatments. Treadmill exercise duration was prolonged with glucose (89.8 min ± 15.4 s.e.m.) compared to saline (78.7 ± 12.4 min) (P<0.05). Plasma glucose concentrations were similar at rest and increased (P<0.05) above resting concentrations throughout exercise beginning at 15 min and 35 min for the glucose and saline trials, respectively. By 15 min of exercise, glucose concentrations were 8.72 ± 0.22 and 5.78 ± 0.28 mmol/l (P<0.05) for the glucose and the saline trials, respectively. Changes in haematocrit, plasma lactate, plasma total solids, plasma electrolytes, heart rate, core temperature, body weight and body water loss were similar for both treatments. An explanation for the glucose-induced prolongation of exercise could be the availability of additional substrate during exercise.

AB  - Abstract We sought to investigate the risk factors and outcome of Ventilator Associated Tracheitis (VAT) according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition in pediatric trauma patients who were ventilated for ≥48?hr. In a retrospective cohort study, medical records of all pediatric trauma patients admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between April 2002 and April 2007 were reviewed. Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, Trauma Injury Severity Score (TISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), type of trauma, and other potential risk factors prior to the development of VAT (such as hyperglycemia, rate of re-intubation and tracheotomy, presence of chest tubes and central lines, urinary tract infection, seizures, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of total parental nutrition, transfusion, use of H2 blockers, steroids, and pressors/inotropes). Medical records were also reviewed for days of mechanical ventilation, PICU length of stay, and PICU mortality. During the study period, 217 trauma patients were admitted to the PICU, 113 patients met our inclusion criteria and 21.2% (24/113) developed VAT. On average patients with VAT (in comparison to patients without VAT), had a higher TISS score on admission [38.6?±?16.9 vs. 24.2?±?10.6; respectively (P?<?0.01)], longer days of ventilation and PICU length of stay [11.5?±?6.2 vs. 3.7?±?2.3 days (P?<?0.001) and 16.4?±?8.3 vs. 5.4?±?2.8 days (P?<?0.001), respectively]. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. In a logistic regression model adjusting for possible confounders, the TISS score (adjusted OR 7.53; CI: 2.01?28.14; P?=?0.03 and use of pressors/inotropes (adjusted OR 4.64; CI: 1.28?16.86; P?=?0.01) were the only independent risk factors associated with VAT. We conclude that the severity of illness and use of pressors/inotropes are associated with VAT in pediatric trauma patients. We also conclude that VAT is associated with an increase in days of mechanical ventilation and PICU length of stay in pediatric trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that neutrophils are essential for the protection from invading pathogens, hyperactive neutrophils may elicit detrimental cerebral damage after severe trauma. The neutrophil interactions with the neurovascular unit entail endothelial dysfunction involving endothelial leakage, formation of edema, coagulation abnormalities, disturbed hemodynamics, tissue infiltration etc. These elements of the ?whole body inflammation,? designated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in conjunction with intracerebral proinflammatory activities, are important triggers of post-traumatic cerebral damage and mortality according to the ?second hit? concept. From the immunologic point of view, the brain is an immune privileged site, known to resist autodestructive inflammatory activity much more efficiently than other organs because of the highly efficient diverse functions of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). However, both the underlying strategy of the BBB to maintain cerebral protecting functions against the post-traumatic neutrophil-mediated ?second hit? and how activated neutrophils may overcome the BBB are currently unknown. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of the ?second hit,? the BBB physiology, and its role in the maintenance of cerebral immune privilege, and discusses recent findings that may explain the pathophysiologic neutrophil?BBB interactions occurring after severe trauma, thus offering novel therapeutic options to protect from post-traumatic brain damage. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - About 50% of the trauma victims die at the scene mostly because of exsanguinating haemorrhage. Most trials of resuscitation fail in face of the ongoing bleeding. Ongoing research/studies to save these victims by inducing rapid hypothermia using cardiopulmonary bypass as an emergency initial measure along with delayed resuscitation show improved outcomes. A comprehensive review of this research and analysis of studies showed that rapid induction of hypothermia within 5 min of cardiac arrest is associated with better survival and improved neurological outcome. This led us to conclude that suspended animation is a lifesaving modality for the treatment of trauma victims, otherwise hurtling towards certain death. This should be integrated into regular clinical practice. The US Food and Drug Administration has given its approval for clinical trials on such an intervention.

AB  - Summary Recent years, studies have demonstrated that hyperglycemia is one of the main manifestations after cardiac surgeries, which contributes to myocardial injuries and increases the chance of subsequent complications and mortality in such patients. However, strategies targeting at glucose metabolic disorder after cardiac surgeries to attenuate myocardial injuries are inadequately studied. In this study, a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was applied to investigate the role of Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in modulating myocardial glucose metabolic-induced cardiac injuries after cardiac surgery. The results revealed that CPB elicited significant cardiac dysfunction, and pronouncedly elevated the markers of myocardial injuries including serum creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin I. Additionally, blunted myocardial glucose uptake after CPB was associated with decreased membrane glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) content. However, pretreatment of AMPK agonist 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide1-?-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) at the beginning of CPB activated AMPK, enhanced phosphorylation of Akt substrate 160 (AS160), and increased myocardial membrane content of GLUT4. Meanwhile, improved myocardial glucose uptake and more importantly alleviated cardiac injury were also observed after CPB pretreated with AICAR. Moreover, the application of a mutant form of AS160 (AS160-4P) abolished the beneficial effect of AICAR, as evidenced by impaired cardiac glucose uptake, reduced myocardial membrane GLUT-4 translocation, increased cardiac injury markers, and deterioration of cardiac function after CPB. In conclusion, it was suggested in this study that preactivation of AMPK by AICAR improved myocardial glucose uptake by promoting AS160 dependent myocardial membrane GLUT-4 translocation, which ultimately provided a potent cardioprotective effect.

AB  - Abstract Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease confirmed at postmortem. Those at highest risk are professional athletes who participate in contact sports and military personnel who are exposed to repetitive blast events. All neuropathologically confirmed CTE cases, to date, have had a history of repetitive head impacts. This suggests that repetitive head impacts may be necessary for the initiation of the pathogenetic cascade that, in some cases, leads to CTE. Importantly, while all CTE appears to result from repetitive brain trauma, not all repetitive brain trauma results in CTE. Magnetic resonance imaging has great potential for understanding better the underlying mechanisms of repetitive brain trauma. In this review, we provide an overview of advanced imaging techniques currently used to investigate brain anomalies. We also provide an overview of neuroimaging findings in those exposed to repetitive head impacts in the acute/subacute and chronic phase of injury and in more neurodegenerative phases of injury, as well as in military personnel exposed to repetitive head impacts. Finally, we discuss future directions for research that will likely lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms separating those who recover from repetitive brain trauma vs. those who go on to develop CTE.

AB  - Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can be used to show brain function. Courts have admitted PET scan evidence in cases involving brain damage, injury, toxic exposure, or illness (?brain trauma?) and to support claims of diminished cognitive abilities and impulse control. Despite the limited data on the relationships between PET, brain trauma and behavior, many courts admit PET scan evidence without much critical analysis. This article examines the use of PET as proof of functional impairment and justification of abnormal behavior by explaining its diagnostic use and limitations, the limited support for claims of its relationship to behavior, and evidentiary considerations that should govern its admission into court as evidence. The authors urge courts to consider PET evidence, claims of experts, and the scope of the proposed testimony with greater deference to the clinical scope of PET, as outlined by the American College of Radiology's appropriateness criteria and the Working Group Report of the American Psychiatric Association.
