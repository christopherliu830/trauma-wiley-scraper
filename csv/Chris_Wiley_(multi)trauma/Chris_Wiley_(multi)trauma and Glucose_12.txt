AB  - Abstract Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy, but not to the level of being diagnostic for diabetes in a nonpregnant adult. In GDM, whole-body insulin-dependent glucose disposal decreases by 40%-60% which necessitates a 200%-250% increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycaemia. GDM develops when a pregnant woman does not produce sufficient insulin to compensate for the reduced glucose disposal. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that is expressed predominantly in the liver, but also in other metabolically active tissues such as pancreas, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In animals, FGF21 lowers blood glucose levels and inhibits glucagon secretion. In humans, circulating FGF21 levels are increased in insulin-resistant morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An elevated FGF21 level is also an independent predictor of T2DM. GDM and T2DM are proposed to have similar underlying pathophysiologies, raising the question of whether a similar relationship exists between FGF21 and GDM as it does with T2DM. There are a limited number of studies investigating FGF21 levels in patients with GDM. Moreover, recent clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of FGF21 have highlighted a major gap in our understanding of the biology of FGF21. This review evaluates what is currently known about FGF21 and GDM and highlights important gaps that warrant further research.

AB  - Abstract Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays key roles in cell adhesion and migration. We now report that the delayed rectifier Kv2.1 potassium channel, through its LD-like motif in N-terminus, may interact with FAK and enhance phosphorylation of FAK397 and FAK576/577. Overlapping distribution of Kv2.1 and FAK was observed on soma and proximal dendrites of cortical neurons. FAK expression promotes a polarized membrane distribution of the Kv2.1 channel. In Kv2.1-transfected CHO cells, formation of the Kv2.1-FAK complex was stimulated by fibronectin/integrin and inhibited by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). FAK phosphorylation was minimized by shRNA knockdown of the Kv2.1 channel, point mutations of the N-terminus, and TEA, respectively. Cell migration morphology was altered by Kv2.1 knockdown or TEA, hindering cell migration activity. In wound healing tests in vitro and a traumatic injury animal model, Kv2.1 expression and co-localization of Kv2.1 and FAK significantly enhanced directional cell migration and wound closure. It is suggested that the Kv2.1 channel may function as a promoting signal for FAK activation and cell motility. J. Cell. Physiol. 217: 544?557, 2008. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Role of decreased brain glucose metabolism in neurofibrillary degeneration ?? Subgroups of AD ?? Therapeutic approaches to inhibit neurofibrillary degeneration Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is multi-factorial and heterogeneous. Independent of the aetiology, this disease is characterized clinically by chronic and progressive dementia and histopathologically by neurofibrillary degeneration of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau seen as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites, and by neuritic (senile) plaques of ?-amyloid. The neurofibrillary degeneration is apparently required for the clinical expression of AD, and in related tauopathies it leads to dementia in the absence of amyloid plaques. While normal tau promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, the abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau sequesters normal tau, MAP1 and MAP2, and disrupts microtubules. The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau also promotes its self-assembly into tangles of paired helical and or straight filaments. Tau is phosphorylated by a number of protein kinases. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and cyclin dependent protein kinase 5 (cdk5) are among the kinases most implicated in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau. Among the phosphatases which regulate the phosphorylation of tau, protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A), the activity of which is down-regulated in AD brain, is by far the major enzyme. The inhibition of abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau is one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the development of disease modifying drugs. A great advantage of inhibiting neurofibrillary degeneration is that it can be monitored by evaluating the levels of total tau and tau phosphorylated at various known abnormally hyperphosphorylated sites in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients, obtained by lumbar puncture. There are at least five subgroups of AD, each is probably caused by a different etiopathogenic mechanism. The AD subgroup identification of patients can help increase the success of clinical trials and the development of specific and potent disease modifying drugs.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess novel differences in serum levels of glucose, lactate and amino acids in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) compared to age-matched controls, at baseline and in response to universal hypoxia. Methods Twelve patients diagnosed with NTG and eleven control subjects underwent normobaric hypoxia for 2 hr. Peripheral venous blood samples were taken at baseline, during hypoxia and in the recovery phase. Serum glucose and lactate levels were measured by a blood gas analyser. Amino acids were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results Baseline levels of lactate and total amino acids were significantly lower in patients with NTG compared to healthy controls. No differences were seen in blood glucose levels between the two groups. Lactate levels remained unchanged during hypoxia in the control group, but increased in patients with NTG. In the recovery phase, total amino acid levels were reduced in the control group, whereas no changes were found in patients with NTG. Conclusion Reduced serum levels of lactate and total amino acids were identified as potential markers for NTG. Moreover, significant differential regulatory patterns of certain amino acids were found in patients with NTG compared to control subjects. Overall, our results suggest a link between systemic energy metabolites and NTG and support a novel understanding of glaucoma as an inner retinal manifestation of a systemic condition.

AB  - Abstract Background Jinlida granules are a commonly prescribed oral medication in China used in combination with antidiabetic drugs to lower blood glucose. The aim of this study was to systematically identify and pool the findings of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of Jinlida granules as add-on therapy for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods The China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wang Fang, PubMed, China biology medicine (CBM), and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) databases were searched for papers regarding the effects of Jinlida granules in T2D published before 1 July 2018. A pooled analysis of extracted data was performed using random-effects models. Results In all, data were retrieved for 15 studies including 1810 individuals. Decreases in HbA1c were greater in groups receiving Jinlida granules as add-on therapy compared with control groups (n?=?1820; mean difference???0.66; 95% confidence interval???0.72, ?0.60; P?<?0.00001; I2?=?38%). In addition, Jinlida granules reduced body mass index and had beneficial effects on homeostatic model assessment of ?-cell function and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. No obvious adverse events were reported. Conclusions Findings from this meta-analysis demonstrate additional benefits of Jinlida granules as an add-on therapy for T2D and that Jinlida granules are generally safe. Treatment with Jinlida granules provided clinically and statistically significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour post-load glucose, and HbA1c levels in patients with T2D. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and study limitations.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.

AB  - Abstract Identifying the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a critical step toward reducing its debilitating impact. Spontaneous neural activity, measured at rest using various neuroimaging techniques (e.g., regional homogeneity [ReHo], amplitude of low frequency fluctuations [ALFF]), can provide insight about baseline neurobiological factors influencing sensory, cognitive, or behavioral processes associated with PTSD. The present study used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to conduct the largest-to-date quantitative meta-analysis of spontaneous neural activity in PTSD, including 457 PTSD cases, 292 trauma-exposed controls (TECs), and 293 non-traumatized controls (NTCs) across 22 published studies. Five regions-of-interest (ROIs) were identified where activity differed between PTSD cases and controls: one when compared to all controls (left globus pallidus), two when compared to TECs (left inferior parietal lobule [IPL] and right lingual gyrus), and two when compared to NTCs (left amygdala and right caudate head). To corroborate these results, a second analysis was conducted using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on an independent sample of 205 previously-deployed US military veterans. In this analysis, converging evidence from ReHo and ALFF showed that spontaneous neural activity in the left IPL alone was positively correlated with PTSD symptom severity. This result is consistent with theoretical accounts that link left IPL activity with PTSD-relevant processes such as processing of emotional stimuli (e.g., fearful faces) and the extent that attention is captured by salient autobiographical memories. By modeling the neurobiological correlates of PTSD, we can increase our understanding of this debilitating disorder and guide the development of future clinical innovations.

AB  - Aims.  To report the findings of an investigation of patients with diabetes and burns, with emphasis on implications for practice: primary and secondary preventions. Background.  Diabetes and burns are complex conditions with multi-system involvements, which worsen outcomes for patients, and their management. This research investigated outcomes for patients and diabetes management. Methods.  Data on outcomes were obtained from records of patients hospitalised for foot burns in an Australian hospital from 1999?2004. A questionnaire survey design was employed to obtain information on how clinicians in burns units manage diabetes. SPSS was used to analyse data obtained from both resources. Comments written in the questionnaire were analysed using relational analysis. Results.  Of the 64 patients, 12 were with diabetes and 52 were without diabetes. Those with diabetes were more likely to sustain contact foot burns (58·3% Diabetes Mellitus vs. 13·5% non Diabetes Mellitus ?2?=?11·487, p?=?0·002). The duration of hospitalisation was statistically significantly longer among patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes (U?=?169, p?=?0·014); although the two groups were not statistically significant different in terms of severity of burns and received treatment. Of the 29 clinical leaders, 21 (72%) indicated that they regularly provided care to patients with diabetes. Most respondents (n?=?15; 58%) reported that new plans need to be initiated to accommodate the combined insult of diabetes and burns. Diabetes centres were located in all participating sites; but not always involved in the process of care. Conclusion.  The co-existence of diabetes and burns worsens outcomes for patients, and complicates management plans. Optimal management can be achieved via a multidisciplinary approach starting with glycaemic control, and continued to aggressive management of diabetes and burns. Relevance to clinical practice.  Preventive measures should start with tight glycaemic control, identification and avoidance of sources of trauma, early detection and treatment, and continue to aggressive inpatient management of patients with both diabetes and a burn injury.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test.

AB  - Abstract Noninvasive (NI) optical monitoring techniques measure the concentration of analytes in blood or tissue without taking out a sample or without inserting any instrumentation into the human body. Optical biopsy describes NI optical tracking of concentration of molecules in human tissue. Novel tissue optics methods will open new vistas in medical diagnostics and will offer simpler testing modalities compared with current methods. The 600-nm to 1300-nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum represents a window where light penetrates deep enough in the tissue to allow performing optical measurements. NI determination of arterial oxygen saturation is used for monitoring postoperative and critical care patients. NI determinations of hemoglobin offer diagnosis of anemia and internal bleeding. Bilirubin measurements were used for monitoring neonates. Monitoring of diabetics is the most important potential advantage for NI optical diagnostics. A NI glucose-testing device will improve diabetes control through more frequent testing and adjustment of medication. NI optical detection procedures involve irradiating tissue or a vascular region of the body with electromagnetic radiation and measuring the spectral information that results from absorption, scattering, and emission. The concentration of an analyte is determined from the spectral information by comparing the measured spectra with a calibration model. Metabolites affect transmitted and reflected optical signals by affecting light absorption and scattering. Transmission, diffuse reflectance, spatially resolved diffuse reflectance R(r), frequency domain reflectance, time-resolved transmission and reflectance, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and Raman and fluorescence measurements were used for the NI determination of metabolites and are discussed.

AB  - As the number of persons with diabetes increases, there is an increased incidence of foot skin breakdown and lower extremity amputations. Approximately 44%?85% of those amputations can be prevented. Prevention requires an understanding of the causes of diabetic foot skin breakdown and the measures necessary for prevention. As rehabilitation nurses, we care for patients with strokes, hip fractures, spinal cord injuries, or joint replacements, who are diabetic and are at risk for foot skin breakdown. We also care for patients with amputations who are at risk for skin breakdown of the remaining foot. This article identifies the causes of foot skin breakdown, such as neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, trauma, and infection. Discussion includes patients who are at risk, the foot areas at risk, preventive measures, and patient and family education for the prevention of foot skin breakdown in the diabetic patient.

AB  - Background Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIs) are associated with maternal morbidity; however, it is uncertain whether gestational diabetes (GDM) is an independent risk factor when considering birthweight mode of birth and episiotomy. Aims To compare rates of OASIs between women with GDM and women without GDM by mode of birth and birthweight. To investigate the association between episiotomy, mode of birth and the risk of OASIs. Methods A population-based cohort study of women who gave birth vaginally in NSW, from 2007 to 2013. Rates of OASIs were compared between women with and without GDM, stratified by mode of birth, birthweight and a multi-categorical variable of mode of birth and episiotomy. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by multivariable logistic regression. Results The rate of OASIs was 3.6% (95% CI: 2.6?2.7) vs 2.6% (95% CI: 3.4?2.8; P < 0.001) among women with and without GDM, respectively. Women with GDM and a macrosomic baby (birthweight ≥ 4000 g) had a higher risk of OASIs with forceps (aOR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.08?2.86, P = 0.02) or vacuum (aOR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.17?3.04, P = 0.01), compared with those without GDM. For primiparous women with GDM and all women without GDM, an episiotomy with forceps was associated with lower odds of OASIs than forceps only (primiparous GDM, forceps-episiotomy aOR 2.49, 95% CI: 2.00?3.11, forceps aOR 5.30, 95% CI: 3.72?7.54), (primiparous without GDM, forceps-episiotomy aOR 2.71, 95% CI: 2.55?2.89, forceps aOR 5.95, 95% CI: 5.41?6.55) and (multiparous without GDM, forceps-episiotomy aOR 3.75, 95% CI: 3.12?4.50, forceps aOR 6.20, 95% CI: 4.96?7.74). Conclusion Women with GDM and a macrosomic baby should be counselled about the increased risk of OASIs with both vacuum and forceps. With forceps birth, this risk can be partially mitigated by performing a concomitant episiotomy.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the role of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in probiotics while also referring to other moonlighting proteins as the need arises. Probiotics do not produce toxic substances such as ammonia, indole, phenol, and nitrosamine, while probiotics can assimilate ammonia, inhibit the growth of toxic-substance-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and adsorb and eliminate these substances. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is one of the best-studied probiotic strains and many beneficial effects have been reported. LGG has been commercialized and consumed in a wide variety of food products and dietary supplements throughout the world for long time. Most reports about the multiple moonlighting functions of surface GAPDH in probiotics refer to adhesins. GAPDH has multi-binding properties. GAPDH may relate to stress response because some reports show expression of moonlighting proteins such as GAPDH increase under various stress conditions.

AB  - Background: Repeated hypoxia and surgical trauma trigger a potent neuroendocrine response and their association is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multi-organ dysfunction. We investigated the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to repeated acute hypoxia in anaesthetised and surgically instrumented pigs. Methods: Under ketamine-midazolam anaesthesia, 15 pigs were surgically instrumented for measurements of cardiac output, vascular pressures and organ blood flows. Lactate production and O2 uptake were determined in the brain, liver, kidney and intestine. Ten animals were subjected to two 12-min periods of ventilatory hypoxia (FIO2=7%) followed by re-oxygenation and 5 animals underwent 120?min normoxic ventilation (Control group). Results: Both hypoxic challenges produced a comparable release of catecholamines that was associated with increased cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow away from the intestinal and renal areas towards the brain and the liver; O2 uptake was markedly reduced in the intestine (? 56 ± 10%, P < 0.05) and least affected in the brain and the kidney (? 19±12% and ? 23±21%, respectively). During the second hypoxic test, lethal cardiovascular depression occurred in 5 animals; these non-survivors demonstrated impaired hyperdynamic response and incomplete recovery of intestinal O2 uptake during the first hypoxia/reoxygenation test. In the Control group, normoxic ventilation was not associated with significant haemodynamic and metabolic changes. Conclusion: Intraoperative hypoxia causes marked heterogeneity in organ blood flow and metabolism. The inability to develop a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response during a first hypoxic event, as well as a persistent intestinal O2 debt following re-oxygenation, predict the occurrence of death during the second hypoxic insult.

AB  - Summary In the mid-1950s, the need of mass cultivation techniques for vaccine production led to the development of large-scale cell culture bioreactors. The rapid growth in biopharmaceutical industry, with a surge of protein, antibody, and peptide drugs expected in the next 10-20 years, has been led by various products produced by mammalian cells. Mammalian cells can be grown as suspension cells or as anchorage-dependent cells. A deep understanding of cell metabolism is crucial for designing feeding strategies to improve productivity and decrease culture costs. The metabolic pathways of glutamine and glucose have been reported to be quite similar to all mammalian cells including stem cells. Static culture systems such as multi well-plates, T-flasks, or tissue culture Petri dishes are the most widely used options for expanding mammalian cells. Two case studies focusing mammalian cell culture for antibody production and mouse embryonic stem cell culture, in bioreactors systems, are presented.
