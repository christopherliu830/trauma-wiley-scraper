AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a missense, gain-of-function mutation in the equine skeletal muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1). Affected horses have excessive glycogen storage, amylopectate-like inclusions in their muscle and higher muscle glycogen synthase activities (GS) than controls. GS is normally allosterically-regulated by glucose-6-phosphate and enzyme activity is reduced by phosphorylation. We hypothesised that the higher GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses might be due either to 1) increased expression or reduced degradation of the mutant enzyme or 2) due to reduced phosphorylation. Methods Semimembranosus muscle samples were biopsied from 4 homozygotes (HH), 13 heterozygotes (RH) and 12 control (RR) Belgian Draught horses. Samples were analysed for glycogen content and GS activity. Western immunoblotting was used to examine expression of total and phosphorylated forms of GS, GSK3? and GLUT4. Data was analysed using non-parametric ANOVA statistical tests with post-hoc Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Results PSSM1 affected heterozygotes and homozygotes had significantly higher muscle glycogen contents than controls (RR vs. RH P?=?0.005, RR vs. HH P?= 0.041) and GS activity was significantly higher in PSSM1-affected homozygotes than in heterozygotes and control horses (P?=?0.03). Although there was no difference in total GS expression between groups, there was significantly more expression of GS phosphorylated at site 2?+?2a in PSSM1-affected horses in comparison with controls (P?=?0.009). Conclusions Our data suggest that increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses is not associated with increased expression or degradation of the mutant enzyme and occurs despite increased phosphorylation of GS at site 2?+?2a. Alternative mechanisms, including aberrant ligand binding might account for the increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected muscle.

AB  - Introduction Horses performance can be enhanced via growth hormone (GH) doping. The detection time for GH in blood is too short to allow detection during competition. GH not only affects the proteosynthesis in cells and tissues but can also cause long term metabolic variations. This study aimed to show the metabolomic modifications occurring after three months of GH treatment. Methods The study was performed on 20 Welsh ponies. 10 were injected with REPORCIN TM, an approved recombinant GH (30?mg.kg?1 per day) for 3 months and the other 10 comprised the control group. Blood samples were collected before GH treatment (T0), then 3 months later (T3). The NMR spectra acquired on the 40 serum samples were classified according to the factors (season, GH treatment) using the supervised multivariate orthogonal projection on latent structure (OPLS) method. A first OPLS model was computed with the control ponies (T0-T3). The predictive component of this model was subtracted from the whole data (treated, controls at T0 and T3) to only retain the GH-dependent variations. Results Before filtering seasonal effects, glucose, lipids and phospholipids were metabolites discriminating between T0 and T3 samples. After removing the seasonal effect, the OPLS model revealed the effect of GH treatment on protein metabolism through the modification of aromatic amino acids and branched chain amino acids. The variations of other metabolites (glycoproteins and lactate) were enhanced. Conclusions This study showed that chronic GH injection induced systemic metabolism modifications that can be detected using the NMR metabolomic method without neglecting the misleading effect of season.

AB  - Abstract Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes continuous neurological deficits and major sensory-motor impairments. There is no effective treatment to enhance sensory-motor function following SCI. Thus, it is crucial to develop novel therapeutics for this particular patient population. Astaxanthin (AST) is a strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. In the present study, it was tested in a severe compression SCI model with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes, signalling pathway, along with other complications. Methods A severe SCI was induced by compression of the rat thoracic spinal cord with an aneurysm clip and treatment with AST or the vehicle was carried out, 30 min after injury. Behavioural tests including open field, von Frey, hot plate and BBB were performed weekly to 28 days post-injury. Rats were assigned to measure blood glucose, weight and auricle temperature. Western blot and histological analysis also were performed at the same time points. Results AST decreased mechanical and thermal pain and also improved motor function performance, reduced blood glucose and auricle temperature increases and attenuated weight loss in SCI rats. Western blot analysis showed decreased activation of ERK1/2 and increased activation of AKT following AST treatment. The histology results revealed that AST considerably preserved myelinated white matter and the number of motor neurons following SCI. Conclusion Taken together, the beneficial effects of AST to improve sensory-motor outcomes, attenuate pathological tissue damage and modulate ERK and AKT signalling pathways following SCI, suggest it as a strong therapeutic agent towards clinical applications. Significance Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs sensory-motor function and causes complications, which astaxanthin (AST) has the potential to be used as a treatment for. The present study investigates the effects of AST in a compression model of SCI with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes alongside other complications, histopathological damage and also related signalling pathways.

AB  - Introduction Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most important Brazilian horse breed. Functional evaluation of MM horses is performed in marcha competitions, where horses must perform 4-gaited exercise at 13?km/h for 70?min. The aim of this work was to test a training protocol to prepare MM horses for marcha competition. Methods Eight untrained MM mares, in randomized blocks with Split plots, were trained for 84 days. Three days/week horses were ridden for one hour (10?min walk, then an individual amount of marcha exercise at 13?km/h established in a previous test, then walk to complete one hour total exercise time). Two days/week, horses walked for one hour. Before training and every 21 days a marcha test (MT) was performed, totaling 5 tests in the experimental period. During the MT, mares were exercised at 13?km/h using a heart rate monitor. Every 10?min heart rate (HR) and blood lactate concentration [La] were recorded. The MT was stopped at 70?min of exercise, or if HR was ≥150?bpm and [La] was ≥4?mmol/L, or if Marcha Time was reached. Blood samples for hemogram, lactate, glucose, triglyceride and CK, LDH, AST determination were collected. Individual time used for training was 10?min less than the exercising time in the previous MT. Regression was used to analyze the results. Results From MT 1 to 4, the positive effect of training was shown on HR, [La] and marcha time (from 9.52?min to 70.5?min, CV?=?26.41). There was not an increase in marcha time on test 5. Conclusions MM mares trained for 63?days with the described protocol are ready to compete in marcha competition.

AB  - Objective The bilateral absence of cortical Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs), after cardiac arrest (CA), is a high reliable predictor of poor outcome but it is present in no more than 40% of patients. An amplitude reduction of cortical SEPs was found in about 30% of subjects, but few papers analysed its prognostic significance. The aim of our study is to identify a value of SEP amplitude reduction below which all the CA patients had poor outcome and the relationship between SEP and Electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. Material and methods We analysed comatose patients in whom SEPs and EEG were recorded at 6-12 hours after CA. We evaluated the sensitivity at specificity of 100% of SEP amplitude in predicting the non-recovery of consciousness by plotting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. We also analysed the relationship between SEP amplitude and EEG patterns. Outcome was evaluated at 6 months by Glasgow Outcome Scale. Results We analysed 119 subjects. According to the ROC analysis (area under the curve = 0.95/CI 0.91-0.99), all patients with a cortical SEP amplitude <0.65 ?V did not recover consciousness (GOS 1-2), with a sensitivity of 71.8%. Severe EEG abnormalities (suppression and burst-suppression patterns) were also observed in all these patients. Conclusion Not only the absence but also a bilateral amplitude reduction of cortical SEPs (<0.65 ?V) is associated with ominous prognosis (death or non-recovery of consciousness) with a very high predictive value. However, we emphasize that great caution should be applied before adopting amplitude reduction as a criterion for the poor prognosis of CA patients.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions.

AB  - Summary Critical illness, an extreme form of severe physical stress, is characterized by important endocrine and metabolic changes. Due to critical care medicine, survival from previously lethal conditions has become possible but many patients now enter a chronic phase of critical illness. The role of the endocrine and metabolic responses to acute and prolonged critical illness in mediating or hampering recovery remains highly debated. In recent years, important novel insights into the pathophysiology and the consequences of these endocrine responses to acute and chronic critical illness have been generated. This chapter summarizes these insights with a specific focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and on the impact of the hyperglycemic response, on recovery from critical illness. The therapeutic implications of these novel insights are critically analyzed.

AB  - Abstract In this current study, a novel multilayer porous composite scaffold was fabricated with chitosan (CS), silk fibrin (SF) and nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA). Scanning electron microscope was utilized to detect the characteristics of the composed scaffold. Rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSC) were loaded onto the CS/SF/n-HA scaffold and cultured in a bioreactor under an on?off dynamic compression (10% compressive strain, 0.5 Hz, [2 h action?+?4 h pause]/cycle, 4 cycles/day). Metabolism of the loaded rBMSC was assessed through CCK-8 test. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot were applied to assess the chondrogenic differentiation of the seeded cells. Compressive modulus of the cell/scaffold constructs was analyzed. Additionally, a pig model was employed to evaluate the effect of the tissue-engineered cartilage on repairing of cartilage defect. Results showed that the four layers within the scaffold were tightly connected without gaps between porous interfaces of the layers. Scaffold porosity was 92.20%?±?1.30%. The cyclic compression upregulated chondrogenesis markers (Aggrecan, Sox-9, and collagen II). Increased compressive modulus of the cell/scaffold complex was detected after dynamic compression. The pig bone marrow stromal cells/scaffold complex exposed to cyclic compression presented most favorable reparative effect on the mini pig femoral condyle cartilage defects. Our study suggested that the on?off dynamic compression might be a promising approach to fabricate tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) is broadly used to treat orthopaedic infections based on the rationale that high-dose local delivery is essential to eradicate biofilm-associated bacteria. However, ALBC formulations are empirically based on drug susceptibility from routine laboratory testing, which is known to have limited clinical relevance for biofilms. There are also dosing concerns with non-standardized, surgeon-directed, hand-mixed formulations, which have unknown release kinetics. Based on our knowledge of in vivo biofilms, pathogen virulence, safety issues with non-standardized ALBC formulations, and questions about the cost-effectiveness of ALBC, there is a need to evaluate the evidence for this clinical practice. To this end, thought leaders in the field of musculoskeletal infection (MSKI) met on August 1, 2019 to review and debate published and anecdotal information, which highlighted four major concerns about current ALBC use: 1) substantial lack of Level 1 evidence to demonstrate efficacy; 2) ALBC formulations become subtherapeutic following early release, which risks induction of antibiotic resistance, and exacerbated infection from microbial colonization of the carrier; 3) the absence of standardized formulation protocols, and FDA-approved high-dose ALBC products to use following resection in MSKI treatment; and, 4) absence of a validated assay to determine the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) to predict ALBC efficacy against patient specific microorganisms. Here we describe these concerns in detail, and propose areas in need of research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract Background Adult primary mesenchymal cells of different origin which can be obtained with minor donor site morbidity are considered for articular cartilage repair. This study aims at a comparison of their chondrogenic potential. Methods Mesenchymal cells were isolated from perichondrium/periosteum, bone marrow or fat of adult rats and found to be positive for the stem-cell-related antigens Sca-1, c-Kit, CD10, CD13 and CD90 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chondrogenic differentiation was induced by applying recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or adenoviral vectors carrying BMP-2 cDNA, followed by micromass culture. The stimulated cells were characterized by RT-PCR, cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Expression of aggrecan, collagen type I, II, IX and X and alkaline phosphatase genes was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in comparison with unstimulated control cells. Adenovirally stimulated cells were transplanted into mechanically generated partial-thickness cartilage lesions in the patellar groove of the rat femur. Quality and integration of the repair tissues were assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Results Stimulation with BMP-2 or AdBMP-2 led to an up-regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression in all three cell populations studied, most rapidly and prominently in the perichondrial/periosteal cells, which showed a 3200-fold increase of type II collagen mRNA and reached the highest absolute levels of type II and IX collagen transcripts after stimulation. Similar results were obtained for the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), while the respective transcript levels in fat stromal cells declined after an initial more than 30-fold elevation. Following transplantation in vivo, AdBMP-2-infected perichondrial/periosteal cells produced a proteoglycan-rich, type II collagen-positive matrix with only faint staining for type I collagen. The repair tissue originating from AdBMP-2-infected BMSC showed less intense type II collagen staining, but a relatively proteoglycan-rich matrix, weakly positive for type I collagen. Transgene-activated fat stromal cells formed rather fibrous tissue mainly composed of type I collagen. Unstimulated cells of the three different populations gave only rise to fibrous tissue. Conclusions Perichondrium/periosteum-derived cells and BMSC seem superior to cells isolated from fat with respect to forming hyaline cartilaginous tissue. A chondrogenic stimulus, e.g. by transfer of BMP-2 cDNA, appears to be required for initiation and support of chondrogenic differentiation. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The principal safety concern for driving for people treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues is hypoglycaemia, which impairs driving performance. Other complications, such as those causing visual impairment and peripheral neuropathy, are also relevant to medical fitness to drive. Case control studies have suggested that drivers with diabetes pose a modestly increased but acceptable and measurable risk of motor vehicle accidents compared to non-diabetic drivers, but many studies are limited and of poor quality. Factors which have been shown to increase driving risk include previous episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, previous hypoglycaemia while driving, strict glycaemic control (lower HbA1c) and absence of blood glucose monitoring before driving. Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia may be counteracted by frequent blood glucose testing. The European Union Third directive on driving (2006) has necessitated changes in statutory regulations for driving licences for people with diabetes in all European States, including the UK. Stricter criteria have been introduced for Group 1 vehicle licences while those for Group 2 licences have been relaxed. Insulin-treated drivers can now apply to drive Group 2 vehicles, but in the UK must meet very strict criteria and be assessed by an independent specialist to be issued with a 1-year licence.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.
