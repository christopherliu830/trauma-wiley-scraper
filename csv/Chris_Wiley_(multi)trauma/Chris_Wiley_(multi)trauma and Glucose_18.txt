AB  - Summary Complications related to diabetes, particularly peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease, can lead to potentially serious foot problems, such as ulcers or Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN). Foot ulcers often become infected, and these can present urgent problems requiring rapid and appropriate medical and surgical interventions. This chapter will review key concepts of diabetic foot infections and their management and discuss the related problems of acute CN.

AB  - Sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, and burns are often associated with altered metabolism characterized by severe catabolism, wasting of the lean body mass, immune dysfunction, and compromised wound healing. Nutrition support is one of the mainstays in the management of these critically ill patients and is aimed at minimizing these complications. The purpose of this article is to compare stress hypermetabolism and starvation metabolism, to review current recommendations for the provision of energy and substrate to the critically ill patient, and to review pertinent literature regarding enteral vs parenteral nutrition. Finally, this article will provide a brief overview of new and future therapies with emphasis on specific substrates and growth factors and the potential for their use in the critically ill patient.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract The assumption that anesthesia has no serious, long-term, adverse central nervous system consequences may be true for most patients between 6 months and 60 years of age. However, for patients younger than 6 months or older than 60 years, that status quo assumption is under challenge from a growing body of evidence. Fetuses and newborns appear to be at risk because systems that would enable them to fully recover from the effects of more than 2 hours of anesthesia are still in development. In distinction, the elderly appear to be at risk because systems that once enabled them to fully recover have ever-diminishing capacity. Even for those between the age of 6 months and 60 years, full recovery may require replacing apoptosed neurons and pruning overabundant dendritic spines ? perhaps leaving patients not quite the same person that they were before they were anesthetized.

AB  - Abstract The trans-activating response of DNA/RNA-binding protein (TDP)-43 pathology is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases via unknown mechanisms. Here, we use a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human wild-type neuronal TDP-43 to study the effects of TDP-43 pathology on glutamate metabolism and synaptic function. We found that neuronal TDP-43 over-expression affects synaptic protein expression, including Synapsin I, and alters surrounding astrocytic function. TDP-43 over-expression is associated with an increase in glutamate and ?-amino butyric acid and reduction of glutamine and aspartate levels, indicating impairment of presynaptic terminal. TDP-43 also decreases tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism and induces oxidative stress via lactate accumulation. Neuronal TDP-43 does not alter microglia activity or significantly changes systemic and brain inflammatory markers compared to control. We previously demonstrated that brain-penetrant tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), nilotinib and bosutinib, reduce TDP-43-induced cell death in transgenic mice. Here, we show that TKIs reverse the effects of TDP-43 on synaptic proteins, increase astrocytic function and restore glutamate and neurotransmitter balance in TDP-43 mice. Nilotinib, but not bosutinib, reverses mitochondrial impairment and oxidative metabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that TKIs can attenuate TDP-43 toxicity and improve synaptic and astrocytic function, independent of microglial or other inflammatory effects. In conclusion, our data demonstrate novel mechanisms of the effects of neuronal TDP-43 over-expression on synaptic protein expression and alteration of astrocytic function.

AB  - As one of the most important natural materials, cortical bone is a composite material comprising assemblies of tropocollagen molecules and nanoscale hydroxyapatite mineral crystals, forming an extremely tough, yet lightweight, adaptive and multi-functional material. Bone has evolved to provide structural support to organisms, and therefore its mechanical properties are vital physiologically. Like many mineralized tissues, bone can resist deformation and fracture from the nature of its hierarchical structure, which spans molecular to macroscopic length-scales. In fact, bone derives its fracture resistance with a multitude of deformation and toughening mechanisms that are active at most of these dimensions. It is shown that bone's strength and ductility originate primarily at the scale of the nano to submicrometer structure of its mineralized collagen fibrils and fibers, whereas bone toughness is additionally generated at much larger, micro- to near-millimeter, scales from crack-tip shielding associated with interactions between the crack path and the microstructure. It is further shown how the effectiveness with which bone's structural features can resist fracture at small to large length-scales can become degraded by biological factors such as aging and disease, which affect such features as the collagen cross-linking environment, the homogeneity of mineralization, and the density of the osteonal structures.

AB  - Abstract The large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant, defined as >90th birthweight percentile, is associated with mild disturbances of maternal glucose tolerance. In the UK the same birthweight percentile charts are used for all ethnic groups when assessing LGA infants. The influence of maternal hyperglycaemia on LGA infants of Asian (Indian Sub-continent) mothers in the UK is likely to be under-reported, as Asian birthweights tend to be lower than White/Europid birthweights. We assessed the number of LGA infants born consecutively to 21 Asian and 26 White/Europid mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), delivered between 37 and 42 weeks gestation, and also in 34 Asian and 121 White/Europid mothers with a positive screening test for GDM but a normal 75?g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Large-for-gestational-age infants were identified using both the standard UK percentile charts of the Medical Research Council and percentile charts constructed from 30418 Asian and 162477 White/Europid singleton births, delivered between 37 and 42 weeks gestation to non-diabetic mothers delivered in the North West Thames Region of England. The standard Medical Research Council percentile charts, compared with the ethnically derived charts, identified fewer LGA Asian (7/56 vs 15/56) but more White/Europid infants (33/147 vs 21/147). When correcting for ethnicity more Asian than White/Europid GDM mothers delivered LGA infants (9/21 vs 3/26, ?2?=?4.76, p?<?0.05). The maternal 2?h OGTT plasma glucose was a significant independent contributor to birthweight in the Asian (r?2?=?0.319, p?<?0.0005) but not the White/Europid infants, in whom gestational age and maternal height were significant independent contributors to birthweight (r2?=?0.158, p?<?0.0001). We conclude that ethnic influences are important when defining LGA infants and that mild disturbances of maternal glycaemia have a greater influence on the birthweight of Asian than White/Europid infants.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?≥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?≥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin ≥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype. Ethical animal research:?Ethical University Committee approved all the procedures and owner informed consent was obtained. Source of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Background: The neuroendocrine response following major surgery has not been previously influenced by either regional anaesthetic techniques or opioid analgesia probably due to insufficient intraoperative afferent neural blockade. In this study we attempted to determine whether significant inhibition of these pathways could be achieved by combining preoperative high spinal anaesthesia with postoperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia. In theory too, there may be additional benefits over perioperative thoracic epidural anaesthesia on pain and pulmonary dysfunction. Methods: 20 ASA 1?3 patients undergoing elective colonic surgery were studied. Gp 1 (n=10) received a high spinal intraoperative block to T4 using 6mls of 0.5% bupivacaine plus continuous epidural 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. Gp 2 (n=10) patients received epidural 0.5% bupivacaine block to T4 plus continuous epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine/0.0025% diamorphine. We measured a) plasma glucose and Cortisol at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 h; b) forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and peak flow rate (PFR) preoperatively, at 8 and 24 h; c) visual analogue pain scores (VAS 0?10) at rest, cough and mobilisation at 8 and 24 h; d) block height every hour for 12 hours then 3 hourly; e) 24-hour urine volumes for dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline f) 24-hour PCA morphine requirements. Results: The two groups did not differ in age, sex, height, weight, duration of surgery, blood loss or serum albumin. Pain relief was excellent and similar in both groups. The average 24 hour morphine consumption was 10 mg in both groups with no differences in the block height. All the patients had a 30?50% reduction in FEV1, FVC and PFR (P>0.05). Metabolically, there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups except a higher rise in glucose in Gpl at 2 and 3 h (P=0.0312 and 0.014). 24-hour catecholamine studies showed no differences for noradrenaline (P=0.8), adrenaline (P=0.47) and dopamine (P=0.36). Conclusions: Thoracic epidural bupivacaine/diamorphine infusion provided excellent postoperative analgesia following colonic surgery. An intraoperative combined spinal/epidural technique conferred no additional benefit on analgesia, pulmonary function and the neuroendocrine response.

AB  - Abstract Although calpain (EC 3.4.22) protease activation was suggested to contribute to excitotoxic delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) via proteolysis of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3 (NCX3), cytoplasmic calpain activation in relation to DCD has never been visualized in real-time. We employed a calpain fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate to simultaneously image calpain activation and calcium deregulation in live cortical neurons. A calpain inhibitor-sensitive decline in fluorescence resonance energy transfer was observed at 39?± 5?min after the occurrence of DCD in neurons exposed to continuous glutamate (100??M). Inhibition of calpain by calpeptin did not delay the onset of DCD, recovery from DCD-like reversible calcium elevations, or cell death despite inhibiting α-spectrin processing by >?90%. NCXs reversed during glutamate exposure, the NCX antagonist KB-R7943 prolonged the time to DCD, and significant NCX3 cleavage following 90?min of glutamate exposure was not observed. Our findings suggest that robust calpain activation associated with acute glutamate toxicity occurs only after a sustained loss in calcium homeostasis. Processing of NCX3 or other calpain substrates is unlikely to be the primary cause of acute excitotoxicity in cortical neurons. However, a role for calpain as a contributing factor or in response to milder glutamate insults is not excluded.

AB  - Key points Optic nerve axons get less excitable with warming. F-fibre latency does not shorten at temperatures above 30°C. Action potential amplitude falls when the Na+-pump is blocked, an effect speeded by warming. Diuretics reduce the rate of action potential fall in the presence of ouabain. Our data are consistent with electroneutral entry of Na+ occurring in axons and contributing to setting the resting potential. Abstract Raising the temperature of optic nerve from room temperature to near physiological has effects on the threshold, refractoriness and superexcitability of the shortest latency (fast, F) nerve fibres, consistent with hyperpolarization. The temperature dependence of peak impulse latency was weakened at temperatures above 30°C suggesting a temperature-sensitive process that slows impulse propagation. The amplitude of the supramaximal compound action potential gets larger on warming, whereas in the presence of bumetanide and amiloride (blockers of electroneutral Na+ movement), the action potential amplitude consistently falls. This suggests a warming-induced hyperpolarization that is reduced by blocking electroneutral Na+ movement. In the presence of ouabain, the action potential collapses. This collapse is speeded by warming, and exposure to bumetanide and amiloride slows the temperature-dependent amplitude decline, consistent with a warming-induced increase in electroneutral Na+ entry. Blocking electroneutral Na+ movement is predicted to be useful in the treatment of temperature-dependent symptoms under conditions with reduced safety factor (Uhthoff's phenomenon) and provide a route to neuroprotection.

AB  - Abstract Chromium is an essential nutrient required for the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in humans and many animal species. We evaluated whether feeding laying hens with high levels of different chemical forms of trivalent chromium may affect hepatic metabolizing cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-linked enzymes. Modulation of CYP-dependent monooxygenases (which play a pivotal role in the endogenous metabolism) by Cr(III) was tested using either specific substrates as probes of different CYPs or testosterone as a multi-bioprobe. The CYP-supported oxidases were studied in liver microsomes from laying hens fed with diet supplemented with either 25 or 50 ppm chromium chloride as a yeast or as aminoniacinate. Although at 25 ppm no appreciable effects were observed, at 50 ppm a general inactivation of the recorded monooxygenases (ranging from 34% loss for ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase with chromium chloride to 85% loss for O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin with either chromium yeast or aminoniacinate) were achieved in the supplemented groups vs controls. The only exception was the O-dealkylation of pentoxyresorufin, which was significantly boosted by both chromium yeast (up to 65% increase) and chromium aminoniacinate (up to 141%). Measurements of the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of testosterone used as a multi-bioprobe corroborated the inactivating properties of Cr(III) at the higher dose. Taken as a whole, these findings seem to indicate that high levels of Cr(III) supplementation can substantially impair CYP-catalysed drug metabolism in laying hens.

AB  - Summary Liver disease in children differs greatly from that in adults. An infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (CHB) or a suspected inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) requires a referral to a specialist liver centre. Patients with liver disease require regular nutritional assessment. The frequency of assessment is determined by the stage and severity of liver disease. The causes of acute liver failure (ALF) include: infective (hepatitis A, B or C, cytomegalo-virus); IMD including haemochromatosis, galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia; toxins/drugs, (parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy or paracetamol overdose); and irradiation (radiotherapy). There are many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). The chance of requiring liver transplantation increases with advancing age and liver disease progression. Pancreatitis is the result of inflammation within the parenchyma of the pancreas; causes for pancreatitis in children differ from those of adults. Nutrition support is particularly important in acute pancreatitis caused by trauma.

AB  - Abstract Mycotic keratitis (an infection of the cornea) is an important ocular infection, especially in young male outdoor workers. There are two frequent presentations: keratitis due to filamentous fungi (Fusarium, Aspergillus, phaeohyphomycetes and Scedosporium apiospermum are frequent causes) and keratitis due to yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans and other Candida species). In the former, trauma is usually the sole predisposing factor, although previous use of corticosteroids and contact lens wear are gaining importance as risk factors; in the latter, there is usually some systemic or local (ocular) defect. The clinical presentation and clinical features may suggest a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis; increasingly, in vivo (non-invasive) imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography) are also being used for diagnosis. However, microbiological investigations, particularly direct microscopic examination and culture of corneal scrape or biopsy material, still form the cornerstone of diagnosis. In recent years, the PCR has gained prominence as a diagnostic aid for mycotic keratitis, being used to complement microbiological methods; more importantly, this molecular method permits rapid specific identification of the aetiological agent. Although various antifungal compounds have been used for therapy, management of this condition (particularly if deep lesions occur) continues to be problematic; topical natamycin and, increasingly, voriconazole (given by various routes) are key therapeutic agents. Therapeutic surgery, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, is needed when medical therapy fails. Increased awareness of the importance of this condition is likely to spur future research initiatives.
