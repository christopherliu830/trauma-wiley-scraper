AB  - Summary Liver disease in children differs greatly from that in adults. An infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (CHB) or a suspected inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) requires a referral to a specialist liver centre. Patients with liver disease require regular nutritional assessment. The frequency of assessment is determined by the stage and severity of liver disease. The causes of acute liver failure (ALF) include: infective (hepatitis A, B or C, cytomegalo-virus); IMD including haemochromatosis, galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia; toxins/drugs, (parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy or paracetamol overdose); and irradiation (radiotherapy). There are many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). The chance of requiring liver transplantation increases with advancing age and liver disease progression. Pancreatitis is the result of inflammation within the parenchyma of the pancreas; causes for pancreatitis in children differ from those of adults. Nutrition support is particularly important in acute pancreatitis caused by trauma.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - Abstract Mycotic keratitis (an infection of the cornea) is an important ocular infection, especially in young male outdoor workers. There are two frequent presentations: keratitis due to filamentous fungi (Fusarium, Aspergillus, phaeohyphomycetes and Scedosporium apiospermum are frequent causes) and keratitis due to yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans and other Candida species). In the former, trauma is usually the sole predisposing factor, although previous use of corticosteroids and contact lens wear are gaining importance as risk factors; in the latter, there is usually some systemic or local (ocular) defect. The clinical presentation and clinical features may suggest a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis; increasingly, in vivo (non-invasive) imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography) are also being used for diagnosis. However, microbiological investigations, particularly direct microscopic examination and culture of corneal scrape or biopsy material, still form the cornerstone of diagnosis. In recent years, the PCR has gained prominence as a diagnostic aid for mycotic keratitis, being used to complement microbiological methods; more importantly, this molecular method permits rapid specific identification of the aetiological agent. Although various antifungal compounds have been used for therapy, management of this condition (particularly if deep lesions occur) continues to be problematic; topical natamycin and, increasingly, voriconazole (given by various routes) are key therapeutic agents. Therapeutic surgery, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, is needed when medical therapy fails. Increased awareness of the importance of this condition is likely to spur future research initiatives.

AB  - Abstract Background Previous studies have shown that heating the insulin injection site may accelerate insulin absorption. We investigated the pharmacological profile of insulin administered with InsuPatch, a local skin-heating device. Methods In this randomized, crossover study carried out in 56 subjects with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump [mean age 32?±?13.5 years; 23 women; HbA1c:7.8?±?0.9% (62?±?10 mmol/mol) (mean+/?standard deviation)]. Euglycemic glucose clamps were performed after administration of 0.15 units/kg of short-acting insulin analogues. Each subject underwent three clamp procedures: two with the InsuPatch device (day 1 and day 3) and one without the device (day 1 control). The primary endpoints were the following: (1) the change in the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin during the first 60 min post-insulin bolus on day 1 with the InsuPatch device versus day 1 control and (2) parameters to assess the safety of using the device. Results The area under the curve of insulin during the initial 60 min (insulin AUC0?60) after insulin bolus was increased by 29.7?±?7% on day 1 InsuPatch versus day 1 control (p?<?0.01). Maximal post-insulin bolus concentration was 57 mU/L on day 1 InsuPatch versus 47.6 mU/L on day 1 control (p?<?0.01). On day 3 InsuPatch, insulin AUC0?60 was increased by 27.9?±?72% versus day 1 InsuPatch (p?<?0.01). Maximal insulin concentration was 70.4 mU/L versus 57 mU/L, respectively (p?=?0.05). Conclusions The use of the heating device upon administration of short-acting insulin analogues in pump-treated type 1 diabetic patients was found to enhance insulin absorption. This heating device may therefore serve to achieve better meal insulin coverage. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - An approximately eight-year-old female grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) was presented with a two months history of blindness. The radiographic examination showed a dilatation of the proventriculus, ventriculus and gut. Ophthalmoscopy and electroretinography revealed degeneration of the retina. A proventricular dilatation disease was suspected. The bird was euthanased because of deteriorating condition and poor prognosis. The pathological examination showed an atrophy of the ventricular muscles and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of the myenteric plexus of the proventriculus, ventriculus and gut as well as moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of the cerebrum with moderate neuronophagia. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the retina, indicating proventricular dilatation disease, and subsequent retinal degeneration were found. A potential common aetiology for proventricular dilatation disease and blindness is discussed.

High-affinity glutamate uptake was studied in platelets from 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 multi-infarct dementia patients, and 35 age-matched normal controls; it was decreased by 40% in platelets from Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls and with multi-infarct dementia patients. Platelet glutamate uptake could be used as peripheral marker of glutamatergic involvement and as adjunctive diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. Ann Neurol 2000;47:641?643

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Summary This chapter helps the readers to identify the structured approach to the clinical assessment and initial care of a patient requiring transfer, using the ABCDEF (Airway assessment and control; Breathing; Circulation; Disability and Dextrose; Exposure and Everything else; Family) approach to structure primary and secondary surveys. The primary survey (for infants this is called the initial approach assessment and stabilisation of any potentially life-threatening problems) followed by the secondary survey (for infants called the reassessment and planning of definitive care) are outlined. When becoming involved with the care of a patient for potential transfer it is important to follow exactly the same rules that are applied as the initial responder to an emergency. This is delivered through the use of the ABCDEF structure using a primary survey to seek out and treat any potentially life-threatening problems followed by secondary survey ABCDEF reassessment and planning of definitive care.

AB  - In order to standardize and quantify diagnostic information derived from medical histories and case reports given by demented patients, their families or care-providers, a questionnaire has been developed containing 94 questions. The output is categorized by computer into graphic clinical scales which correlate and weigh information relating to seven of the most common causes of dementia. The present investigation assesses the validity of predictive diagnostic classifications derived from the clinical scales tested on admission by correlating them later with final diagnoses determined independently by thorough clinical evaluation including standard diagnostic tests, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance scans. Results of 101 healthy, neurologically normal, age-matched volunteers and 140 patients representative of the more common forms of dementia indicate that correct diagnostic identification was: 75% for dementia secondary to Parkinson's disease, 100% for Huntington's disease, 90.2% for Alzheimer's disease, 82.4% for multi-infarct dementia, 90.0% for posttraumatic dementia, 77.8% for normal-pressure hydrocephalus and 85.7% for Wernicke-Korsakoff dementia. Correct diagnostic assignment was highly significant (P < .0005). The screening questionnaire may prove to be a useful and standard diagnostic tool for clinicians and investigators concerned with epidemiology, prevention and treatment of dementia.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To determine endogenous serum insulin concentration in dogs with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and to compare it to endogenous serum insulin concentration in diabetic dogs with ketonuria but no acidosis (KDM), diabetic dogs with uncomplicated diabetes mellitus (DM) that did not have ketonuria or acidosis, and dogs with non-pancreatic disease (NP). Design: Prospective study. Setting: Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Animals: Forty-four client-owned dogs; 20 dogs with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (7 dogs with DKA, 6 dogs with KDM, and 7 dogs with DM) and 24 dogs with non-pancreatic disease. Interventions: Blood and urine samples were obtained at the time of admission to the hospital. Measurements and main results: Signalment, clinical signs, physical examination findings, and concurrent disease were recorded for all dogs. Blood glucose concentration, venous blood pH, venous blood HCO3? concentration, urinalysis, and endogenous serum insulin concentration were determined in all dogs. Dogs with DKA have significantly decreased endogenous serum insulin concentrations compared to dogs with DM (P?=?0.03) and dogs with non-pancreatic disease (P?=?0.0002), but not compared to dogs with KDM (P?=?0.2). Five of 7 dogs with DKA had detectable endogenous serum insulin concentrations, and 2 of these dogs had endogenous serum insulin concentration within the normal range. Conclusions: Diabetic dogs with ketoacidosis have significantly decreased endogenous serum insulin concentration compared to dogs with uncomplicated diabetes mellitus. However, most dogs with DKA have detectable endogenous serum insulin concentrations, and some dogs with DKA have endogenous serum insulin concentrations within the normal range.

AB  - Abstract The Akt/protein kinase B is critical regulator of cellular homeostasis with diminished Akt activity being associated with dysregulation of cellular metabolism and cell death while Akt over-activation has been linked to inappropriate cell growth and proliferation. Although the regulation of Akt function has been well characterized in vitro, much less is known regarding the function of Akt in vivo. Here we examine how skeletal muscle Akt expression and enzymatic activity are controlled, the role of Akt in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction, stress response glucose utilization, and protein metabolism, and the potential participation of this important molecule in skeletal muscle atrophy, aging, and cancer.

AB  - Abstract Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a persistent or recurrent fever for which the underlying source has not been identified despite diagnostic investigation. In people, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) alone or in combination with computed tomography (CT) is often beneficial in detecting the source of fever when other diagnostics have failed. Veterinary reports describing use of these modalities in animals with fever of unknown origin are currently lacking. Aims of this retrospective case series were to describe 18F-FDG-PET or 18F-FDG-PET/CT findings in a group of dogs with fever of unknown origin. Dogs presenting to a single center between April 2012 and August 2015 were included. A total of four dogs met inclusion criteria and underwent either positron emission tomography (n = 2) or positron emission tomography/CT (n = 2) as a part of their diagnostic investigation. All subjects underwent extensive diagnostic testing prior to 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Initial diagnostic evaluation failed to identify either a cause of fever or an anatomic location of disease in these four dogs. In each dog, positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT was either able to localize or rule out the presence of focal lesion thereby allowing for directed sampling and/or informed disease treatment. Follow up 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans performed in two patients showed improvement of observed abnormalities (n = 1) or detected recurrence of disease allowing for repeated treatment before clinical signs recurred (n = 1). Fever resolved after specific treatment in each dog. Findings from the current study supported the use of positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography/CT as adjunctive imaging modalities for diagnosis and gauging response to therapy in dogs with fever of unknown origin.
