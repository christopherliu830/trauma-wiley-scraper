AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Abstract Glucan phosphate is a water-soluble, yeast-derived, (1 ? 3)-?-D-glucopyranose polymer that has been demonstrated to be a potent immune stimulant. Glucan phosphate administration is associated with stimulation of immunity and a concomitant increase in resistance to a variety of experimentally induced disease states. Preclinical safety evaluation indicates that glucan phosphate does not induce mortality or significant toxicity over a wide dose range. Phase I clinical data indicate that glucan phosphate will ameliorate immunosuppression, stimulate immunity, decrease susceptibility to infection and alter ultimate outcome in trauma patients following laparotomy or thoracotomy. This work reviews the development, characterization, preclinal and clinical evaluation of glucan phosphate.

AB  - Abstract Aim This article presents the results of a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on the regulation of glycaemia among adults admitted to hospital with acute stroke. Background Hyperglycaemia is commonly observed in acute stroke. International stroke guidelines recommend that hyperglycaemia is treated after stroke. Nurses have a key role in the monitoring and management of glycaemia. Design Systematic review. Data sources A search for randomized controlled trials was conducted in MEDLINE and PubMed electronic databases, and original papers published between January 1996?June 2011 were identified. The search was performed using the terms ?stroke?, ?hyperglycaemia?, and ?treatment? combined. Searching of citations from identified studies was also used to supplement electronic searches. The search was limited to adults and English language publications. Review methods A systematic review was conducted for eight studies, meeting the inclusion criteria that: (i) insulin protocols were subjected to randomized controlled trial; and that (ii) only adults admitted to hospital with acute stroke were sampled. The review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis reporting standards. Results Intensive insulin therapy regimes have been investigated in a total of eight trials. Intravenous insulin therapy significantly lowers glucose levels when compared with controls but adherence to glucose monitoring and treatment protocols appeared to pose considerable challenge on nurses in routine stroke care. Trials conducted to date have been on poor to sound quality. Conclusion There is currently no substantive evidence to support aggressive glucose lowering in the acute phase of stroke. Well-conducted, large randomized controlled trials are required.

AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Abstract This study was designed to investigate the effect of quercetin (QE) on bone minerals and biomechanics in insulin-dependent diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by 50?mg?kg?1 intraperitoneal streptozotocin (STZ) in a single dose. The rats were randomly allotted into four experimental groups: A (control), B (non-diabetic?+?QE), C (diabetic), and D (diabetic?+?QE) each containing 10 animals. The diabetic rats received QE (15?mg?kg?1?day?1) for 4 weeks following 8 weeks of STZ injection. Blood samples were taken to determine glucose, insulin, calcium, and magnesium levels. The rats' femora were assessed biomechanically at femoral mid-diaphysis and neck. It was found that QE treatment increased insulin, calcium, and magnesium levels. Three-point bending of the femoral mid-diaphysis and necks showed significantly lower maximum load values (Fmax) in animals in the STZ group than the QE?+?STZ or control groups (p?<?0.05). The results support the conclusion that QE treatment may decrease blood glucose and increase plasma insulin, calcium, and magnesium. QE treatment may also be effective in bone mineral metabolism, biomechanical strength, and bone structure in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Objective Fracture risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance is increased, despite relatively preserved bone mineral density (BMD). In this study, we investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and composite indices of femoral neck strength in Koreans. Design A population-based, cross-sectional study from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Participants About 1243 men and 1433 women Measurements Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Femoral neck width and axis length were measured from hip dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and combined with BMD, weight and height to calculate composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load: compression (CSI), bending (BSI) and impact strength indices (ISI). Results HOMA-IR showed an inverse relationship with CSI, BSI and ISI in both genders before and after adjusting for confounders (P < 0·001?0·029). CSI was more strongly associated with HOMA-IR than BSI and/or ISI in both genders (P < 0·001?0·013). When men were stratified according to HOMA-IR quartiles, all strength indices decreased as the quartile increased, after adjusting for all potential confounders (P for trend <0·001?0·001), whereas CSI and ISI did in women (P for trend = 0·012 and 0·002, respectively). Fasting insulin levels, but not glucose levels, were negatively associated with all strength indices regardless of confounders (P < 0·001?0·044). Conclusions Insulin resistance is associated with low femoral neck strength, particularly against the compressive load. These findings suggest a better approach to evaluate bone health in insulin-resistant individuals.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of ProcalAmine as a source of parenteral nutrition in hospitalized dogs and to report complications possibly referable to its use. Design Retrospective study. Settings Private veterinary teaching hospital. Animals Thirty-six dogs hospitalized in ICU receiving ProcalAmine between October 2010 and March 2013. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results The most common underlying disease process in this population of dogs was trauma (n = 8). Median duration of administration was 4 days and median resting energy requirement provided via ProcalAmine was 33%. ProcalAmine was administered via central catheters in 86% of cases and via peripheral catheters in 14% of cases. The overall mechanical complication rate was 19%. Metabolic complications possibly associated with ProcalAmine administration were documented in 12/36 dogs. Hyponatremia was most commonly identified (n = 6) followed by hyperglycemia (n = 4), hypochloremia (n = 2), azotemia (n = 2), metabolic alkalosis (n = 2), hyperchloremia (n = 1), and metabolic acidosis (n = 1). Conclusion ProcalAmine appears to be relatively safe and a viable option for parenteral nutrition in ill and injured dogs. Due to the potential for electrolyte derangements and other metabolic complications, daily monitoring of these parameters is advisable.

AB  - Summary Many of the topical products noted can be considered ?natural?, such as chitosan, collagen, and alginates. This chapter focuses on a few of the basic natural products used in wound care, including, honey, sugar, yeast extract, and aloe vera. Large areas of necrotic tissue are best surgically debrided prior to application of honey and sugar. Leeches have been used in an attempt to manage hemodynamic imbalance or venous insufficiency in compromised skin. In an attempt to reduce venous stasis, leeches were applied to the tail wound daily over a 4-day period. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been described for medical uses. The medical uses include orthopedics, sports medicine, dentistry, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urogenital surgery, burns and wound healing, cardiothoracic surgery, and maxillofacial surgery. The primary clinical application of PRP is to promote wound healing by increasing the local concentration of growth factors involved in the migration, proliferation, and maturation at the site of injury.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Objectives To compare serum concentrations of homocysteine in healthy dogs and those fitting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and to compare these values to commonly measured B-vitamins. Methods Study dogs were classified into non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis groups and blood was drawn on Day 1 of the patient's hospitalisation for measurement of serum homocysteine, folate and cobalamin concentrations. Homocysteine concentration was measured in 51 clinically healthy dogs to serve as the control group. Results A statistically significant difference was found between the homocysteine concentrations of the healthy group when compared to non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis groups. Homocysteine values were not correlated with folate, cobalamin or APPLEfast severity scores. Homocysteine concentrations were significantly lower in sick dogs when compared to the control group, which is dissimilar to the human population. Clinical Significance The clinical significance of homocysteine changes in critically ill dogs is currently unknown.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.
