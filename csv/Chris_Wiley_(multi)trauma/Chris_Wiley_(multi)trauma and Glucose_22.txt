AB  - ABSTRACT Mast cells, important sensor and effector cells of the immune system, may influence bone metabolism as their number is increased in osteoporotic patients. They are also present during bone fracture healing with currently unknown functions. Using a novel c-Kit-independent mouse model of mast cell deficiency, we demonstrated that mast cells did not affect physiological bone turnover. However, they triggered local and systemic inflammation after fracture by inducing release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of innate immune cells. In later healing stages, mast cells accumulated and regulated osteoclast activity to remodel the bony fracture callus. Furthermore, they were essential to induce osteoclast formation after ovariectomy. Additional in vitro studies revealed that they promote osteoclastogenesis via granular mediators, mainly histamine. In conclusion, mast cells are redundant in physiologic bone turnover but exert crucial functions after challenging the system, implicating mast cells as a potential target for treating inflammatory bone disorders. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary This chapter is an overview of basic patient evaluation with an eye to anesthetic planning. Important things to evaluate are the patient's overall health status with a thorough physical examination, temperament, body condition score, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Basic blood work can include just a Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and Total Protein (TP) in healthy patients who are young with no systemic disease. Other tests will be indicated in patients who are geriatric or who have significant disease. The full gamut of possible tests that can be run are outside of the scope of this chapter.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Abstract? Denture stomatitis is a common recurring problem of the denture wearers. The aetiology of the disease includes infection, trauma and probably a defect in the host defence mechanism. Current thinking suggests an interplay of most of these factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. The extent of interplay of these factors is still a controversy. Candida albicans has been implicated as the causative organism. However, in the light of recent research it is debatable if it is the only causative organism. Recently, cases resistant to antifungal therapy have been reported. In such cases other micro-organisms have been isolated. At the moment, comprehensive management includes meticulous denture hygiene together with anti-fungal or antibacterial therapy and correction of denture faults.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the airway and perioperative management. Beta Blockers have potential beneficial effects when taken perioperatively. In addition to helping prevent/control arrhythmias, beta blockade also helps reduce myocardial oxygen demand that is produced by catecholamine release during stress periods. The most widely accepted theory of the continuation of statin therapy in the perioperative period is due to plaque stabilization. This is thought to occur secondary to the reduction of thrombin-induced expression and lipopolysaccharide induced expression of tissue factor. Assessment for difficult cricothyrotomy can be performed by patient history and physical examination. The mnemonic ?SMART? is a tool that can used to assess for difficulties that may occur: S: Surgery; M: Mass; A: Access or Anatomy; R: Radiation; and T: Tumor. Clinicians should be aware of identifiable factors in patients with difficult airways as these can dictate outcomes.

AB  - Although excessive consumption of ethanol in alcoholic beverages causes multi-organ damage, moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, is protective against all-cause mortality. These protective effects could be due to one or many components of the complex mixture of bioactive compounds present in red wine including flavonols, monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols, highly colored anthocyanins as well as phenolic acids and the stilbene polyphenol, resveratrol. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, firstly in cancer chemoprevention and then later for cardioprotection, has stimulated many studies on the possible mechanisms of action. Further indications for resveratrol have been developed, including the prevention of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These improvements are remarkably similar yet there is an important dichotomy: low doses improve cell survival as in cardio- and neuro-protection yet high doses increase cell death as in cancer treatment. Fewer studies have examined the responses to other components of red wine, but the results have, in general, been similar to resveratrol. If the nonalcoholic constitutents of red wine are to become therapeutic agents, their ability to get to the sites of action needs to be understood. This mini-review summarizes recent studies on the possible mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic uses, and bioavailability of the nonalcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages, in particular resveratrol and other polyphenols.

AB  - Abstract Nanomedicine is a rapidly emerging technology and represents an innovative field for therapy. Nanomaterials have intrinsically defined features for biomedical applications due to the high specific surface area, the amazing diversity, versatility in structure and function and the possibility of surface charge. In particular, the functionalization of targeting or stimuli-responsive unit on the surface of these materials gives them specific targeted therapeutic properties. There are many pediatric lung diseases that could potentially benefit from nanomedicine. Herein, we aim to review various drug carrier systems and release systems specifically targeting pediatric lung diseases. The injection of nanomedicine into in vivo models and their elimination will also be discussed. Finally, the potential toxicity of nanomaterials will be addressed.

AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.
