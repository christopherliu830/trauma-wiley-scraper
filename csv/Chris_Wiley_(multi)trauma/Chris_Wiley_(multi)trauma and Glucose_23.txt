AB  - Abstract Nanomedicine is a rapidly emerging technology and represents an innovative field for therapy. Nanomaterials have intrinsically defined features for biomedical applications due to the high specific surface area, the amazing diversity, versatility in structure and function and the possibility of surface charge. In particular, the functionalization of targeting or stimuli-responsive unit on the surface of these materials gives them specific targeted therapeutic properties. There are many pediatric lung diseases that could potentially benefit from nanomedicine. Herein, we aim to review various drug carrier systems and release systems specifically targeting pediatric lung diseases. The injection of nanomedicine into in vivo models and their elimination will also be discussed. Finally, the potential toxicity of nanomaterials will be addressed.

AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

AB  - Summary Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for most other geriatric emergencies. Deranged glycaemic control may be the first indication of an infection or other acute illness. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia increases with age, and symptoms may be atypical. Long-acting insulin or oral sulphonylureas can cause persistent hypoglycaemia. Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome is associated with potentially lethal dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Complications include infection and thrombosis. Older patients are prone to disorders of thermoregulation due to extreme environmental conditions, medical conditions or medication. Hypothermia can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Heat illness is less common in temperate climates but older patients are particularly vulnerable during heatwaves and as a result of sun-exposure.

AB  - Tendinopathy is a common condition, which has been linked to surrogate measures of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and insulin resistance. This study aimed to compare in vivo measures of the SNS and insulin resistance between individuals with and without Achilles tendinopathy. This case?control study compared Achilles tendinopathy sufferers to healthy controls. SNS activity was quantified using muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), while metabolic status was assessed via a modified glucose tolerance test and fasting lipid panel. Ultrasound tissue characterization assessed tendon structure. Resting MSNA did not differ between the 15 cases and 20 controls. Tendon pain duration in tendinopathy patients was correlated with burst frequency (R2=.32, P=.02) and burst incidence (R2=.41, P=.01) of MSNA. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, there was a trend suggesting fasting glucose was greater in cases (median 4.80, IQR .70 in cases vs 4.51, .38 in controls) and correlated with pain severity (R2=.14, P=.03), but no other metabolic measures were associated with tendon pain/structure. This study indicates that SNS activity is associated with tendon pain duration, building on previous data indicating the SNS is involved in recalcitrant tendinopathy. Metabolic parameters had little relationship with Achilles tendinopathy in this metabolically homogenous sample. Prospective studies are required to uncover the precise relationship between SNS activity, insulin resistance, and tendinopathy.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication in the cat, carrying a mortality rate as high as 26% during initial hospitalization. In humans, the presenting laboratory values can be correlated with the length of hospitalization and survival. To our knowledge, no studies of this kind can be found in the veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of therapy and clinical outcome of cats with DKA based on laboratory values, and whether or not administration of sodium HCO3 had an impact on survival. Only completed medical records of cats treated at the Animal Emergency Center for DKA from January 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. All patients received a standardized protocol for treatment of DKA. Data collected included presenting blood glucose level, presenting venous blood gas values, whether or not bicarbonate therapy was administered, length of hospitalization, and survival. Median duration of hospitalization of survivors was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and comparisons between groups performed using the log-rank test. Differences in laboratory values between survivors and non-survivors were compared using a one-sided unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test. Twenty medical records fit the study criteria. There were 12 male and 8 female cats, of which 14 were released to owner care and 6 died in the hospital (5 euthanized). Median duration of hospitalization among survivors was 4.5 days. There was a trend toward increased hospital stay in cats presenting with a blood glucose >269?mg/dL (3 days versus 5 days; p=0.0685). There was a trend for nonsurvivors to have pCO2 <21.5?mmHg (p=0.063), and K+<3.65?mmol/L (p=0.063). Eight cats presented with HCO3 <10?mmol/L. Of these, 2 were administered sodium HCO3. In conclusion, there was no statistically significant correlation between presenting laboratory values and outcome of cats with DKA. Those presenting with a pCO2<21.5?mmol/L or K+<3.65 mEq/L may have a greater chance for morbidity. There does not appear to be an association between sodium HCO3 administration and outcome in these cats. Additional case evaluations would provide greater power in confirming the validity of these preliminary results.

AB  - Summary This chapter commences with the management of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). It is recommended to consider vasculitis in the patient with systemic symptoms and headache or evidence of organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is based on the pattern of organ injury, characteristic features on imaging, the size of involved blood vessels and histological findings on biopsy. GCA usually presents with new-onset headache in older people, associated with constitutional upset; it carries a significant risk (20-30%) of visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy, and so needs urgent assessment and treatment. Typical presentations of acute vasculitis include headache, neurological presentation with stroke, hearing loss, and haemoptysis. With the exception of suspected GCA, early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy is rarely needed, and should not be given unless advised by a specialist. The chapter also presents information on considerations in suspected GCA and new presentation of suspected systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Abstract We have compared several serum-free media for the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and assessed the extent of differentiation in several ways including as to active tension generation capability. C2C12 cells were allowed to differentiate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing Ham's F-12 (F-12), AIM-V (AIM), 0.2% Ultroser-G in DMEM (Ult-G), and 0.1% Sericin in DMEM (Sericin), compared with in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (HS) or 2% calf serum (CS). C2C12 differentiation was assessed as the extent of myotube formation, glucose metabolism, protein expression, sarcomere formation, and active tension generation. All serum-free media examined were capable of inducing myotube formation and the expression of muscle-specific proteins. All serum-free media except for F-12 gave the sarcomere structure. Active tension generation was observed for cells that differentiated in AIM and Ult-G, but the active tension generated by C2C12 cells that differentiated in Ult-G was only ?25% in the case of myotubes that formed in HS. The addition of Ult-G to the AIM resulted in improvement of the active tension generation capability, the active tension generated being ?3.4? compared to that in HS. The approach for assessing muscle cell differentiation presented in this study will be suitable for other studies that involve the differentiation of muscle cells. Biotechnol.

AB  - Voltage-gated K+ channels of the Kv7 family underlie the neuronal M current that regulates action potential firing. Suppression of M current increases excitability and its enhancement can silence neurons. We here show that three of five Kv7 channels undergo strong enhancement of their activity by oxidative modification induced by physiological concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. A triple cysteine pocket in the channel S2?S3 linker is critical for this effect. Oxidation-induced enhancement of M current produced a hyperpolarization and a dramatic reduction of action potential firing frequency in rat sympathetic neurons. As hydrogen peroxide is robustly produced during hypoxia-induced oxidative stress, we used an oxygen/glucose deprivation neurodegeneration model that showed neuronal death to be severely accelerated by M current blockade. Such blockade had no effect on survival of normoxic neurons. This work describes a novel pathway of M-channel regulation and suggests a role for M channels in protective neuronal silencing during oxidative stress.

AB  - Purpose The term ?chemobrain? is sometimes used to denote deficits in neuropsychological functioning that may occur as a result of cancer treatment. As breast cancer survivors now commonly reach late life, it is not known whether previous exposure to chemotherapy may affect long-term risk for cognitive impairment. To help address this concern, this study tested whether successfully surviving chemotherapy earlier in life was associated with later differences in brain metabolic function as an older adult compared to controls. This question was examined using positron emission tomography measures of brain glucose metabolism in elderly women cancer survivors. Methods Breast cancer survivors (N?=?10), currently free of recurrent cancer and without a diagnosis of a cognitive disorder, were compared to matched healthy controls (N?=?10). All subjects were imaged at rest with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Images were analyzed semi-quantitatively using the Alzheimer's Discrimination Tool and a volume of interest-based approach derived from co-registered magnetic resonance imaging. Results Relative [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (normalized to global) was significantly lower in the survivors compared with control subjects in bilateral orbital frontal regions, consistent with differences between the groups in cognition and executive function (i.e., Trail Making Test, Part B and mini-mental state examination) and despite no significant differences with respect to age, education, intelligence, or working memory. None of the survivors and only one control manifested a global positron emission tomography score consistent with an Alzheimer's disease metabolic pattern. Conclusion Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy may manifest long-term changes in brain glucose metabolism indicative of subtle frontal hypometabolism, a finding consistent with results from neuropsychological testing and other imaging modalities.
