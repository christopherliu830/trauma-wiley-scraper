AB  - Ranched southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii were fed baitfishes supplemented with vitamins (predominantly E and C) or vitamins and immunostimulants, nucleotides and ?-glucans, over 12 weeks after transfer and monitored for enhancement in immune response, health and performance through their 19 week grow-out period. Fish from two different tows were sampled separately at three different sampling points: at transfer to grow-out pontoons, at 8 weeks post-transfer and at harvest, 19 weeks post-transfer. Lysozyme activity was enhanced during vitamin supplementation compared to control fish. Performance (i.e. survival, condition index and crude fat), health (i.e. blood plasma variables including pH, osmolality, cortisol, lactate and glucose) and alternative complement activity were not commonly improved through diet supplementation. There were some tow-specific improvements in performance through vitamin supplementation including survival, selected parasite prevalence and intensity, and alternative complement activity. Immunostimulant supplementation also showed a tow-specific improvement in plasma cortisol level. Tow-specific responses may suggest that life history, previous health condition and husbandry can affect the success of vitamin and immunostimulant enhancement of immune response, health and performance of ranched T. maccoyii.

AB  - Abstract The receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand binding protein that was initially described as an AGEs-binding protein. Other proteins, some of them classified as danger signals or alarmins have been described as RAGE ligands. Of note, RAGE shares some of its ligands with some member of the Toll-like receptor family. Once RAGE is engaged by any of its ligands, the receptor is able to trigger robust pro-inflammatory cellular responses. At present, RAGE has emerged as a relevant actor in the onset and development of chronic inflammation, which underlies many human diseases. Key Concepts The receptor of advanced glycation end products is a multi-ligand receptor. RAGE variants are mainly originated by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage. RAGE and TLRs share common ligands and signalling pathways. RAGE activation is associated with activation of pro-inflammatory signalling. RAGE activation by AGEs play a key a role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Most of the misfolded proteins linked to neurodegeneration act as RAGE ligands. RAGE activation plays a key role in the disturbance of endothelial functions and cardiovascular homeostasis. RAGE has been regarded as the bridge association between chronic inflammation and cancer. RAGE activation in tumour cells promotes proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis.

AB  - Oestrogens are powerful endogenous and exogenous neuroprotective hormones in animal models of brain injury, including focal cerebral ischaemia. This protective effect has been demonstrated under a variety of different treatments and injury paradigms, such as in vivo and in vitro stroke conditions. Neuroprotection in the central nervous system by progesterone is less defined. In the present study, cultured cortical and midbrain mouse neurones and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were exposed to combined glucose-serum deprivation (CGSD), which is regarded as a reliable model mimicking the effects of ischaemia in vitro. Cell viability was assayed using lactate dehydrogenase release and metabolic activity. Conditions for CGSD treatment were chosen to yield half-maximal cell death rates. The validity of CGSD in vitro was compared with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo. CGSD for 4?h induced half-maximal neuronal cell death. MCAO in vivo for the same period resulted in significant neuronal loss, also suggesting the validity of CGSD as a suitable stroke-like in vitro model. Combined steroid treatment (17?-oestradiol and progesterone) but not the application of single steroids abolished CGSD-induced cell death of cortical neurones in vitro. By contrast, no cell protection was found in midbrain neurones or neuroblastoma cells. The co-application of oestrogen (ICI 182,780) or progesterone (RU-486) receptor antagonists did not obviously counteract the protective steroid effects. This suggests the operation of nonclassical steroid mechanisms and their implication in mediation of hormonal effects. The surplus of combined protective hormonal effects might be a result of the observed influence of progesterone application on neuronal oestradiol synthesis. The data obtained in the present study clearly highlight the potential of a combined steroid treatment under toxic degenerative brain pathologies.

AB  - Obligatory nitrogen losses due to paralysis in the spinal cord-injured (SCI) patient prevent positive nitrogen balance (NB) regardless of the calorie and protein intakes. Ten patients with SCI and 20 controls with nonspinal cord injury (NSCI) matched for time, sex, age, and injury severity score (ISS) were admitted to our Level I trauma center. In both groups, total nutritional support was delivered within 72 hours of admission based on predicted energy expenditures (PEE = Harris-Benedict equation x 1.2 x 1.6) and 2 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). Subsequent changes in nutrient delivery were based on NB. No SCI patient established positive NB during the 7-week period following injury despite an average delivery of 2.4 g of protein/kg IBW and 120% of the PEE at the time of peak negative NB (-10.5). In six SCI patients, an average increase of 25% in delivered protein and 12% in delivered calories over a 1-week period effected no change in average NB (-7.4 us -6.8). Indirect calorimetry in five SCI patients showed that calorie intakes were 110% more than average measured energy expenditures. In contrast, 17 of 20 NCSI patients achieved positive NB within 3 weeks of admission. They required an average delivery of 2.3 g of protein/kg IBW and 110% of PEE to reach positive NB. These data demonstrate the phenomenon of obligatory negative NB acutely following SCI. Aggressive attempts to achieve positive NB in these patients will fail and result in overfeeding.

AB  - The inhibition of microbial growth is the first step toward avoiding the formation of biofilms. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the microbiostatic activity of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) with three commonly used antiseptic agents to find an alternative to or supplementary concept for antiseptic treatment. The efficacy of two CAP generating devices ? the plasma jet kINPen09? and a hollow dielectric barrier electrode (HDBD) ? both working with argon with or without admixture of 1% oxygen, was compared with chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG 0.0001 and 0.00000625%), polyhexanide (PHMB 0.0001 and 0.000025%) and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT 0.0002 and 0.00005%). The antiseptics were added to the planktonic stage of the biofilm-forming strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa SG 81, Staphylococcus epidermidis RP 62A, Streptococcus mutans DSM 20523 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 resp. SC 5314. The antiseptics were present during the subsequent cultivation period (32.5?h), whereas CAP was applied for only 60?s with the same cultivation period after the exposition. During the cultivation period, growth was measured every hour by optical density and analyzed with the calculated area under the curve (AUC) to determine the delay of exponential growth. Except for the higher resistance of C. albicans against PHMB and S. mutans against CHG, P. aeruginosa was the most resistant test organism against the other antiseptic treatments. OCT 0.0002% was the most effective among the tested antiseptic agents. The plasma jet did not differ from OCT in its efficacy against C. albicans and S. mutans. Against P. aeruginosa and both Candida strains, the plasma jet was more effective than against both Gram-positive test strains. In terms of efficacy against Candida spp., the HDBD (dielectric barrier discharge plasma) did not differ significantly from the plasma jet with argon plasma; in contrast, the bacteriostatic efficacy was significantly higher. While the addition of 1% O2 did not change the efficacy of the plasma jet, the efficacy of the HDBD against S. epidermidis increased significantly. The antimicrobial efficacy of CAP as demonstrated in earlier studies was confirmed with planktonic microorganisms showing delayed growth during cultivation for 32.5?h after a single application of CAP for 60?s. Short treatment with CAP could be an effective alternative or supplement to conventional antiseptics, for example, to inhibit the growth of microorganisms in an infected wound. OCT in the concentration used here showed the best microbial growth inhibitory results among the antiseptics.

AB  - Acquired neuromuscular weakness due to critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) frequently develops in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for more than 1?week. CIPNM may present with muscle weakness and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, but is discovered more often and earlier by electrophysiological examination. In this review, the incidence, clinical and electrophysiological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of CIPNM will be described. Risk factors for CIPNM are sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the severity of multi-organ failure. Presence of CIPNM is associated with higher mortality rate, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and prolonged rehabilitation. The majority of survivors with CIPNM have persistent functional disabilities and a reduced quality of life. There is need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize CIPNM in critically ill patients.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - Abstract The in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) is now a powerful technique in biomedical research, especially for tracking specific cells in circulatory system. The current fluorescence-based IVFC is limited to visible spectrum, while near infrared (NIR) dyes have their advantages, such as deeper penetration, less absorption and less scattering for NIR fluorescence. Here, using an NIR in vivo flow cytometer with a 785 nm laser excitation, the measurement of fluorescent dye IR-780 labeled circulating cells is demonstrated. Representative peaks corresponding to NIR fluorescent circulating cells are detected and quantified. In addition, blood flow information, including the blood flow velocity and flow volume per unit time, is obtained. By simultaneous detection of IR-780 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) signals from dual labeled cells, the IR-780 is shown to be a suitable fluorescent dye for multicolor detection by IVFC, including NIR. Thus, the IVFC is extended to the NIR range and shows potential application in biomedical research. ? 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine physiologic responses to apnea-induced severe hypoxemia in anesthetized horses. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six university-owned horses with a median (range) body weight of 500 (220?510) kg and aged 13.5 (0.8?24.0) years scheduled for euthanasia. Methods Xylazine?midazolam?ketamine-anesthetized horses breathing room air spontaneously were instrumented with a facial artery catheter for pressure measurement and blood sampling, and were made apneic with atlanto-occipital intrathecal lidocaine (4 mg kg?1). Cardiopulmonary, biochemical and hematologic variables were recorded before (baseline) and every minute for 10 minutes after lidocaine injection. Results PaO2 values were: baseline, 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa); 1 minute, 28 mmHg (3.8 kPa); 2 minutes, 18 mmHg (2.4 kPa); 3 minutes, 15 mmHg (2.0 kPa), and 4?10 minutes, (8?11 mmHg (1.1?1.5 kPa). PaCO2 values were: baseline, 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa); 1 minute, 61 mmHg (8.1 kPa), and 2?10 minutes, 64?66 mmHg (8.5?8.8 kPa). Base excess values at baseline, 1 minute and 2?10 minutes were 5.3 mmol L?1, 6.5 mmol L?1 and 7.0?8.1 mmol L?1, respectively. Pulse rates at baseline, 1 minute and 2?7 minutes were 36, 53 and 54?85 beats minute?1, respectively. Asystole occurred at 8 minutes. Pulse pressures were 50 mmHg at baseline and 1 minute, and 39 mmHg, 31 mmHg, 22 mmHg, 17 mmHg and 1?9 mmHg at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6?10 minutes, respectively. Lactate was 0.9 mmol L?1 at baseline, progressively increasing to 1.7?2.4 mmol L?1 at 7?10 minutes. Packed cell volume increased after 7 minutes of apnea. There were no other major changes. Conclusions and clinical relevance Apnea immediately exacerbated hypoxemia and hypercapnia and rapidly caused hemodynamic instability. Apnea in hypoxemic anesthetized horses is associated with a serious risk for progress to cardiovascular collapse.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Changes in protein subdomains through alternative splicing often modify protein-protein interactions, altering biological processes. A relevant example is that of the stress-induced up-regulation of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) splice variant, a common response in various tissues. In germ cells of male transgenic TgR mice, AChE-R excess associates with reduced sperm differentiation and sperm counts. To explore the mechanism(s) by which AChE-R up-regulation affects spermatogenesis, we identified AChE-R's protein partners through a yeast two-hybrid screen. In meiotic spermatocytes from TgR mice, we detected AChE-R interaction with the scaffold protein RACK1 and elevated apoptosis. This correlated with reduced scavenging by RACK1 of the pro-apoptotic TAp73, an outcome compatible with the increased apoptosis. In contrast, at later stages in sperm development, AChE-R's interaction with the glycolytic enzyme enolase-α elevates enolase activity. In transfected cells, enforced AChE-R excess increased glucose uptake and adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) levels. Correspondingly, TgR sperm cells display elevated ATP levels, mitochondrial hyperactivity and increased motility. In human donors' sperm, we found direct association of sperm motility with AChE-R expression. Interchanging interactions with RACK1 and enolase-α may hence enable AChE-R to affect both sperm differentiation and function by participating in independent cellular pathways.

AB  - Introduction:? A bioartificial kidney, which consists of a continuous hemofilter and a bioartificial tubule device using proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), is desired to develop for preventing long-term complications in hemodialysis patients. A bioartificial tubule device should function for a long duration in terms of the simplicity and the economy. Continuous hemofiltration with 10?L/day of filtrate could maintain plasma urea, creatinine and ?2-microglobulin in patients at low levels compared to those in standard hemodialysis patients. Methods:? 6 bioartificial tubule devices, in which LLC-PK1 cells were grown on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber capillaries (membrane area: 0.4?m2, 1600 fibers), were used to evaluate the transport ability of H2O, glucose and Na+, and leak rates of urea and creatinine for 2 weeks when the medium containing 50?mg/dL of urea and 5.0?mg/dL of creatinine was perfused inside of the cell-attached membranes and another medium containing 2.5?g/dL of albumin was perfused outside of the membranes. Scanning electron micrograph of cross-sectional findings of the hollow fibers was taken at 6, 10, and 14 days after formation of confluence. Results:? By conversion into 1?m2 of membrane area, transport of H2O, glucose, and Na+ was 6266?± 995?mL/day, 22832?±?7240 mg/day, and 941.3?±?180 mEq/day, respectively at 6 days after confluence. Leak rates of urea and creatinine across the cell-attached membranes were 22?±?6.1% and 19.2?±?4.9 with albumin addition, whereas 13.1?±?1.9% and 12.2?±?1.6 without albumin addition. Transport capacity of these components and the leak rates had continued for 10?13 days, and decreased thereafter because of the formation of the multilayers. Bioartificial tubule devices with membrane area 1.0?m2 can reach the targeted amounts of H2O, glucose, and Na+ transports when 6?L of 10?L/day of hemofiltrate has to be regenerated, substituting 4?L with meal and drinks.

AB  - Summary Background The objective of this study was to determine factors predictive of need for mechanical ventilation (MV) upon discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among patients who receive a tracheostomy during their stay. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS) database. Patients <18 years old admitted between 2009-2011 who required MV for at least 3 days and received a tracheostomy during their PICU stay were included. Results A total of 680 pediatric patients from 74 PICUs were included, of whom 347 (51%) remained on MV at the time of PICU discharge. Neonates (30/38, 79%) and infants (129/203, 64%) required MV at PICU discharge after tracheostomy more often than adolescents (66/141, 47%) and children (122/298, 41%). Time on MV pre-tracheostomy was longer among those who required MV at discharge (median 18.3 vs. 13.8 days, P?<?0.0001); however, number of failed extubations was similar (median 1 for both groups, P?=?0.97). On mixed-effects multivariable regression analysis, the age categories of neonate (OR?2.9, 95%CI 1.1?7.6, P?=?0.03), and infant (OR?1.7, 95%CI 1.1?2.8, P?=?0.03), and ventilator days prior to tracheostomy (OR?1.01, 95%CI 1.0?1.02, P?=?0.01) were significantly associated with increased odds of MV upon PICU discharge, while being a trauma admission was associated with decreased odds (OR?0.45, 95%CI 0.28?0.73, P?=?0.001). Conclusions Younger patients and those with prolonged courses of MV prior to tracheostomy are more likely to continue to need MV upon PICU discharge.

AB  - Abstract The meglitinides offer an opportunity to target specifically the postprandial hyperglycemia that occurs commonly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Their rapid onset and short duration of action leads to more ?physiological? release of insulin and partially restores the pattern of postprandial insulin secretion that is defective in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This potentially allows tighter glycemic control while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. As prandial glucose regulators they allow flexible dosing such that a tablet need only be taken before a patient has a meal. Repaglinide in particular has been shown to reduce HbA1c and is well-tolerated by patients both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents. It appears to have some advantages from head-to-head studies with sulfonylureas. Nateglinide appears to produce a faster early-phase insulin response that gives it the potential to produce less hypoglycemia, but randomized controlled trials in comparison with sulfonylureas are lacking. Both agents are more expensive than sulfonylureas. Formal data regarding cost-effectiveness are not currently available. However, their flexible administration may be of benefit in certain subgroups such as shift-workers and those with flexible lifestyles. Efficacy in early diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance is currently being investigated. The ability to flexibly dose with these agents makes them useful in patients with flexible lifestyles. Macrovascular and microvascular outcome data for the meglitinides are awaited.

AB  - Abstract Aim To evaluate Save-A-Tooth (SAT), EMT Toothsaver (EMT) and Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for their influence on the viability and proliferative capacity of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLFs). Methodology Primary HPDLFs were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates and exposed to SAT, EMT, HBSS and water (negative control) for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h at room temperature (22 °C). After each exposure time, cell viability was measured through quantifying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using a luminescent dye. The proliferative capacity was also quantified using the PrestoBlue assay after 12 or 24 h storage in each medium. The data were analysed statistically by two-way anova and post hoc Least Significant Difference (LSD) test (P < 0.05). The morphology of the cells after 12 h storage was also investigated through live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit together with fluorescence microscopy. Results There was no significant difference in cell viability amongst HBSS, SAT and EMT groups up to 6 h. SAT was effective in maintaining cell viability only up to 12 h and then became detrimental to HPDLF; after 24 h, the effectiveness of SAT in maintaining cell viability was similar to that of water (P > 0.05). Amongst all the media, only EMT could maintain the proliferative capacity of HPDLFs significantly higher than the negative control, that is water (P < 0.05) after 24 h storage. Conclusion EMT maintained the proliferative capacity of HPDLFs after 24 h storage.
