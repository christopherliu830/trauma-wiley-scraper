AB  - Malnutrition and weight loss negatively affect outcomes in surgical cancer patients. Decades of research have sought to identify the most appropriate use of nutrition support in these patients. National and international guidelines help to direct clinicians? use of nutrition support in surgical patients, but a number of specific issues concerning the use of nutrition support continue to evolve. This review focuses on 5 key issues related to perioperative nutrition support in cancer patients: (1) Which perioperative cancer patients should receive nutrition support? (2) How can the nutrition status and requirements of these patients be optimally assessed? (3) What is the optimal route of administration (parenteral nutrition vs enteral nutrition) and composition of nutrition support in this setting? (4) When should feedings be initiated? (5) What is the role of glycemic control in these patients?

AB  - Abstract Changes in protein subdomains through alternative splicing often modify protein-protein interactions, altering biological processes. A relevant example is that of the stress-induced up-regulation of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) splice variant, a common response in various tissues. In germ cells of male transgenic TgR mice, AChE-R excess associates with reduced sperm differentiation and sperm counts. To explore the mechanism(s) by which AChE-R up-regulation affects spermatogenesis, we identified AChE-R's protein partners through a yeast two-hybrid screen. In meiotic spermatocytes from TgR mice, we detected AChE-R interaction with the scaffold protein RACK1 and elevated apoptosis. This correlated with reduced scavenging by RACK1 of the pro-apoptotic TAp73, an outcome compatible with the increased apoptosis. In contrast, at later stages in sperm development, AChE-R's interaction with the glycolytic enzyme enolase-α elevates enolase activity. In transfected cells, enforced AChE-R excess increased glucose uptake and adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) levels. Correspondingly, TgR sperm cells display elevated ATP levels, mitochondrial hyperactivity and increased motility. In human donors' sperm, we found direct association of sperm motility with AChE-R expression. Interchanging interactions with RACK1 and enolase-α may hence enable AChE-R to affect both sperm differentiation and function by participating in independent cellular pathways.

AB  - Summary Background The objective of this study was to determine factors predictive of need for mechanical ventilation (MV) upon discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among patients who receive a tracheostomy during their stay. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS) database. Patients <18 years old admitted between 2009-2011 who required MV for at least 3 days and received a tracheostomy during their PICU stay were included. Results A total of 680 pediatric patients from 74 PICUs were included, of whom 347 (51%) remained on MV at the time of PICU discharge. Neonates (30/38, 79%) and infants (129/203, 64%) required MV at PICU discharge after tracheostomy more often than adolescents (66/141, 47%) and children (122/298, 41%). Time on MV pre-tracheostomy was longer among those who required MV at discharge (median 18.3 vs. 13.8 days, P?<?0.0001); however, number of failed extubations was similar (median 1 for both groups, P?=?0.97). On mixed-effects multivariable regression analysis, the age categories of neonate (OR?2.9, 95%CI 1.1?7.6, P?=?0.03), and infant (OR?1.7, 95%CI 1.1?2.8, P?=?0.03), and ventilator days prior to tracheostomy (OR?1.01, 95%CI 1.0?1.02, P?=?0.01) were significantly associated with increased odds of MV upon PICU discharge, while being a trauma admission was associated with decreased odds (OR?0.45, 95%CI 0.28?0.73, P?=?0.001). Conclusions Younger patients and those with prolonged courses of MV prior to tracheostomy are more likely to continue to need MV upon PICU discharge.

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Introduction:? A bioartificial kidney, which consists of a continuous hemofilter and a bioartificial tubule device using proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), is desired to develop for preventing long-term complications in hemodialysis patients. A bioartificial tubule device should function for a long duration in terms of the simplicity and the economy. Continuous hemofiltration with 10?L/day of filtrate could maintain plasma urea, creatinine and ?2-microglobulin in patients at low levels compared to those in standard hemodialysis patients. Methods:? 6 bioartificial tubule devices, in which LLC-PK1 cells were grown on the inner surfaces of hollow fiber capillaries (membrane area: 0.4?m2, 1600 fibers), were used to evaluate the transport ability of H2O, glucose and Na+, and leak rates of urea and creatinine for 2 weeks when the medium containing 50?mg/dL of urea and 5.0?mg/dL of creatinine was perfused inside of the cell-attached membranes and another medium containing 2.5?g/dL of albumin was perfused outside of the membranes. Scanning electron micrograph of cross-sectional findings of the hollow fibers was taken at 6, 10, and 14 days after formation of confluence. Results:? By conversion into 1?m2 of membrane area, transport of H2O, glucose, and Na+ was 6266?± 995?mL/day, 22832?±?7240 mg/day, and 941.3?±?180 mEq/day, respectively at 6 days after confluence. Leak rates of urea and creatinine across the cell-attached membranes were 22?±?6.1% and 19.2?±?4.9 with albumin addition, whereas 13.1?±?1.9% and 12.2?±?1.6 without albumin addition. Transport capacity of these components and the leak rates had continued for 10?13 days, and decreased thereafter because of the formation of the multilayers. Bioartificial tubule devices with membrane area 1.0?m2 can reach the targeted amounts of H2O, glucose, and Na+ transports when 6?L of 10?L/day of hemofiltrate has to be regenerated, substituting 4?L with meal and drinks.

AB  - Summary Obesity is rising in the obstetric population, yet there is an absence of services and guidance for the management of maternal obesity. This systematic review aimed to investigate relationships between obesity and impact on obstetric care. Literature was systematically searched for cohort studies of pregnant women with anthropometric measurements recorded within 16-weeks gestation, followed up for the term of the pregnancy, with at least one obese and one comparison group. Two researchers independently data-extracted and quality-assessed each included study. Outcome measures were those that directly or indirectly impacted on maternity resources. Primary outcomes included instrumental delivery, caesarean delivery, duration of hospital stay, neonatal intensive care, neonatal trauma, haemorrhage, infection and 3rd/4th degree tears. Meta-analysis shows a significant relationship between obesity and increased odds of caesarean and instrumental deliveries, haemorrhage, infection, longer duration of hospital stay and increased neonatal intensive care requirement. Maternal obesity significantly contributes to a poorer prognosis for mother and baby during delivery and in the immediate post-partum period. National clinical guidelines for management of obese pregnant women, and public health interventions to help safeguard the health of mothers and their babies are urgently required.

AB  - In this article the authors discuss the development, use and auditing of nursing care protocols, which have been implemented and form a guide for nurses caring for patients with fractured neck of femur in Southend Health Care NHS Trust. The development of these protocols occurred after an initial medical audit, which was followed by a far larger multidisciplinary audit, and both of these revealed there was need for changes in the clinical management of such patients; subsequently a large multi disciplinary working group worked together to develop care protocols/pathways to enable closure of the audit loop. The reasons for focusing on fractured neck of femur as a high priority condition are also discussed. All professional groups caring for these patients were involved in the multi disciplinary working group, which was formed to close the audit loop and to improve clinical practices by increasing the systemization and coordination of care. The development of the nursing protocols represented an extremely important part of this process, and the care of about 700 patients was examined during this work. The audit and associated subsequent work have resulted in direct improvements to both patient care and health outcomes, and the authors conclude that there is great value in developing multi disciplinary protocols, particularly those involving nurses, because they spend more time with patients whilst they are in hospital than any other professional group. The benefits of these nursing protocols have been multifold, in particular they have facilitated a clearer flow of patients through the hospital, increased awareness of responsibilities and reduced duplication of effort, and ensured patients receive the best possible care over the 24-hour period.

AB  - This review updates similar articles published in the Journal of Family Therapy in 2001 and 2009. It presents evidence from meta-analyses, systematic literature reviews and controlled trials for the effectiveness of systemic interventions for families of children and adolescents with various difficulties. In this context, systemic interventions include both family therapy and other family-based approaches such as parent training. The evidence supports the effectiveness of systemic interventions either alone or as part of multi-modal programmes for sleep, feeding and attachment problems in infancy; child abuse and neglect; conduct problems (including childhood behavioural difficulties, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, delinquency and drug misuse); emotional problems (including anxiety, depression, grief, bipolar disorder and self-harm); eating disorders (including anorexia, bulimia and obesity); somatic problems (including enuresis, encopresis, medically unexplained symptoms and poorly controlled asthma and diabetes) and first episode psychosis.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief summary of natural history of ursids and practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases. It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - Summary The survival of transfused (allogeneic) red cells differs little if at all from that of autologous red cells, as shown by the close similarity of results obtained with differential agglutination and with DF32P. The shorter the red cell survival, the less important are the technical inaccuracies of the labelling method. In haemolytic anaemia caused by an inherited red cell defect, compatible red cells are expected to survive normally. Breakdown of glucose is the only source of energy for red cells. Phosphorylation of glucose is the source of energy for stored red cells and cannot continue when adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is depleted. In estimating the post-transfusion survival of stored red cells, allowance must be made for the significant differences between donors. Satisfactory storage of red cells in the frozen state became possible when it was discovered that red cells, mixed with glycerol, could be frozen and thawed without damage.

AB  - Abstract Hypovolemia and hypotension in traumatized patients as well as those undergoing long-lasting surgical procedures lead to hypoperfusion of tissues. Combined with the trauma of flap elevation and the warm ischemia during performance of the anastomoses, hypoperfusion of flap tissues may lead to flap failure. The influence of hypovolemia, ischemia and reperfusion on flap macro- and microcirculation was studied in an acute experiment on a new musculocutaneous pectoralis flap developed in minipigs. Using a multichannel laser Doppler system we studied, simultaneously and continuously, microcirculatory flow (MBF) in both the skin and muscle of the flap as well as in the contralateral control skin and muscle in anesthetized minipigs (n = 7). Measurements were done before and after raising the flap, after 90 min of flap ischemia, during mild to moderate hypovolemia (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% blood loss) and during and after restoration of blood volume. Electromagnetic flowmetry was used to measure total blood flow (TBF) to the flap. All animals remained hemodynamically stable during the experiment. The flap MBF decreased by 20% in the skin and 25% in the muscle after flap elevation with no changes in the control skin and muscle. After flap ischemia and reperfusion, MBF returned to post-elevation values while TBF showed a significant increase as compared to MBF (P<0.05). Hypovolemia caused a gradual drop in cardiac output (25%) and mean arterial pressure (40%), but both recovered above the baseline after reinfusion of shed blood. Hypovolemia also caused a 60% reduction in MBF in both flap skin and muscle, and only 20?23% in control skin and muscle (P<0.01). After reinfusion of shed blood the MBF in the flap remained 30?40% below and the TBF increased 20% over the baseline. The MBF in control skin and muscle increased more than 20% over baseline (P<0.01). It was concluded that MBF in flap skin and muscle decreased by approximately 20?25% as a consequence of flap elevation, while central parameters remained normal. It was shown that even during moderate hypovolemia, MBF in the flap might decrease to critical levels. We suggest that intensive monitoring of central hemodynamics and continuous LDF monitoring of the flap during and after surgery should be performed in order to restore the blood volume expeditiously and prevent irreversible damage to flap tissues. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? Modified Bo-Yang-Hwan-O-Tang (mBHT) is an improved herbal formula of BHT, which has been widely used to treat ischaemic stroke in East Asia, by the addition of five herbs having anti-ischaemic properties. In this study, we investigated whether mBHT would reduce cerebral ischaemic injury in rats. Methods? Sprague?Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and subsequent 22-h reperfusion. mBHT was administered either intraperitoneally twice 15?min before and 15?min after, or orally once 30?min or 120?min after the onset of MCAO (50 or 200?mg/kg each). Key findings? Intraperitoneal administration of mBHT markedly reduced the cerebral infarct size and neurological deficit caused by MCAO/reperfusion. mBHT treatment also significantly improved long-term survival rate after cerebral ischaemic injury. Oral administration of mBHT 30?min after ischaemia also markedly reduced the infarct size after cerebral ischaemia. The anti-ischaemic effect of mBHT was significantly, but not fully, reduced when mBHT-induced hypothermia was abolished. In cultured cortical neurons, we further found that mBHT decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation-evoked neuronal injury by inhibiting production of reactive oxygen species, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and activation of caspase-3. However, mBHT did not inhibit N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Conclusions? Taken together, our data suggest that mBHT has multiple anti-ischaemic properties and would be a good therapeutic herbal prescription for the treatment of cerebral ischaemic stroke.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2012; 19: 402?408 ? 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Background:? Physical and molecular mechanisms for the neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia are not completely understood, and new therapeutic applications incorporating hypothermia remain to be developed and tested. Clinically relevant animal models of therapeutic hypothermia are not well established or consistent. Objectives:? The objective was to develop and test an inexpensive small animal therapeutic hypothermia system that models those in widespread clinical use and verify that such a system confers neuroprotection in a rat model of global brain ischemia. Methods:? A water-cooled extracorporeal system and attendant anesthesia/sedation protocol were developed and tested. In Stage 1, animals were instrumented for brain, temporalis, and rectal temperature monitoring, and the system was tested for its effect on temperature and hemodynamics. In Stage 2, animals were instrumented for rectal temperature only, subjected to global brain ischemia by two-vessel occlusion and hypotension for 8?minutes, and given either sham therapy (37°C) or hypothermia (32°C) for 4?hours. Viable CA1 neurons were counted at 7?days. Results:? The system was well tolerated, provided exquisite control of animal core and brain temperatures, and conferred robust neuroprotection at 7?days. The median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) of viable neurons per 300-?m field were 130 (IQR?=?128 to 135) for sham control, 19 (IQR?=?15 to 30) for untreated ischemic animals, and 101 (IQR?=?94 to 113) for ischemic animals treated with hypothermia (p?<?0.05 for comparison between all groups). Conclusions:? Like human protocols, this model incorporates sedation and analgesia, results in robust neuroprotection, is well tolerated, and offers exquisite temperature control. The system is noninvasive and inexpensive and offers a model that is similar to methods used in clinical practice. This system will be of interest to investigators using small animal models to examine neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia and translational strategies that combine hypothermia with targeted pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are intrinsically heterogeneous and comprise subpopulations that differ in their proliferation, multi-potency, and functional properties, which are commonly demonstrated by culturing hMSCs at different plating densities. The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of different subpopulations of hMSC by testing the hypothesis that the clonogenic hMSC subpopulation, which is selectively enriched in clonal density (CD) and low density (LD) culture (10 and 100 cells per square centimeter, respectively), possesses a metabolic phenotype that differs from that of hMSC in medium- or high-density (MD: 1,000 and HD: 3,000 cells per square centimeter, respectively). Cells at CD and LD conditions exhibited elevated expression of CD146 and colony forming unit-fibroblast compared with cells at MD- or HD. Global metabolic profiles revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of cell extracts showed clear distinction between LD and HD cultures, and density-dependent differences in coupling of glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Metabolic inhibitors revealed density-dependent differences in glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP generation, in glutamine metabolism, in the dependence on the pentose phosphate pathway for maintaining cellular redox state, and sensitivity to exogenous reactive oxygen species. We also show that active OXPHOS is not required for proliferation in LD culture but that OXPHOS activity increases senescence in HD culture. Together, the results revealed heterogeneity in hMSC culture exists at the level of primary metabolism. The unique metabolic characteristics of the clonogenic subpopulation suggest a novel approach for optimizing in vitro expansion of hMSCs. Stem Cells 2015;33:3368?3381
