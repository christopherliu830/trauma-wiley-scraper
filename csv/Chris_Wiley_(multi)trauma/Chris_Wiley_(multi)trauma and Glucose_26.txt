AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are intrinsically heterogeneous and comprise subpopulations that differ in their proliferation, multi-potency, and functional properties, which are commonly demonstrated by culturing hMSCs at different plating densities. The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of different subpopulations of hMSC by testing the hypothesis that the clonogenic hMSC subpopulation, which is selectively enriched in clonal density (CD) and low density (LD) culture (10 and 100 cells per square centimeter, respectively), possesses a metabolic phenotype that differs from that of hMSC in medium- or high-density (MD: 1,000 and HD: 3,000 cells per square centimeter, respectively). Cells at CD and LD conditions exhibited elevated expression of CD146 and colony forming unit-fibroblast compared with cells at MD- or HD. Global metabolic profiles revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of cell extracts showed clear distinction between LD and HD cultures, and density-dependent differences in coupling of glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Metabolic inhibitors revealed density-dependent differences in glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP generation, in glutamine metabolism, in the dependence on the pentose phosphate pathway for maintaining cellular redox state, and sensitivity to exogenous reactive oxygen species. We also show that active OXPHOS is not required for proliferation in LD culture but that OXPHOS activity increases senescence in HD culture. Together, the results revealed heterogeneity in hMSC culture exists at the level of primary metabolism. The unique metabolic characteristics of the clonogenic subpopulation suggest a novel approach for optimizing in vitro expansion of hMSCs. Stem Cells 2015;33:3368?3381

AB  - Abstract? The superficial regions of the dog splanchnic nerve were selectively stimulated with 33-electrode spiral cuffs in 11 circumferential groups of three electrodes to modulate the function of the innervated internal organs and glands. In two adult Beagle dogs under general anaesthesia, the cuffs were chronically implanted on the nerve trunks before the celiac ganglion. Superficial regions of the nerves were selectively stimulated for 15?s with biphasic, rectangular, current pulses (2?mA intensity, 200?µs duration, and 20?Hz frequency) which were delivered sequentially to the corresponding group of three electrodes. The results showed that Group no. 8 of three electrodes elicited the highest influence on pressure within the bladder. Namely, a decrease in pressure starting from 34.97?mmHg at the beginning of stimulation to 34.92?mmHg at the end of stimulation was observed. It was also shown that only Group no. 4 of three electrodes significantly modified the endocrine function of the pancreas. A considerable increase in glucagon secretion with a peak value of 47?pg/ml and an insignificant change in insulin secretion were also observed. The results of histological observations demonstrated that the use of the cuff was associated with a buildup of connective tissue encapsulation around the cuff as well as within it. However, functional deficits were not observed in the animal, and most of the fibers appeared to be histologically normal after stimulation. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that internal organs and glands can be selectively stimulated through the selective stimulation of innervating superficial regions of the autonomous peripheral nerve.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Aim Recent developments in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have enabled non-invasive clarification of brain functions in psychiatric disorders. In pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), reduced prefrontal hemodynamic responses have been observed with NIRS repeatedly. However, there are few studies of adult ADHD by multi-channel NIRS. Therefore, in this study, we used multi-channel NIRS to examine the characteristics of prefrontal hemodynamic responses during the Stroop Color?Word Task (SCWT) in adult ADHD patients and in age- and sex-matched control subjects. Methods Twelve treatment-naïve adults with ADHD and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects participated in the present study after giving consent. We used 24-channel NIRS to measure the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) changes at the frontal lobes of participants during the SCWT. We compared the oxy-Hb changes between adults with ADHD and control subjects by t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Results During the SCWT, the oxy-Hb changes observed in the ADHD group were significantly smaller than those in the control group in channels 11, 16, 18, 21, 22, 23, and 24, corresponding to the prefrontal cortex. At channels 16, 21, 23, and 24 of the ADHD group, there were negative correlations between the symptomatic severity and the oxy-Hb changes. Conclusion The present study suggests that adults with ADHD have reduced prefrontal hemodynamic response as measured by NIRS.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - ABSTRACT The lifespan of the US population is increasing, with the elderly desiring successful aging. This goal is jeopardized as multiple systemic conditions and their treatments become more prevalent with age, causing impaired systemic and oral health and influencing an older person's quality of life. To obtain successful aging, a compression of morbidity must be obtained through prevention and management of disease. This paper describes the most common systemic diseases causing morbidity and mortality in persons aged 65+ years: diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, influenza, diabetes mellitus, trauma, Alzheimer's disease, renal diseases, septicemia, and liver diseases. Disease prevalence and the impact of medications and other therapeutic measures used to treat these conditions are discussed. Oral sequelae are reviewed with guidelines for early detection of these deleterious consequences, considerations for oral treatment, and patient management. An understanding of the impact of systemic diseases and treatment on oral health is imperative for dental practitioners to appropriately treat and manage older patients with these conditions. With a focus on early detection and prevention, oral health care providers can improve the quality of life of this population and aid in the attainment of successful aging.

AB  - Abstract Background The 2018 Lipids in Parenteral Nutrition summit involved a panel of experts in clinical nutrition, lipid metabolism, and pharmacology, to assess the current state of knowledge and develop expert consensus statements regarding the use of intravenous lipid emulsions in various patient populations and clinical settings. The main purpose of the consensus statements is to assist healthcare professionals by providing practical guidance on common clinical questions related to the provision of lipid emulsions as part of parenteral nutrition (PN). Methods The summit was designed to allow interactive discussion and consensus development. The resulting consensus statements represent the collective opinion of the members of the expert panel, which was informed and supported by scientific evidence and clinical experience. Results The current article summarizes the key discussion topics from the summit and provides a set of consensus statements designed to complement existing evidence-based guidelines. Lipid emulsions are a major component of PN, serving as a condensed source of energy and essential fatty acids. In addition, lipids modulate a variety of biologic functions, including inflammatory and immune responses, coagulation, and cell signaling. A growing body of evidence suggests that lipid emulsions containing ?-3 fatty acids from fish oil confer important clinical benefits via suppression of inflammatory mediators and activation of pathways involved in the resolution of inflammation. Conclusions This article provides a set of expert consensus statements to complement formal PN guideline recommendations.

Information for this article was selected from articles found on MEDLINE between 1998 and 2008 on the topics of hospital management of hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes. The article was further developed according to the clinical experiences of the author. Results:? When discussing the identification and treatment of hyperglycaemia in hospitalized patients, it is important to include the many aspects of glycaemic control that can be provided by hospital pharmacists. These include tasks such as patient screening and identification, monitoring glycaemic parameters, documenting therapy and therapeutic end points, and evaluating prescribing habits. Risk evaluation, guideline implementation, and a coordinated multi-disciplinary approach to discharge planning can be used to improve diabetes management by incorporating the entire hospital health-care team in patient care and education. Conclusions:? Hospital pharmacists should develop and implement protocolized care for the management of patients with hyperglycaemia throughout the institution in order to optimize the efficacy and safety of insulin therapy.

AB  - Summary The study of stress, fear and anxiety was the major focus of research among the early neuroscientists interested in behaviour. This is not surprising because fear, anxiety and alarm play a fundamental role in survival. Thus, research investigating the phenomenology and neurobiology of anxiety, fear, startle, arousal, alarm, vigilance and alerting functions has been conducted for decades. This chapter provides an overview of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder. These anxiety disorders were selected because each of them has an extensive base of knowledge in two or more of the following areas: neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology or neuroimmunology, and neurophysiology.

AB  - The late endosomal adaptor protein LAMTOR2/p14 is essential for tissue homeostasis by controlling MAPK and mTOR signaling, which in turn regulate cell growth and proliferation, migration and spreading. Moreover, LAMTOR2 critically controls architecture and function of the endocytic system, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in lysosomes, positioning of late endosomes and defense against intracellular pathogens. Here we describe the multifaceted ultrastructural phenotype of the endo/lysosomal system of LAMTOR2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Quantitative (immuno-)electron microscopy of cryo-fixed samples revealed significantly reduced numbers of recycling tubules emanating from maturing multivesicular bodies (MVB). Instead, a distinct halo of vesicles surrounded MVB, tentatively interpreted as detached, jammed recycling tubules. These morphological changes in LAMTOR2-deficient cells correlated with the presence of growth factors (e.g. EGF), but were similarly induced in control cells by inactivating mTOR. Furthermore, proper transferrin receptor trafficking and recycling were apparently dependent on an intact LAMTOR complex. Finally, a severe imbalance in the relative proportions of endo/lysosomes was found in LAMTOR2-deficient cells, resulting from increased amounts of mature MVB and (autophago)lysosomes. These observations suggest that the LAMTOR/Ragulator complex is required not only for maintaining the homeostasis of endo/lysosomal subpopulations but also contributes to the proper formation of MVB-recycling tubules, and regulation of membrane/cargo recycling from MVB.

AB  - Abstract There has been a recent call for longitudinal imaging studies to better characterize the time course of physiological recovery following sport-related concussion (SRC) and its relationship with clinical recovery. To address this, we evaluated changes to resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of the whole-brain network following SRC and explored associations between rs-FC and measures of clinical outcome. High school and collegiate football athletes were enrolled during preseason. Athletes that suffered SRC (N =?62) were assessed across the acute (within 48?hr) and sub-acute (days 8, 15, and 45) phases. Matched football athletes without concussion served as controls (N =?60) and participated in similar visits. Multi-band resting-state fMRI was used to assess whole-brain rs-FC at each visit using network-based statistic and average nodal strength from regions of interest defined using a common whole-brain parcellation. Concussed athletes had elevated symptoms, psychological distress, and oculomotor, balance, and memory deficits at 48?hr postconcussion relative to controls, with diminished yet significant elevations in symptoms and psychological distress at 8?days. Both rs-FC analyses showed that concussed athletes had a global increase in connectivity at 8?days postconcussion relative to controls, with no differences at the 48-hr, 15-day, or 45-day visits. Further analysis revealed the group effect at the 8-day visit was driven by the large minority of concussed athletes still symptomatic at their visit; asymptomatic concussed athletes did not differ from controls. Findings from this large-scale, prospective study suggest whole-brain rs-FC alterations following SRC are delayed in onset but associated with the presence of self-reported symptoms.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of a 78-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical service (EMS) with a chief complaint of a fall resulting in right wrist pain. The functional status of geriatric patients is dependent on multiple aspects of the individual patient, including things such as medical, physical, cognitive, and environmental issues. Functional decline as measured by various ADLs is an important factor in precipitating many ED visits as well, particularly those mobility related activities of daily living (ADLs). Direct observation of functional capabilities via performance testing of gait, gait speed, strength, and balance capabilities is the best method to assess such function, as both patients and physicians are poor predictors of functional limitations. Incorporating functional assessment into the multidisciplinary team approach such as that proposed by the new geriatric emergency department guidelines may help improve outcomes and prevent future adverse events.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian hibernation consists of periods of depressed metabolism and reduced body temperature called ?torpor? that are interspersed by normothermic arousal periods. Numerous cellular processes are halted during torpor, including transcription, translation, and ion homeostasis. Hibernators are able to survive long periods of low blood flow and body temperature followed by rewarming and reperfusion without overt signs of organ injury, which makes these animals excellent models for application of natural protective mechanisms to human medicine. This review examines efforts to induce torpor-like states in non-hibernating species using pharmacological compounds. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of natural and pharmacologically induced torpor will speed the development of new clinical approaches to treat a variety of trauma and stress states in humans.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Environmental factors are poorly understood in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The importance of environmental factors in gene environment interactions (GxE) is suggested by wide individual differences in cognitive loss, even for carriers of AD-risk genetic variants. Results and Discussion We propose the ?AD exposome? to comprehensively assess the modifiable environmental factors relevant to genetic underpinnings of cognitive aging and AD. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous environmental factors requires multi-generational consideration of these interactions over age and time (GxExT). New computational approaches to the multi-level complexities may identify accessible interventions for individual brain aging. International collaborations on diverse populations are needed to identify the most relevant exposures over the life course for GxE interactions.

AB  - Abstract During seizures, glucose concentrations are high in the hippocampus. Mitochondrial hexokinase (HK) catalyzes the first essential step of glucose metabolism and directly couples extramitochondrial glycolysis to intramitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The neuroprotective effects of an HK inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), on kainic acid (KA)-induced excitotoxic injury were investigated. Hippocampal slices were prepared from hippocampi of 6?8-day-old rats using a tissue chopper and placed on a membrane insert. After a treatment with KA (5 ?M) for 15 hr, neuronal death was quantified by propidium iodide (PI), cresol violet, and TUNEL staining. KA-induced cell death was significantly prevented by 30 ?M 3-BrPA treatment. According to Western blots, the expression level of phospho-Akt increased after 3-BrPA treatment. The induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at 48 hr after 3-BrPA treatment tended to increase in the CA1 area compared with the KA-only group, but the difference was not significant. Blocking the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway using LY294002 reversed the neuroprotective effect of 3-BrPA. These results suggest that inhibition of HK may play a protective role against neuronal death in KA-induced excitotoxic injury. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
