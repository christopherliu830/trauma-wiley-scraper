AB  - Scurvy is a rarely seen disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. We present a case of scurvy in a 65-year-old man. The patient reported heavy alcohol abuse over the last several years. He also reported that his diet consisted of cheese pizzas only. On physical examination, he was noted to have spontaneous ecchymosis of his lower extremities (denying any history of trauma); poor dentition; and corkscrew hairs on his chest, abdomen, and legs, with associated perifollicular petechia. Punch biopsy of his skin lesions revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation, with some focal perifollicular erythrocyte extravasation. A serum ascorbic acid level was<0.12 mg/dL (normal range, 0.20?1.9 mg/dL). A diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency was made. The patient was successfully treated with 1 g/d vitamin C for the first 5 days, followed by a dose of 500 mg/d. Though scurvy is rarely seen in modern times, it is important to identify who is at risk and to recognize the clear and classic signs and symptoms associated with scurvy. Failure to diagnose this disease can potentially lead to expensive and unnecessary medical tests, as well as missing a very simple treatment that can prevent infection and even death.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - Abstract This article explores the admissibility of neuroimaging evidence in U.S. courts, recognizing various trends in decisions about such evidence. While courts have routinely admitted some neuroimages, such as CT scans and MRI, as proof of trauma and disease, they have been more circumspect about admitting the PET and SPECT scans and fMRI evidence. With the latter technologies, courts have often expressed reservations about what can be inferred from the images. Moreover, courts seem unwilling to find neuroimaging sufficient to prove either insanity or incompetency, but are relatively lenient about admitting neuroimages in death penalty hearings. Some claim that fMRI and ?brain fingerprinting? are able to detect deception. Other scholars argue that brain fingerprinting is a dubious concept and that fMRI is not yet sufficiently reliable. Moreover, there are substantial concerns about privacy and the perils of mind reading implicit in such technology. Yet, there is a movement to try to make these new technologies ?courtroom ready? in the near future, raising a host of legal, policy, and ethical questions to be answered.

AB  - Human mesenchymal or stromal cells (hMSCs) isolated from various adult tissues are primary candidates in cell therapy and tissue regeneration. Despite promising results in preclinical studies, robust therapeutic responses to MSC treatment have not been reproducibly demonstrated in clinical trials. In the translation of MSC-based therapy to clinical application, studies of MSC metabolism have significant implication in optimizing bioprocessing conditions to obtain therapeutically competent hMSC population for clinical application. In addition, understanding the contribution of metabolic cues in directing hMSC fate also provides avenues to potentiate their therapeutic effects by modulating their metabolic properties. This review focuses on MSC metabolism and discusses their unique metabolic features in the context of common metabolic properties shared by stem cells. Recent advances in the fundamental understanding of MSC metabolic characteristics in relation to their in vivo origin and metabolic regulation during proliferation, lineage-specific differentiation, and exposure to in vivo ischemic conditions are summarized. Metabolic strategies in directing MSC fate to enhance their therapeutic potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are discussed. ? 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFα degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.

AB  - Abstract: In pancreatic B- and A-cells, metabolic stimuli regulate biochemical and electrical processes that culminate in Ca2+-influx and release of insulin or glucagon, respectively. Like in other (neuro)endocrine cells, Ca2+-influx triggers the rapid exocytosis of hormone-containing secretory granules. Only a small fraction of granules (<1% in insulin-secreting B-cells) can be released immediately, while the remainder requires translocation to the plasma membrane and further ?priming? for release by several ATP- and Ca2+-dependent reactions. Such functional organization may account for systemic features such as the biphasic time course of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Since this release pattern is altered in type-2 diabetes mellitus, it is conceivable that disturbances in the exocytotic machinery underlie the disease. Here I will review recent data from our laboratory relevant for the understanding of these processes in insulin-secreting B-cells and glucagon-secreting A-cells and for the identification of novel targets for antidiabetic drug action. Two aspects are discussed in detail: 1) The importance of a tight interaction between L-type Ca2+-channels and the exocytotic machinery for efficient secretion; and 2) the role of intragranular acidification for the priming of secretory granules and its regulation by a granular 65-kDa sulfonylurea-binding protein.

AB  - Summary Careful assessment of the biochemistry panel and familiarity with normal biochemistry values for neonatal foals is imperative in the workup of any critically ill neonate, particularly those with neurological signs. The importance of rapidity of change compared to the absolute value of the biochemical abnormality must be emphasised. Serial biochemical panels ideally assist in assessing rapidity of change. Many foals can have severe biochemical derangements in the absence of seizures. Identifying values that are significantly out of range should spur immediate therapy to correct them and potentially additional diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the abnormalities. A temporal relationship between correction of biochemical abnormalities and resolution of seizures and encephalopathic signs supports causation.

AB  - Abstract Electrodes can provide information on neural function and stimulate neural activity. These neural electrodes can provide remarkable benefit to people suffering physical trauma or neural disease. Traditional metal electrodes have shortcomings related to poor biostability, cytocompatibility, and a rigid structure that maps poorly to tissue. Organic conductors can be formed with various chemical and physical properties to create improved electrode-neural interfaces. The processability of organic conductors enables their use in advanced fabrication methods. This review details the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and conducting polymers for neural interfacing. Construction of novel neural electrode architectures via advanced fabrication processes is also addressed.

AB  - Summary Sketches provides, in more technical language, outlines of the various imaging modalities, and illustrates their roles in medical care with many clinical examples. After examining film-radiography and conventional fluoroscopy, in which images arise from differential attenuation of an X-ray beam by various tissues, it moves on to their twenty-first century computer-based descendants: computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), culminating in three-dimensional mapping of tissues with spiral, multi-slice CT. It then addresses nuclear medicine (NM), including single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), where contrast comes from the differential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by tissues. With diagnostic ultrasound (US), echoes are created at tissue interfaces where differences in tissue elasticity and density occur. The chapter concludes with an appendix on the selection of optimal imaging modalities for representative clinical problems.

AB  - Summary Analgesia, usually provided by opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIAs), can be enhanced by other classes of medication that have a different primary role but with a pharmacological mechanism of action that supports their analgesic actions. Adjunct analgesic methods/medications added to standard opioid and NSAIA analgesia has gained popularity in veterinary medicine; however, there are few veterinary clinical trials assessing efficacy. Adjunctive analgesics are frequently used in combination with other analgesics to confer a synergistic effect in a multi-modal regimen or to facilitate lower drug dosages to reduce adverse effects. Drugs currently used as adjuncts are Lidocaine systemically, Alpha2-adrenergic agonists, Gabapentin, Amitriptyline and Amantadine. This chapter discusses tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Corticosteroids inhibit cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2) gene expression, which is upregulated in inflammatory states, reduces aberrant firing originating from nerve injury and reduces inflammation at the site of injury.

AB  - Abstract Aims To synthesize the evidence evaluating if blood samples are similar when obtained from peripheral intravenous cannula compared with venepuncture. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Searches were conducted in databases for English language studies between January 2000?December 2018. Review methods The search adhered to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs critical appraisal instruments. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE. Results Sixteen studies were identified. Findings suggest haemolysis rates are higher in blood sampled from peripheral intravenous cannula. However, haemolysis rates may be lower if a peripheral intravenous cannula blood sampling protocol is followed. For equivalence of blood test results, even though some results were outside the laboratory, allowable error and were outside the Bland?Altman Level of Agreement, none of these values would have required clinical intervention. With regard to the contamination rates of blood cultures, the results were equivocal. Conclusion Further research is required to inform the evidence for best practice recommendations, including, if a protocol for drawing blood from a peripheral cannula is of benefit for specific patient populations and in other settings. Impact Venepuncture can provoke pain, anxiety and cause trauma to patients. Guidelines recommend blood samples from peripheral intravenous cannula be taken only on insertion. Anecdotal evidence suggests drawing blood from existing cannulas may be a common practice. Further research is required to resolve this issue.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition often leading to disabling complications including retinopathy, neuropathy and cardiovascular disease which can be modified by intensive treatment with insulin. Such treatment, however, is associated with a restrictive lifestyle and risk of hypoglycaemic morbidity and mortality. Methods:? This review examines the role of pancreas transplantation in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Results:? Pancreas transplantation is currently the only proven option to achieve long-term insulin independence, resulting in an improvement or stabilization of those diabetic related complications. The hazards of pancreas transplantation as a major operation are well known. Balancing the risks of a surgical procedure, with the benefits of restoring normoglycaemia remains an important task for the pancreas transplant surgeon. Pancreas transplantation is not an emergency operation to treat poorly managed and non-compliant patients with debilitating complications. It is a highly specialized procedure which has evolved both in terms of the surgical technique, patient selection and assessment. Conclusion:? Pancreas transplantation has emerged as the single most effective way to achieve normal glucose homeostasis in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - 36 I. 36 II. 37 III. 44 IV. 49 V. 53 54 References 55 Summary Anoxia tolerance in plants is distinguished by direction of the sparse supply of energy to processes crucial to cell maintenance and sometimes to growth, as in rice seedlings. In anoxic rice coleoptiles energy is used to synthesise proteins, take up K+, synthesise cell walls and lipids, and in cell maintenance. Maintenance of electrochemical H+ gradients across the tonoplast and plasma membrane is crucial for solute compartmentation and thus survival. These gradients sustain some H+-solute cotransport and regulate cytoplasmic pH. Pyrophosphate (PPi), the alternative energy donor to ATP, allows direction of energy to the vacuolar H+-PPiase, sustaining H+ gradients across the tonoplast. When energy production is critically low, operation of a biochemical pHstat allows H+-solute cotransport across plasma membranes to continue for at least for 18 h. In active (e.g. growing) cells, PPi produced during substantial polymer synthesis allows conversion of PPi to ATP by PPi-phosphofructokinase (PFK). In quiescent cells with little polymer synthesis and associated PPi formation, the PPi required by the vacuolar H+-PPiase and UDPG pyrophosphorylase involved in sucrose mobilisation via sucrose synthase might be produced by conversion of ATP to PPi through reversible glycolytic enzymes, presumably pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase. These hypotheses need testing with species characterised by contrasting anoxia tolerance.

AB  - Summary Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis resulting in poor quality of life, high risk of development of other complications of cirrhosis, increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and poor long-term outcome. The practical management of ascites involves a proper evaluation of the patient with a thorough history and physical exam. In addition, complete laboratory, ascitic fluid, radiological, endoscopic, and in some cases histological tests should be performed. Taking proper care of patients with ascites can be challenging because they are prone to several complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatocellular carcinoma, bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. While the initial management of uncomplicated ascites with low-sodium diet and diuretic treatment is straightforward in the majority of patients, there is a group of patients that fail to respond to diuretics and become a real therapeutic challenge.

However, their effects on neuroinflammation are unknown. In this study, we show that MSCs suppress endotoxin-induced glial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated OHSCs activated MSCs to increase the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and produce prostaglandin E2. MSC-derived prostaglandin E2, then suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the OHSCs. Together, the results suggest the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of MSCs in models of disease and support earlier observations that MSCs may offer a therapy for neuroinflammation produced by trauma or disease.
