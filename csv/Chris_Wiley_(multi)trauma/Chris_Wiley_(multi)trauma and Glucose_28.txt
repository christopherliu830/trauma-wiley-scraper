AB  - A 14-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented with hypoglycaemia and seizures of several weeks duration. Bloodwork revealed hypoglycaemia (1·83 mmol/l; reference range 4·22-8·05 mmol/l) with concurrent normal insulin levels (171 pmol/l; reference range 72-583 pmol/l). An insulinoma was suspected and medical and dietary management were attempted with minimal success. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and a single, well-defined mass was found within the left lobe of the pancreas. The mass was removed and histologically classified as an islet cell carcinoma, consistent with an insulinoma. The cat had an episode of presumed postoperative pancreatitits, but recovered with appropriate treatment. The cat has had no clinical signs of recurrence of greater than 32 months postsurgery. There are only four cases of insulinoma in cats reported in the literature. All prior insulionomas reported were in older cats and were malignant in character, which is similar to the reports in the dog. This case is unique because of the apparent lack of local recurrence and development of metastatic disease, leading to the prolonged survival.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a leading nosocomial pathogen, infecting a wide range of anatomic sites including the respiratory tract and the bloodstream. In addition to being multi-drug resistant, little is known about the molecular basis of A. baumannii pathogenesis. To better understand A. baumannii virulence, a combination of a transposon-sequencing (TraDIS) screen and the neutropenic mouse model of bacteremia was used to identify the full set of fitness genes required during bloodstream infection. The lytic transglycosylase MltB was identified as a critical fitness factor. MltB cleaves the MurNAc-GlcNAc bond of peptidoglycan, which leads to cell wall remodeling. Here we show that MltB is part of a complex network connecting resistance to stresses, membrane homeostasis, biogenesis of pili and in vivo fitness. Indeed, inactivation of mltB not only impaired resistance to serum complement, cationic antimicrobial peptides and oxygen species, but also altered the cell envelope integrity, activated the envelope stress response, drastically reduced the number of pili at the cell surface and finally, significantly decreased colonization of both the bloodstream and the respiratory tract.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, aggressive, soft-tissue infection that results in necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. It spreads rapidly and may progress to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death. Predisposing conditions include diabetes, chronic alcoholism, advanced age, vascular disease, and immunosuppression and many cases are preceded by an injury or invasive procedure. Necrotizing soft-tissue infection of the breast is uncommon, with only a few reported cases in the literature. We present a 53-year-old diabetic woman who presented to the emergency room with several weeks of worsening breast and shoulder pain, swelling, and erythema. Upon formal evaluation by the surgical service, a necrotizing soft-tissue infection was suspected, and the patient was scheduled for emergent, surgical debridement. Because of the aggressive nature and high mortality of this disease, immediate surgical intervention, coupled with antibiotic therapy and physiologic support, is necessary to prevent complications and death.

AB  - Aims To conduct a 10-year, observational follow-up of patients completing PROactive to investigate whether trends of cardiovascular benefit with pioglitazone and imbalances in specific malignancies persisted over time. Methods Macrovascular endpoints and malignancies were compared based on original randomization to pioglitazone or placebo and ?any? versus ?no? pioglitazone use for bladder and prostate cancer. Results Of 4873 patients completing the PROactive trial, 74% entered the follow-up. During follow-up (mean 7.8?years), there were no statistically significant differences in the primary [all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac intervention, stroke, major leg amputation, leg revascularization] or main secondary (death, MI, stroke) endpoints for subjects originally randomized to pioglitazone and placebo, except for leg amputations during follow-up [4.1% pioglitazone, 5.6% placebo; hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55?0.99; p?=?0.046]. During follow-up, the incidence of total malignancies was similar between groups; bladder cancer was reported in 0.8% of patients (n?=?14) in the pioglitazone versus 1.2% (n?=?21) in the placebo group [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.33?1.28], and prostate cancer was reported in 44 men (3.7%) in the pioglitazone versus 29 men (2.5%) in the placebo group (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.93?2.34). Conclusions The trends of macrovascular benefits of pioglitazone compared with placebo during PROactive did not persist in the absence of continued pioglitazone during this 10-year follow-up. Trends of decreased bladder cancer and increased prostate cancer were observed in the pioglitazone group during follow-up; however, these imbalances should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the observational study design.

AB  - Abstract We have developed an organotypic culture system that allows the production of bone tissue features on a centimeter scale. A composite, calcium phosphate?strained fibrin gel system is able to organize itself in the presence of osteoblastic cells, creating basic hierarchical units as seen in vivo, and can be modified to produce a range of other tissues that require such directional structuring. Constructs evolve over time into multi-compositional structures containing a high mineral content and terminally differentiated, osteocyte-like cells. These tissues can be cultured over extended durations (exceeding 1 year) and are responsive to a variety of chemical and biological agents. The platform can reduce the number of animals used in experimentation by acting as an intermediate stage in which more personalized research conditions can be generated. We provide a thorough description of the protocol used to successfully culture and modify this system, as well as guidance on compositional characterization. ? 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract In the adult mammalian central nervous system, reinnervation and recovery from trauma is limited. During development, however, postlesion plasticity may generate alternate paths, providing models to investigate reinnervating axon?target interactions. After unilateral transection of the neonatal rat olivocerebellar path, axons from the ipsilateral inferior olive grow into the denervated hemicerebellum and develop climbing fibre (CF)-like arbors on Purkinje cells (PCs). However, the synaptic function and extent of PC reinnervation remain unknown. In adult rats pedunculotomized on postnatal day?3 the morphological and electrophysiological properties of reinnervating olivocerebellar axons were studied, using axonal reconstruction and patch-clamp PC recording of CF-induced synaptic currents. Reinnervated PCs displayed normal CF currents, and the frequency of PC reinnervation decreased with increasing laterality. Reinnervating CF arbors were predominantly normal but 6% branched within the molecular layer forming smaller secondary arbors. CFs arose from transcommissural olivary axons, which branched extensively near their target PCs to produce on average 36?CFs, which is six times more than normal. Axons terminating in the hemisphere developed more CFs than those terminating in the vermis. However, the precise parasagittal microzone organization was preserved. Transcommissural axons also branched, although to a lesser extent, to the deep cerebellar nuclei and terminated in a distribution indicative of the olivo-cortico-nuclear circuit. These results show that reinnervating olivocerebellar axons are highly plastic in the cerebellum, compensating anatomically and functionally for early postnatal denervation, and that this reparation obeys precise topographic constraints although axonal plasticity is modified by target (PC or deep nuclear neurons) interactions.

AB  - Abstract Liver transplantation is currently the only effective therapy for patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The availability of an artificial liver could bridge these patients through the relatively brief crisis period and allow their own livers to regenerate, providing a more favorable outcome and sparing the trauma and expense of transplant. We have developed a device consisting of a highly differentiated human liver cell line cultured in a hollow fiber cartridge. This device is capable of supporting dogs with acetaminopheninduced fulminant hepatic failure for a period long enough for their own livers to resume function. Even though liver function tests such as albumin and prothrombin time became extremely abnormal during the course of the experiment, the dogs did not become encephalopathic. Two of the three treated animals recovered sufficient liver function after 42 to 48 hr of treatment that they could be disconnected from the device, and they survived the experiment. Histological results and serum ALT levels suggest that the device affected the course of the disease in two animals, allowing recovery of hepatocytes that would otherwise have lysed. In the third animal, regenerative nodules demonstrated that, even in the presence of severe liver injury, the device was capable of supporting total liver function. (HEPATOLOGY 1992;16:60?65.)

AB  - BACKGROUND The short shelf-life of fresh platelets limits their efficient inventory management and availability during a massive transfusion protocol. Risk of insufficient availability can be mitigated by building an inventory of cryopreserved platelets (CPs). METHODS A comparative study of fresh apheresis platelets (FAPs) and CPs was performed. Type-O CPs were processed with DMSO frozen at ?80°C and reconstituted in thawed AB plasma. All patients enrolled in the study had the following parameters evaluated on admission: vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure), blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and, in trauma patients, international severity score. Several outcomes were evaluated: 30-day survival, adverse events, quantity of administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate and thromboxane (TXA), and laboratory parameters after transfusion (blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level). RESULTS Twenty-five (25) patients in the study group received transfusions totaling 81?units of CPs. Twenty-one (21) patients in the control group received a total of 67?units of FAPs. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics (p?>?0.05) between groups. Both groups were comparable in clinical outcomes (30-day survival, administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate, TXA, and adverse events). Among posttransfusion laboratory parameters, platelet count was higher in the group transfused with FAPs (97.0 ?109/L) than in the group transfused with CPs (41.5 ?109/L), p?=?0.02025. Other parameters were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION The study suggests that CPs are tolerable and a feasible alternative to FAPs. However, larger randomized studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the conditions more commonly encountered, either in medical examinations or in clinical practice, and attempts to provide a framework for developing an understanding of their pathological basis and diagnosis. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) can be used in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) and to distinguish between the other causes of hyperglycaemia. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening acute complication of DM, occurring when insulin therapy is absent or becomes inadequate for the current physiological state. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition associated with either abnormal antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion from the posterior pituitary (central) or an abnormal renal response to ADH. Cortisol is a corticosteroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. Cushing's syndrome is caused by an excess of glucocorticoids. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a rare syndrome involving the development of either multiple endocrine gland tumours or hyperplasia.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.
