AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

Rigorous clinical, laboratory and psychometric assessments revealed no toxicity and no significant effects on vital functions. In the cerebrospinal fluid, the ratio of lactate to pyruvate decreased?a finding consistent with an increase in the aerobic metabolism of glucose.

AB  - This is the author's fifth revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately one-third of the previous references have been replaced by more current or more delimited articles. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited are primarily concerned with medical ailments of the elderly; legal, ethical, and sociological topics receive more limited coverage. The references are divided into categories. The first set (I) deals with some possible causes of aging; the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging; the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients; the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society; and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Abstract Polysialic acid (PSA) was investigated for its applicability as coating material for mammalian cell cultivation. PSA is involved in post-translational modification of the vertebrate neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). It is biocompatible and degradation-controlled. Thus, it becomes interesting for use as a coating and scaffold material for tissue engineering applications, especially for peripheral nerve regeneration. As a preliminary study of the use of PSA as scaffold material it was tested in its soluble form as coating material. The cytotoxicity was investigated and compared to another polysaccharide ?-glucan, to widely used coating substances (collagen I, poly-L-lysine, hyaluronic acid) and uncoated tissue culture plastic material. The interactions between the modified cell culture surface and the cells were investigated using a model liver cell line Hep-G2 and a neurobiological cell line PC-12. The PSA coating itself was analyzed by immunoanalysis. Viability of the cells was investigated by the MTT assay. The number and distribution of adhered cells were studied by cell nuclei staining. Furthermore, the differentiation status of the PC-12 cells was monitored, as well as glucose and lactate levels in the cell culture medium from the Hep-G2 cells. Comparable viability and similar numbers of attached cells were observed. Growth in cell clusters was observed for PSA, ?-glucan, and hyaluronic acid coated materials. In general, the results indicate that PSA is comparable to other well-established coating materials (e.g. collagen I, hyaluronic acid, and poly-L-lysine). Moreover, as a key substance in vertebrate development it offers interesting features for nerve regeneration, especially as an insoluble, modified scaffold material. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Lamb losses to hypothermia are highest outdoors in wet, cold and windy environments but can also occur indoors, in particular in lambs that are compromised due to dystocia. The 20% glucose solution used for intraperitoneal injection should be warmed to body temperature. Lambs which are unable to suck from a teat should be fed using a stomach tube and feeder. Watery mouth is a common disease of oneto three-day-old lambs seen under all management systems. Lamb dysentery is a sudden onset fatal clostridial disease of young lambs. Outbreaks of salmonellosis in lambs are rare, and usually follow the purchase of infected carrier sheep or calves. Most cases are caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Salmonella Dublin. Rotavirus and coronavirus infections do not appear to cause primary disease in lambs, although lambs may be infected during the first week of life. Iodine deficiency is an occasional cause of high mortality rates in newborn lambs and kids.

AB  - Summary A 34-year-old female farmer suffered from localized cutaneous mucormycosis for 17 years. At the first admission, the lesion was a dull red plaque, about 7 x 9 cm in size with ulcerations, surrounded by some nodules on the dorsum of her right hand. General examination did not reveal abnormal findings except the skin lesion. Direct examination of skin scrapings in 10 % KOH revealed broad, sparsely septate, branching hyphae. Histopathology showed many intradermal granulomata and microabscesses as well as mycelial elements comprising broad, distorted, ribbon-like strands. Some of them were phagocytized by multi-nucleated giant cells. Cultures revealed rapidly growing yellow colonies on Sabouraud dextrose agar medium at 25°C. Sporangiophores branched in sympodia and the sporangia were globose, 35?60 ?m in diameter. Their walls were deliquescent, but some of them were rather persistent. Columellae were mostly globose, 12?17 ?m in diameter, up to 35 ?m with collars. Sporangiospores were mainly ellipsoidal, 1.5?2.5 x 3?5 ?m in size, but sometimes highly variable in size and shape. The maximum growth temperature of the isolate was 37°C. The pathogenic organism isolated was tentatively identified as Mucor lusitanicus, which, as far as we know, has not been reported as a causative agent of cutaneous mucormycosis.

AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.

AB  - Abstract Acrolein, a major lipid peroxidation product, has been associated with both CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Because of its long half-life, acrolein is a potent endogenous toxin capable of killing healthy cells during the secondary injury process. Traditionally, attempts to intervene in the process of progressive cell death after the primary injury have included scavenging reactive oxygen species (so-called free radicals). The animal data supporting such an approach have generally been positive, but all human clinical trials attempting a similar outcome in human CNS injury have failed. New drugs that might reduce toxicity by scavenging the products of lipid peroxidation present a promising, and little investigated, therapeutic approach. Hydralazine, a well-known treatment for hypertension, has been reported to react with acrolein, forming hydrazone in cell-free systems. In the companion paper, we have established an acrolein-mediated cell injury model using PC12 cells in vitro. Here we test the hypothesis that the formation of hydrazone adducts with acrolein is able to reduce acrolein toxicity and spare a significant percentage of the population of PC12 cells from death. Concentrations of approximately 1 mM of this aldehyde scavenger can rescue over 80% of the population of PC12 cells. This study provides a basis for a new pharmacological treatment to reduce the effects of secondary injury in the damaged and/or diseased nervous system. In particular, we describe the need for new drugs that possess aldehyde scavenging properties but do not interfere with the regulation of blood pressure. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the principles and physics of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and its current use in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources: Research for this manuscript included current human and veterinary literature. Human-based studies: Human studies of BIA and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MFBIA) have resulted in a considerable amount of controversy about the capability of BIA and MFBIA to accurately assess exact fluid volume and distribution. The recent emphasis on point-of-care monitoring has resulted in the use of BIA and MFBIA to evaluate the rapid changes in fluid distribution that can occur with trauma and various disease states. Veterinary-based studies: The use of BIA and MFBIA has been limited in veterinary medicine. However, studies in domestic and laboratory animals have shown good correlation with the isotope dilution method. The effectiveness of BIA/MFBIA in monitoring the critically ill veterinary patient has not yet been evaluated. Conclusion: BIA and MFBIA have been used to evaluate a variety of biological parameters such as nutritional status, cardiac output, and intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes. Recent studies using BIA and MFBIA to evaluate fluid compartmentalization and shifts in critically ill human patients have shown promising results. BIA and MFBIA provide immediate results that may aid in the assessment of a patient's clinical progress and response to therapy.

AB  - Abstract Minimally invasive techniques enable diagnostics and surgery to be performed through a small incision. This greatly reduces the damage to healthy tissue leading to faster recovery times for the patient. However, the surgeon is deprived of the sensory feedback available with normal surgical techniques. Miniaturised sensors can provide this information about location, diagnostics and the treatment. This application severely limits the size of the device, with some catheters being less than 1 mm in diameter. Catheters are usually defined in multiples of 1/3 mm or 1 french. Further important issues are bio-compatibility, safety and the ability of the sensor to withstand the working environment. Sensors able to meet these demands are improving the efficiency of operations and are opening new opportunities for minimally invasive techniques.

AB  - Abstract Chronic diabetic complications ? both microvascular and macrovascular ? have become serious health issues with their increasing prevalence paralleling the dramatic rise of the diabetic population worldwide. Of these complications, foot disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, consuming more health care resource than all other complications combined. Diabetic polyneuropathy and peripheral vascular disease constitute the two main risk factors, with trauma and foot infection being the most important initiating factors and contributors to delayed healing. Intracellular oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycaemia along with hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking constitute the main pathological processes in the aetiology of both macrovascular and microvascular disease. Whilst the former remains the major cause of overall mortality in diabetes, the role of microangiopathy in the pathogenesis of diabetes foot disease and its contribution to delayed wound healing in diabetes has yet to be fully understood and indeed continues to be debated. This article will review the key findings to date on structural and functional microvascular abnormalities in the diabetic foot skin and consider their contribution to impaired would healing.

AB  - Abstract Man has used hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms for centuries.
