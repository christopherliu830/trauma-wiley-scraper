AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether past history of depression is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, and whether history of gestational diabetes is associated with increased rates of postpartum depression. Research design Data for this case?control study consisted of de-identified chart records for 1439 women who received pregnancy care at a large university hospital between 1998 and 2017. Results A history of depression prior to pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes requiring insulin, although not with subtler degrees of gestational hyperglycemia. Diabetes in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Trauma history was associated with both impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy and postpartum depression. Conclusions Past episodes of depression increase risk for the most severe form of gestational diabetes; however, gestational diabetes does not contribute significantly to risk for postpartum depression. This suggests a unidirectional association, unlike the bidirectional association of diabetes with depression among the general population. History of trauma increases risk for both gestational hyperglycemia and postpartum depression, suggesting important health effects of trauma that may differ measurably from those associated with depression.

AB  - Background: We investigated the incidence and severity of post-injury morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)-treated trauma patients. We also identified risk factors in the early phase after injury that predicted the later development of complications. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study design was used. One hundred and sixty-four adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24?h were included during a 21-month period. The incidence and severity of morbidity such as multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), severe sepsis and 30-day post-injury mortality were calculated and risk factors were analyzed with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The median age was 40 years, the injury severity score was 24, the new injury severity score was 29, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 15, sequential organ failure assessment maximum was 7 and ICU length of stay was 3.1 days. The incidences of post-injury MOF were 40.2%, ALI 25.6%, severe sepsis 31.1% and 30-day mortality 10.4%. The independent risk factors differed to some extent between the outcome parameters. Age, severity of injury, significant head injury and massive transfusion were independent risk factors for several outcome parameters. Positive blood alcohol was only a predictor of MOF, whereas prolonged rescue time only predicted death. Unexpectedly, injury severity was not an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions: Although the incidence of morbidity was considerable, mortality was relatively low. Early post-injury risk factors that predicted later development of complications differed between morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract:? Ten urine chemistry parameters were measured on 74 voided urine samples from 34 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Multi-reagent urine dipstick tests were performed and results determined using colorimetric scales. Urine pH measured between 8 and 9 units in 91% of the chimpanzees. Test pads detected protein, erythrocytes, leukocyte esterase activity, and nitrites, ketones and bilirubin in 47, 32, 29, and <10% of the chimpanzees, respectively. No apparent association between positive test results for blood in adult females and reproductive status was found. Overall, 17 of the 34 chimpanzees had positive urine test results for protein, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, nitrites, ketones, and/or bilirubin. Dipstick urinalysis alone is an unreliable method for assessing health and physiological status of wild chimpanzees. However, if combined with other diagnostics it could prove to be a valuable health-monitoring tool. Limitations associated with this methodology need to be considered when interpreting urinary dipstick test results.

AB  - An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions in adipose tissue is thought to contribute to chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation and consequently to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whose serum levels are elevated in such patients, have been shown to interfere with cytokine production in vitro. In order to evaluate the effects of elevated NEFA levels on cytokine production in adipose tissue in vivo we used an 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion (OFM) catheter to induce local inflammation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of healthy volunteers and to sample interstitial fluid (IF) specifically from the inflamed tissue. In two crossover studies, nine subjects received either an intravenous lipid-heparin infusion to elevate circulating NEFA levels or saline over a period of 28 h. The former increased the circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs), NEFA, glucose, and insulin over the study period. NEFA effects on locally induced inflammation were estimated by measuring the levels of a panel adipokines in the OFM probe effluent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels increased during the study period but were not affected by lipid-heparin infusion. In contrast, the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced during the final hour of lipid-heparin infusion (saline: 449.2 ± 105.9 vs. lipid-heparin: 65.4 ± 15.4 pg/ml; P = 0.02). These data provide the first in vivo evidence that elevated NEFA can modulate cytokine production by adipose tissue.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is required to support the metabolic demands of rapid malignant cell growth. Using orthotopic mouse models of human glioblastoma (GBM) and renal cell carcinoma metastatic to brain, we estimated the activity of the PPP relative to glycolysis by infusing [1,2-13C2]glucose. The [3-13C]lactate/[2,3-13C2]lactate ratio was similar for both the GBM and brain metastasis and their respective surrounding brains (GBM, 0.197?±?0.011 and 0.195?±?0.033, respectively (p?=?1); metastasis: 0.126 and 0.119?±?0.033, respectively). This suggests that the rate of glycolysis is significantly greater than the PPP flux in these tumors, and that the PPP flux into the lactate pool is similar in both tumors. Remarkably, 13C?13C coupling was observed in molecules derived from Krebs cycle intermediates in both tumor types, denoting glucose oxidation. In the renal cell carcinoma, in contrast with GBM, 13C multiplets of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) differed from its precursor glutamate, suggesting that GABA did not derive from a common glutamate precursor pool. In addition, the orthotopic renal tumor, the patient's primary renal mass and brain metastasis were all strongly immunopositive for the 67-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase, as were 84% of tumors on a renal cell carcinoma tissue microarray of the same histology, suggesting that GABA synthesis is cell autonomous in at least a subset of renal cell carcinomas. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 13C-labeled glucose can be used in orthotopic mouse models to study tumor metabolism in vivo and to ascertain new metabolic targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

AB  - Abstract In the first case, the AA and glucose were infused through a perinatal port system into the umbilical vein at 30 weeks' gestation due to severe IUGR. The patient received daily hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO, 100% O2) with 1.4 atmospheres absolute for 50 min for 7 days. At 31+4 weeks' gestation, the patient gave birth spontaneously to a newborn weighing 1378 g, pH 7.33, APGAR score 4/6/intubation. In follow-up examinations at 5 years of age, the boy was doing well without any neurological disturbance or developmental delay. In the second case, the patient presented at 25/5 weeks' gestation suffering from severe IUGR received HBO and maternal AA infusions. The cardiotocography was monitored continuously during HBO treatment. The short-time variations improved during HBO from 2.9 to 9 msec. The patient developed pathologic CTG and uterine contractions 1 day later and gave birth to a hypotrophic newborn weighing 420 g. After initial adequate stabilization, the extremely preterm newborn unfortunately died 6 days later. Fetal nutrition combined with HBO is technically possible and may allow the prolongation of the pregnancy. Fetal-specific amino-acid composition would facilitate the treatment options of IUGR fetuses and extremely preterm newborn.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - In order to provide data in support of licensure applications for citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) supplemented with adenine, a multi-institutional cooperative effort was organized to determine survivability of red blood cells subjected to prolonged liquid storage. Two manufacturers supplied plastic multiple bag blood storage containers prefilled with modified CPD (glucose 25% greater than the normal concentration) supplemented with adenine (17.0 to 17.3 mg per 63 ml of anticoagulant; 0.25 millimolar approximate final concentration when diluted with 450 ml of whole blood). Red blood cells from 32 units stored as whole blood for 35 days showed a mean survival of 80.53 + 6.44 per cent (1 SD). Both red blood cell and supernatant plasma biochemical characteristics were comparable to those reported for whole blood stored for 21 days in either acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) or CPD. Red blood cells from 19 units stored as concentrates for 35 days (Hct 75.03 + 3.74%) had a mean survival of 71.38 + 10.3 per cent with considerable interdonor variation in survival and interlaboratory variation in some biochemical characteristics. Red blood cells from eight units stored as concentrates (Hct 75.38 + 4.30%) for 28 days showed a mean survival of 83.97 + 6.10 per cent and biochemical characteristics comparable to those reported for red blood-cell concentrates stored in CPD or ACD for 21 days. Modified CPD with adenine as formulated offers an improved anticoagulant for blood banking by extending the permissible red blood cell storage period.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The survey was supported by a grant from the Petplan Charitable Trust. Boehringer Ingelheim assisted with survey distribution. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract The existence of interactions between sequential enzymes of metabolic pathways has been explored extensively throughout the field of biochemistry. These closely coupled pathways, termed metabolons, have been demonstrated to induce substrate channeling that results in increased efficiency by enhancing local substrate concentrations, protecting liable intermediates, and limiting distance between enzyme active sites. This phenomenon may have direct implication in the advancement of multi-enzyme enzymatic biofuel cells through the use of super-complex formations as bioanode catalysts. This will result in an efficient means of a more complete oxidation of a fuel, while optimizing the flux of the system through the recreation of a phenomenon that is conserved throughout biology.

AB  - Summary Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous disease with the hallmarks of alveolar capillary membrane injury, increased pulmonary oedema and pulmonary inflammation. The most common direct aetiological factor for ALI is usually parenchymal lung infection or haemorrhage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of ALI. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) plays an important role both in production of ROS as well as their removal through the supply of NADPH. However, how G6PD modulation affects NOX2-mediated ROS in the airway epithelial cells (AECs) during acute lung injury has not been explored previously. Therefore, we investigated the effect of G6PD inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide on G6PD activity, NOX2 expression, ROS production and enzymatic anti-oxidants in AECs in a mouse model of ALI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ALI led to increased G6PD activity in the AECs with concomitant elevation of NOX2, ROS, SOD1 and nitrotyrosine. G6PD inhibitor led to reduction of LPS-induced airway inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration as well as NOX2-derived ROS and subsequent oxidative stress. Conversely, ALI led to decreased glutathione reductase activity in AECs, which was normalized by G6PD inhibitor. These data show that activation of G6PD is associated with enhancement of oxidative inflammation in during ALI. Therefore, inhibition of G6PD might be a beneficial strategy during ALI to limit oxidative damage and ameliorate airway inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To compare the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were new users of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) versus other classes of antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs). Methods Patients were identified from four large US claims databases using broad (all T2DM patients) and narrow (intended to exclude patients with type 1 diabetes or secondary diabetes misclassified as T2DM) definitions of T2DM. New users of SGLT2i and seven groups of comparator AHAs were matched (1:1) on exposure propensity scores to adjust for imbalances in baseline covariates. Cox proportional hazards regression models, conditioned on propensity score-matched pairs, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of DKA for new users of SGLT2i versus other AHAs. When I2 <40%, a combined HR across the four databases was estimated. Results Using the broad definition of T2DM, new users of SGLT2i had an increased risk of DKA versus sulfonylureas (HR [95% CI]: 1.53 [1.31-1.79]), DPP-4i (1.28 [1.11-1.47]), GLP-1 receptor agonists (1.34 [1.12-1.60]), metformin (1.31 [1.11-1.54]), and insulinotropic AHAs (1.38 [1.15-1.66]). Using the narrow definition of T2DM, new users of SGLT2i had an increased risk of DKA versus sulfonylureas (1.43 [1.01-2.01]). New users of SGLT2i had a lower risk of DKA versus insulin and a similar risk as thiazolidinediones, regardless of T2DM definition. Conclusions Increased risk of DKA was observed for new users of SGLT2i versus several non-SGLT2i AHAs when T2DM was defined broadly. When T2DM was defined narrowly to exclude possible misclassified patients, an increased risk of DKA with SGLT2i was observed compared with sulfonylureas.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.
