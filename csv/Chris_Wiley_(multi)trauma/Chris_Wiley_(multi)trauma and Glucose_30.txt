AB  - Summary A 3-month-old female Warmblood foal, weighing 150?kg, was presented to the Equine Clinic of the University of Hannover with a fracture of the ulna (type 5 fracture of the olecranon). Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and ketamine after sedation with xylazine and maintained with isoflurane. Anaesthesia was uneventful until cardiac arrest occurred in the early recovery period. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed with chest compressions and electrical defibrillation. During resuscitation palpebral reflexes and spontaneous breathing returned but ventricular fibrillation could not be converted to sinus rhythm by transthoracic defibrillation of the heart by electrical shock.

AB  - Abstract Background Mediastinitis following pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with significantly high morbidity and mortality. Method In our review, 21 studies from 1986 to 2011 (12 retrospective studies, eight prospective studies, and a multi-institutional study) including 44,693 pediatric cardiac patients were analyzed. Results and Conclusion Younger age, malnutrition, preoperative respiratory tract infection, high American anesthesiology score, longer duration of surgery, prolonged ventilation, and ICU stay were definite risk factors for mediastinitis. Early primary closure over drains, vacuum-assisted closure, muscle flap, and omental flap remain the most frequently performed treatments for post-sternotomy mediastinitis. Vacuum-assisted closure has emerged as the technique of choice in recent years. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12243 (J Card Surg 2014;29:74-82)

AB  - Abstract Man has used hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms for centuries. The characteristics of these plants that led to their incorporation into important ritualistic and spiritual traditions, however, have also resulted in their widespread propagation and abuse. Hallucinogenic plants have long been depicted as innocuous substances, yet their unpredictable nature makes intoxication potentially dangerous. In present-day society, there is greater access to these drugs and a growing trend among the younger generations to experiment with these plants in a recreational fashion. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the potential sources of plant hallucinogens and the spectrum of toxic effects. A review of the more common hallucinogenic plants and fungi is discussed with reference to historical, pharmacological and clinical aspects of these intoxications.

AB  - Summary The prevalence of underlying renal disease in pregnancy is estimated to be as high as 3%. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal death are increased. Although data are limited, current evidence indicates that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy serum creatinine is the best predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes are progressively worse with higher stages of chronic kidney disease. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize the well-being of both patients: the mother and her fetus. Pregnancies complicated by dialysis and renal transplant warrant special considerations. Effective contraception and evidence-based preconception counseling are important.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common medical emergency and may represent up to 14% of all diabetic admissions with an annual incidence of about 4.6 cases per 1,000 diabetics per year. A spectrum of disease is encountered and mortality rates vary in different series from 1.9% to 15%. The pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on interpretation of biochemistry results and on fluid and electrolyte resuscitation. A flexible approach to fluid resuscitation, careful interpretation of biochemistry results, and close monitoring should be combined with other standard aspects of management such as titratable insulin infusions and early treatment of identifiable precipitants in order to minimise morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Background The Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) study is an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of early goal-directed therapy compared with standard care for patients presenting to the ED with severe sepsis. Objective In keeping with current practice, and taking into considerations aspects of trial design and reporting specific to non-pharmacologic interventions, this document outlines the principles and methods for analysing and reporting the trial results. The document is prepared prior to completion of recruitment into the ARISE study, without knowledge of the results of the interim analysis conducted by the data safety and monitoring committee and prior to completion of the two related international studies. Methods The statistical analysis plan was designed by the ARISE chief investigators, and reviewed and approved by the ARISE steering committee. The data collected by the research team as specified in the study protocol, and detailed in the study case report form were reviewed. Information related to baseline characteristics, characteristics of delivery of the trial interventions, details of resuscitation and other related therapies, and other relevant data are described with appropriate comparisons between groups. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes for the study are defined, with description of the planned statistical analyses. Results A statistical analysis plan was developed, along with a trial profile, mock-up tables and figures. A plan for presenting baseline characteristics, microbiological and antibiotic therapy, details of the interventions, processes of care and concomitant therapies, along with adverse events are described. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes are described along with identification of subgroups to be analysed. Conclusion A statistical analysis plan for the ARISE study has been developed, and is available in the public domain, prior to the completion of recruitment into the study. This will minimise analytic bias and conforms to current best practice in conducting clinical trials.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - A progressive pulmonary disease resulting in severe respiratory failure and death in an average of 3 weeks was diagnosed in 11 young Dalmatian dogs. The dogs were from 4 litters, all genetically related by a common ancestor. The initial clinical signs were tachypnea and noisy respiration. Respiratory distress developed shortly before death and was characterized by strenuous and rapid respirations, along with cyanosis and vomiting. On blood gas analysis, there were severe arterial hypoxemia, hypercapma, and marked alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Radiographically, a diffuse pattern of alveolar, interstitial, and peribronchial densities was observed in the lungs. Most dogs developed pneumomediastinum and gastroesophageal intussusception in the terminal phase of the disease. There was no response to treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, diuretics, or oxygen. At necropsy, the lungs were wet, heavy, and relatively airless. Absence of 1 kidney in 2 dogs and severe internal hydrocephalus in 2 dogs were additional necropsy findings. Pulmonary histopathology included metaplasia and atypia of the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, a nonpurulent inflammatory reaction characterized mainly by mononuclear cells and macrophages, eosinophilic hyaline membrane formation, and focal pulmonary fibrosis. The histological manifestations were typical of acute lung injury. Clinically, the findings were consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), except for the relatively long course. No known risk factors for ARDS, such as trauma, toxin exposure, infection, or endotoxemia could be identified. The relationship of the other abnormalities (ie, renal aplasia, hydrocephalus) to the pulmonary disease also remains obscure. An inherited defect is suspected, because segregation analysis of the 4 litters suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.

AB  - Summary Abdominal pain is common in school-aged children and is rarely organic, but there is a diverse and extensive differential diagnosis. The Rome III criteria set out diagnostic features of the functional bowel disorders. Most cases require screening investigations, and ?reg flags? identify those more likely to have underlying pathology. Management is often multi-disciplinary, especially important when chronic pain is debilitating and responds poorly to drug or dietary intervention.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.

AB  - Summary Growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial inhibition plays a major role in the development of multiple organ failure during sepsis. Early correction of tissue hypoxia, strict control of glycaemia and modulation of oxidative and nitrosative stress may protect mitochondria during the acute inflammatory response. Once mitochondrial dysfunction has developed, the regulated induction of a hypometabolic state, analogous to hibernation, may protect the cells from severe bioenergetic failure and a critical fall in ATP. Though this is clinically manifest as organ dysfunction, it may actually represent an adaptive response to a prolonged, severe inflammatory stress. Repair of damaged organelles, stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and re-activation of cellular metabolism may accelerate the recovery phase and thus improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this review is to discuss putative interventions aimed at preventing or reversing mitochondrial dysfunction that may have possible clinical relevance, and to stress the importance of the correct timing of intervention.

AB  - Summary Background Medetomidine suppresses cardiovascular function and reduces gastrointestinal motility in horses mainly through peripheral α2-adrenoceptors. Vatinoxan, a peripheral α2-antagonist, has been shown experimentally to alleviate the adverse effects of some α2-agonists in horses. However, vatinoxan has not been investigated during constant-rate infusion (CRI) of medetomidine in standing horses. Objectives To evaluate effects of vatinoxan on cardiovascular function, gastrointestinal motility and on sedation level during CRI of medetomidine. Study design Experimental, randomised, blinded, cross-over study. Methods Six healthy horses were given medetomidine hydrochloride, 7 ?g/kg i.v., without (MED) and with (MED+V) vatinoxan hydrochloride, 140 ?g/kg i.v., followed by CRI of medetomidine at 3.5 ?g/kg/h for 60 min. Cardiorespiratory variables were recorded and borborygmi and sedation levels were scored for 120 min. Plasma drug concentrations were measured. The data were analysed using repeated measures ANCOVA and paired t-tests as appropriate. Results Initially heart rate (HR) was significantly lower and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) significantly higher with MED compared with MED+V. For example at 10 min HR (mean ± s.d.) was 26 ± 2 and 31 ± 5 beats/minute (P = 0.04) and MAP 129 ± 15 and 103 ± 13 mmHg (P<0.001) respectively. At 10 min, cardiac index was lower (P = 0.02) and systemic vascular resistance higher (P = 0.001) with MED than with MED+V. Borborygmi were reduced after MED; this effect was attenuated by vatinoxan (P<0.001). All horses were sedated with medetomidine, but the mean sedation scores were reduced with MED+V until 20 min (6.8 ± 0.8 and 4.5 ± 1.5 with MED and MED+V, respectively, at 10 min, P = 0.001). Plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine was significantly lower in the presence of vatinoxan (P = 0.01). Main limitations Experimental study with healthy, unstimulated animals. Conclusions Vatinoxan administered i.v. with a loading dose of medetomidine improved cardiovascular function and gastrointestinal motility during medetomidine CRI in healthy horses. Sedation was slightly yet significantly reduced during the first 20 min.. The Summary is available in Portuguese ? see Supporting Information
