AB  - Abstract Proper pancreas retrieval during multi-organ recovery is one of the cornerstones of technically successful whole-organ pancreas transplantation. With evolving surgical approaches for organ retrieval and implantation, it has become standard to procure the pancreas in conjunction with other abdominal organs without compromising either vasculature, graft quality, or transplant outcomes. This review summarizes the major steps required for proper whole-organ retrieval of the pancreas allograft with suggestions and tips whenever alternative approaches are available.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.

AB  - A three-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for loss of vision associated with hyperthermia, lethargy and anorexia. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis. Cytological examination of aqueous and vitreous humours was performed and revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture from aqueous and vitreous humour. No primary infection site was identified. Active uveitis resolved after systemic antibiotic therapy, but the vision loss was permanent. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to E. faecalis infection in a cat.

AB  - Abstract Cystic fibrosis patients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trauma, burn wound, or patients requiring ventilation are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physiological innate defense mechanisms against this pathogen, and their alterations in lung diseases, are for the most part unknown. We now demonstrate a role for the sphingoid long chain base, sphingosine, in determining susceptibility to lung infection by P. aeruginosa. Tracheal and bronchial sphingosine levels were significantly reduced in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients and from cystic fibrosis mouse models due to reduced activity of acid ceramidase, which generates sphingosine from ceramide. Inhalation of mice with sphingosine, with a sphingosine analog, FTY720, or with acid ceramidase rescued susceptible mice from infection. Our data suggest that luminal sphingosine in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells prevents pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in normal individuals, paving the way for novel therapeutic paradigms based on inhalation of acid ceramidase or of sphingoid long chain bases in lung infection.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High concentrations of lactate approx. 10?mM are characteristic of wound healing. We have previously shown that lactate instigates release of VEGF from macrophages and endothelial cells. Our present study uses an in vivo murine Matrigel model to study how lactate enhances vascular development and repair. METHODS: Matrigel is a reconstituted basement membrane complex, a liquid at 4 degree C. When injected subcutaneously, it reconstitutes as a gel. 30?mgs of finely divided polylactate polymer (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was mixed with 1cc of Matrigel, and 2 injections were made into the dorsum of each of 60 (average 7/group), 6-month-old Swiss Webster mice. The gel implants were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 11 and 16 days post injection, and were fixed in buffered formalin or frozen. Cell migration and vascular development were assessed using H&E, anti-CD31 and anti-MAC3 antibody stainings for leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Cells and vessels were quantified microscopically. RESULTS: Control implants (without polylactate) developed little or no inflammation or angiogenesis. Polylactated implants developed highly significant number of endothelial cells and recognizable vessels at 6 and 9 days. At 11 and 16 days, sizeable vessels with surrounding connective tissue were found. Though a moderate inflammation occurred in the lactate groups, no foreign body reaction was seen. Larger implants of high molecular weight instigated little inflammation and few vessels. CONCLUSION: Slowly released lactate leads to the formation of new vessels. Our results provide support for further clinical applications of lactate polymer in wounds. NIH/NIGMS Trauma Training Grant

AB  - Abstract Objectives Hypothermia has a well-established neuroprotective effect and offers a foundation for combination therapy for brain ischemia. The authors evaluated the effect of combination therapy with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and hypothermia on brain structure and function in the setting of global brain ischemia and reperfusion in rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to groups by a registrar. Animals were subjected to 8 minutes of global brain ischemia using bilateral carotid occlusion and systemic hypotension, followed by 7 days (Stage I dose studies) or 28 days (Stage II outcome studies) of reperfusion. Sham controls were subjected to surgery, but not ischemia. Stage II animals were randomized to no treatment, IGF-1 at the dose determined in Stage I, hypothermia (32°C for 4 hours), or a combination of IGF-1 and hypothermia. Stage II animals underwent 21 days of spatial memory testing. At 7 days (Stage I) or 28 days (Stage II), brains were harvested for counting of CA1 neurons. The primary Stage II outcome was a neurologic outcome index computed as the ratio of viable CA1 neurons per 300-?m field to the number of days to reach success criteria on the memory task. Results Stage I experiments confirmed the neuroprotective effect of the hypothermia protocol and IGF-1 at a dose of 0.6 U/kg. Stage II studies suggested that early neuroprotection with hypothermia and IGF-1 was not well maintained to 28 days and that combination therapy was more beneficial than either IGF-1 or hypothermia alone. Median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) of viable neurons per 300-?m field were 114 (IQR = 99.5 to 136) for sham, three (IQR = 2 to 4.8) for untreated ischemia, four (IQR = 3 to 70.25) for ischemia treated with IGF-1 alone, 25 (IQR = 3 to 70) for ischemia treated with hypothermia alone, and 78 (IQR 47.3 to 97.5) for ischemia treated with combination therapy. Days to memory success criteria were 13.6 (IQR = 11.5 to 15.5 days) for sham, 23.5 (IQR = 20 to 25.5 days) for untreated ischemia, 17.5 (IQR = 15.5 to 25.5 days) for ischemia treated with IGF-1, 15 (IQR = 14.5 to 21 days) for ischemia treated with hypothermia, and 13.5 (IQR = 12.25 to 18.5 days) for ischemia treated with combination therapy. Neurologic outcome indices were 8.5 (IQR = 7.4 to 9.5) for sham, 0.14 (IQR = 0.08 to 0.2) for untreated ischemia, 0.18 (IQR = 0.17 to 4.6) for ischemia treated with IGF-1, 0.7 (IQR = 0.2 to 4.8) for ischemia treated with hypothermia, and 5.7 (IQR = 3.3 to 6.2) for ischemia treated with combination therapy. Statistically significant differences in neuron counts, days to memory test criteria, and outcome index were found between sham and untreated ischemic animals. Of the three treatment regimens, only combination therapy showed a statistically significant difference from the untreated ischemic group for neuronal salvage (p = 0.02), days to criteria (p = 0.043), and outcome index (p = 0.014). Conclusions Combination therapy with IGF-1 (0.6 U/kg) and therapeutic hypothermia (32°C for 4 hours) at the onset of reperfusion synergistically preserves CA1 structure and function at 28 days after 8 minutes of global brain ischemia in healthy male rats.

AB  - Summary The overall success rate for aphakic contact lens wear is related to motivation. It is highest in bilateral cases. Most successful results occur in physically and mentally active individuals, and poorest results in the unilateral alphakic, especially in infancy. Prolonged, or extended wear gives hope to many patients at the extremes of age. The criteria for extended wear is high gas flow materials, perfection in optical finish, and best fitting lens form. When considering the different materials available and their physio-chemical properties, attention must be paid to the lens form. Thus high plasticity and low elasticity means a large lens, and high elasticity a small thin lens. The problems of constant wear are still sufficiently serious to make such lenses experimental in use. Thus infect/on can occur secondary to chronic oedema and trauma of the surface epithelium. Infection may be introduced at the time of insertion, but also arises by the abnormal environment produced by contact lens wear resulting in gram negative pathogenic organisms invading the cornea. Whilst the aphakic eye may be an easy eye to fit and tolerate the lens, this may mask the onset of chronic oedema and neovascularisation. Studies in the Contact Lens Department at Moorfields using 85% Sauflon and 75% Duragel indicate over 50% of aphakics in the adult group wear soft lenses constantly for several months, but new lenses are often required every six months and in children more often. Better surfaced lenses are necessary before a safer system will result to encourage prolonged wear.

AB  - Abstract Usually dentists in Australia give patients oral antibiotics after dentoalveolar surgery as a prophylaxis against wound infection. When this practice is compared to the principle of antibiotic prophylaxis in major surgery it is found to be at variance in a number of ways. In major surgery, the risk of infection should be high, and the consequences of infection severe or catastrophic, before antibiotic prophylaxis is ordered. If it is provided then a high dose of an appropriate spectrum antibiotic must be present in the blood prior to the first incision. Other factors which need to be considered are the degree of tissue trauma, the extent of host compromise, other medical comorbidities and length of hospitalization. Standardized protocols of administration have been determined and evaluated for most major surgical procedures. Dentoalveolar surgery is undoubtedly a skilled and technically challenging procedure. However, in contrast to major surgical procedures, it has a less than five per cent infection rate and rarely has severe adverse consequences. Dentoalveolar surgery should be of short duration with minimal tissue damage and performed in the dental chair under local anaesthesia. Controlled studies for both mandibular third molar surgery and placement of dental implants show little or no evidence of benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis and there is an adverse risk from the antibiotic. This review concludes that there is no case for antibiotic prophylaxis for most dentoalveolar surgery in fit patients. In the few cases where it can be considered, a single high pre-operative dose should be given.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Brain inflammation has been implicated in the development of brain edema and secondary brain damage in ischemia and trauma. Adhesion molecules, cytokines and leukocyte chemoattractants released/presented at the site of blood-brain barrier (BBB) play an important role in mobilizing peripheral inflammatory cells into the brain. Cerebral endothelial cells (CEC) are actively engaged in processes of microvascular stasis and leukocyte infiltration by producing a plethora of pro-inflammatory mediators. When challenged by external stimuli including cytokines and hypoxia, CEC have been shown to release/express various products of arachidonic acid cascade with both vasoactive and pro-inflammatory properties, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These metabolites induce platelet and neutrophil activation and adhesion, changes in local cerebral blood flow and blood rheology, and increases in BBB permeability. Ischemic CEC have also been shown to express and release bioactive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-I?, IL-8 and MCP-1. Many of these mediators and ischemia in vitro and in vivo have been shown to up-regulate the expression of both selectin and Ig-families of adhesion molecules in CEC and to facilitate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration into the brain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a pivotal role of CEC in initiating and regulating inflammatory responses in cerebral ischemia. Summary Inflammatory genes/mediators are involved in molecular/biochemical cascades determining stroke outcome. Cerebral endothelial cells, targeted by inflammatory mediators produced in ischemic brain, undergo pro-inflammatory activation by expressing/secreting various inflammatory mediators, thus becoming a source of inflammation themselves. A unique position of the cerebral endothelial cells at the interface between blood and brain establishes their role as principal regulators of peripheral inflammatory cell recruitment into the brain during stroke. Cerebral endothelial cells also exhibit ability to regulate vasomotor responses of brain microcirculation and the permeability of the BBB, both important components of inflammation. Therefore, approaches to attenuate consequences of stroke must take into consideration cerebral endothelial cells as an easily accessible target to interfere with the ischemic brain inflammation.

Outcome Postoperative complications occurred due to unusually large volume ileostomy output in the subsequent 4 weeks, resulting in severe volume depletion and the sequelae that required intensive care support. These were triggered and prolonged by two episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis. Conclusions Sepsis-induced high ileostomy output following intestinal resection for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia is a serious complication. Early restoration of intestinal continuity following bowel resection for established infarction may prevent this complication.

AB  - Summary The number of pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes is rising as a function of maternal age and obesity. Type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes (GDM) result in hyperglycaemia that increases the frequency of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. This chapter reviews the evidence-base for the management of diabetes in pregnancy. Specifically, it reviews the clinical measures to be taken for pre-conception care, antenatal care, perinatal care, and postnatal care. At the pre-conception stage, women should be counselled that improving glycaemia reduces the risk of miscarriage, congenital malformation and neonatal death. Women with pre-gestational diabetes should be reviewed in a multidisciplinary clinic as soon as a viable pregnancy is confirmed, ideally before 12 weeks gestation. Labour should take place on a dedicated obstetric ward with a neonatal unit. Blood glucose should be maintained between 4?7 mmol/l to reduce the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia and foetal distress syndrome.

AB  - Aims This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02453555) evaluated the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin (Empa) 10 or 25 mg as add-on to linagliptin (Lina) 5 mg (fixed-dose combination, Empa/Lina 10/5 or 25/5) in insufficiently controlled Japanese type 2 diabetes patients. Methods The trial (40 sites; May 2015-March 2017) involved screening 433 adults (≥20 years) who were treatment-naive or were using one oral antidiabetic drug for ≥12 weeks, which was discontinued at enrolment. Patients with HbA1c 7.5%-10.0% after ≥16 weeks of using Lina (pre-enrolment or during a 16-week, open-label period) and 2 weeks of using placebo (Plc) for Empa/Lina 10/5, plus Lina, were randomized (2:1) to once-daily Empa/Lina 10/5 (n = 182) or Plc/Lina 10/5 (n = 93) for 24 weeks. Patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.0% at Week 24 received Empa/Lina up-titrated to 25/5 (n = 126) or the corresponding placebo (n = 80), per randomization, from Week 28; 172 Empa/Lina and 84 Plc/Lina patients completed 52 weeks. Results Change from baseline in HbA1c was greater (P < .0001) with Empa/Lina than with Plc/Lina at Week 24 (primary outcome, ?0.93% vs 0.21%; adjusted mean difference, ?1.14%) and Week 52 (?1.16% vs 0.06%; adjusted mean difference, ?1.22%). More patients with HbA1c < 7.0% and greater decreases in fasting plasma glucose, body weight and systolic blood pressure were seen in the Empa/Lina group than in the Plc/Lina group. Empa/Lina was well tolerated. The adverse events that were more frequent with Empa/Lina were known empagliflozin-associated events (eg, increased urination, increased blood ketones). There were no adjudication-confirmed diabetic ketoacidosis events or lower limb amputations. Conclusions These results support the notion that empagliflozin-linagliptin in fixed-dose combination is a therapeutic option for Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Summary Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by an acute onset of severe headache and multi-focal segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries resolving within 12 weeks. Diagnostic criteria include normal or near-normal findings in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, especially leucocyte levels < 10/mm?. Distinguishing RCVS from primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is essential to avoid unnecessary and sometimes unfavourable immunosuppressive treatment. We reviewed retrospectively the clinical and diagnostic data of 10 RCVS patients who presented in our neurological department from 1 January 2013 to February 2017. The main purpose was to verify whether CSF leucocyte counts < 10/mm? serve to discriminate RCVS from PACNS. Five of six patients who underwent lumbar puncture presented with CSF leucocyte levels ≥ 10/mm?. Two patients had a history of misinterpretation of CSF pleocytosis as cerebral vasculitis and of immunosuppressive treatment. A complete restitution of cerebral vasoconstriction was evident in all. No patient had further cerebral strokes or bleedings without immunosuppressive treatment over more than 12 weeks. Despite the established diagnostic criteria, RCVS can manifest with CSF leucocyte levels > 10/mm?. Careful anamnesis and the response of ?vasculitis-like angiography? to nimodipine given as a test during angiography and as oral medication are key to differentiate RCVS from cerebral vasculitis.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.
