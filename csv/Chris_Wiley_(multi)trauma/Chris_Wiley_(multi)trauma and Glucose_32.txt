AB  - Aim:?? The aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of Mandibular fractures in the indigenous Australians and define any commonly occurring patterns. Patients and Methods:?? A retrospective series of 485 patients with Mandibular fractures admitted to the maxillofacial unit during the period January 1999 to June 2003 were analysed. Demographic data on patient's age, sex, aetiology, alcohol consumption at the time of injury, urban/rural status were recorded and assessed. Results:?? The epidemiology of an unselected series of Mandibular fractures is defined in this study. The overall incidence of Mandibular fractures was 54.5 cases per 100,000 populations per year. The incidence in indigenous Australians was 155 cases per 100,000 populations per year (2nd highest in the world). 72% of the patients were Aboriginal. 72% of the patients were male and 28% female. 90% of the females were indigenous. Most fractures were caused by assault (82.5%). 92% of the aboriginal women with mandibular fractures were assaulted. 69.9% of the patients were under the influence of alcohol at the time of injury. 6.18% of patients in this series had a recurrent mandibular fracture. In 5% of the patients the presenting symptom was an abscess from the mandibular fracture. Conclusions:?? The incidence and causes of mandibular fractures reflect trauma patterns (assaults and domestic violence) with in the aboriginal community in Northern Territory. Strategies to identify risk factors linked to Assaults and Domestic Violence and to help families to reduce the incidence of violence and alcoholism are integral to addressing this problem.

AB  - Numbers of corpora amylacea (CA) were observed among 1407 autopsied and/or biopsied cases where diabetes mellitus had been diagnosed clinically and in those where the diabetes mellitus did not exist. A comparative examination was carried out by a semi-quantitative method which revealed a significant difference in the incidence of CA between 100 diabetic and 100 non-diabetic cases. However, there was not a significant difference in the incidence of CA between the diabetic and ischemic cases who have also shown a tendency for developing CA. The results were evaluated statistically by homogeneity examination. Diabetes may enhance the tendency for forming CA by the hyperglycemia increasing the quantity of unused carbohydrate polymers, which are the main components of CA. Changes in the metabolism of glucose by astrocytes caused by aging or by some pathological processes may play a primary role in the developing of CA. Other factors such as the greater volume of cerebrospinal fluid, barrier disturbances and pathological changes which are associated with the appearance of heat stroke protein positivity in CA, also have a prominent role in this type of astrocytic degeneration. The presence of CA does not have any pathognostic significance but some conditions favor its development. A theory is also suggested for the formation of CA similar to other types of biocrystalloids in the central nervous system.

AB  - Aims Type 1 diabetes can be complicated with neuropathy that involves immune-mediated and inflammatory pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, have shown anti-inflammatory properties, and thus we hypothesized that long-term treatment with liraglutide induced diminished inflammation and thus improved neuronal function. Methods The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Titration was 6 weeks to 1.2?1.8 mg/d, continuing for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in latency of early brain evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints were changes in proinflammatory cytokines, cortical evoked potential, autonomic function and peripheral neurophysiological testing. Results Thirty-nine patients completed the study, of whom 19 received liraglutide. In comparison to placebo, liraglutide reduced interleukin-6 (?22.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?38.1, ?3.2; P = .025) with concomitant numerical reductions in other proinflammatory cytokines. However neuronal function was unaltered at the central, autonomic or peripheral level. Treatment was associated with ?3.38 kg (95% CI: ?5.29, ?1.48; P < .001] weight loss and a decrease in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (?40.2%; 95% CI: ?60.6, ?9.5; P = .02). Conclusion Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - A 14-month-old, male German shepherd dog was evaluated for chronic, recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. An initial diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made, which resolved with appropriate antibacterial therapy. The urinary tract infection, however, did not resolve and on further investigation a bladder trigone diverticulum was evident, thought to be congenital in origin. This report describes the apparent ultrasonographic and radiological changes, and surgical repair of the diverticulum, and reviews the literature with regard to both congenital bladder trigone diverticulum and emphysematous cystitis. The former has never been documented in the dog and the latter is an unusual finding in a non-diabetic dog.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the main tasks a foundation doctor can expect to face in their surgical job, and provides practical tips and advice to guide them in becoming a proficient, confident, multi-tasking junior surgeon. All patients undergoing elective surgery will be assessed preoperatively, usually in pre-assessment clinics a few weeks prior to surgery. To reduce the risk of aspiration during anaesthesia, patients are fasted preoperatively. Obtaining consent is an art combining communication skills, surgical knowledge and perception. Further to all the checks doctor have done, further perioperative checks are done according to the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. Thromboprophylaxis is essential in the surgical setting. One of doctor's most important roles on the wards will be management of post-operative patients. They will need a constant degree of suspicion for emerging complications, which may be directly related to surgery or indirect responses to the physiological stresses of surgery and anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract The versatile electrospinning technique is recognized as an efficient strategy to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients and has gained tremendous progress in drug delivery, tissue engineering, cancer therapy, and disease diagnosis. Numerous drug delivery systems fabricated through electrospinning regarding the carrier compositions, drug incorporation techniques, release kinetics, and the subsequent therapeutic efficacy are presented herein. Targeting for distinct applications, the composition of drug carriers vary from natural/synthetic polymers/blends, inorganic materials, and even hybrids. Various drug incorporation approaches through electrospinning are thoroughly discussed with respect to the principles, benefits, and limitations. To meet the various requirements in actual sophisticated in vivo environments and to overcome the limitations of a single carrier system, feasible combinations of multiple drug-inclusion processes via electrospinning could be employed to achieve programmed, multi-staged, or stimuli-triggered release of multiple drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of the designed electrospun drug-eluting systems is further verified in multiple biomedical applications and is comprehensively overviewed, demonstrating promising potential to address a variety of clinical challenges.

AB  - A multi-institutional study ?Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth? (PDAY) was initiated to document the natural history of atherosclerosis, its relationship to risk factors, and pathobiology of lesion development in young subjects. Pathology laboratories in nine centers collected arteries and tissues from over 2000 persons from 15 through 34 years of age whose deaths were attributed to homicides, accidents, or suicides. Arteries were evaluated for lesions, and risk factors were analyzed in a central laboratory. Postmortem risk factors included serum lipoproteins, serum thio-cyanate (smoking), glycohemoglobin (diabetes), thickness of panniculus adiposus (obesity), small renal artery changes (hypertension) and apoprotein isoforms. This study documents the development of atherosclerosis at an early age. It also shows that the recognized risk factors for coronary heart disease are associated with lesion development in the arteries of these young subjects. The PDAY study has a counterpart in Japan where the development of atherosclerosis has been studied in young subjects. This Japanese study, in a population in which coronary heart disease has not yet become a major epidemic, has findings quite similar to the findings from the PDAY study. Studies of atherosclerosis in both Japan and the USA provide strong justification for reducing risk factors in young persons.

AB  - Summary Infants of birth weight ≤2500?g are termed low birth weight (LBW). These children often have considerable morbidity from prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction. Additionally, LBW infants have increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac congenital anomalies and may require surgery. Primary rather than palliative surgical repair of cardiac lesions has been preferred in recent years. However, LBW remains a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity after open-heart surgery (OHS). There is a paucity of information about the anesthetic challenges presented by LBW infants undergoing OHS. This review summarizes the perioperative issues of relevance to anesthesiologists who manage these high-risk patients. Emphasis is placed on management concerns that are unique to LBW infants. Retrospective data from the authors? institution are provided for those aspects of anesthetic care that lack published studies. Successful outcome often requires substantial hospital resources and collaborative multi-disciplinary effort.

AB  - Abstract The phenomenon of spreading depression (SD) involves waves of profound neuronal and glial depolarization that spread throughout brain tissue. Under many conditions, tissue recovers full function after SD has occurred, but SD-like events are also associated with spread of injury following ischemia or trauma. Initial large cytosolic Ca2+ increases accompany all forms of SD, but persistently elevated Ca2+ loading is likely responsible for neuronal injury following SD in tissues where metabolic capacity is insufficient to restore ionic gradients. Ca2+ channels are also involved in the propagation of SD, but the channel subtypes and cation fluxes differ significantly when SD is triggered by different types of stimuli. Ca2+ influx via P/Q type channels is important for SD generated by localized application of high K+ solutions. In contrast, SD-like events recorded in in vitro ischemia models are not usually prevented by Ca2+ removal, but under some conditions, Zn2+ influx via L-type channels contributes to SD initiation. This review addresses different roles of Ca2+ in the initiation and consequences of SD, and discusses recent evidence that selective chelation of Zn2+ can be sufficient to prevent SD under circumstances that may have relevance for ischemic injury.

AB  - Abstract The most common errors in the diagnosis of dementia are underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Underdiagnosis is best avoided by careful use of psychometric screening tests to detect cognitive impairment in patients unaware of their own defect. Overdiagnosis can be avoided by not applying the label of ?dementia? until the diagnosis is unequivocal. Complete evaluation is necessary to rule out treatable causes of dementia, and should include medical, neurological, and psychiatric history and examination, simple psychometric tests, laboratory battery, computerized transaxial tomographic brain scan, and electroencephalogram. Ultimately, the diagnosis of dementia may change at follow-up examination, and the unequivocal diagnosis of a specific form of dementia still requires autopsy and neuropathological examination of the brain. The most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly include Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, depression, and other specific illnesses such as tumors, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Even systemic disease can present as dementia. The evaluation outlined above may help distinguish among these causes. New diagnostic techniques may eventually be helpful as well.
