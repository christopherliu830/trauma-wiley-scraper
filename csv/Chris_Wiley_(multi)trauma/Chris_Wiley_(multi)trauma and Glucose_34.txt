AB  - Abstract Although the medical profession is slowly realizing that many disorders in the aged must be treated differently than in the young, there is still no proper appreciation of these age differences. Too often, when a patient reaches life-expectancy age, the physician relaxes his medical attention. It is assumed that the patient will die soon, although the actuarial statistics may show that he has many more years of life. Accordingly, therapy should be more intensive in order to attain the maximal life span. Elderly people will tolerate many major operations (e.g., herniorrhaphy or thyroidectomy) as well as young people. However, when it comes to serious major operations (e.g., radical neck dissection or radical excision of the rectum for carcinoma), the mortality rate for the aged may be four to eight times higher than for young patients. Elderly patients tolerate emergency major operations and complications very poorly. The chronologic age is not the chief factor in the mortality rate; more important are the operative complications. Therefore, preoperatively, every effort should be made to identify and treat diseases that might cause complications postoperatively. After operation a close watch must be kept for complications so that they may be treated promptly and effectively. Operative technic must be meticulous, with no excessive trauma and with particular attention to hemostasis and wound closure. The operation should be completed in the shortest possible time consistent with safety. A summary of 6 reports in the medical literature shows an operative mortality rate for major operations of 2.6 per cent in patients under 60, compared to 7.2 per cent for patients over 60. The mortality rate for emergency operations is much higher than for elective operations?18.5 per cent versus 6.5 per cent, respectively. A summary of 4 reports shows that cardiac complications were the greatest single cause of postoperative mortality (21.6 per cent), with pneumonia and atelectasis a close second. Despite precautions such as bandaging the extremities and early ambulation, pulmonary embolism accounted for 9.4 per cent of the deaths. [Though inoperable carcinoma caused more deaths (22.2 per cent of the entire group) than any of the other diseases, it is classified as a multiple cause.] Since the mortality rate for major operations in both aged and young patients is still significant, there is great need for more accuracy in determining operability.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess the cardiopulmonary effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine for management of isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses. Study design Prospective randomized clinical study. Animals Fourteen isoflurane-anesthetized horses undergoing digital palmar neurectomy. Methods Ephedrine (EPH group; 0.02 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) or phenylephrine (PHE group; 0.002 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) was administered to all horses when mean arterial pressure (MAP) was <60 mmHg. The infusions were ended when the target MAP was achieved, corresponding to a 50% increase over the pre-infusion MAP (baseline). The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow the collection of blood for pH and blood-gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded at baseline and at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after achieving the target MAP. Results In both groups, the MAP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased significantly at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05). The EPH group had a significant increase in cardiac index (CI) and systemic oxygen delivery index at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05) and compared to the PHE group (p < 0.05). The PHE group had significantly higher SVR and no decrease in oxygen extraction compared with the EPH group at 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion (p < 0.05). No significant differences in ventilatory parameters were observed between groups after the infusion. Conclusions Ephedrine increased the MAP by increasing CI and SVR. Phenylephrine increased MAP by increasing SVR but cardiac index decreased. Ephedrine resulted in better tissue oxygenation than phenylephrine. Clinical relevance Ephedrine would be preferable to phenylephrine to treat isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses since it increases blood flow and pressure.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Introduction:? Electric fields of the magnitude likely to occur in electrical injury can result in skeletal muscle electroporation. It has been reported that Poloxamer 188 (P188) is able to seal damaged cell membranes. Using a previously described rat hind limb model of electrical injury, in this study we employ MRI to demonstrate that intravenously administered P188 arrests muscle tissue edema caused by electrical shock. Methods:? Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat hindlimbs were subjected to 12 electrical shock pulses of 2?kV and ?2A amplitude with duration of 4?ms. There was a 10-second separation period between shocks to allow thermal relaxation. Animals received either P188 or Lactated Ringer?s Injection (control) intravenously at 60 minutes after shock. Proton MRI were recorded using a 4.7-Tesla Bruker scanner (200?MHz). A Multi-Slice Multi-Echo (MSME) spin echo sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted images. Ten slices over the entire midthigh region were taken. For each slice, images from 10 echos in the TE range of 10?ms?100?ms and TR?=?2000?ms were collected. Imaging began at 60 minutes and continued until 3 hours postshock. The signal intensities at different TE times were used to fit an exponential decay and measure the T2 value in each voxel. Voxels with T2 values?>?80?ms were considered injured. Results:? There were noticeable increases of injured area with time for electrically injured limbs due to development of edema. Control-treated rats averaged a 58.0%(±6.59% SD) increase in total area of injury. The total area of injury for P188-treated rats increased by 46.6%(±2.96% SD) In nonelectroporation limbs, no change in T2 occurred. Discussion:? Disruption of the plasma membrane due to electrical current leads to edema. We treated the injured muscles with P188 and observed that it helped to arrest edema. MRI proved effective not only in characterizing the degree of injury resulting from electrical shock but also in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.

AB  - Abstract Aim Hospital inpatient care for children with diabetes is frequently mentioned by parents as unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to examine the reasons for inpatient admission of children with diabetes and to understand patient and carer experience in order to improve services. Methods Questionnaires were given to medical teams, parents and children during admissions of children with diabetes under 16 years of age in three regions of England. Results There were 401 admissions over 6 months from 3247 patients: 334 (83%) emergency admissions and 59 (15%) elective; the reason is unknown in eight (2%). One hundred and forty-three (36%) were emergency admissions with diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperglycaemia. Clinical teams reported adverse events around insulin administration in 25, hypoglycaemia (sometimes recurrent) in 120 and food provision in 14 admissions. Others included seven incidents around elective surgery. Diabetes clinical teams were not always informed about admissions and only 33% were informed within 2 h. Parents and children reported fewer problems: 62% were involved in care most of the time and 87% were able to give insulin. Most negative comments were about poor staff management of out-of-range blood glucose levels, knowledge of insulin pumps and care of children waiting in the emergency department. Conclusions There were a large number of admissions and the majority were emergencies. Parents generally felt that they receive good care, although with some lack of knowledge amongst the ward staff. There were an unacceptable number of adverse incidents reported. We recommend that education of ward staff in diabetes is carried out regularly with reference to the standards of care.

AB  - Objective To determine the in vitro effects of differing growth factor treatments on the fibrochondrogenic potential of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from cruciate ligament deficient femorotibial joints of dogs. Study Design In vitro study. Sample Population Synoviocytes from dogs (n?=?8) with naturally occurring cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods Synoviocytes were cultured in monolayer and synthesized into tensioned synoviocyte bioscaffolds (TSB) suspended in media containing TGF-?3, or FGF-2, TGF-?1, and IGF-I. The 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and toluidine blue stain assessed glycosaminoglycan content; hydroxyproline assay, and collagen I and II immunohistochemistry assessed collagen content. Biomechanical properties were determined by materials testing/force?deformation curves. Results All tissue cultures formed tensioned fibrous tissue-like constructs. Mean tissue cellularity and cellular viability was significantly greater in the triple growth factor-treated TSB by 0.09% and 44%, respectively. Percentage collagen content, and relative gene expression for collagen I, II, and aggrecan was not significantly different between groups. Median percentage of GAG content was significantly greater in triple growth factor-treated TSB by 1.6%. Biomechanical properties were not different in compression. Triple growth factor-treated TSB were significantly stronger in toughness, peak load to failure, and stiffness in tension. Conclusions TGF-?3 cultured bioscaffolds failed to outperform triple growth factor-treated TSB. Architectural extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cellularity likely explained the differences between groups. TGF-?3 alone cannot be recommended at this time for in vitro formation of autologous fibrocartilage bioscaffolds for meniscal deficiency.

AB  - The pseudorheumatoid nodule (PRN) is a subcutaneous palisading granuloma characterized by a pattern of interstitial histiocytes surrounding an area of collagen necrobiosis and typically unassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is part of the spectrum of palisading granulomatous dermatitidis which includes the rheumatoid nodule, the rheumatic fever nodule, the spirochaete-associated juxtarticular nodes of Lyme disease, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica and the palisading granuloma of Churg and Strauss. PRN has previously been associated with surgical trauma and with retained suture material at old surgical sites. We present a case of PRN arising in a previous biopsy site of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A 48-year-old woman with no history of rheumatoid arthritis or a granulomatous diathesis underwent biopsy of a keratotic left forearm skin lesion on 10/14/03 that showed invasive SCC. She had a re-excision of the the same site on 11/22/03 that grossly showed a central scar. Histology revealed a scar at the site of a recent biopsy with no residual SCC, in the base of which was an area of necrosis palisaded by histiocytes. No residual suture or other polarizable foreign material was identified. Pancytokeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen immunostains were negative. The morphology is considered prototypic for PRN.

AB  - This is the author's third revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 250 new references from 135 different journals. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unrefereed article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by the concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society, and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Summary Cardiogenic shock may be due to a range of cardiac disorders. In 75% of cases, the cause is acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular failure, or, less commonly, ventricular septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture, free wall rupture or right ventricular infarction. This chapter summarizes focused clinical assessment and investigation in suspected cardiogenic shock. Diuretics are relatively ineffective in patients with cardiogenic shock, but can be used in case of fluid overload once the cardiac output has increased (as shown by improvement in the patient's mental state and skin perfusion): if renal function is normal, give furosemide 40 mg IV. If the patient is not improving, consider haemodynamic monitoring using pulse contour or thermodilution techniques to allow more accurate titration of therapy. Specific management is directed at the underlying cause. Pending definitive treatment, systemic blood pressure and organ perfusion must be maintained by inotropic/vasopressor therapy.
