AB  - Reasons for performing study Advanced imaging modalities enable assessment of the equine skull and brain. Horses are susceptible to neurological dysfunction of the cranial nerves; however, our understanding of these structures? imaging anatomy is limited. Hypothesis Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be superior to computed tomography (CT) for the identification of cranial nerves, but optimal assessment may depend on both modalities. Objectives Identify cranial nerves and compare and contrast the utility of MRI and CT images of cadaver and clinical material. Interpret images from both modalities and determine the cranial nerve imaging anatomy. Study design Prospective cadaver anatomical study combined with retrospective clinical case study. Methods The head of a neurologically normal 9-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was scanned immediately following euthanasia (performed for reasons unrelated to this study). High resolution MRI (1.5 Tesla) and CT examinations were conducted over a 12?h interval following euthanasia. Images obtained were compared with selected clinical cases which were scanned during anaesthesia (MRI; approximately 30?60?min) or standing sedation (CT; approximately 30?s). Results On a high resolution MRI scan of a cadaver equine skull, each of the 12 cranial nerves and their topographic location was readily appreciated. Cranial nerves 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more easily identified in clinically relevant MRI scans. CT allowed visualisation of the stylomastoid foramen, the inner and middle ear and cranial nerves 2, 3, 5 and 7. Conclusions High field MRI allows for excellent visualisation of equine cranial nerves. CT allows for detailed visualisation of the osseous canals and foramina. This study advances anatomical knowledge of the normal equine cranial nerves to aid interpretation in horses that display neurological dysfunction localising to the brain and brainstem.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine the prevalence of EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5 in respiratory samples from a large number of horses using quantitative PCR methods. Samples from horses with, and without mild signs of respiratory disease provided an opportunity to examine associations with single or multiple herpesviral infections. Objectives To determine any correlation between quantitative detection of these equine herpesviruses and mild clinical respiratory disease in horses. Methods Nasal swabs were taken from horses with, and without, clinical respiratory disease. Nucleic acid was extracted from all swabs prior to PCR testing for EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5. Clinical signs of respiratory disease included coughing, fever (temperature >38.5°C) or nasal discharge. Results Of the 409 horses, 250 (61%) were clinically normal, 121 (30%) presented with clinical signs consistent with mild respiratory disease and 38 (9%) horses had no traceable clinical history. One-fifth (83/409) of horses sampled were infected with EHV-2 and almost two-thirds 249/409 (60.9%) with EHV-5. Infection with EHV-5 was significantly associated with mild respiratory disease (85/121; 70.2%) compared to nondiseased horses (137/249; 55%) P?=?0.005. The proportion of EHV-2 infected horses, however, did not differ significantly between those in the diseased (18/121) and nondiseased (61/250) groups. Too few horses were detected with alphaherpesviruses to determine any association with clinical signs of disease. Mean nasal shedding loads of herpesviruses were not significantly different between diseased and nondiseased horses. Conclusions There was a significant association between horses displaying clinical signs of mild respiratory disease and infection with EHV-5, however, no such association was evident for neither horses with EHV-2 nor the alphaherpesviruses EHV-1 and -4. The clinical significance of respiratory gammaherpesvirus infections in horses remains yet to be determined; however, these findings add to the mounting body of evidence incriminating EHV-5 in association with equine respiratory disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Despite ongoing advances in diagnostic imaging, ?wind-testing? remains the most common screening test for upper respiratory tract obstructions and is an important condition of sale at Thoroughbred public auctions in UK/Europe. Correlations between abnormal respiratory noise and resting laryngeal function have been incompletely investigated to date. Objectives To determine whether associations exist between respiratory noise at lunge and subsequent diagnosis of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Study design Retrospective analysis of records for all post sale wind-testing undertaken by a single veterinary practice at Tattersalls Newmarket yearling, breeze-up and horse-in-training sales between 2009 and 2013. Methods Descriptions of abnormal respiratory noise were categorised as ?inspiratory whistle?, ?inspiratory harsh? or ?pan-respiratory harsh?, and included lunge direction during which noise was evident. Concurrent examination by 2 veterinary surgeons was a criterion for inclusion of cases. All horses making abnormal respiratory noises underwent resting endoscopy with a consensus score (Lane scale) given for laryngeal function. Results 2972 horses underwent post sale wind-testing and 418 horses (14.1%) underwent resting endoscopic examination due to abnormal respiratory noise. Likelihood of making an abnormal respiratory noise differed significantly between groups (yearlings 10.8%, ?breeze-up? 2-year-olds 20.6%, horses-in-training 30.1%). Yearlings were significantly more likely (P<0.0001, Chi-squared/Bonferroni test) to make a ?harsh? respiratory noise than horses-in-training. Type of noise (whistle) was significantly associated with resting endoscopic evidence of RLN in yearlings (P?=?0.009); specificity of ?whistle? for RLN in this group was 38.6%. There was no association between lunge direction noise (left, right or both) and RLN. Conclusions These results support the widespread belief that harsh respiratory noise when lunged of presumed ?palatal/pharyngeal? origin is more likely in yearlings than horses-in-training, possibly due to upper respiratory inflammation or immaturity. Inspiratory whistle in both lunge directions is no stronger an indicator of RLN than unidirectional whistle.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry in the equine hindlimb are poorly defined. Little research has been carried out into the potential interactions between these variables despite the commonality of hindlimb lameness in sports and leisure horses. Objectives To determine hind foot placement and describe the relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry. Study design Observational study. Methods Overall foot placement of 43 horses was determined from simultaneous orthogonal filming at walk and trot, foot conformation was measured from digital photographs and motion symmetry data was collected using horse mounted inertial sensors. Results Left and right hind foot conformation differed significantly (P?=?0.001?0.036). Foot placement was not significantly different between left and right feet, despite these conformational differences. Foot placement was significantly different between walk and trot (P<0.001). Lateral heel landing was the most common landing pattern observed at walk (55.81%) and trot (43.12%). Lateral and lateral toe landings were more common at trot, though relatively uncommon at both gaits. Foot conformation was significantly associated with motion symmetry (P<0.001?0.007) and with placement at trot (P?=?0.002?0.005) but not walk. Conclusions Hind feet land preferentially laterally and heel first at both the walk and trot. Foot conformation appeared to be associated with landing patterns at the trot but not walk. Foot conformation was also associated with motion symmetry, although it is difficult to say whether conformation affects symmetry or vice versa. Multiple factors contribute to equine locomotion, foot conformation, landing patterns and the maintenance of orthopaedic health.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Some ponies are predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis, but the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Adipose tissue is a highly metabolically active tissue that secretes mediators which affect vascular function, insulin signalling and inflammation, all of which are potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of laminitis. Objectives To determine whether the gene expression of adipose tissue from previously laminitic ponies (LP) differs from nonlaminitic ponies (NL). Study design Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected by biopsy from the neck region of healthy LP and NL (n?=?6 each group) in the summer and winter. Methods Gene expression was determined using a 44?K equine expression microarray. Data were analysed using GeneSpring and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genes with >2-fold difference, P<0.01 were considered significant using a t test to analyse group and/or season. Results The most significant differences in global gene expression in adipose tissue were observed between summer and winter in both groups, with 244 (NL) and 174 (LP) genes differentially expressed. There was a significant difference between LP and NL groups in the summer (141 genes differentially expressed), whereas the 2 groups were more similar in the winter (40 genes differentially expressed). Eight of the top 10 upregulated genes and 3 of the top 5 canonical pathways that differed between LP and NL in the summer were associated with inflammation and/or immunity. Conclusions Laminitic ponies appear to have a different adipose tissue gene expression profile to NL, particularly in the summer. Inflammatory genes and pathways were significantly upregulated in the LP group suggesting higher levels of inflammation or priming of inflammatory pathways which may contribute to a predisposition to laminitis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Diagnosis of equine herpesvirus-1 associated myeloencephalopathy (EHM) can be troublesome, but early recognition and knowledge of risk factors are primordial for prevention and control. Objectives 1) Improvement of early clinical recognition, and 2) identification of factors potentially of importance for spread. Study design Retrospective descriptive study of EHM cases and statistical comparison to acutely neurologically affected horses negative for EHM. Methods Files from a French epidemiosurveillance programme for equine infectious neurological diseases (2008?2011) were reviewed. Cases were considered EHM (n?=?26) based on presence of acute neurological signs and laboratory confirmation. Cases were considered control cases (n?=?29) when reported to be suffering from acute neurological diseases, but negative for EHM. A subgroup of controls was created that excluded cases with peripheral neuromuscular diseases (n?=?21). Univariate and multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree analysis between groups were performed to identify diagnostic markers and risk factors. Results EHM had a fatality rate of 46% and occurred often in isolated cases. They frequently showed ataxia, paresis and cauda equina affection, but the clinical picture was variable. Univariate analysis identified the following variables as more associated to EHM than to control groups: new horse introduced in herd, vaccination, cauda equina affection, larger herd size, and saddle horses. In the multivariate analysis, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection could be retained. CART analyses identified herd size, month of occurrence, new horse introduced in herd and cauda equina affection as main predictors for EHM. Conclusions Isolated EHM cases occur frequently, accentuating the diagnostic difficulty. History and clinical examination of acutely neurologically affected horses can potentially improve early recognition of EHM. Risk factors were in accordance with other studies, although in a different geographic location and study setup, and therefore strengthen their importance for spread of EHM.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Since 2010, the OIE expert surveillance panel (ESP) recommends that EI vaccines contain representative equine influenza virus (EIV) strains from the Florida clade 1 and 2 sub-lineages for optimal protection against EIV currently circulating worldwide. To date, no EI vaccine commercially available in the EU meets this recommendation. Objectives This report summarises the development process of a fully updated recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine, including clinical efficacy results against EIV strain A/eq/Richmond/1/07. Study design The EI vaccine ProteqFlu containing 2 recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin of EIV strains was updated by replacing the A/eq/Newmarket/2/93 strain with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 isolate (Florida clade 2 sub-lineage) and keeping A/eq/Ohio/03 (Florida clade 1 sub-lineage), to meet the last OIE recommendations. The updated EI vaccine was tested for efficacy in the Welsh mountain pony model. Methods The mode of action, production steps and efficacy of the updated EI vaccine will be presented. Efficacy was tested in a group of 7 ponies vaccinated twice, 5 weeks apart. Protective antibody response were measured and challenged by experimental infection with the A/eq/Richmond/1/07 EIV strain. Clinical signs of disease and virus shedding were compared with control unvaccinated ponies (n?=?7). Results Significant protection was measured in vaccinated ponies, which supports the vaccine registration. Conclusions The recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine was already the first EI vaccine to meet the 2004 OIE ESP recommendations and was successfully used in Australia during the 2007 EI outbreak. This new version will be the first fully updated EI vaccine available in the EU, which will help to minimise the increasing risk of vaccine breakdown due to constant EIV evolution through antigenic drift. EI vaccination remains one of the most effective tools to prevent or limit the impact of EI, as clearly illustrated by the limited frequency and scale of EI outbreaks.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinicopathological and laboratory investigation of horses showing severe neurological signs during the 2010 WNV-lineage 2 human epidemic in Central Macedonia (Northern Greece). Implementation of preventive measures was also addressed. Objectives To describe the clinical signs, supportive treatment and outcome in WNV cases and report the use of an inactivated WNV vaccine used for the protection of horses during the following epidemic periods. Study design Clinical study. Methods Laboratory testing included serology, real-time RT-PCR and histopathology. All affected animals received supportive treatment (furosemide, dexamethasone, B-complex vitamins and NSAIDs). The Equip WNV vaccine was used for immunisation of horses. Results WNV-specific IgM antibodies were detected in 17 horses with neurological signs. The specificity of the detected antibodies was confirmed by seroneutralisation tests. The maximum duration of IgM was determined to be 60 days. Clinical signs included weakness of hindlimbs, ataxia and tremors (17/17), altered mental state (10/17), hypersensitivity (7/17), inability to swallow (3/17), recumbency (3/17) and convulsions (3/17). Supportive treatment was successful in 14/17 horses. The 3 recumbent horses died as a result of the infection, or were subjected to euthanasia. Histopathological findings observed in the CNS were mild perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, axonal swelling, glial nodules, microhaemorrhages and neuronal necrosis. None of the vaccinated horses showed clinical signs. Three unvaccinated horses showed clinical signs and developed WNV-specific IgM antibodies. Conclusions The Nea Santa-Greece-lineage 2 strain responsible for the massive human epidemic of 2010 was also highly pathogenic for horses. Timely administration of supportive treatment is important to the prognosis of the cases. WNV infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of horses with encephalitis in Greece. Vaccinations can effectively protect horses, especially in areas of Greece where the virus seems to have become endemic.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early pregnancy loss (EPL) between Days 15 and 65 of pregnancy occurs in 7?10% of Thoroughbred pregnancies causing substantial financial losses. Despite this, very little is known about risk factors associated with the condition. Objectives To determine the current incidence of EPL in Thoroughbred mares and to investigate risk factors associated with the condition. Study design A prospective cohort study was carried out on a population of 927 Thoroughbred mares in the Newmarket area during the 2013 breeding season. Methods Questionnaires were completed by clinicians from 2 veterinary hospitals and stud secretaries from 23 stud farms. Univariable risk factor analyses were conducted using Chi-squared and t tests. Results The incidence of pregnancy loss was 6.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3?8.6%) between Days 15?42 and 2% (95% CI 1.2?3.0%) between Days 43?65. Mares aged 11 years or over were 2.4 times more likely to suffer EPL than younger mares (95% CI 1.5?3.9): the risk of loss increased as mare age increased. Foaling, rested or barren mares had a 4.3 times increased risk of loss compared to maiden mares (95% CI 1.5?12.0). Mares receiving the preovulatory hormones deslorelin or hCG were shown to have a significantly reduced risk of EPL (P?=?0.03) compared with mares who had not received any preovulatory treatments. Pregnancies undergoing loss had a significantly smaller vesicle size (mean 1.7?cm, s.d. 0.51) at the initial (Day 14?17) pregnancy scan compared to pregnancies which were maintained throughout the study period (mean 2.0?cm, s.d. 0.49, P?=?0.01). Conclusions The incidence of EPL in 2013 was similar to that previously reported in the Newmarket area. Further multivariable risk factor analyses and investigations to discover novel causes of EPL are required to reduce the incidence of this condition.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The maxillary first premolar (wolf tooth) is present in a significant proportion (13?40%) of horses and is frequently extracted. The size of these teeth has been reported to vary but the authors are not aware of published descriptions of the dimensions of these teeth. Objectives To measure the dimensions of a sample of equine first premolar teeth and to seek correlations between dimensions of the crown and the root. Study design A retrospective descriptive study. Methods Calipers were used to measure total length, root length, crown height, and crown width of 65 first premolar teeth extracted in their entirety from 2 populations of horses (UK population: n?=?30, USA population: n?=?35). Most of the variables were not normally distributed so nonparametric statistics (Spearman correlation coefficients) were used to describe tooth size and seek correlations between different measurements. Results Dimensions expressed as median (range) were total length: 21 (12?34) mm; root length: 13.2 (0?19.6) mm; crown height 7 (2?20) mm; and crown width 7 (2.6?16) mm. Root length was longer than crown height in 61/65 teeth. Total length was poorly correlated with crown height (r?=?0.443) but had a good correlation with root length (r?=?0.799). Crown height and crown width were poorly correlated with root length (r?=?-0.093 and r?=?0.463), respectively. Conclusions The dimensions of 65 first premolar teeth indicate that the root is usually longer than the crown but that the dimensions of the clinical crown of the tooth do not provide a good estimate of the length of the root.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Synovial fluid (SF) is located in joint cavities, tendon sheaths and bursae. In joints it comprises a serum filtrate with additional contributions from articular cartilage, synovium and bone. It represents a potential source of disease specific proteins that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of joint disease and be used in the early diagnosis of disease. Objectives To comprehensively profile the protein complement of SF in health and osteoarthritis (OA) using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and identify potential OA biomarkers. Study design SF was used from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 9 normal and 9 OA Thoroughbred horses following macroscopic, microscopic and synovitis scoring. Methods Samples were analysed with LC-MS/MS using a NanoAcquity LC coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos. ProgenesisTM LC-MS software was used for label-free quantification with data searched using Mascot in the Ensembl database for horse. Adjusted ANOVA values of P<0.05 and regulation of >2-fold were regarded as significant. Results 754 proteins were identified in SF. Thus ProteominerTM beads concentrated the lower abundance proteins enabling the most comprehensive SF proteome to date. Proteins identified included those relating to matrix proteins, inflammatory factors, complement activation proteins and proteases. A subset of 10 proteins was identified which were differentially expressed in OA SF. Conclusions A number of proteins were identified for the first time in SF which may be involved in the pathogenesis of OA. We identified a distinct set of proteins that may act as potential biomarkers to distinguish between normal and OA joints. S100-A10, a calcium binding protein has upregulated in OA. This may have a role in the synthesis and activation of matrix degrading proteases. CD109 is a TGF-? co-receptor, released from the chondrocyte cell surface that inhibits TGF-? signalling. Its contribution to the disregulation of TGF-? is unknown.

It is therefore important to ensure appropriate business model auditing to identify where costs may limit expected treatment options. Objectives This study investigated how the costs of treatment for equine colic at a single university referral hospital have changed over a 10-year period between 2003 and 2013. The aim was to analyse which costs have changed excessively or disproportionately between different treating services, consumables and professional fees, which may render treatment of colic financially prohibitive. Study design Retrospective study. Methods All charges billed against cases undergoing treatment for colic between 2003 and 2013 were accessed from hospital records. Horses were identified as having surgery or purely medical management. Charges were categorised by service (medicine, surgery, anaesthesia), type (consumable, livery, professional fee), and consumable type (e.g. NSAID, opiate, antibiotic, fluid therapy, lab fee, surgery consumables). Results There was a significant association between year and the frequency of medically and surgically treated colic (Chi-square test, P<0.001). Between 2003 and 2012, median total treatment costs increased in both medically (42%) and surgically treated (46%) cases. Costs attributable to consumables increased (surgical cases 28%, medical cases 14%), while those attributable to livery (surgical -19%, medical -21%) and professional fees decreased (surgical -22%, medical -8%). The greatest increase in consumable cost was attributable to fluids (surgical 94%, medical 182%). Conclusions This study demonstrates areas where the cost of colic treatment are disproportionately changing and thus highlights potential targets where business models may be optimised in the interest of patient survival. The substantial increase in costs attributable to fluids correlates with increasing emphasis on fluid therapy in the management of colic.

AB  - Abstract Background? Oral terbinafine and oral itraconazole are two of the most common agents used for the treatment of toenail dermatophyte onychomycosis. Despite the fact that diabetic patients are more likely to have onychomycosis than normal individuals are, there is little research into the efficacy of standard oral regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole for onychomycosis in the diabetic population. Study design? We present a prospective, randomized, single-blind, parallel group, comparator-controlled, multi-centre study designed to assess the efficacy of the pulse itraconazole (200 mg twice daily, 1 week on, 3 weeks off, for 12 weeks) vs. continuous terbinafine (250 mg once daily for 12 weeks) oral therapies in the treatment of dermatophyte toenail distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) in the diabetic population. Efficacy parameters? Primary efficacy measures included mycological cure rate (negative KOH and culture) and effective cure (mycological cure plus nail plate involvement of 10% or less) at Week 48. Results? At Week 48, mycological cure was attained by 88.2% (30 of 34) and 79.3% (23 of 29) of patients in the itraconazole and terbinafine groups, respectively (P not significant). Effective cure (mycological cure with ≤ 10% of nail plate involvement) was attained by 52.9% (18 of 34) of the itraconazole group and 51.7% (15 of 29) of the terbinafine group (P not significant). Three itraconazole patients experienced side effects in the form of gastrointestinal problems. There were no serious adverse events and no interactions with concomitant medications recorded. Discussion? Both continuous terbinafine and itraconazole pulse therapy are effective and safe in the management of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis in people with diabetes.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Objectives Prior studies demonstrated that plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. In addition, plasma glucose and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, the components of plasma osmolality, have been shown to be an important contributor for in-hospital mortality in acute pulmonary embolism (APE) patients. Hence, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of plasma osmolality upon admission with in-hospital mortality in patients with APE. Methods A total of 245 consecutive intermediate or high risk APE patients were enrolled into the study. The study population was divided into three tertile groups (T1, T2 and T3) based on the increased plasma osmolality. The in-hospital mortality was the primary end-point. Results After adjusting for all risk factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the T3 group compared to T1 and T2 groups (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3 to 18.8, P < .001). In addition, the incidence of asystolia, hypotension and cardiogenic shock were significantly higher in the T3 group. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of plasma osmolality for the in-hospital mortality was 0.76 with sensitivity 67.2% and specificity 74.1% 95% CI: (0.66-0.87, P < .001). Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that elevated levels of plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in APE patients. Our findings are novel and deserve further studies whether the treatment of higher plasma osmolality may reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality in APE patients.

AB  - Objective? To identify preoperative diagnostic results that predict postoperative complications and survival in feline renal-transplant recipients. Study Design? Retrospective clinical study. Animals? Sixty-one feline renal allograft recipients. Methods? Medical records for 61 consecutive cats that underwent renal allograft transplantation between January 1, 1996, and December 1, 1999, were reviewed. Age, diagnosis, body weight, body condition score, preoperative medical treatment, systolic blood pressure, packed cell volume, biochemical parameters at admission and at the time of surgery, postoperative complications, and postoperative survival were recorded. Associations of preoperative data with the occurrence of postoperative complications were determined using logistic regression. Postoperative survival was graphed using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative-survival plot. Associations of covariates with postoperative survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results? Two parameters were significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative central nervous system (CNS) disorders: blood urea nitrogen concentration (odds ratio = 1.083; 95% CI = 1.018 to 1.148) and serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.413 to 2.187) at the time of surgery. Postoperative survival 6 months after transplantation was 59%, though 3-year survival remained at 42%. Of all covariates investigated, only recipient age (relative hazard = 1.183; 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.334) was significantly associated with survival. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance? Standard measures of preoperative renal dysfunction do not predict postoperative survival in cats after renal transplantation, although an increase in the degree of preoperative azotemia is associated with an increased risk of CNS disorders after surgery. Increased recipient age is associated with decreased survival after renal transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Degenerative disc disease is a highly prevalent, global health problem that represents the primary cause of back pain and is associated with neurological disorders, including radiculopathy, myelopathy, and paralysis, resulting in worker disability and socioeconomic burdens. The intervertebral disc is the largest avascular organ in the body, and degeneration is suspected to be linked to nutritional deficiencies. Autophagy, the process through which cells self-digest and recycle damaged components, is an important cell survival mechanism under stress conditions, especially nutrient deprivation. Autophagy is negatively controlled by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that detects nutrient availability to trigger the activation of cell growth and protein synthesis pathways. Thus, resident disc cells may utilize autophagy and mTOR signaling to cope with harsh low-nutrient conditions, such as low glucose, low oxygen, and low pH. We performed rabbit and human disc cell and tissue studies to elucidate the involvement and roles played by autophagy and mTOR signaling in the intervertebral disc. In vitro serum and nutrient deprivation studies resulted in decreased disc cell proliferation and metabolic activity and increased apoptosis and senescence, in addition to increased autophagy. The selective RNA interference-mediated and pharmacological inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was protective against inflammation-induced disc cellular apoptosis, senescence, and extracellular matrix catabolism, through the induction of autophagy and the activation of the Akt-signaling network. Although temsirolimus, a rapamycin derivative with improved water solubility, was the most effective mTORC1 inhibitor tested, dual mTOR inhibitors, capable of blocking multiple mTOR complexes, did not rescue disc cells. In vivo, high levels of mTOR-signaling molecule expression and phosphorylation were observed in human intermediately degenerated discs and decreased with age. A mechanistic understanding of autophagy and mTOR signaling can provide a basis for the development of biological therapies to treat degenerative disc disease.
