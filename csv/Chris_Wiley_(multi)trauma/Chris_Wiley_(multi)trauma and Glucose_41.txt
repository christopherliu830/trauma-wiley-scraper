AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sporadic measurement of serum triglycerides in depressed and inappetant clinically ill horses revealed severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible evidence of lipaemia on several occasions, leading to the inclusion of serum triglyceride concentrations in the routine serum biochemistry evaluation of our hospital. Since then, more cases have been identified and treated for hypertriglyceridaemia, raising questions about the prevalence, predisposing factors and significance of these findings. Hypotheses: 1) Severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible opacity of the serum occurs more commonly in clinically ill and inappetant horses than previously described and 2) appropriate treatment using i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition would decrease serum triglycerides to normal limits and might result in improved appetite and attitude of the patient. Methods: The laboratory computer database from 2000 and 2001 was searched for increased serum triglycerides (>5.65 mmol/l) in any horse breed, ponies and miniature breeds excluded. Data analysed included subject details, diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, treatment, response to treatment and outcome. Results: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in 13 horses, with serum triglyceride concentrations 6.17?18.29 mmol/l, while none showed visible lipaemia. All horses had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and all but one had an increased serum creatinine concentration. Treatment with i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition resulted in decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Conclusions: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in inappetant and clinically ill horses without evidence of serum opacity more commonly than previously described. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose horses to hypertriglyceridaemia, while the increased creatinine concentration might be a predisposing factor or result of the condition. Horses identified in our study readily responded to treatment and appetite and attitude improved coincident with decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Potential relevance: Hypertriglyceridaemia could perpetuate inappetance and depression in clinically ill horses and potentially predispose to fatty infiltration of the liver and other organ systems.

AB  - Abstract History CaridianBCT apheresis machines require a ~285 mL priming volume (extracorporeal blood) that is withdrawn from the patient in ~10 minutes. Therefore, apheresis in dogs has generally been limited to dogs > ~20 kg to assure <20% of the blood volume is removed in the priming phase. Animals/physical examination Three dogs weighing <14 kg (13.6, 10.5, and 9.9 kg) with lymphoma that underwent apheresis. Management The dogs were premedicated for placement of apheresis catheters with hydromorphone (0.1 mg kg?1) IM. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, to effect, intravenously and general anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Following catheter placement, dogs were allowed to recover from isoflurane but were kept sedated with either a dexmedetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) or a propofol CRI. Real time autologous blood priming was not performed in any of the dogs. Instead, priming solutions were composed of a combination of hetastarch, lactated Ringer's solution, and/or autologous blood that was harvested 4 days before the procedure. During apheresis, dogs received anticoagulant citrate-dextrose, solution-A (ACD-A) to prevent clotting and 10% calcium gluconate as needed to maintain normal ionized calcium concentrations. Dogs were monitored for cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary stability, anemia and lactic acidosis. Follow-up All of the dogs had cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary values within clinically acceptable ranges. Immediately following apheresis all of the dogs were mildly to moderately anemic (PCV; 17?35%) although none of the dogs required a transfusion or had an increased lactate concentration. Conclusions Dogs as small as 9.9 kg can successfully undergo apheresis with a variety of priming solutions. Dexmedetomidine or propofol given as a CRI provides sufficient sedation for this procedure.

AB  - Purpose The study was undertaken to demonstrate that there is more than 1 component in the extracellular Pi 31P signal ( ) acquired from human head using nonlocalized 31P MRS. Methods Outer-volume-suppression (OVS) saturation and 1D/2D 31P CSI were utilized to reveal the presence of an additional component in the signal. Results 67% of the head extracellular Pi signal was attenuated upon OVS saturation of the peripheral meningeal tissues, likely reflecting elimination of the Pi signal in the meningeal fluids (the blood and CSF). Localized 1D/2D CSI data provided further support for this assignment. Upon correction for the meningeal contribution, the extracellular Pi concentration was 0.51?±?0.07?mM, whereas the intracellular Pi was 0.85?±?0.10?mM. The extracellular pH was measured as 7.32?±?0.04 when using OVS, as compared to 7.39?±?0.03 when measured without OVS (N?=?7 subjects). Conclusion The extracellular Pi signal acquired from the human head using nonlocalized 31P MRS contains a significant component likely contributed by peripheral blood and CSF in meninges that must be removed in order to use this signal as an endogenous probe for measuring extracellular pH and other properties in the brain.

AB  - Abstract Background The role of structured exercise in improving cardiometabolic profile and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (2DM) has been widely demonstrated. Little is known about the effects of an aquatic-based exercise program in patients with 2DM. Objective To evaluate the effects of a supervised aquatic-based exercise program on cardiometabolic profile, quality of life, and physical activity levels in patients with 2DM. Design and Setting Observational study, community pre-post aquatic-based exercise program, primary care intervention. Patients Eighteen men diagnosed with 2DM (52.2 ± 9.3 years). Methods and Main Outcome Measurements: Cardiometabolic profile, quality of life, and physical activity levels were assessed before and after 12 weeks of an aquatic-based exercise program. Results The results show a significant improvement of cardiometabolic assessments (maximum oxygen consumption: 24.1 versus 21.1 mL/kg/min, P < .05; blood pressure: 125.4/77 versus 130.7/82.5 mm Hg, P < .05; fasting blood glucose: 119.6 versus 132.5 mg/dL, P < .05; body mass index: 29.9 versus 31.1 kg/m², P < .005; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 95.2 versus 104.9 mg/dL, P < .05; and diastolic function: E/E? 9.1 versus 10.1, P < .005) and an increase in quality of life and physical activity levels (Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary: 72.3 versus 67, P < .05; Problems Area About Diabetes: 20.1 versus 33.2, P < .005) and energy expenditure in general physical activity (physical activity: 3888.7 versus 1239.5 kcal/wk, P < .05). Conclusions These findings demonstrate that an aquatic-based exercise program produces benefits for the cardiovascular system and metabolic profile and appears to be safe and effective in improving quality of life and increasing physical activity levels in patients with 2DM.

AB  - Background Application of evidence-based perioperative care protocols reduces complication rates, accelerates recovery and shortens hospital stay. Presently, there are no comprehensive guidelines for perioperative care for gastrectomy. Methods An international working group within the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS?) Society assembled an evidence-based comprehensive framework for optimal perioperative care for patients undergoing gastrectomy. Data were retrieved from standard databases and personal archives. Evidence and recommendations were classified according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system and were discussed until consensus was reached within the group. The quality of evidence was rated ?high?, ?moderate?, ?low? or ?very low?. Recommendations were graded as ?strong? or ?weak?. Results The available evidence has been summarized and recommendations are given for 25 items, eight of which contain procedure-specific evidence. The quality of evidence varies substantially and further research is needed for many issues to improve the strength of evidence and grade of recommendations. Conclusion The present evidence-based framework provides comprehensive advice on optimal perioperative care for the patient undergoing gastrectomy and facilitates multi-institutional prospective cohort registries and adequately powered randomized trials for further research.

AB  - Abstract Management of early paracetamol poisoning is dependent on prompt administration of N-acetylcysteine to patients whose plasma concentrations of paracetamol exceed the normal-risk or high-risk treatment lines. Paracetamol poisoning presenting after 15 h since ingestion, especially as fulminant hepatic failure, requires meticulous supportive care of organ dysfunction. The putative mechanisms of action of N-acetylcysteine and its practical use are discussed. The best prognostic marker for paracetamol poisoning in ?established hepatotoxicity? is the prothrombin time. Indications for liver transplantation in paracetamol poisoning and exclusion criteria are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background:? When gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diagnosed in a population with a high prevalence of unrecognised type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM), the rate of neonatal morbidity is not clear. There is also a paucity of data reporting neonatal outcome in women with recognised type 2 DM. Aim:? To describe, in a population with a high background prevalence of type 2 DM, neonatal morbidity in infants of women with GDM and type 2 DM admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods:? A 2-year audit was carried out in a tertiary level obstetric hospital with a multi-ethnic delivery population. All infants admitted to the NICU whose mothers had GDM or type 2 DM were identified from the hospital database. The records of 136 infants were retrospectively reviewed and data collected on outcome measures including maternal diagnosis, macrosomia, mode of delivery, delivery complications, hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress and congenital anomalies. Results:? Admission to NICU occurred in 29% of GDM and 40% of type 2 DM pregnancies. Median gestation was 37 weeks (range: 25?41), with 46% delivered preterm. Forty percent of infants were delivered by emergency Caesarean section. Fifty-one percent of admissions had hypoglycaemia and 40% required support for respiratory distress. Women with type 2 DM diagnosed either prepregnancy or post-partum were the highest risk group for neonatal morbidity, including congenital anomalies. Conclusions:? Neonatal morbidity is common in infants of women with type 2 DM and GDM in a population with high prevalence of type 2 DM.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.)

(Charcoal Hemoperfusion) Blood ? evidence of massive hemolysis intra-vascular hemolysis, shown in table (no evidence of HUS/TTP). She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction remains a significant complication after cardiopulmonary bypass, despite continuous improvement in the overall outcome in open-heart surgery. Embolization of the atheromatous material, most notably during removal of the aortic clamp, is a major cause. Strategies have been developed to minimize cerebral embolization. Modified surgical techniques include the use of hypothermic circulatory arrest, venting of the left ventricle, minimizing aortic manipulation, and the use of epiaortic ultrasound to locate and avoid trauma to the aortic atheromatous plaque. Use of an intra-aortic filter has been shown recently to reduce intraoperative cerebral embolic events and improve postoperative neurocognitive outcomes. Off-pump coronary artery bypass technique has also been claimed to have lower neurological complications, which is probably attributable to the avoidance of aortic cannulation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Its role on cerebral protection is, however, debatable. Chinese Abstract Chinese Abstract

AB  - The role of chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular complications and in neuropathy has been clearly established by intervention studies. However, the biochemical or cellular links between elevated blood glucose levels, and the vascular lesions remain incompletely understood. This review focuses on the consequences of hyperglycemia on the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and on the role of AGEs and of their specific receptors (RAGE) in the functional and anatomical alterations of the vascular wall. AGEs are formed during the Mailiard reaction by the binding of aldoses on free NH2 groups of proteins, which, after a cascade of molecular rearrangements, result in molecules of brown color and specific fluorescence. Experimental studies have indicated that the binding of AGEs to RAGE activates cells, particularly monocytes and endothelial calls. Activated endothelial cells produce cytokines, and express adhesion molecules and tissue factor. The role of AGEs in increased oxidative stress, and in the functional alterations in vascular tone control observed in diabetes, in part related to a reduction in nitric oxide, is also discussed. The microvascular retinal, glomerular and nerve lesions induced by experimental diabetes in animals are prevented by an inhibitor of AGEs formation, aminoguanidine. The administration in diabetic animals of recombinant RAGE, which hinders AGEs-RAGE interaction, prevents hyperpermeability and vascular lesions. These data suggest a central role of AGEs and RAGE in the development of chronic complications of diabetes.

AB  - Abstract The brain swells over the several minutes that follow stroke onset or acute hypo-osmotic stress because cells take up water. Measuring the volume responses of single neurons and glia has necessarily been confined to isolated or cultured cells. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy enables real-time visualization of cells functioning deep within living neocortex in vivo or in brain slices under physiologically relevant osmotic and ischemic stress. Astrocytes and their processes expressing green fluorescent protein in murine cortical slices swelled in response to 20 min of overhydration (?40 mOsm) and shrank during dehydration (+40 or +80 mOsm) at 32?34°C. Minute-by-minute monitoring revealed no detectable volume regulation during these osmotic challenges, particularly during the first 5 min. Astrocytes also rapidly swelled in response to elevated [K+]o for 3 min or oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) for 10 min. Post-OGD, astroglial volume recovered quickly when slices were re-supplied with oxygen and glucose, while neurons remained swollen with beaded dendrites. In vivo, rapid astroglial swelling was confirmed within 6 min following intraperitoneal water injection or during the 6?12 min following cardiac arrest. While the astrocytic processes were clearly swollen, the extent of the astroglial arbor remained unchanged. Thus, in contrast to osmo-resistant pyramidal neurons (Andrew et al., 2007) that lack known aquaporins, astrocytes passively respond to acute osmotic stress, reflecting functional aquaporins in their plasma membrane. Unlike neurons, astrocytes better recover from brief ischemic insult in cortical slices, probably because their aquaporins facilitate water efflux. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract In 2015, it can be said that the diabetic foot is no longer the Cinderella of diabetic complications. Thirty years ago there was little evidence-based research taking place on the diabetic foot, and there were no international meetings addressing this topic. Since then, the biennial Malvern Diabetic Foot meetings started in 1986, the American Diabetes Association founded their Foot Council in 1987, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes established a Foot Study Group in 1998. The first International Symposium on the Diabetic Foot in The Netherlands was convened in 1991, and this was soon followed by the establishment of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot that has produced useful guidelines in several areas of investigation and the management of diabetic foot problems. There has been an exponential rise in publications on diabetic foot problems in high impact factor journals, and a comprehensive evidence-base now exists for many areas of treatment. Despite the extensive evidence available, it, unfortunately, remains difficult to demonstrate that most types of education are efficient in reducing the incidence of foot ulcers. However, there is evidence that education as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to diabetic foot ulceration plays a pivotal role in incidence reduction. With respect to treatment, strong evidence exists that offloading is the best modality for healing plantar neuropathic foot ulcers, and there is also evidence from two randomized controlled trials to support the use of negative-pressure wound therapy in complex post-surgical diabetic foot wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy exhibits the same evidence level and strength of recommendation. International guidelines exist on the management of infection in the diabetic foot. Many randomized trials have been performed, and these have shown that the agents studied generally produced comparable results, with the exception of one study in which tigecycline was shown to be clinically inferior to ertapenem?±?vancomycin. Similarly, there are numerous types of wound dressings that might be used in treatment and which have shown efficacy, but no single type (or brand) has shown superiority over others. Peripheral artery disease is another major contributory factor in the development of ulceration, and its presence is a strong predictor of non-healing and amputation. Despite the proliferation of endovascular procedures in addition to open revascularization, many patients continue to suffer from severely impaired perfusion and exhaust all treatment options. Finally, the question of the true aetiopathogenesis of Charcot neuroarthropathy remains enigmatic, although much work is currently being undertaken in this area. In this area, it is most important to remember that a clinically uninfected, warm, insensate foot in a diabetic patient should be considered as a Charcot foot until proven otherwise, and, as such, treated with offloading, preferably in a cast.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is not rare, which would affect the patient?s prognosis. Objectives To examine the prevalence, risk factors and clinical characteristics of AECOPD patients with VTE. Methods We performed this multi-center, prospective, observational study that involved 16 hospitals in China. Patients admitted to hospital due to AECOPD were consecutively enrolled. Baseline characteristics, VTE risk factors, symptoms, signs and auxiliary examination results were collected. Lower limb venous ultrasound and computed tomography pulmonary angiography were examined. Results Between June 2009 and October 2010, a total of 1144 AECOPD patients (the average age 72.0 ± 9.1 years, 761 males) were enrolled in this study. Seventy-eight (6.8%) were diagnosed with VTE, including 24 PE, 64 DVT, 10 combined PE and DVT. VTE patients were older than non-VTE patients. History of venous thromboembolism and lower extremity varicose vein, and presence of longer immobility (≥3 days), lower limbs problems of swelling, pain and walking difficulties, diuretics use, fever, syncope, higher d-dimer and lower hemoglobin were more common in VTE patients than in non-VTE patients. After adjusting the covariates, venous thrombosis history, prolonged immobility (≥3 days), lower limb pain before hospitalization, higher d-dimer independently associated with VTE development. Regular glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risk of VTE in this set of patients. Conclusion VTE is relatively common among hospitalized AECOPD patients. Conventional prophylactic anticoagulant therapy may be considered for those hospitalized AECOPD patients with risk factors.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate an infusion of propofol for anesthesia in comparison to tiletamine-zolazepam anesthesia, evaluating physiological variables and recovery in squirrel monkeys. Study design Prospective non-blinded randomized study. Animals Eight healthy squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), aged 3 years and weighing 0.340?0.695 kg. Methods Premedication was intramuscular midazolam (0.5 mg) and meperidine (4 mg). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous (IV) propofol (4 mg kg?1 minute?1) and maintained with propofol starting at 0.4 mg kg?1 minute?1 (PRO, n = 4) or IV tiletamine-zolazepam (5 mg kg?1) and maintained with supplementary doses of TZ (TZ, n = 4). Cardiopulmonary variables were measured continuously. Arterial blood gases and lactate concentration were measured at the end of anesthesia. Quality and times of recovery were determined. Repeatedly measured data for significant differences were tested between groups with t-test and within groups by anova. Results Median time for induction of anesthesia in PRO was 180 seconds. Mean maintenance infusion rate of propofol was 0.43 ± 0.05 mg kg?1 minute?1, varying during the 1 hour period. One monkey died after administration of TZ; others required 1, 4, or 8 supplemental doses. Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between groups, but hypotension was recorded. Recovery times to ventral recumbency in PRO (32 ± 17 minutes) and TZ (84 ± 11 minutes) and normal ambulation in PRO (58 ± 22 minutes) and TZ (358 ± 109minutes) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Recovery quality was superior in PRO, with less ataxia and fewer unsuccessful attempts to stand. Lactate concentration was not different between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between protocols, aside from the higher incidence of hypotension in PRO, indicating that further studies with a larger number of animals are required. Compared to tiletamine-zolazepam, propofol anesthesia provided faster and superior anesthetic recovery in these animals.
