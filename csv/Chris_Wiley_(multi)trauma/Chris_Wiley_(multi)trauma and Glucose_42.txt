AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate an infusion of propofol for anesthesia in comparison to tiletamine-zolazepam anesthesia, evaluating physiological variables and recovery in squirrel monkeys. Study design Prospective non-blinded randomized study. Animals Eight healthy squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), aged 3 years and weighing 0.340?0.695 kg. Methods Premedication was intramuscular midazolam (0.5 mg) and meperidine (4 mg). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous (IV) propofol (4 mg kg?1 minute?1) and maintained with propofol starting at 0.4 mg kg?1 minute?1 (PRO, n = 4) or IV tiletamine-zolazepam (5 mg kg?1) and maintained with supplementary doses of TZ (TZ, n = 4). Cardiopulmonary variables were measured continuously. Arterial blood gases and lactate concentration were measured at the end of anesthesia. Quality and times of recovery were determined. Repeatedly measured data for significant differences were tested between groups with t-test and within groups by anova. Results Median time for induction of anesthesia in PRO was 180 seconds. Mean maintenance infusion rate of propofol was 0.43 ± 0.05 mg kg?1 minute?1, varying during the 1 hour period. One monkey died after administration of TZ; others required 1, 4, or 8 supplemental doses. Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between groups, but hypotension was recorded. Recovery times to ventral recumbency in PRO (32 ± 17 minutes) and TZ (84 ± 11 minutes) and normal ambulation in PRO (58 ± 22 minutes) and TZ (358 ± 109minutes) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Recovery quality was superior in PRO, with less ataxia and fewer unsuccessful attempts to stand. Lactate concentration was not different between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between protocols, aside from the higher incidence of hypotension in PRO, indicating that further studies with a larger number of animals are required. Compared to tiletamine-zolazepam, propofol anesthesia provided faster and superior anesthetic recovery in these animals.

AB  - Purpose:?? We have recently shown mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from haemangioma stained strongly for OPG. Vimentin immunoreactivity (IR) is an established marker for immature cells of mesenchymal origin. This study characterises haemangioma biopsies at different phases of progression to identify the presence of progenitor cells. Methods:?? Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on formalin-fixed paraffin sections of haemangioma at different phases of progression for vimentin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), von Willebrand factor and glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1). Results:?? Positive staining for OPG and vimentin was observed on progenitor cells in the proliferating and early involuting phases of haemangioma. Strong Glut-1 staining of mature capillaries of the involuted phase was inversely related to the degree of OPG and vimentin IR. Positive vimentin staining of cells in the interstitium of involuted heamangioma and weak vimentin IR of blood vessels was found suggesting that these vimentin-positive cells may be MSCs that eventually differentiate into adipocytes that characterise involuted lesions. OPG IR diminished as haemangioma involuted, with little staining seen in involuted lesions. Conclusions:?? OPG and vimentin IR are early progenitor cell markers that stain immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma. In involuted haemangioma OPG IR is scant whereas vimentin-positive cells are present in the interstitium. This finding supports our hypothesis that OPG IR is a marker for progenitor cells present in immature capillaries of proliferating haemangioma that is lost as the lesions involute.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Increasing human and laboratory evidence suggests thatpost-resuscitative brain hypothermia reduces the pathologic consequences of brain ischemia. Using a swine model of prolonged cardiac arrest, this investigation sought to determine whether unilateral hypothermic carotid bypass was capable of inducing selective brain hypothermia and reducing neurohistologic damage. Methods: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in common swine (n? 12). After 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary arrest (without ventilatory support or cardiopulmonary resuscitation), systemic extracorporeal bypass was instituted to restore coronary and cerebral perfusion, followed by restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Animals randomized to the normal brain temperature (NBT) cohort received mechanical ventilation and intravenous fluids for 24 hours. The selective brain hypothermia (SBH) cohort received 12 hours of femoral/carotid bypass at 32°C. The bypass temperature was then increased one degree per hour until reaching 37°C and continued at this temperature until completion of the protocol (24 hours). Histopathologic damage was evaluated in two areas of the hippocampus. Results: Normal sinus rhythm was restored in all animals after the systemic (femoral/femoral) bypass was initiated. Nasal temperature (surrogate measure of brain temperature) remained higher than 37.0°C throughout the 24-hour recovery period in the NBT animals. In the SBH cohort, right nasal temperature dropped to the mild hypothermic range (<34°C) two hours after institution of femoral/carotid bypass. This was maintained throughout the 12-hour cooling period without hemodynamic compromise. There was a significant improvement in the neurohistology scores in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the SBH treated animals as compared with those of the NBT cohort. Conclusions: Post-resuscitative selective brain hypothermia reduced regional ischemic brain damage in swine with prolonged ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - Key points Thermal and hypoxic stress commonly coexist in environmental, occupational and clinical settings, yet how the brain tolerates these multi-stressor environments is unknown Core cooling by 1.0°C reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) by 20?30% and cerebral oxygen delivery (CDO2) by 12?19% at sea level and high altitude, whereas core heating by 1.5°C did not reliably reduce CBF or CDO2 Oxygen content in arterial blood was fully restored with acclimatisation to 4330 m, but concurrent cold stress reduced CBF and CDO2 Gross indices of cognition were not impaired by any combination of thermal and hypoxic stress despite large reductions in CDO2 Chronic hypoxia renders the brain susceptible to large reductions in oxygen delivery with concurrent cold stress, which might make monitoring core temperature more important in this context Abstract Real-world settings are composed of multiple environmental stressors, yet the majority of research in environmental physiology investigates these stressors in isolation. The brain is central in both behavioural and physiological responses to threatening stimuli and, given its tight metabolic and haemodynamic requirements, is particularly susceptible to environmental stress. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF, duplex ultrasound), cerebral oxygen delivery (CDO2), oesophageal temperature, and arterial blood gases during exposure to three commonly experienced environmental stressors ? heat, cold and hypoxia ? in isolation, and in combination. Twelve healthy male subjects (27 ± 11 years) underwent core cooling by 1.0°C and core heating by 1.5°C in randomised order at sea level; acute hypoxia ( = 50 mm Hg) was imposed at baseline and at each thermal extreme. Core cooling and heating protocols were repeated after 16 ± 4 days residing at 4330 m to investigate any interactions with high altitude acclimatisation. Cold stress decreased CBF by 20?30% and CDO2 by 12?19% (both P < 0.01) irrespective of altitude, whereas heating did not reliably change either CBF or CDO2 (both P > 0.08). The increases in CBF with acute hypoxia during thermal stress were appropriate to maintain CDO2 at normothermic, normoxic values. Reaction time was faster and slower by 6?9% with heating and cooling, respectively (both P < 0.01), but central (brain) processes were not impaired by any combination of environmental stressors. These findings highlight the powerful influence of core cooling in reducing CDO2. Despite these large reductions in CDO2 with cold stress, gross indices of cognition remained stable.

AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The metabolic syndrome (MS), a cluster of central obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, conveys an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome traits (MST) in long-term survivors of pediatric sarcoma (SARC) who received multi-modality therapy (MMT). Methods Thirty-two SARC survivors (predominantly Ewings; median age 36.5; median age at MMT 15) underwent body composition, activity, and psychosocial analysis. Serum endocrine and inflammatory parameters and urine beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated. The prevalence of MST was compared to age- and gender-matched U.S. population data. Results SARC survivors were more likely to have two or more MST (OR 2.38 95% CI: [1.14, 5.04]). Analysis of individual MST demonstrated higher prevalence of hypertension (OR 2.61 95% CI: [1.20, 5.59]), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 3.63 95% CI: [1.75, 7.60]), and male visceral abdominal obesity (20?39 years old OR 4.63 95% CI: [0.91, 21.63], 40?59 years old OR infinity). Survivors 18?39 years old had a higher prevalence of the MS (OR 4.29 95% CI: [1.50, 11.21]), defined as three or more MST. Plasminogen activator inhibitory activity (P?=?0.016) and B2M (P?=?0.027) increased with increasing numbers of MST. In males, total testosterone declined (P?=?0.0027) as the number of MST increased. Average (P?=?0.014) and maximum (P?=?0.021) activity levels decreased as the number of MST increased. Conclusion After a median follow up of 17 years, adult SARC survivors of MMT had an increased prevalence of MST, especially those less than 40 years old. The development of MST in this population was associated with decreased testosterone and activity levels. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2008;50:341?346. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background The present interdisciplinary consensus review proposes clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthetic practice in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. Methods Studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined and reviewed. The group reached a consensus recommendation after critical appraisal of the literature. Results This consensus statement demonstrates that anaesthesiologists control several preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative ERAS elements. Further research is needed to verify the strength of these recommendations. Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each element of perioperative care pathways, the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ?) Society presents a comprehensive consensus review, clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthesia care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery within an ERAS programme. This unified protocol facilitates involvement of anaesthesiologists in the implementation of the ERAS programmes and allows for comparison between centres and it eventually might facilitate the design of multi-institutional prospective and adequately powered randomized trials.

AB  - Abstract Background Adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) face significant barriers to screening participation. We determined predictors for regular cardiovascular health screening at baseline among adults with ID in Singapore, and evaluated the effectiveness of a 3-month screening intervention. Methods The study population involved all adults with ID aged ≥40 years receiving services from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS), the largest such provider in Singapore. Over 3 months in 2011, adult clients not screened regularly at baseline for hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia were offered free and convenient blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipid testing; data on other cardiovascular disease risk factors were also collected. Chi-square and logistic regression identified predictors of regular screening at baseline. Results Participation was 95.0% (227/239). At baseline, among adults with ID, 61.8% (118/191), 24.8% (52/210) and 18.2% (34/187) had gone for regular hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia screening respectively; post intervention, rates rose to 96.9%, 89.5% and 88.8% respectively. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors (22.5% with hypertension, 10.6% with diabetes, 34.8% with dyslipidaemia, 10.7% obese and 90.6% lacking regular exercise) was high compared against the general population. While receiving residential services was associated with regular hypertension screening, receiving non-residential services and being independently mobile were associated with regular participation in fasting blood tests (all P?<?0.05). Conclusion Cardiovascular disease risk factors are common among adults with ID and clinicians should proactively screen such populations. Provision of free and convenient screening for cardiovascular disease risk improved screening participation.

AB  - Summary This chapter emphasises the vital role the nurse plays in the prevention of progression to acute kidney injury (AKI) and of the delivery of care for the patient in AKI. In this central role the nurse can maintain close links with the patient's family, which can be instrumental to a family-centred approach to the patient's treatment. AKI may be divided into three major categories, in which each category has a physiological location of the insult: prerenal, renal, and postrenal. An acute impairment may also present in the patient with existing chronic kidney disease, which may lead to further structural damage; this presentation is often referred to as acute-on-chronic renal failure and evidence would indicate that this is an increasing group. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends performing urine dipstick testing for blood, protein, leucocytes, nitrites, and glucose in any patient in whom AKI is suspected as soon as possible.

AB  - Background and purpose Critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIP/CIM) is being increasingly recognized as a significant clinical problem in critically ill children especially if they have spent long periods in the intensive care unit. So the aim was to determine the frequency of CIP/CIM amongst mechanically ventilated children and to analyse the associated risk factors and drawbacks frequently encountered in this cohort. Methods The study included 105 patients admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit who underwent mechanical ventilation for ≥7 days. These patients were screened daily for awakening. Patients with severe muscle weakness on day 7 post-awakening underwent nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Accordingly, the patients were classified as CIP/CIM patients if they had abnormal neurophysiology studies or control patients if normal neurophysiology studies were obtained. Their clinical and laboratory profiles had been recorded as well. Results Overall, of 105 patients who achieved satisfactory awakening, 34 patients (32.4%) developed CIP/CIM mostly of the axonal polyneuropathy pattern (27.6%) whilst 71 control patients (67.6%) showed normal electrophysiological studies. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in patients with CIP/CIM compared to control patients (P = 0.001). The study also revealed that 62.1% of our CIP/CIM patients failed weaning trials and finally died. CIP/CIM was significantly associated with decreased platelets, elevated liver enzymes and prolonged prothrombin time. Acidosis, low serum calcium and albumin levels and higher blood glucose were also found to be more significant in CIP/CIM patients compared to control patients. Conclusion Critically ill children frequently develop CIP/CIM, mostly of axonal polyneuropathy pattern, which compromises rehabilitation and recovery and is associated with a number of comorbidities.

AB  - Abstract Chronic abuse of cocaine or alcohol is associated with structural, neuropathological and cognitive impairments that have been documented extensively. Little is known, however, about neurobiochemical changes in chronic substance abusers.We performed MRI and multi-slice brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to assess neuronal viability (via N-acetylaspartate (NAA)) and white matter metabolite status in 22 4-months-abstinent individuals dependent on crack cocaine only and on both crack cocaine and alcohol. Compared to 11 non-dependent controls we found (1) significantly lower NAA measures in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the combined cocaine-dependent groups; (2) comparable spatial distribution and magnitude of these NAA effects for both cocaine-dependent groups; (3) higher choline-containing metabolites in frontal white matter of individuals dependent on both cocaine and alcohol; (4) absence of brain atrophy in both abstinent cocaine-dependent samples; and (5) partial recovery from prefrontal cortical NAA loss, primarily with abstinence from alcohol. The MRSI findings suggest preferential neuronal damage to the frontal cortex of both cocaine-dependent samples and gliosis in frontal white matter of individuals dependent on both alcohol and cocaine, conditions that persist for more than 4 months of abstinence.

AB  - Abstract This chapter focuses on anemias resulting from bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes and on anemias caused by heritable defects in the glycolytic pathway and in the pentose phosphate pathways. The two broad categories of BMF syndromes are those that are acquired and those that are inherited. Advances in different areas of biology have already had impacts on the diagnosis and treatment of BMF and hemolytic anemias. Increasing knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms of how gene transcription is regulated and relevant mechanistic studies focused on genes associated with heritable BMF and hemolytic anemias promise to lead to new therapies. The chapter deals with those enzymopathies affecting red cell metabolism for which the molecular basis has been elucidated. It provides a brief overview of enzymopathies and provides information on deficiencies of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase - representative of disorders of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and nucleotide metabolism, respectively.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disease which represents the most common form of dementia. Cognition impairment and memory loss are mostly caused by reduced levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, current drug therapies are based on the cholinergic hypothesis. However, ?-amyloid hypothesis is getting more important in last years. For many years, one of the basic drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was tacrine, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Unfortunately, it was withdrawn from the market due to its side effects. To diminish side effects, research has focused on obtaining multi-target-directed ligands, which target numerous disease pathways simultaneously, including those of Alzheimer's disease. The comprehensive review is focused on the outcomes of the studies of phyto-tacrine hybrids. Hybrids can inhibit cholinesterase and ?-amyloid aggregation. Additionally, phyto-hybrids have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective and metal chelating properties. Further research is necessary for the development of hybrids to find a proper therapy for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Abstract Recent findings indicate that vascular risk factors and neurovascular dysfunction play integral roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to aging, the most common risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are apolipoprotein e4 allele, hypertension, hypotension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. All of these can be characterized by vascular pathology attributed to conditions such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and subsequent blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Many epidemiological, clinical, and pharmacotherapeutic studies have assessed the associations between such risk factors and Alzheimer's disease and have found positive associations between hypertension, hypotension, and diabetes mellitus. However, there are still many conflicting results from these population-based studies, and they should be interpreted carefully. Recognition of these factors and the mechanisms by which they contribute to Alzheimer's disease will be beneficial in the current treatment regimens for Alzheimer's disease and in the development of future therapies. Here we discuss vascular factors with respect to Alzheimer's disease and dementia and review the factors that give rise to vascular dysfunction and contribute to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - This is the second annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 200 new references. Since the literature pertinent to geriatrics is growing ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Almost all of the references date from the past four years. Preference is given to recent publications, since they provide a list of the important earlier articles. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional review article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, studies of which, it will be noted, are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. A few articles concern diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study specifically from a geriatric viewpoint exists; e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, and the fourth (IV) with non-physician services available to the elderly, including ethical quandaries. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Aims:?? The mainstay treatment for problematic proliferating haemangioma is pharmacologic with high dose steroid being the first line treatment. A dramatic response occurs in 30% of cases, equivocal in 40% and continued growth is observed in the remainder cases. Steroid therapy is associated with significant side effects. We report our experience in treating proliferating haemangioma with Propranolol, discovered serendipitously by Léauté-Labràze et al recently. Methodology:?? A 9-week old boy was referred with a steroid-resistant proliferating haemangioma involving the upper lip and nose causing feeding and breathing difficulties. The patient was commenced on Propranolol at 0.5?mg/kg twice daily for 24?hours increasing to 1?mg/kg twice daily. The treatment was administered as an inpatient with 4-hourly heart rate and blood pressure and postprandial (30?minutes) blood glucose level monitoring, for the first 48?hours. The second patient was a 3-month old boy with a similar rapidly proliferating lesion on the upper lip and nose. He was commenced on similar Propranolol regimen. Both patients were maintained on the original total daily dose of Propranolol. Results:?? In both cases rapid reduction of the size and softening of the lesion was noted within 48?hours of treatment with on going accelerated regression observed during the follow-up period of 4 and 2?months respectively. No cardiovascular or metabolic side effects were observed in both patients. Conclusion:?? Accelerated regression is observed in 2 infants with problematic haemangioma following Propranolol therapy with no observed side effect. The possible mechanism of action of beta-blocker on cell proliferation is discussed.
