AB  - Abstract Pain and speed of convalescence are the two main problems after uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We therefore identified interventional and descriptive studies in electronic databases and supplemented them with manual searches. Pain and interventional analgesic studies were analysed with reference to the effects on specific pain components after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Convalescence and factors associated with early recovery were also analysed. Pain after cholecystectomy is most intense for the first 2?3 days with a high interindividual variability and dominated by incisional pain rather than other pain components. Early pain after cholecystectomy is reduced by minimising residual pneumoperitoneum and by giving incisional local anaesthetics, epidural analgesia, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There are inconclusive data about type and pressure of pneumoperitoneum, the use of intraperitoneal local anaesthetics, and the type of general anaesthesia. Pain and medico-cultural traditions are the main factors responsible for prolonged convalescence after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To minimise pain and the duration of convalescence, we recommend multi-modal analgesic treatment in combination with short, standardised instructions to resume work and normal activity.

AB  - Abstract Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a common endocrine disease affecting the elderly in particular. Long-term complications involve the vasculature; vision, renal, and neural function; and the periodontium. Knowledge about the oral health of the elderly and the effects of NIDDM is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the oral health of patients aged 60+ years, who have NIDDM, with patients who do not have NIDDM. To evaluate oral health, we recorded retention and condition of the teeth, periodontal health, and condition of the oral mucosa. We also assessed oral hygiene, smoking history, regularity of dental checkups, and medication use. The study group was selected from among patients who came to the ambulatory care clinic at University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey, Center for Aging with a diagnosis of NIDDM. The control group, which did not have NIDDM, was selected from among the same patient group and was matched for age and gender. Patients with severe dementia, those having fewer than 10 teeth or those who were in need of antibiotic prophylaxis were excluded from the study. Patients underwent a short interview and a clinical evaluation. Our study involved 32 elderly adults with NIDDM and 40 elderly adults who did not have NIDDM. Both groups had similar oral hygiene levels and regularity of professional dental care. In addition, the plasma glucose levels among the study group were well controlled. This study did not show statistically significant differences in oral health parameters between participants with diabetes and those in a control group.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.

AB  - Summary Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid covalently bound in esterified form in the cell membranes of most body cells. Following irritation or injury, arachidonic acid is released and oxygenated by enzyme systems leading to the formation of an important group of inflammatory mediators, the eicosanoids. It is now recognised that eicosanoid release is fundamental to the inflammatory process. For example, the prostaglandins and other prostanoids, products of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme pathway, have potent inflammatory properties and prostaglandin E2 is readily detectable in equine acute inflammatory exudates. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and this explains the mode of action of agents such as phenylbutazone and flunixin. Lipoxygenase enzymes metabolise arachidonic acid to a group of non-cyclised eicosanoids, the leukotrienes, some of which are also important inflammatory mediators. They are probably of particular importance in leucocyte-mediated aspects of chronic inflammation. Currently available non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, however, do not inhibit lipoxygenase activity. In the light of recent evidence, the inflammatory process is re-examined and the important emerging roles of both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase derived eicosanoids are explored. The mode of action of current and future antiinflammatory drugs offered to the equine clinician can be explained by their interference with arachidonic acid metabolism.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine whether the Diabetes Inpatient Care and Education (DICE) programme, a whole-systems approach to managing inpatient diabetes, reduces length of stay, in-hospital mortality and readmissions. Research design and methods Diabetes Inpatient Care and Education initiatives included identification of all diabetes admissions, a novel DICE care-pathway, an online system for prioritizing referrals, use of web-linked glucose meters, an enhanced diabetes team, and novel diabetes training for doctors. Patient administration system data were extracted for people admitted to Ipswich Hospital from January 2008 to June 2016. Logistic regression was used to compare binary outcomes (mortality, 30-day readmissions) 6 months before and after the intervention; generalized estimating equations were used to compare lengths of stay. Interrupted time series analysis was performed over the full 7.5-year period to account for secular trends. Results Before-and-after analysis revealed a significant reduction in lengths of stay for people with and without diabetes: relative ratios 0.89 (95% CI 0.83, 0.97) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.90, 0.96), respectively; however, in interrupted time series analysis the change in long-term trend for length of stay following the intervention was significant only for people with diabetes (P=0.017 vs P=0.48). Odds ratios for mortality were 0.63 (0.48, 0.82) and 0.81 (0.70, 0.93) in people with and without diabetes, respectively; however, the change in trend was not significant in people with diabetes, while there was an apparent increase in those without diabetes. There was no significant change in 30-day readmissions, but interrupted time series analysis showed a rising trend in both groups. Conclusion The DICE programme was associated with a shorter length of stay in inpatients with diabetes beyond that observed in people without diabetes.

AB  - Summary It has become increasingly obvious that factors such as communication, teamwork, and leadership have significant roles in patient safety. In healthcare, when communication breaks down patient safety is jeopardized, a reality that has been documented in a number of clinical settings, including general medicine, emergency departments, and surgery. Teamwork is the array of interconnected behaviors, cognitive processes, and attitudes that make coordinated and adaptive performance possible in complex environments such as clinical settings. This chapter provides some examples of breakdowns in communication within the context of veterinary anesthesia. Every method of communication is prone to error. Oral communications are often only partially recalled by the receiver. Written communications are time consuming so are often only partially completed. Electronic communications are often too brief. Forms should be backed up with verbal communications and vice versa. Standardizing communication and communication training should be encouraged.

AB  - A continuous increase in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases is to be expected in the aging societies worldwide. Autoimmune disorders not only cause severe disability and chronic pain, but also lead to considerable socio-economic costs. Given that the current treatment options are not curative, have substantial side effects and a high percentage of non-responders, innovative options to the existing therapeutic armament against autoimmune diseases are urgently required. Accumulating evidence suggests that changes in the metabolism of immune cells are associated with, and contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Additionally, some autoimmune diseases share alterations in metabolic pathways, key metabolites or metabolic byproducts such as reactive oxygen species. Other examples for metabolic changes in autoimmune settings include modifications in amino acid and cholesterol levels or glucose catabolism. Thus, the emerging field of immunometabolism may hold the potential to discover new therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss recent findings describing metabolic changes in autoimmune arthritis, multiple sclerosis as well as type 1 diabetes, focusing on pathophysiological aspects.

AB  - Abstract The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) is a multi-site naturalistic cohort study to: (1) describe the long-term course and consequences of depressive and anxiety disorders, and (2) to integrate biological and psychosocial research paradigms within an epidemiological approach in order to examine (interaction between) predictors of the long-term course and consequences. Its design is an eight-year longitudinal cohort study among 2981 participants aged 18 through 65 years. The sample consists of 1701 persons with a current (six-month recency) diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorder, 907 persons with life-time diagnoses or at risk because of a family history or subthreshold depressive or anxiety symptoms, and 373 healthy controls. Recruitment took place in the general population, in general practices (through a three-stage screening procedure), and in mental health organizations in order to recruit persons reflecting various settings and developmental stages of psychopathology. During a four-hour baseline assessment including written questionnaires, interviews, a medical examination, a cognitive computer task and collection of blood and saliva samples, extensive information was gathered about key (mental) health outcomes and demographic, psychosocial, clinical, biological and genetic determinants. Detailed assessments will be repeated after one, two, four and eight years of follow-up. The findings of NESDA are expected to provide more detailed insight into (predictors of) the long-term course of depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. Besides its scientific relevance, this may contribute to more effective prevention and treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. Copyright ? 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Divalent manganese ion (Mn2+) has been reported to be a useful contrast agent for functional MRI, through a technique named activity-induced manganese-dependent MRI (AIM). In AIM, signal enhancement is related to functional increases in calcium influx, and therefore AIM is, thus far, the only MRI method able to map brain activation in vivo independently of the surrogate hemodynamic changes used in functional MRI. Because of its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high sensitivity, AIM allows the use of multi-slice or three-dimensional MRI techniques to map functional activity at high spatial resolution. In the present review, we define AIM as a functional MRI tool based on the administration of divalent ionized manganese through an open or disrupted blood?brain barrier (BBB). The adequacy and efficacy of AIM in detecting neural activation is described in light of supporting experiments on inhibition of calcium channels, FOS expression, and on direct comparison to BOLD- and perfusion-based functional MRI. Two main applications of AIM, mapping brain activation in rat somatosensory cortex, as well stroke research based on the well-established middle cerebral artery occlusion model, are described in detail. Methodological problems associated with a strong dependence on anesthetic conditions, potential corruption due to disruption of the BBB, and unspecific increase of the baseline signal due to acoustical noise are discussed. Finally, recommended preparation methods and experimental protocols for AIM are introduced. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The ecology of V. vulnificus in seawater is markedly affected by temperature and salinity. The role of phage in the ecology of V. vulnificus remains poorly defined but has been proposed as a potential remedial method to reduce V. vulnificus and target pathogenic strains in post-harvest shellfish. PCR and gene probe methods are available as confirmatory tests for V. vulnificus. When these phenotypic methods are used, V. vulnificus can be differentiated from non-Vibrio using TSI, KIA, and arginine glucose slants, oxidation- fermentation and oxidase tests, and various other methods. The US food and drug administration (FDA) produced a risk assessment that is used to control growth of V. vulnificus through post-harvest time?temperature control.

AB  - As society ages, aging medical problems such as organ damage or failure among senior citizens increases, raising the demand for organ repair technologies. Synthetic materials have been developed and applied in various parts of human body to meet the biomedical needs. Hydrogels, in particular, have found extensive applications as wound healing, drug delivery and controlled release, and scaffold materials in the human body. The development of the next generation of soft hydrogel biomaterials focuses on facile synthetic methods, efficacy of treatment, and tunable multi-functionalities for applications. Supramolecular 3D entities are highly attractive materials for biomedical application. They are assembled by modules via various non-covalent bonds (hydrogen bonds, p?p stacking and/or van der Waals interactions). Biodegradable thermogels are a class of such supramolecular assembled materials. Their use as soft biomaterials and their related applications are described in this Review.

AB  - Abstract Antifungal agents may be associated with significant toxicity or drug interactions leading to sub-therapeutic antifungal drug concentrations and poorer clinical outcomes for patients with haematological malignancy. These risks may be minimised by clinical assessment, laboratory monitoring, avoidance of particular drug combinations and dose modification. Specific measures, such as the optimal timing of oral drug administration in relation to meals, use of pre-hydration and electrolyte supplementation may also be required. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antifungal agents is warranted, especially where non-compliance, non-linear pharmacokinetics, inadequate absorption, a narrow therapeutic window, suspected drug interaction or unexpected toxicity are encountered. Recommended indications for voriconazole and posaconazole TDM in the clinical management of haematology patients are provided. With emerging knowledge regarding the impact of pharmacogenomics upon metabolism of azole agents (particularly voriconazole), potential applications of pharmacogenomic evaluation to clinical practice are proposed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Summary The priority in treating the equine patient with acute diarrhoea is to stabilise the haemodynamic aberrations secondary to the fluid and electrolyte losses. Once this has been initiated and the patient is stabilised ancillary treatments may be beneficial. Besides the well established effects of NSAIDs and polymixin B on systemic inflammation, recent studies suggest that the use of DTOS to bind bacterial toxins and Saccharomyces boulardii to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea may be beneficial. The justification for using probiotic products is scant. There is no evidence to suggest that systemic use of antimicrobials benefits equine patients with colitis, with the exception of metronidazole in cases of clostridial diarrhoea. In light of their potentially detrimental effects, their use can, in the opinion of the authors, not be advocated. Better understanding of the pathways of systemic inflammation and more selective anti-inflammatory drugs may be of great benefit in the future.

AB  - Abstract. Glucagon injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly may take up to 30 min to reverse hypogly-caemia. We investigated whether glucagon absorption could be accelerated by two manoeuvres known to enhance insulin absorption: addition of a powerful local hyperaemic agent (10 nmole Î±-calcitonin gene-related peptide; CGRP), and injection using a multi-hole ?sprinkler? needle. Glucagon (1 mg) given by conventional injection to six normal subjects produced peak plasma glucagon concentrations of 1?48 Â± 0.23 (SEM) ng ml-1 after 20 min and a peak glycaemic response of 7.8 Â± 0.8 mmol 1-1 at 25 min. Glucagon injected with CGRP or using the sprinkler needle did not produce any significant differences in plasma glucagon or glycaemia profiles, compared with conventional injection. Further studies demonstrated that glucagon is itself a powerful vasodilator, causing a 300?500% increase in local blood flow, comparable to that induced by CGRP. Because of its intense local hyperaemic action, the absorption of subcutaneously-injected glucagon may be optimal and seems unlikely to be accelerated by pharmacological or other means.

AB  - Summary Diarrhoea is a common problem in the neonatal and suckling foal. In certain circumstances supplemental nutrition is necessary depending on the age of foal, severity of diarrhoea and presence of other systemic manifestations. Nutritional supplementation can be provided either enterally or parenterally. Enteral nutrition is superior to parenteral nutrition because it is the most natural and physiologically sound means to provide nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition may be warranted if the foal is unable to receive or tolerate enteral nutrition. Dextrose alone or with amino acids and lipids can provide appropriate nutrition when enteral feeding is not tolerated. As soon as the foal stabilises enteral feeding can be reintroduced.

AB  - Summary Bariatric surgery can facilitate weight loss and improvement in medical comorbidities. It has a profound impact on nutrition, and patients need access to follow-up and aftercare. NICE CG189 Obesity emphasized the importance of a minimum of 2 years follow-up in the bariatric surgical service and recommended that following discharge from the surgical service, there should be annual monitoring as part of a shared care model of chronic disease management. NHS England Obesity Clinical Reference Group commissioned a multi-professional subgroup, which included patient representatives, to develop bariatric surgery follow-up guidelines. Terms of reference and scope were agreed upon. The group members took responsibility for different sections of the guidelines depending on their areas of expertise and experience. The quality of the evidence was rated and strength graded. Four different shared care models were proposed, taking into account the variation in access to bariatric surgical services and specialist teams across the country. The common features include annual review, ability for a GP to refer back to specialist centre, submission of follow-up data to the national data base to NBSR. Clinical commissioning groups need to ensure that a shared care model is implemented as patient safety and long-term follow-up are important.
