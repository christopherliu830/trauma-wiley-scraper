AB  - Summary A 2-day-old filly foal presented with signs of depression, recumbency and inappetence. Blood analyses revealed hypoalbuminaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperkalaemia. The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Summary Bariatric surgery can facilitate weight loss and improvement in medical comorbidities. It has a profound impact on nutrition, and patients need access to follow-up and aftercare. NICE CG189 Obesity emphasized the importance of a minimum of 2 years follow-up in the bariatric surgical service and recommended that following discharge from the surgical service, there should be annual monitoring as part of a shared care model of chronic disease management. NHS England Obesity Clinical Reference Group commissioned a multi-professional subgroup, which included patient representatives, to develop bariatric surgery follow-up guidelines. Terms of reference and scope were agreed upon. The group members took responsibility for different sections of the guidelines depending on their areas of expertise and experience. The quality of the evidence was rated and strength graded. Four different shared care models were proposed, taking into account the variation in access to bariatric surgical services and specialist teams across the country. The common features include annual review, ability for a GP to refer back to specialist centre, submission of follow-up data to the national data base to NBSR. Clinical commissioning groups need to ensure that a shared care model is implemented as patient safety and long-term follow-up are important.

AB  - Summary Background Birthweight of Thoroughbred foals has increased in recent years. It is unknown whether this is associated with increased broodmare obesity or endocrine dysfunction. Objectives To determine insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations in Thoroughbred mares throughout gestation and investigate their association with obesity and foal birthweight. Study design Cohort study. Methods A total of 66 mares were included from 40 days post-breeding. Body condition score (BCS), weight and blood samples were obtained every 60 days throughout gestation. Serum/plasma insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations and foal birthweight were recorded. Associations between hormone/triglyceride concentration with BCS, stage of gestation and birthweight were analysed using a linear mixed effects model. Results Serum insulin concentrations were greater at 1?60 days (4.31 ?iu/mL) compared with 241?300 days (3.13 ?iu/mL) and 61?120 days (5.33 ?iu/mL) compared with 181?240, 241?300 and 301?360 days (3.78, 3.13, 3.37 ?iu/mL) gestation (P<0.05). There was no significant hyperinsulinaemia and no association of insulin concentration with BCS. Leptin concentration was greater at 181?240 days (2.28 ?g/L, P<0.0001) compared with all other time points and correlated with BCS (P<0.0003). Triglyceride concentration was greater at 241?300 days (0.245 mmol, P<0.02) compared with earlier time points, but was not associated with BCS. Foal birthweight was weakly positively correlated with BCS (r = 0.13, P<0.001) and inversely correlated with leptin concentrations at 61?120 and 241?300 days gestation (r = ?0.64, P<0.05). Main limitations Reduction in sample size over the study and tight clustering of BCS. Conclusions Mare BCS correlated with foal birthweight; obese mares had heavier foals. Significant hyperinsulinaemia was not identified in this population. Increased leptin concentration in early and late gestation was associated with decreased foal birthweight. Further work is required to establish whether leptin concentration in late gestation could predict foal birthweight.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the effect of acepromazine (ACP) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by stimulated equine neutrophils. Study design? Ex vivo biochemical experiments. Animals? Isolated neutrophils from healthy untreated horses. Methods? Neutrophils were incubated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m and then stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) before measurement of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). In a second experiment neutrophils were incubated in the presence of α-keto-? methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) and treated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m. Subsequent PMA stimulation lead to neutrophilic ROS production and decomposition of KMB to ethylene, which is measured by gas chromatography. Electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping (EPR) analysis was performed with PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the presence of ACP (10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m) directly added to the cell suspension. In the second experiment, the same concentrations of ACP were pre-incubated with neutrophils, then centrifuged to eliminate the excess of ACP and re-suspended in phosphate buffer before stimulation with PMA. In all experiments, the results of ACP-treated and ACP-untreated stimulated neutrophils were compared. Results? Overall, results obtained with lucigenin-enhanced CL and KMB oxidation were in agreement with those seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Acepromazine induced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on neutrophilic ROS production. Electron paramagnetic resonance also showed, at high ACP concentration, the appearance of a cation radical derived from ACP. In contrast, electron paramagnetic resonance study performed with pre-incubated neutrophils showed an important dose-dependent inhibitory effect of ACP. Conclusion? The results indicate that ACP can neutralize O??2 or its by-products during the stimulation of neutrophils. Clinical relevance? These findings may have a therapeutic relevance when phenothiazines are used in horses suffering from inflammatory diseases in which neutrophil activation and ROS production are implicated.

AB  - Summary The development of the equine placenta involves a series of stage-specific events which ensure that the fetus is nourished throughout its 11 months of gestation. Initially, placental exchange to the developing embryo is histotrophic, via the yolk sac but, as the allantochorion develops and microcotyledons form, haemotrophic nutrition plays the major role in sustaining the increasing demands of the growing fetus. This review describes the development of the allantochorionic placenta of the mare and discusses some of the factors that influence its growth, size and functions and, hence, its control of fetal growth and maturation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine those factors which are predictive of outcome in cases of thoracic empyema that are solely community acquired. All patients admitted with a diagnosis of thoracic empyema in the Auckland region between 1993 and 1995 were reviewed retrospectively. Both clinical and radiological outcomes were determined at 3?6 month follow up. Radiological outcomes were scored on admission, discharge and follow up by blinded chest radiograph review based on lung field opacification, extent and thickness of pleura. Forty-six cases fulfilled inclusion criteria. Mean age was 56 ± 21 years, 67% were male and there was no ethnic preponderance. Forty-six per cent of cases had specific underlying risk factors. Multi-loculated cases of empyema occurred in 63%, pleural aspirate was culture positive in 59% and Streptococcus milleri represented 42% of all positive cultures. Delay in appropriate management was 5.2 ± 4.2 days. Fifty-six per cent of total procedures incorporated intrapleural streptokinase as an adjunct to drainage. The cure rate was 93.3% without requirement for surgical intervention. Two patients died early giving a 4.3% mortality rate. Radiological scores were 8.6 ± 0.6 on admission, 6.3 ± 1.5 on discharge and 2.5 ± 2.5 at follow up. Improvement in radiological scores was statistically significant from admission to discharge and follow up (P<0.001). The total duration of hospitalization was 22 ± 10 days and by univariate analysis was predicted by: pleural sepsis not involving S. milleri (P = 0.001), specific predisposing factors (P = 0.02), and frank pus on pleural aspiration (P = 0.03). Total delay in management was suggestive in prolonging the duration of hospitalization (P = 0.07). Parapneumonic thoracic empyema is an important source of morbidity which is determined by both patient and management factors. Good results can be obtained by prompt medical therapy including tube drainage and intrapleural streptokinase without need for surgical intervention.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess health and musculoskeletal function in survivors of pediatric sarcomas. Patients and Methods Thirty-two individuals treated for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), or non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NR-STS) with multi-modality therapy were enrolled on this cross-sectional study. Median age at the time of therapy was 15.4 years (range 7.1?34.2), median age at the time of analysis was 37.4 years (17.5?55.4), and median duration of time elapsed from completion of therapy was 17.3 years (2.9?32.6). Participants underwent assessments of musculoskeletal functioning, cardiac function, metabolic and lipid analyses, renal and gonadal function, and psychological evaluation. Results This cohort of sarcoma survivors shows expected locoregional limitations in function of the area affected by sarcoma, and impaired global musculoskeletal functioning as evidenced by limited endurance and limited overall activity levels. The cohort also demonstrated substantial rates of cardiac dysfunction, elevated body fat index, hyperlipidemia, chronic psychological distress, and infertility in men (76%) and premature menopause (49%) in women. Conclusion Sarcoma survivors demonstrate diminished locoregional and global musculoskeletal functioning which likely limit occupational opportunities and socioeconomic health. In addition, the combination of diminished cardiac reserve, limited activity levels, and lipid dysregulation in sarcoma survivors suggests that this population is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, even many years following completion of sarcoma therapy. Sarcoma survivors may benefit from life long follow-up for cardiovascular disease and from occupational counseling upon completion of therapy. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2007;48:192?199.

AB  - Abstract Acute hypoglycaemia provokes profound physiological changes affecting the cardiovascular system and several haematological parameters, principally as a consequence of sympatho-adrenal activation and counter-regulatory hormonal secretion. Many of these responses have an important role in protecting the brain from neuroglycopenia, through altering regional blood flow and promoting metabolic changes that will restore blood glucose to normal. In healthy young adults the cardiovascular effects are transient and have no obvious detrimental consequences. However, some of the effected changes are potentially pathophysiological and in people with diabetes who have developed endothelial dysfunction, they may have an adverse impact on a vasculature that is already damaged. The acute haemodynamic and haematological changes may increase the risk of localized tissue ischaemia, and major vascular events can certainly be precipitated by acute hypoglycaemia. These include myocardial and cerebral ischaemia and occasionally infarction. Established diabetic retinopathy often deteriorates after strict glycaemic control is instituted, the latter being associated with a threefold increase in frequency of severe hypoglycaemia, and enhanced exposure to mild hypoglycaemia. The possible mechanisms underlying these hypoglycaemia-induced effects include haemorrheological changes, white cell activation, vasoconstriction, and the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The concept that acute hypoglycaemia could aggravate vascular complications associated with diabetes is discussed in relation to evolving comprehension of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and blood vessel disease.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Abstract Extended human longevity has resulted in increasing numbers of elderly persons in the general population. However, old age is also associated with a variety of serious physical disorders. Frailty among sedentary elderly patients is related to the impaired structure and function of contractile fibers. Biochemical research into cellular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia promises to acquire the scientific basis of evidence to aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The recent application of MS-based proteomic methodology has identified a large cohort of disease-specific markers of sarcopenia. This review critically examines the biomedical implications of the results obtained from the proteomic screening of both aged human muscle and established animal models of sarcopenia. Substantial alterations in proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, regulatory and contractile elements of the actomyosin apparatus, myofibrillar remodeling and the cellular stress response are discussed. A multi-factorial etiology appears to be the basis for a slower-twitching aged fiber population, which exhibits a shift to more aerobic-oxidative metabolism. It is hoped that the detailed biomedical characterization of the newly identified biomarkers of sarcopenia will translate into better treatment options for reversing age-dependent muscle degeneration, which could improve the standard of living for a large portion of society.

AB  - Abstract Parametric subtracted post-ictal diffusion tensor imaging (pspiDTI) is a novel imaging technique developed at our center to visualize transient, patient-specific, ictal-associated water diffusion abnormalities in hippocampal-associated axonal tissue. PspiDTI can elucidate putative connectivity patterns, tracing ictal propagation following a partial-onset seizure without generalization secondarily. PspiDTI compares two DTI volumes acquired during the early post-ictal period (<4 hr), and baseline inter-ictal interval (>24?hr post-seizure). This technique performs a voxel-wise parametric test to identify statistically significant transient ictal-associated changes in water diffusivity involving white matter (WM). Our technique was applied to six patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy who were candidates for direct cortical responsive neurostimulation (RNS) therapy. Global and region-specific fractional anisotropy decreases, relative to baseline, were detected in all patients with a 17.01% (p <?.01) relative mean decrement, while trace increases were found in 6/6 (100%) patients with a 13.30% (p <?.01) relative global mean increment. Changes in diffusivity were anatomically compared with transient hyper-perfusion as detected by subtracted ictal SPECT co-registered to MRI (SISCOM). In 5/6 (83.33%) patients, alterations in WM diffusivity were detected adjacent to the SISCOM signal localized predominantly in gray matter. In 4/6 patients, post-implant RNS electrocorticography revealed early ictal propagation between implanted RNS depth leads guided by pspiDTI, hence validating concordant abnormal diffusivity regions detected by our technique. PspiDTI can complement the conventional pre-surgical evaluation to provide additional crucial information regarding WM ictal-propagation pathways between predominantly gray matter ictal-onset zones. When incorporated into a multi-modality pre-surgical workflow, pspiDTI can aid in defining critical nodes between ictogenic regions. This information can be used to strategically implant a limited set of two RNS depth leads for maximizing the extent to which direct cortical RNS can modulate a potentially extensive epileptogenic network.

Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six healthy Beagle dogs aged 7?8 years. Methods Dogs were anaesthetized with sevoflurane in oxygen, and catheters were inserted for TPTDCO and TDCO measurement. After instrumentation, baseline CO was measured using each technique at a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3?7 mmHg. Dogs were subsequently administered lactated Ringer's solution and 6% hydroxyethyl starch to induce fluid overload. CO measurements were obtained using each technique at CVP values of 8?12 mmHg, 13?17 mmHg, 18?22 mmHg and 23?27 mmHg. Agreements between CO measurements obtained with the respective techniques were analysed using Dunnett's test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland?Altman analysis. Results Thirty pairs of CO values were obtained, ranging from 1.45 L minute?1 to 4.69 L minute?1 for TPTDCO and from 1.30 L minute?1 to 4.61 L minute?1 for TDCO. TPTDCO and TDCO values correlated strongly (r2 = 0.915, p < 0.001). The bias and mean relative bias between TPTDCO and TDCO were 0.26 ± 0.30 L minute?1 (limits of agreement ? 0.29 to 0.81 L minute?1) and 9.7%, respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance TPTDCO and TDCO measurements obtained in anaesthetized dogs during fluid overload exhibited good agreement. Accordingly, transpulmonary thermodilution provides an accurate measurement of CO in dogs with fluid overload.

AB  - Abstract Aims Diabetic kidney disease independently predicts cardiovascular disease and premature death. We examined the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD, defined as an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and quality of care in a cross-sectional survey of adults (age ≥ 18 years) with Type 2 diabetes across Asia. Methods The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation programme is a disease-management programme implemented using an electronic portal that systematically captures clinical characteristics of all patients enrolled. Between July 2007 and December 2012, data on 28 110 consecutively enrolled patients (China: 3415, Hong Kong: 15 196, India: 3714, Korea: 1651, Philippines: 3364, Vietnam: 692, Taiwan: 78) were analysed. Results In this survey, 15.9% of patients had CKD, 25.0% had microalbuminuria and 12.5% had macroalbuminuria. Patients with CKD were less likely to achieve HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) (36.0% vs. 42.3%) and blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg (20.8% vs. 35.3%), and were more likely to have retinopathy (26.2% vs. 8.7%), sensory neuropathy (29.0% vs. 7.7%), cardiovascular disease (26.6% vs. 8.7%) and self-reported hypoglycaemia (18.9% vs. 8.2%). Despite high frequencies of albuminuria (74.8%) and dyslipidaemia (93.0%) among CKD patients, only 49.0% were using renin?angiotensin system inhibitors and 53.6% were on statins. On logistic regression, old age, male gender, tobacco use, long disease duration, high HbA1c, blood pressure and BMI, and low LDL cholesterol were independently associated with CKD (all P < 0.05). Conclusions The poor control of risk factors, suboptimal use of organ-protective drugs and high frequencies of hypoglycaemia highlight major treatment gaps in patients with diabetic kidney disease in Asia.

AB  - A cat receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma was administered a four times overdose of vinblastine in error. Severe, acute life-threatening toxicities occurred. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was suspected based on electrolyte disturbances. A favourable outcome was achieved with aggressive supportive care. Personnel involved in administering chemotherapy to small animal patients must check that the patient is receiving the correct drug, at the appropriate dose, prior to every treatment.

AB  - Summary The provision of anaesthesia for patients suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa is not without its risks. The anaesthetist needs to appreciate that these eating disorders can predispose the patient to significant risk of multi-organ dysfunction related to starvation and purging. Any such organ dysfunction can have serious implications on morbidity and mortality. Therefore, careful peri-operative management is essential to avoid anaesthetic complications. Both disorders are common, with incidences in the general population of up to 30% in girls and young women. A review of the literature on the provision of anaesthesia for anorexic patients was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of these disorders on the patient's physiology and the subsequent implications for anaesthesia.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In-office evaluation of erectile dysfunction by color duplex Doppler ultrasound (CDDU) may benefit the decision-making process in regard to choosing the most appropriate therapy. Unfortunately, there is no uniform standardization in performing CDDU resulting in high variability in data expression and interpretation when comparing results among various centers, especially when conducting multicenter trials. Establishing standard operating procedures (SOPs) is a major step that will help minimize such variability. Aim.? This SOP describes CDDU procedure with focus on establishing uniformity and normative parameters. Main Outcome Measure.? Measure intra-arterial diameter, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and resistive index for each cavernosal artery. Methods.? After initial discussion with the patient about his history and International Index of Erectile Function evaluation describe procedural steps to the patient. Perform the CDDU in a relaxed state, scanning the entire penis (in B-mode image) using a 7.5- to 12-MHz linear array ultrasound probe. An intracorporal injection of a single or combination of vasoactive agents (e.g., prostaglandin E1, phentolamine, and papaverine) is then administered and CDDU performed at various time points, preferably with audiovisual sexual stimulation (AVSS). Results.? Monitor penile erection response (tumescence and rigidity) near peak blood flow. Self-stimulation or AVSS leaving the patient alone in room or redosing may be considered to decrease any anxiety and help achieve a maximum rigid erection. Conclusion.? Considering the complexity and heterogeneity of CDDU evaluation, this communication will help in standardization and establish uniformity in such data interpretation. When indicated, invasive diagnostic testing involving (i) penile angiography and (ii) cavernosography/cavernosometry to establish veno-occlusive dysfunction may be recommended to facilitate further treatment options.
