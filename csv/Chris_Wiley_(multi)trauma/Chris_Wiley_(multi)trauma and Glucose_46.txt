AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the de novo formation of bone that occurs in soft tissue, through recruitment, expansion, and differentiation of multiple cells types including transient brown adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, mast cells, and platelets to name a few. Much evidence is accumulating that suggests changes in metabolism may be required to accomplish this bone formation. Recent work using a mouse model of heterotopic bone formation reliant on delivery of adenovirus-transduced cells expressing low levels of BMP2 showed the immediate expansion of a unique brown adipocyte-like cell. These cells are undergoing robust uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation to a level such that oxygen in the microenvironment is dramatically lowered creating areas of hypoxia. It is unclear how these oxygen changes ultimately affect metabolism and bone formation. To identify the processes and changes occurring over the course of bone formation, HO was established in the mice, and tissues isolated at early and late times were subjected to a global metabolomic screen. Results show that there are significant changes in both glucose levels, as well as TCA cycle intermediates. Additionally, metabolites necessary for oxidation of stored lipids were also found to be significantly elevated. The complete results of this screen are presented here, and provide a unique picture of the metabolic changes occurring during heterotopic bone formation. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Emergency care providers share a compelling interest in developing an effective patient-centered, outcomes-based research agenda that can decrease variability in pediatric outcomes. The 2018 Academic Emergency Medicine Consensus Conference ?Aligning the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Research Agenda to Reduce Health Outcome Gaps (AEMCC)? aimed to fulfill this role. This conference convened major thought leaders and stakeholders to introduce a research, scholarship, and innovation agenda for pediatric emergency care specifically to reduce health outcome gaps. Planning committee and conference participants included emergency physicians, pediatric emergency physicians, pediatricians, and researchers with expertise in research dissemination and translation, as well as comparative effectiveness, in collaboration with patients, patient and family advocates from national advocacy organizations, and trainees. Topics that were explored and deliberated through subcommittee breakout sessions led by content experts included 1) pediatric emergency medical services research, 2) pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) research network collaboration, 3) PEM education for emergency medicine providers, 4) workforce development for PEM, and 5) enhancing collaboration across emergency departments (PEM practice in non?children's hospitals). The work product of this conference is a research agenda that aims to identify areas of future research, innovation, and scholarship in PEM.

AB  - Abstract Childhood and adolescent rates of obesity and overweight are continuing to increase in much of the world. Risk factors such as diet composition, excess caloric intake, decreased exercise, genetics, and the built environment are active areas of etiologic research. The obesogen hypothesis, which postulates that prenatal and perinatal chemical exposure can contribute to risk of childhood and adolescent obesity, remains relatively underexamined. This review surveys numerous classes of chemicals for which this hypothesis has been explored. We focus on human data where they exist and also discuss the findings of rodent and cell culture studies. Organochlorine chemicals as well as several classes of chemicals that are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists are identified as possible risk factors for obesity. Recommendations for future epidemiologic and experimental research on the chemical origins of obesity are also given. Mt Sinai J Med 78:22?48, 2011. ? 2011 Mount Sinai School of Medicine

AB  - Aim: Multi-center clinical trials were performed using allogeneic cultured dermal substitutes (CDS) newly developed in the R & D Center for Artificial Skin of Kitasato University. Method: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of burns in 5 cases and the treatment of skin ulcers in 4 cases. Complications with the skin ulcers were diabetes (1 case), varix (1 case), and collagen diseases (2 cases). The wound surface area was measured with picture analysis software during the wound healing process. Results: The clinical evaluation was made using a protocol that includes a standard for the development of new wound dressings. According to the comprehensive judgment, the results achieved were evaluated as excellent for 4 burn cases and good for one case. Regarding the skin ulcers, results were excellent in 3 cases and good for one case. No harmful complications were observed during this study. Conclusions: CDS were useful for burn and ulcer treatment but the wound surface must be checked rigorously for the occurrence of infection during the healing process.

AB  - Summary Background Continuous digital hypothermia can prevent the development and progression of laminitis associated with sepsis but its effects on laminitis due to hyperinsulinaemia are unknown. Objectives To determine the effects of continuous digital hypothermia on laminitis development in the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp model. Study design Randomised, controlled (within subject), blinded, experiment. Methods Eight clinically normal Standardbred horses underwent laminitis induction using the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp model (EHC). At initiation of the EHC, one forelimb was continuously cooled (ICE), with the other maintained at ambient temperature (AMB). Dorsal lamellar sections (proximal, middle, distal) were harvested 48 h after initiation of the EHC and were analysed using histological scoring (0?3) and histomorphometry. Cellular proliferation was quantified by counting epidermal cell nuclei staining positive with an immunohistochemical proliferation marker (TPX2). Results Severe elongation and disruption of SEL with dermo-epidermal separation (score of 3) was observed in all AMB feet at one or more section locations, but was not observed in any ICE sections. Overall 92% of the AMB sections received the most severe histological score (grade 3) and 8% were grade 2, whereas ICE sections were classified as either grade 1 (50%) or grade 2 (50%). Relative to AMB feet, ICE sections were 98% less likely to exhibit grades 2 or 3 (OR: 0.02, 95% CI 0.001, 0.365; P<0.01). Histomorphometry measurements of total and nonkeratinised primary epidermal lamellar length were significantly increased (P<0.01) in AMB limbs compared with ICE. TPX2 positive cell counts were significantly increased (P<0.01) in AMB limbs compared with ICE. Main limitations Continuous digital hypothermia was initiated before recognition of laminitis and therefore the clinical applicability requires further investigation. Conclusions Continuous digital hypothermia reduced the severity of laminitis in the EHC model and prevented histological lesions compatible with lamellar structural failure.

AB  - Cognitive decline is increasingly described as a co-morbidity of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment are not fully understood despite examining clinical factors, such as seizure frequency, and cellular mechanisms of excitotoxicity. We review the neuropsychometry evidence for progressive cognitive decline and examine the pathology and neuroimaging evidence supporting a neurodegenerative process in hippocampal sclerosis (HS)-related TLE. Accelerated cognitive decline is described in groups of adult HS-related TLE patients. Large childhood studies show early onset of seizures result in poor development of verbal memory and a hindrance in achieving cognitive potential. We discuss HS classification according to different patterns of neuronal loss and correlation to post-temporal lobectomy cognitive outcomes in refractory TLE patients. Factors such as lateralization of HS pathology, neuronal density and subtype have correlated to cognitive outcomes with varying significance between different studies. Furthermore, alterations in neuronal maturity, regenerative capacity and aberrant connectivity appear to affect cognitive performance post-operatively suggesting a complex multifactorial process. More recent studies have identified tau pathology being present in HS-related TLE and correlated to post-operative cognitive decline in some patients. A traumatic head injury-related or novel tauopathy has been hypothesized as an underlying process. We discuss the value of prospective and cross-sectional imaging in assessing cognition and review volumetric magnetic resonance studies with progressive ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy identified to correlate with seizure frequency. Finally, we consider the use of positron emission tomography biomarkers, such as tau tracers, and connectivity studies that may examine in vivo pathways and further explore cognitive decline in TLE.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention by researchers worldwide in recent years for their small dimensions and unique architecture, and for having immense potential in nanomedicine as biocompatible and supportive substrates, as a novel tool for the delivery of therapeutic molecules including peptides, RNA and DNA, and also as sensors, actuators and composites. Key findings? CNTs have been employed in the development of molecular electronic, composite materials and others due to their unique atomic structure, high surface area-to-volume ratio and excellent electronic, mechanical and thermal properties. Recently they have been exploited as novel nanocarriers in drug delivery systems and biomedical applications. Their larger inner volume as compared with the dimensions of the tube and easy immobilization of their outer surface with biocompatible materials make CNTs a superior nanomaterial for drug delivery. Literature reveals that CNTs are versatile carriers for controlled and targeted drug delivery, especially for cancer cells, because of their cell membrane penetrability. Summary? This review enlightens the biomedical application of CNTs with special emphasis on utilization in controlled and targeted drug delivery, as a diagnostics tool and other possible uses in therapeutic systems. The review also focuses on the toxicity aspects of CNTs, and revealed that genotoxic potential, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of different types of CNTs must be explored and overcome by formulating safe biomaterial for drug delivery. The review also describes the regulatory aspects and clinical and market status of CNTs.

AB  - Introduction Adopting the modified International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) will increase the prevalence of GDM resulting in increased resource utilisation and an unknown effect on clinical outcomes. Aims To determine the prevalence of GDM by the modified IADPSG criteria and compare characteristics and pregnancy outcomes between women with GDM by IADPSG-additional, those with GDM by the New Zealand Society for the Study of Diabetes (NZSSD) criteria and those with a normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Methods All women who delivered at Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) for a 12-month period from July 2012 to June 2013 had demographic, pregnancy and laboratory data obtained from hospital databases and clinical records. Results Of the 6376 (85%) of eligible women screened for GDM, 381 (6%) had GDM by NZSSD criteria and an additional 238 (4%) by the modified IADPSG-additional criteria, a relative increase of 62%. Women with GDM by NZSSD criteria had similar characteristics compared to women with GDM by IADPSG-additional. The outcomes between the two groups were also similar with the exception of a higher induction of labour (IOL) rate in women with GDM by NZSSD and a higher mean birthweight in the GDM by IADPSG-additional. Conclusion Adopting the modified IADPSG criteria will result in a 62% increase in the number of GDM cases with a significant impact on workload and resources. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the introduction of the IADPSG criteria for our service.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Keloids are disfiguring, proliferative scars that are a pathologic response to cutaneous injury. An organotypic tissue culture system (the Raft model 1?10) was used to investigate the feasibility of using photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an adjunctive therapy to treat keloids following surgical excision. The Raft co-culture system mimics skin by layering keratinocytes on top of fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. PDT uses drugs that produce singlet oxygen in situ when irradiated by light, and may lead to a number of effects in living tissues varying from the modulation of growth to apoptosis. PDT is already used to treat several benign and malignant diseases in organs such as the skin, retina, and esophagus. Study Design/Materials and Methods Normal adult, neonatal, and keloid fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated from skin obtained from patients undergoing elective procedures and used to construct the Rafts. Mature Rafts (after 4 days) were incubated with 5-amino levulinic acid (5-ALA), a photosensitizer, for 3 hours and were laser-irradiated (635 nm) for total energy delivery of 5 J/cm2, 10 J/cm2, or 20 J/cm2. Rafts were examined 24 hours and 14 days later. Cell viability was determined using confocal imaging combined with live-dead fluorescent dyes. Multi-photon microscope (MPM) imaged collagen structure and density. As Rafts contract over time, surface area was measured using optical micrometry daily. Results At 10 and 20 J/cm2, near-total cell death was observed in all constructs, while at 5 J/cm2 cell viability was comparable to controls. Cell viability in keloid and neonatal Rafts was greater than that observed in normal adult Rafts. Treated Rafts contracted less over the 14-day period compared to controls. Contraction and collagen density were greatest in keloid and neonatal Rafts. Conclusions A PDT dosimetry range was established, which reduces tissue contraction and collagen density while minimizing injury to fibroblasts. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Despite its past anonymity, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type is a disease with a major impact on our ageing society. It affects a considerable percentage of old and very old people (some 20% of people over the age of eighty), causing distress and discomfort for the sufferers and the carers; it causes close to 50% of all nursing home admissions and costs the nation probably more than $2 billion annually; it is, with cardiovascular diseases and cancer, a leading cause of death. One of the particular difficulties with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) is that the diagnosis only can be confirmed in the post-mortem ? during life the diagnosis can only be made with a limited degree of certainty by following established inclusion and exclusion criteria (Glen and Christie 1979); that is, by ruling out other known causes of dementia in a patient with a dementia syndrome it is concluded that it must be senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. One other interesting aspect is that in SDAT, a disease which I compared before with cancer and cardio-vascular disease, a defeatist attitude amongst the medical profession is frequently noticed. Had the same attitude been adopted in the past towards cancer and cardio-vascular disease, progress in diagnosis and treatment of these diseases would never have happened. I am suggesting that it is possible to adopt a less defeatist and more positive attitude towards SDAT and this then stimulates the development of working strategies and working hypotheses. A working hypothesis can never claim to be a final solution to the problem, it is merely a frame of thought that directs step by step research working towards piecemeal solution of the problem. Summary A working hypothesis is presented, describing SDAT as a multi-factorial condition, in which genetic factors, toxic factors and nutritional factors are interacting and may play an accelerating role in the development of SDAT. Depression, frequently co-existing with SDAT, contributes to symptomatology and can be considered as playing an accelerating role. A tremendous amount of research has to be done. A working strategy at present could be: 1. Increase research. 2. Maintenance of a good nutritional status in the individual patient is mandatory. Nutritional research deserves high priority, based on early indications that secondary changes in nutritional condition may accelerate the process. 3. More attention should be given, before the verdict of ?Alzheimer? is pronounced, to the possibility that toxic factors have been contributing to the condition. Extra attention should be given to careful prescription of medication. 4. Prevention, early recognition and vigorous treatment of depression seems to be a most important factor. The importance of psycho-social stimulation should be recognised. The influence of the depression-like state on the blood-brain barrier function and on nutritional status of the brain should have high priority in future research.

AB  - Advancements in soft tissue minimally invasive surgery have been rapid and comprehensive since its inception in human medicine approximately 25?years ago. From its origins in traditional laparoscopy, followed rapidly by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, minimally invasive surgery in human medicine has evolved through a number of different platforms that now include single-port approach devices, robotic surgery as well as natural orifice transluminal endosurgery. Whilst some of these remain beyond the reach of veterinary medicine for now, largely because of technical challenges and the prohibitive costs of some single-use disposable components, veterinary minimally invasive surgery is advancing rapidly allowing our small animal patients to benefit from some of the many documented advantages that a minimally invasive approach affords the patient.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - Summary The intestine may be subjected to simple obstruction, in which only the lumen is obstructed, strangulating obstruction, in which both the lumen and vasculature are obstructed, or infarction, in which only the vasculature is obstructed. Each of these may injure intestinal tissues, particularly with interruption of blood flow and subsequent ischemic injury. This can also occur in simple obstruction as the luminal pressure causes collapse of the vasculature within the intestinal wall. Once reperfused, ischemic-injured mucosa may undergo reperfusion injury, depending on the circumstances. This relates to the level of reactive oxygen metabolite generation and infiltration of neutrophils. More recently, repair of the mucosa has been studied in depth, including villus contraction (in the small intestine), epithelial restitution, tight junction closure, and mucosal proliferation. Other layers of the intestine are also injured, particularly the serosa, which can lead to inflammation and development of adhesions.

Only 35% of men and 24% of women reach the recommended 30?minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity at least five times a week. Men tend to be more active than women at all ages, and there is a marked decline in physical activity with age in both sexes. Children are more active than adults. Seventy per cent of boys and 61% of girls reach the recommended 60?minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a day. Boys tend to be more active than girls and there is a decline in physical activity as children reach adolescence, which is more marked in girls. For adults and children, lower-income groups have particularly low physical activity levels. Although physical activity levels in adults and children have been relatively stable in recent years, there is some evidence to suggest a decline in occupational activity from the 1990s onwards, and a decrease in active transport to school and time spent in school physical education lessons. This has coincided with an upward trend in sports participation (e.g. joining fitness clubs) in adults. The physiological effects of physical activity are wide ranging, and affect various body systems. As a modifiable component of energy expenditure, physical activity can affect energy balance. However, the total effects of physical activity on total energy expenditure go beyond the physical activity-induced energy expenditure. Increases in resting metabolic rate and non-exercise activity thermogenesis are also seen. Furthermore, physical activity can modify body composition favourably by decreasing fat mass and increasing lean mass. Physical activity can reduce resting blood pressure and increase capacity to carry blood in the coronary arteries. Beneficial changes also occur in the lining of blood vessels which help direct the appropriate distribution of blood in the body. Regular physical activity can also exert beneficial effects on the body's capacity for forming and breaking down blood clots, and produces favourable changes in plasma lipid profile. Physical activity is known to improve blood glucose handling and is also associated with beneficial immunological (with the exception of intense activities of long duration) and neurological changes. In terms of its interaction with food intake, physical activity tends not to lead to an increase in energy intake in the short-term. But long-term studies indicate that negative energy balance cannot continue indefinitely; eventually energy intake increases until energy balance is resumed. In those who are physically active, the greater energy intake needed to match energy expenditure means that it is easier to achieve adequate micronutrient intakes. In addition, those who are more active adapt to using fat as an energy substrate more effectively. Physical activity is commonly assessed using self-reported (subjective) measures such as diaries, physical activity logs, recall surveys and questionnaires, and these methods have been relied upon heavily in epidemiological studies and surveys conducted to date. Unfortunately, self-reported measures of physical activity are limited in terms of reliability and reliance on accurate recall from participants in studies. This hinders research in this area because measurement error is likely to possibly underestimate the strength of observed relationships between physical activity and health, and weaken the effects of physical activity interventions. Despite these measurement issues, there is substantial evidence that physical activity is protective for a number of chronic diseases, both independently and via its effects on weight gain and obesity. Greater physical activity is associated with less weight gain. Weight loss programmes that include a regular physical activity component are more effective at maintaining weight loss. It is likely that for many people, 45?60?minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a day is necessary to prevent obesity. Physical activity (independently) reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes by 33?50%. Those who are at high risk of type 2 diabetes (e.g. the obese and those with impaired glucose tolerance) can benefit most from physical activity. Physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in a dose-dependent manner. Benefits are seen with regular moderate-intensity physical activity, e.g. walking, but more intense exercise, e.g. running, carried out more often and for longer episodes can decrease risk even further. Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of a number of cancers. It is well established that physical activity reduces the risk of colon cancer (especially in men) and breast cancer (especially in post-menopausal women). There is also consistent evidence that physical activity reduces the risk of lung and endometrial cancers and some indication that physical activity can reduce the risk of advanced prostate cancer. In childhood, physical activity habits, particularly during growth periods including puberty, have a long-lasting effect on bone health. Weight-bearing and high impact activities, such as running or skipping, are most effective at increasing bone strength. In older adults, physical activity is important to counteract the age-related decrease in bone mass. Physical activity can decrease the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older people, particularly if the activity increases muscle strength, balance and co-ordination. There is good evidence that physical inactivity increases the risk of clinical depression. There is also good evidence that physical activity has an important beneficial effect on anxiety. Furthermore, physical activity is important for psychological wellbeing and can be used as a means to improve mood and self-esteem. It is clear that physical activity exerts its benefits throughout the life course. In childhood, physical activity is important as a means of maintaining energy balance and helping bone strength, and thus reduces the risk of chronic disease later in life. It is also important for social interaction, wellbeing and setting good lifestyle habits. It is recommended that children and young people achieve a total of at least 60?minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity each day. At least twice a week this should include activities to improve bone health (e.g. skipping, running), muscle strength and flexibility. It is recommended that adults should achieve a total of at least 30?minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity each day, on five or more days a week. This level of physical activity should be maintained throughout adulthood in order to reduce the risk of chronic disease and should be continued into old age for as long as capabilities allow, in order to counteract the age-related losses in muscle and bone, deterioration of the cardiovascular system and to decrease the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Widespread physical inactivity is a major public health problem and improving physical activity levels is crucial. This challenging situation is now well recognised by international and national health bodies. The World Health Organization (2004) has a global strategy on physical activity, and in England the Department of Health (2005) has a ?Choosing Activity? physical activity action plan. In the UK, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) offers a range of guidance on the effectiveness of different methods of promoting physical activity, but current research is limited and it is hoped that ongoing work will provide more comprehensive guidance in the coming years. There are a number of psychological barriers to physical activity, including issues related to body image, poor confidence and lack of immediate rewards. These barriers are often marked in those who are obese and need to lose weight. Most importantly, environmental factors which contribute to low levels of physical activity should to be tackled if significant changes to population level physical activity are to be achieved. For example, policies which support active transport initiatives have proved to be effective in other countries and thus have great potential in the UK. Further research to gain a greater understanding of the psychological and environmental barriers to increasing physical activity is likely to help direct more effective campaigns to promote physical activity in the future.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Diarrhoea is the most common disease in young calves, accounting for about 50% of all calf deaths. The disease can be easily recognised and it is important that treatment is administered rapidly in order to maximise the chance of survival. However, equally important is a thorough understanding of the underlying causes of the disease and the implementation of appropriate management steps to minimise the impact of the disease in the future. This article discusses the most common causes of neonatal diarrhoea and seeks the advice of the panel on how best to treat and manage them.

AB  - Abstract. The function of pancreatic grafts harvested from six pancreas-liver (PL) donors was compared to that of nine pancreas-alone (PA) donors. All donors had comparable physiological parameters. Pancreas and liver were flushed in situ with 4C Collins solution and the portal vein was vented immediately. The pancreaticoduodenal grafts were reflushed and stored in Collins solution (three PA and two PL), silica gel-filtered plasma (six PA and two PL), or University of Wisconsin solution (two PL). Later they were revascularized by the iliac vessels and drained into the bladder. All pancreas recipients were insulin-dependent. Serum glucose, amylase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, protein, albumin, and urine amylase, bicarbonate and pH were monitored for 12 days. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fischer's exact test. The PL grafts received a significantly higher aortic flush volume (5983 cc vs 1622 cc, P= 0.001) than those in the other group. Recipients of PL grafts had higher serum amylase (335 vs 250 IU/1) and lipase (1048 vs 424 IU/1), significantly lower levels of urine bicarbonate (11.2vs27.1 mEq/l, P= 0.01), pH (6.8vs7.3, P= 0.04), and amylase (9202 vs 19981 IU/l, P= 0.05) than those in the PA group. Moreover, they required longer periods of gastric suction (4.8 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 3.1 days, P = 0.04), and despite central venous nutrition (4/6 vs 1/9 patients, P = 0.02) had significantly lower serum protein (6.0 ±0.7 vs 5.2 ±0.4 g/dl, P=0.02) and albumin (2.7 ±0.3 vs 3.3±0.4g/dl, P= 0.01) when compared to the other group and to the pre-transplant values (P= 0.03). These data suggest that high volume aortic flush induces pancreatic graft injury. Suggestions for improvement are discussed.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent an attractive source for regenerative medicine. However, prior to their application, fundamental questions regarding molecular characterisation, growth and differentiation of MSCs must be resolved. Objectives: To compare and better understand the behaviour of equine MSCs obtained from bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT) in culture. Methods: Five horses were included in this study. Proliferation rate was measured using MTT assay and cell viability; apoptosis, necrosis and late apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of 7 surface marker genes were quantified using RT-qPCR and CD90 was also analysed by flow cytometry. Differentiation was evaluated using specific staining, measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and analysis of the mRNA expression. Results: High interindividual differences were observed in proliferation in both cell types, particularly during the final days. Statistically significant differences in viability and early apoptosis of cultured AT- and BM-MSCs were found. The highest values of early apoptosis were observed during the first days of culture, while the highest percentage of necrosis and late apoptosis and lowest viability was observed in the last days. Surface marker expression pattern observed is in accordance to other studies in horse and other species. Osteogenic differentiation was evident after 7 days, with an increasing of ALP activity and mRNA expression of osteogenic markers. Adipogenic differentiation was achieved in BM-MSCs from 2 donors with one of the 16 media tested. Chondrogenic differentiation was also observed. Conclusions: Proliferation ability is different in AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs. Differences in viability and early apoptosis were observed between both sources and CD34 was only found in AT-MSCs. Differences in their osteogenic and adipogenic potential were detected by staining and quantification of specific tissue markers. Potential relevance: To provide data to better understand AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs behaviour in vitro.

AB  - Focus on the risks of viral transmission via transfusion has pushed recognition of other transfusion risks to the background over the last several decades. With reduction in the risks of HCV and HIV to very low levels (well less than 1/million units), productive attention can now be directed toward other risks. Bacterial contamination of platelets represents the largest morbidity and mortality risk faced by a platelet recipient, and the risk of dieing due to a contaminated unit is at least 10- if not 100-times greater than the chance of HIV transmission. Approximately 1 in every 1?4,000 units of platelets can be shown to contain bacteria, and the frequency of fatality due to port-transfusion sepsis is 14/million units transfused. Bacterial contamination is often not recognized clinically, however, because of the situation of the patient. A variety of techniques to limit and detect bacterial contamination are available for implementation. Culturing is used most widely. Checking pH, glucose concentration or preservation of swirling are simple and inexpensive techniques but suffer from lack of sensitivity. The development of immunologic techniques that can be accomplished rapidly may shift the testing to immediately before issuance for transfusion, a time at which any contamination would be easier to detect because of growth during the storage period. Not only will detection techniques improve transfusion recipient safety, but they can lead to cost-savings through extension of the platelet storage period as has already been implemented in several European countries.
