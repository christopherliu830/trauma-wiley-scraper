AB  - Introduction Electrolyte supplementation prior to exercise is known to benefit both performance and recovery; however its effects on acid-base status remain not well characterized. The purpose of this study was to use the physicochemical approach to provide a comprehensive time-course of the acid-base alterations that occur following pre-exercise electrolyte supplementation in horses. It was hypothesized that electrolyte supplementation will attenuate the alkalosis occurring with prolonged moderate intensity exercise. Methods In a randomized crossover experiment four conditioned mares were given, via nasogastric tube, 3?L of a commercial electrolyte solution (ES; designed to fully replace sweat electrolyte and fluid losses), or water alone (Control), 1 hour before they exercised on a treadmill at 30% VO2max until voluntary fatigue (inability to keep pace with belt speed). Blood was sampled from jugular venous catheters at frequent intervals before, during, and until 20?h of exercise recovery, and analyzed for all dependent and independent plasma acid-base variables. Differences (P<0.05) over time and between groups were assessed by 1- or 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results Horses exercised for 57.5?±?10.3 and 72.5?±?17.0?min and lost 2.73?±?0.82 and 4.63?±?1.35?L in Control and ES trials, respectively. ES horses had lower pCO2 and total carbon dioxide (TCO2) concentrations during exercise and early recovery. Control horses exhibited decreased [H+]. pCO2 was the primary contributor to changes in [H+] and [TCO2], while there were no differences in strong ion difference ([SID]) or total weak acid concentration ([Atot]). Conclusions Electrolyte supplementation prior to prolonged exercise leads to sustained effects on equine acid-base variables, even in the absence of significant changes in plasma electrolytes or hydration.

AB  - Introduction Exercise causes several physiological changes resulting from autonomic and hemodynamic adaptations, but there are few reports about the behaviour of blood pressure (BP) during physical activity in horses, as well as the effect of training on BP. Methods 9 untrained Arabian horses underwent two treadmill evaluations (before and after 90 days of aerobic training at 60% HRmax) at 6% incline with incremental speed increases every 3 minutes (commencing at 2.5?m/s and reaching 12.5?m/s). The facial artery was cannulated with a 20?G catheter and systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were recorded with a multiparameter monitor (GE Dash 3000 model). Data were evaluated by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures and Bonferroni multiple comparison (P<0.05). Results During initial evaluation SBP increased in a gradual and uniform manner as speed increased, reaching a maximum of 208?mmHg at a speed of 10?m/s. After training, SBP behaved similarly during treadmill evaluation, however values were lower until 10?m/s (P<0.001), and the maximum value of SBP obtained was 218?mmHg at 12.5?m/s. DPB was not significantly different (P?=?0.124). MAP emulated the behaviour of SBP (P?=?0.012). Conclusions A decrease in SBP and MAP during identical treadmill evaluations before and after 90 days of aerobic exercise (60% HR max) indicated that training decreased cardiac effort required for the maintenance of physical activity.

AB  - Introduction Cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) has been previously validated in horses. Newer high sensitivity troponin assays have recently become available that are now the standard in human cardiology. The objective was to validate the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T (hscTn-T) assay for use in horses and to determine the biological variation within and between horse breeds. Methods Samples were analysed using the hscTn-T assay reagent (Roche,Cobas c501). Method validation included linearity, lower limit of quantitation (LLQ), freeze-thaw stability, within-and between-run precision, and comparison with cTn-I (Abbott iSTAT, Deming regression). Normal range and biological variation included healthy horses (n?=?120; age?=?7.2?±?0.5 years (SE)) representing 5 breeds. Results Assay was linear from 3?391?ng/L. The LLQ was validated at 3?ng/L. Stability of samples was unaffected by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Within-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?6.50 (±0.97), L2?=?10.1 (±0.88), L3?= 15.3 (±0.82)?ng/L and between-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?12.2 (±1.03), L2?=?57.0 (±4.82), L3?=?256 (±23.1)?ng/L. Comparison with cTn-I assay showed excellent correlation (range: 8?3535?ng/L, r?=?0.9998). Bias was evident in the regression results [hscTnT?=?(0.6153?±?0.002809)*(cTnI*1000)???(11.53?±?5.462)]. The 95th and 99th percentile of the normal distribution in healthy horses was 4 and 6?ng/L. Between breed, diurnal effect and between day variation was not detectable due to low concentrations of hscTnT. Conclusions This study established reference intervals for hscTn-T assay in healthy horses and the performance characteristics of hsTn-T assay in horse samples. Normal population distribution was mostly below the detection limit of the assay. The hscTn-T assay will likely establish the standard in early detection of cardiac pathologies in horses.

AB  - Introduction Increasing cardiac dimension with endurance training is well known in adult athletes. However, adaptation of the heart to training in growing Arabian type horses is less well documented. Methods During the national finals for young endurance horses, standardized echocardiographic examinations were performed before the races by two experienced examiners. In 2011 left ventricle (LV) was assessed in 74 horses aged 4-years (18), 5-years (33) and 6-years (23). In 2012 left atrial (LA) dimensions and the great heart vessels were measured in 122 horses aged 4-years (32), 5-years (40) and 6-years (50). Data were normally distributed; age groups and gender were compared by one-way ANOVA (Holm-Sidak test for multiple comparisons, significance P<0.05); relationships between echocardiographic dimensions and body weight (BWT) were assessed by linear regressions. Results BWT was highest in 5-year old horses. LV dimensions increased with age, but for most measurements the difference was significant only for the group of 6-year old horses. The stroke volume (SV) increased (P?=?0.0016) and the heart rate decreased (P?=?0.06) with increasing age, leading to a constant cardiac output in all age groups. There was a weak relationship between BWT and SV. Two dimensional LA measurements increased between 4 and 5 years but remained constant between 5 and 6 years. LA area measurements and LA functional indices showed no evolution between the groups. Aortic dimension increased with age but pulmonary artery dimension showed no such increase. No influence of gender on echocardiographic dimensions and function could be found. Conclusions Great heart vessels, LA and LV dimensions showed different growth patterns between 4 and 6 years of age.

AB  - Introduction Field exercise tests (FET) can assist design of individualized training programs. Although FETs have been used in other breeds, there are limited reports for Quarter horses (QH) and cross-bred QH which are widely used in traditional Venezuelan equestrian activities. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of an FET in cross-bred Quarter horses in Venezuela. Methods Six horses (3 stallions and 3 mares) performed a FET consisting of a four-step incremental increase in speed (91?±?10; 136?±?3; 271?±?20; 439?±?43?m/min). Each cycle lasted 3 to 5?min with 3 minutes of rest between each. Environmental temperature was 32°C. Heart rate and speed were recorded (Polar Equine RS800CX?) and the speed to reach a heart rate of 200 and 170 beats/min was calculated by linear regression. The rate of heart rate decline was determined 5 minutes after the last step. Linear regression analysis, descriptive statistics and an unpaired t- test (Graph Pad Prism 5.0) were utilized to identify gender differences (P<0.05). Results Gender did not influence the results. V200 and V170 were slightly higher in stallions (617?±?98 and 465?±?66?m/min, respectively) than in mares (511?±?60 and 387?±?60?m/min, respectively). The rate of heart rate decline was slightly more rapid in mares (25?±?7 beats/min) compared to stallions (13?±?5 beats/min). Conclusions Although a low number of horses were evaluated, these preliminary data suggest that gender has limited influence on fitness of cross-bred Quarter horses used in local Venezuelan equestrian activities under tropical environmental conditions. The mean V200 and V170 values obtained were lower than those reported for Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds, but similar to those reported in young racing Quarter horses.

AB  - Introduction During racing, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a major source of energy for muscle contraction. Assessment of muscle OXPHOS capacity by high-resolution respirometry (HRR) might identify animals with altered energy metabolism and consequently increased risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER). Methods Prospective cohort study. Ten healthy French Standardbreds in active training, aged 4?7 years, recruited at the start of a competitive racing season, underwent a standardised field exercise test with determination of speed at onset of lactate accumulation (VLa4) and measurement of serum creatine kinase activity (CK) two hours post-exercise. Triceps brachii muscle microbiopsies were obtained for determination of OXPHOS and electron transfer system (ETS) capacities with HRR. Associations between HRR variables and occurrence of ER over the following four months of racing were analysed using univariate logistic regression. Results Two horses developed ER during the study period: one within one month of recruitment, another presented multiple minor episodes over the season. For these ER horses OXPHOS/ETS ratio was lower, and Complex I/Complex I?+?II ratio and Complex I /Complex II ratio were higher than non-affected horses in the study (perfect prediction of occurrence of ER with ratio of ≤0.74, ≥0.60 and ≥0.715 respectively). VLa4 for ER horses was within the range of non-affected horses. Post-exercise CK was within normal limits for all horses in the study. Conclusions OXPHOS and ETS capacities and their derived ratios indicate dysfunctional muscle energy metabolism whereas VLa4 and CK were unremarkable in horses subsequently affected by ER. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by Liège University's Animal Ethics Committee (agreement N° 07-629); owner informed consent was obtained. Sources of funding:?Part of the study protocol was funded by Les Haras Nationaux (France). Competing interests:?The Oxygraph-2k HRR apparatus was provided on loan by OROBOROS Instruments (Innsbruck, Austria); there are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of meloxicam or tolfenamic acid administered preoperatively and postoperatively (five days in total) to cats undergoing surgical fracture repair. Methods: Eighty-eight otherwise healthy cats were matched according to fracture site and then randomly allocated to one of two groups, receiving 0·2 mg/kg meloxicam by subcutaneous injection (group M) or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg tolfenamic acid orally (group T) before anaesthesia. Analgesia was continued with 0.05 mg/kg oral meloxicam once daily or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg oral tolfenamic acid twice daily for four days postoperatively. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using visual analogue scales and a functional limb score. The drug administrator assessed feed intake and palatability of the treatment. Results: Data from 66 cats were analysed. Visual analogue scale pain scores and functional limb scores decreased over time in both groups but were not significantly different between treatments. Feed intake was similar in both groups. Meloxicam was significantly more palatable than tolfenamic acid on all treatment days. Clinical Significance: Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid demonstrated comparable analgesia, without clinically observable side effects. Meloxicam may be associated with superior compliance in clinical practice due to the higher palatability and once daily treatment resulting in better ease of administration.

AB  - Canine pancreatic tumours are rare compared to human medicine and the detection and differentiation of pancreatic neoplasia is challenging with B-mode ultrasonography, which often leads to late clinical diagnosis and poor prognosis. This case report describes the findings of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in four dogs with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or insulinoma. B-mode ultrasonography of the pancreas revealed a hypoechoic nodule in three dogs and heterogenous tissue in one dog. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was able to differentiate between two tumour types: adenocarcinomas showed hypoechoic and hypovascular lesions, whereas insulinomas showed uniformly hypervascular lesions. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography findings were confirmed by cytology and/or histopathology. The results demonstrated that contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was able to establish different enhancement patterns between exocrine (adenocarcinoma) and endocrine (insulinoma) tumours in dogs.

AB  - Context:? Hypoglycaemia from antihyperglycaemic drugs may have a significant impact on patients? health-related quality of life. Combination use of metformin and a sulphonylurea has become increasingly common; yet, the impact of hypoglycaemia on quality of life in these patients is not well documented. Objective:? To examine patient-reported experience of hypoglycaemia, worry about hypoglycaemic symptoms and the impact of hypoglycaemia on patients? quality of life associated with use of sulphonylurea co-administered with metformin. Design:? This was an observational, cross-sectional, multi-centre study. Setting:? A total of 98 primary care centres in France during October to December 2005. Patients:? A total of 400 patients with type 2 diabetes, who were ≥35?years old and who had been treated with metformin and a sulphonylurea for at least 6?months, completed questionnaires during their usual primary care office visit. Main Outcome Measures:? Frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms in the past 6?months, the Worry subscale of the Hypoglycaemic Fear Survey-II (HFS-II) and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Results:? A total of 136 (34%) patients reported experiencing hypoglycaemia, of whom 78 (58%) experienced mild, 40 (30%) experienced moderate and 16 (12%) experienced severe or very severe symptoms. Mean score on the HFS-II Worry scale was higher for patients who reported having hypoglycaemia than for those who did not (19.0 vs. 10.2; p?<?0.0001) and increased with severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms. In linear regression analyses, more severe symptoms of hypoglycaemia were significantly associated with higher scores on the HFS-II Worry scale (p?=?0.0162) among patients with hypoglycaemic symptoms. Summary scores on the EQ-5D were lower for patients who reported hypoglycaemia than for those who did not (p?=?0.0001) and, in multivariate analysis, the experience of hypoglycaemia was negatively associated with the EQ-5D summary score (p?<?0.0001). Conclusion:? The occurrence and severity of hypoglycaemic symptoms were associated with increased patient worry about hypoglycaemia and lower health-related quality of life among type 2 diabetic patients being treated with both metformin and a sulphonylurea.

AB  - Background Despite a lack of high-quality evidence, the use of ?non-indicated? term labour induction is increasingly restricted throughout the world. Objectives To assess published associations between the regular use of modelled risk-based ?non-indicated? term labour induction (hereinafter ?preventive induction?) and rates of common adverse birth outcomes. Search strategy MEDLINE and PUBMED databases were searched electronically. Selection criteria Studies were identified that compared term birth outcomes following either the current standard approach with its emphasis on the expectant management of intermediate-level risk or the regular use of preventive induction. Data collection and analysis Four studies from four unique databases were identified. A meta-analysis was performed using STATA IC12. Main results Pregnancies exposed to the regular use of preventive induction (n = 1153), as compared with pregnancies receiving the current standard approach (n = 1865), experienced a lower caesarean delivery rate (5.7% versus 14.4%; relative risk 0.39, 95% CI 0.31?0.50; I2 P = 0.21), a lower neonatal intensive care unit admission rate (2.9% versus 6.5%; relative risk 0.45, 95% CI 0.31?0.65; I2 P = 0.57), and a lower weighted adverse outcome index score (2.8 versus 6.1). Conclusions The regular use of preventive induction, as compared with the current standard approach, was associated with a more favourable pattern of birth outcomes. Other recently published meta-analyses have also determined that certain types of ?non-indicated? labour induction are beneficial. Accordingly, the current broad restrictions on ?non-indicated? labour induction should be reconsidered. Adequately powered multi-site randomised clinical trials are needed to definitively study the risks and benefits of modelled risk-based ?non-indicated? (i.e. ?preventive?) term labour induction.

AB  - Introduction The use of complementary therapies in both humans and animals has grown over the past decade. Equine back problems are more frequently reported as a contributing factor to poor performance, and back dysfunction affects limb kinematics. This study aimed to determine if (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment has an effect on the range of motion (ROM) of the carpus and tarsus. Methods Hemispherical 35?mm markers were applied to 7 anatomical landmarks of both forelimbs and hindlimbs of 10 sound, healthy horses from the same riding school with similar workload. The treatment group (n?=?5) received (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment for the neck, back, pelvis and front feet. Two digital video recorders set 5.5?m from subjects, filming both sides concurrently, collected 2-D kinematic data at walk and trot, 1 day before, and 2?hrs and 7 days after treatment. Data was analysed using Kinovea software, minimum and maximum joint angles were measured and ROM calculated. Statistical analyses included two-way ANOVA, Student's t-test and symmetry indices. Results A significant increase in right-side ROM for carpus at walk (+4.0?deg, p?=?0.04) and trot (+5.2?deg, p?=?0.02) was noted in the treated compared to the non-treated group. For the treatment group, there was a significant change in carpus ROM asymmetry from left towards neutral at walk (P?=?0.004) and trot (P?=?0.04). Tarsus ROM asymmetry change from left towards neutral was significant (P?=?0.02) at trot. No changes were observed in the control group. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment may improve the symmetry of tarsus and carpus ROM of horses. Further research is needed to assess the clinical relevance of these effects. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were reviewed by the McTimoney Chiropractic College Ethical Review Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?none. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Introduction Racetrack surface type has been shown to affect horse injury rates, limb kinematics, and ground reaction forces. Understanding hoof-surface interactions may direct surface design to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal injury. Hoof accelerations have been recorded at the trot on different surfaces. This study extends these analyses to racing gallop with quantified surface properties. Methods Left fore-hoof accelerations (triaxial, ±?500?g, 1000?Hz) were collected during gallop (10?16?m/s, 5 Thoroughbred racehorses) on dirt and synthetic surfaces of known shear strengths (shear vane). Accelerometric vectors were filtered (5th order Butterworth, stance 85?Hz, swing 30?Hz). Peak accelerations and stance phase durations (limb preparation, hoof landing {heel-strike and slide}, support, and grab) were compared using a mixed model analysis of covariance with surface, lead, stride frequency, and interaction fixed effects, and horse random effect. Results Peak dorsopalmar accelerations were 40% greater during landing on the synthetic surface (P?=?0.06). Grab phase was 32% shorter on the synthetic surface (P?=?0.02), with 34% less dorsopalmar impulse/mass (P<0.01). Previously reported failure shear stress of the synthetic surface was 20% greater, compared to dirt (normal stress >400?kN/m2, equivalent to trotting racehorse). Conclusions Dorsopalmar hoof accelerations were greater on the surface with greater shear strength (synthetic). The finding that accelerations were greater on the synthetic surface compared to dirt is in contrast to that of trotting horses on all-weather waxed and crushed sand surfaces. This discrepancy may be due to differences in horse gait, but also large variability in surfaces. Consequently, it is important to quantify surface behaviors to understand the effect of surface design and maintenance on limb biomechanics and propensity for injury.

AB  - Introduction Weighted boots and unnaturally high and long hooves (SH) are used to improve the 4-beat rhythm of the tölt and enhance forelimb action. Methods The effect of these methods on loading and movement of the limbs was investigated in thirteen Icelandic horses at walk, tölt and trot on an instrumented treadmill. Vertical ground reaction forces and kinematic data of fore- and hindlimbs were measured. Four conditions were differentiated: SN (standard shoeing) and SH, without and with weighted boots of 240?g (WB240), respectively. Differences were tested using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, separately for each gait (P<0.05). Results At the tölt, in both shoeing styles, WB240 increased protraction height of the forelimbs by about 13%. The weight gain of 273?g at the distal limb induced by changing SN to SH had a similar and cumulative effect. Hoof length alone was also positively, but not significantly, associated with protraction height; the combination of SH and WB240 resulted in an increase of up to 35%. Lateral coupling (pace-like rhythm) in tölt was reduced only with a combination of SH and WB240. Stride impulse increased with a change of hoof conformation alone at tölt, and combined with weight at all three gaits. Shorter relative stance durations in the forelimbs particularly at faster speeds resulted only in a minor increase of peak forces (+1.4%) due to an impulse shift to the hindlimbs. Conclusions Weight, particularly in combination with SH, improved gait performance and marginally increased limb peak forces. However, enhanced inertial forces during swing might additionally stress internal distal limb structures.

AB  - Introduction Showjumping (SJ) horses are at increased risk of distal forelimb soft tissue injuries; generally attributed to limb loading on landing. This study investigated relationships between the back, trailing limb angles at take-off, in flight and at landing. Methods Eight showjumpers jumped a 140?cm vertical obstacle (part of a 15-fence course). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to measure limb and regional back kinematics in the dorsoventral plane from markers placed at predetermined locations. Pearson's correlation tests were used to determine associations between limb and back angles at take-off, in flight and upon landing. Results All markers were clearly visible throughout. Greater head-neck ventroflexion at take-off was associated with decreased hock flexion (r?=?-0.81, P?=?0.0141), and decreased neck-trunk angle on landing (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.03). Greater head-neck ventroflexion at landing, 50% and 75% flight was associated with decreased carpal extension on landing (r?=?0.81, 0.84, 0.73; P?=?0.02, 0.01, 0.04 respectively). Increased thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off was associated with decreased metatarsophalangeal joint extension upon landing (r?=?0.78, 0.75; P?=?0.03). Greater lumbosacral flexion at 50 and 75% flight (r?=?-0.73, ?0.77; P?=?0.04, 0.03 respectively) and greater thoracolumbar flexion at 25, 50 and 75% flight was associated with decreased elbow flexion on landing (r?=?-0.87, ?0.78, ?0.76; P?=?0.01, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). Conclusions Decreasing head-neck angle and increasing thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off and in flight appeared to alter peak joint flexion and extension on landing. This suggests that optimising jumping technique in training may be beneficial to reduce the strain placed on the limbs at landing, which could potentially be valuable given the risk of distal limb soft tissue injuries in SJ horses.

AB  - Introduction Water treadmill exercise is used for rehabilitating horses with back dysfunction, yet little is known about the effect of this type of exercise on back movement. Methods 8 horses walked in water level with the hoof, fetlock, hock and stifle. Reflective markers over the dorsal spinous processes of T6, T10, T13, T18, L3, L5 and S3 and left and right tuber coxae were used to measure flexion-extension range of movement (F-E ROM) around T10, T13, T18, L3 and L5, vertical displacement of the pelvis (Pelvic ROM) and vertical distance between T13 and L5 (lowest and highest point of the back). 3D coordinates were tracked using ProReflex cameras. 5?9 strides were analysed for each horse at each water height. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc tests were used to determine differences in measured variables between water heights (P < 0.05). Results Peak flexion of T10, T13, T18 and L3 occurred in hock height water. Peak extension of T18, L3 and L5 occurred in stifle height water without a significant difference in F-E ROM between water heights (P>0.05). Pelvic ROM was greatest in stifle height water, with no significant difference between water heights. The vertical distance between T13 and L5 was greatest in stifle height water (P<0.05 between hoof and hock height water) as a result of an elevation of L5 relative to T13. Conclusions As water height increases L5 is elevated relative to T13, increasing the tendency for extension of the thoracolumbar spine. To maximise thoracolumbar flexion and avoid extension, water at hock height is more beneficial then stifle height water.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to describe the response in heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, hematocrit and plasma lactate concentration in Icelandic horses performing the riding assessment in an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) in Iceland (April 2011). It was hypothesized that the riding assessment constituted high intensity exercise. Methods Data was collected from 15 of 28 horses shown at the BEFT. Horses were judged for riding abilities (all gaits) on a straight track. Respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein before the warm-up and within 5?min after the riding assessment. Hematocrit was analysed by centrifugation of capillary tubes and plasma lactate concentration using an enzymatic and spectrophotometric method. Velocity, distance and heart rate were recorded (Polar, Kempele, Finland) during the riding assessment. Anova (Proc GLM) was performed in SAS and data is presented as LSMean ±?SE (P<0.05). Results The distance covered was 2.7?±?0.1?km, the duration 9:13?±?0:21?min?:?sec and the average speed 17.5?±?0.3?km/h. The peak heart rate was 214?±?3?bpm. Post-exercise plasma lactate concentration was 18.6?±?1.7?mmol/L and there was an increase (P<0.001) in respiratory rate (40?±?6 to 118?±?6 breaths/min), rectal temperature (38.1?±?0.1 to 39.8?±?0.1°C) and hematocrit (35?±?2 to 47?±?2%) following the breed evaluation field test. Conclusions The physiological responses indicate that the riding assessment in BEFT is a demanding exercise, requiring some contribution of anaerobic metabolism.

AB  - Introduction The Accutrend? Lactate (formerly Accusport?) is a low cost point-of-care L-lactate analyser. The analyser is widely used in the training of horses and has been used for research studies and to assist the clinical management of critically ill horses. The analyser is reported to be linear from 0.8?22.0?mmol/L (blood) and 0.7?26.0?mmol/L (plasma); however, test performance at high L-lactate concentrations in equine blood and plasma has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer over a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in paired blood and plasma samples. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected from 8 trained Standardbreds before, during, and after a simulated race on a treadmill into 4?mL partially evacuated tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were measured using a colorimetric lactate-oxidase mediated reaction (BM-Lactate? test strips and Accutrend? Lactate) and the reference enzymatic method (L-lactic dehydrogenase spectrophotometry at 340?nm using samples deproteinized with 8% perchloric acid). Data was analysed using Deming regression and Bland-Altman plots adjusted for repeated measures (P<0.05). Results The reference method measured a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in 128 blood (0.2?23.8?mmol/L) and 127 plasma (0.3?41.1?mmol/L) samples. The Accutrend? Lactate analyzer provided an accurate method of L-lactate measurement, but only when blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were <12.5?mmol/L (79% of samples) and <15.0?mmol/L (64% of samples), respectively. Conclusions Blood L-lactate concentrations >12.5?mmol/L and plasma L-lactate concentrations >15.0?mmol/L measured by the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer underestimate the true value by a variable amount when compared with the enzymatic reference method.

AB  - Introduction During canter and gallop most horses maintain a locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC) ratio of one breath every stride. Occasional big respiratory cycles (BRC) are described when a single breath is taken over two strides. This is considered a transient but normal feature of ventilation. However, a change to a more persistent 2:1 LRC ratio is considered to be ?abnormal?. It has been suggested that upper respiratory tract (URT) disorders could result in a horse adopting an abnormal breathing pattern, although current information is limited. Methods Simultaneous audio and URT endoscopy recordings from 365 horses referred for treadmill evaluation were analysed. Breathing pattern at canter and gallop was categorised at each one minute speed step: Normal: 1:1 with <2 BRC Normal: 1:1 with 2 BRC Abnormal: breathing pattern disrupted by repetitive and frequent BRC's Abnormal: alternating between periods of 2:1 and 1:1 Abnormal: 2:1 throughout Data analysis was performed using PASW 18.0. A chi-square test was used to identify associations between breathing pattern and presence of URT obstructions. Results During the entire exercise test 30% of horses had an abnormal breathing pattern at canter or gallop, of which 23% had a 2:1 breathing pattern. The prevalence of abnormal breathing patterns was higher at low canter speeds than during strenuous exercise. There was a significant association between breathing pattern during strenuous exercise and the presence of an URT obstruction (P?=?0.008). Conclusions Loss of a 1:1 LRC ratio during canter and gallop is more common than previously realised and may be associated with dynamic URT obstructions.

AB  - Introduction Chuckwagon racing involves 4 Thoroughbred horses pulling a 600?kg wagon through a figure-8 pattern and running a 1000?m dash. Horses can race four days in a row and there are concerns regarding the contribution of cumulative racing to electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and sudden death, and its impact on recovery. The objective was to investigate the effects of cumulative racing on plasma electrolytes, lactate and prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias. Methods 148 horses (9.0?±?2.7 years) from 13 teams were monitored for heart rate and ECG activity on racing days 1 and 2. Differences in plasma electrolytes, pH and lactate (pre-vs. post-exercise and between days) were analysed (paired t-test). Associations between electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing and recovery (Pearson correlation) were examined. Results 377 ECGs (82 incomplete due to lost electrode) and 750 plasma samples (374 pre, 376 post) were analysed. 4235 arrhythmic events (21.6% warm-up, 37.6% racing, 20.4% recovery) were recorded and were not different between days 1 and 2. They mainly comprised supraventricular premature contractions during warm-up and racing (48% and 81.4% respectively) and ventricular premature contractions during recovery (29.2%). A significant association was found between post-exercise electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing (P<0.001, r?=?0.17). Consecutive racing significantly increased post-exercise lactate on day 2 (P<0.001). Pre-exercise pH and electrolytes were significantly different on day 2. Conclusions An association exists between post-exercise electrolytes and occurrence of arrhythmias during consecutive racing, however it is of little clinical significance. Ventricular arrhythmias are as prevalent in chuckwagon horses as in other disciplines. Overall, repetitive racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction There are no published studies that characterize the different myofiber types of Mangalarga (ML) horses and hybrids. This study aimed to characterize and compare muscle fibers of the gluteus medius of ML mares and young and inactive mules resulting from the breeding of these mares with a Brazilian donkey. Methods Percutaneous biopsies were performed in 11 mares and their foals (10 mules), at a depth of 60?mm. Fiber types were determined by comparing identical images using both the staining techniques of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR). Stains for mATPase were pre-incubated in acid medium followed by alkaline incubation. The frequency (F%) and relative total area (RTA%) of fiber types I, IIA and IIX were analysed. The cross-sectional area (CSA, ?m2) was quantified by the NADH-TR technique. The means were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results The frequency of type IIA fibers was greater than types I and IIX. Type IIX fibers had higher CSA than I and IIA. The RTA of type IIX fibers was greater than type IIA fibers followed by type I. The higher RTA value of IIX fibers resulted from higher CSA. There was no difference between the variables for mares compared to the mules. Conclusions ML mares and mules that resulted from breeding with the Brazilian donkey have a high prevalence of type IIA fibers in the gluteus medius. This fatigue-resistant fiber uses both metabolic pathways, glycolytic and oxidative, to obtain energy during muscle contraction, thus giving the ML mares and mules good performance in horseback riding, marching contests and endurance rides.
