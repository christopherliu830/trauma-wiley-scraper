AB  - Objectives To describe the use, effectiveness and tolerance of high-flow oxygen therapy in dyspnoeic dogs. Materials and Methods Prospectively, dogs in acute respiratory distress admitted to an intensive care unit between January and May 2018 that failed to respond to nasal oxygen therapy and medical stabilisation after 30?minutes were transitioned to high-flow oxygen therapy. High-flow oxygen therapy, delivered an inspired oxygen fraction of 100% using an air/oxygen blender, active humidifier, single warmed tube and specific nasal cannula. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate and a tolerance score were assessed every 15?minutes from T0 (under nasal oxygen) to 1 hour (T60), and PaO2 and PaCO2 at T0 and T60. Complications were recorded for each dog. Results Eleven dogs were included. At T60, PaO2, flow rate and SpO2 were significantly greater than at T0 (171?±?123 versus 73?±?24?mmHg; P=0.015; 18?±12?L/minute versus 3.2?±?2.0 L/minute, P<0.01; 97.7?±2.3% versus 91.6?±7.2%, P=0.03, respectively). There was no significant difference in PaCO2, respiratory rate or heart rate between T0 and T60. Tolerance was excellent, and there were no complications. Clinical Significance High-flow oxygen therapy improves markers of oxygenation in dyspnoeic dogs and is an effective means to deliver oxygen with comfort and minimal complications.

AB  - Background Despite a lack of high-quality evidence, the use of ?non-indicated? term labour induction is increasingly restricted throughout the world. Objectives To assess published associations between the regular use of modelled risk-based ?non-indicated? term labour induction (hereinafter ?preventive induction?) and rates of common adverse birth outcomes. Search strategy MEDLINE and PUBMED databases were searched electronically. Selection criteria Studies were identified that compared term birth outcomes following either the current standard approach with its emphasis on the expectant management of intermediate-level risk or the regular use of preventive induction. Data collection and analysis Four studies from four unique databases were identified. A meta-analysis was performed using STATA IC12. Main results Pregnancies exposed to the regular use of preventive induction (n = 1153), as compared with pregnancies receiving the current standard approach (n = 1865), experienced a lower caesarean delivery rate (5.7% versus 14.4%; relative risk 0.39, 95% CI 0.31?0.50; I2 P = 0.21), a lower neonatal intensive care unit admission rate (2.9% versus 6.5%; relative risk 0.45, 95% CI 0.31?0.65; I2 P = 0.57), and a lower weighted adverse outcome index score (2.8 versus 6.1). Conclusions The regular use of preventive induction, as compared with the current standard approach, was associated with a more favourable pattern of birth outcomes. Other recently published meta-analyses have also determined that certain types of ?non-indicated? labour induction are beneficial. Accordingly, the current broad restrictions on ?non-indicated? labour induction should be reconsidered. Adequately powered multi-site randomised clinical trials are needed to definitively study the risks and benefits of modelled risk-based ?non-indicated? (i.e. ?preventive?) term labour induction.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered to Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses to reduce the incidence and severity of EIPH. The magnitude and duration of mineral loss following furosemide administration has not previously been measured in horses. Methods Six fit Thoroughbreds (age 6.8?±?1.2?y; bwt 585?±?19?kg) were used in a 3?x?3 Latin square design trial to measure the effect of furosemide on urinary and fecal mineral excretion for 24?h before (?24?h) and 24?h, 48?h and 72?h after a standardized exercise test (SET) on an inclined (3o) high speed treadmill. The treatment groups consisted of an untreated control (C) and two groups (F and FE) which received furosemide (0.5?mg/kg, IV) 4?h before the SET. C and F were fed 60?g/d NaCl and (FE) was fed 200?g/d of an electrolyte mix (14?g?K, 37.7?g?Na and 43.3?g?Cl) for 21 days before the SET. Following the SET the FE group was supplemented with an additional 10?g/d?Ca and 10?g/d?Mg. Results Urinary Ca, P, Na and Cl excretion increased 24?h post treatment in the F and FE groups (P<0.05). 72?h?Ca and Cl balance was decreased in F (P<0.05) and 72?h?Mg and Cl balance was decreased in FE (P<0.05). The digestibility of P and Mg was decreased in FE (P<0.05) and Na digestibility was increased in F and FE (P<0.05). Conclusions A single dose of furosemide negatively affected calcium balance in horses for 72?h post administration. Further research is needed to assess the effect of chronic furosemide use in racehorses on mineral balance and soundness.

AB  - Introduction This study aimed to investigate the possibility of obtaining the beginning and end of stance from a girth-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), by comparing data from the IMU with data from an opto-electronic system. Methods 15 horses were trotted on a treadmill, with markers on hooves and a Girth Marker (GM) on a wireless IMU over the sternum. Proreflex cameras collected 3D marker data. T-tests and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to decipher any difference between diagonally paired limbs; GM and hoof markers; and GM and IMU, the limits of agreement of which were also assessed using a Bland Altman method. Results Timings of diagonally-coupled limbs were not significantly different at beginning (P?=?0.77 and 0.95), or end of stance (P?= 0.60 and 0.46) for right or left diagonal respectively. The diagonal in stance was identifiable from GM y position, with which IMU derived position had 97%, and IMU roll 100% agreement. Stance according to hoof markers did not differ significantly from GM z acceleration at beginning (P?= 0.49?±?0.01, P?= 0.92?±?0.007), or GM z velocity at end (P?= 0.84?±?0.007, P?= 0.83?±?0.007), in right or left diagonal respectively. A strong correlation was seen between beginning and end of stance according to GM and IMU events (each R2>0.99). Relationships between IMU and GM amplitudes were less convincing, with a significant difference at peak acceleration (P<0.05, Standard Deviation?=?2.70?m/s/s, ULOA?=?5.93, LLOA?=??4.66). Conclusions A girth-based IMU can identify temporal stride characteristics in trot on a treadmill, but inferences from amplitude data should be treated with caution until further investigated.

AB  - Introduction Kissing Spines Syndrome (KSS) represents a major challenge in equine practice. Radiographic examination of dorsal spinous processes (DSP) is therefore often included in sale and insurance cases and in diagnosis of back problems. Measurement of interspinous spaces (ISS) on radiographs is often used when evaluating DSPs. Radiographic examination of the equine back usually consists of two to four images causing beam angle differences between the image center and image borders. In addition, radiographs are 2D representations of 3D structures causing superimposition of anatomical structures. The aim of this study was to investigate if x-ray beam angle and superimposition affect radiographic evaluation of ISSs. Methods Beam angle effect was investigated using latero-lateral radiographs of the thoracic DSPs. Importance of superimposition of anatomical structures was investigated by comparing radiographic measurements with measurements in comparable CT and MR images. Cadaver backs from six horses were included. Four had a diagnosis of KSS, while two were considered normal. Backs were placed in an upright position on a flat surface for all images. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model with a single random factor, ISS. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results X-ray beam angle significantly influenced measurement of ISS (P<0.02) with differences of up to 2?mm, when measured three positions apart. ISS widths measured in radiographs were significantly lower than in comparable CT (P<0.0001) and MR (P<0.0001) images with differences of up to 3?mm. Conclusions These findings suggest that radiographic assessment may result in incorrect evaluation of ISSs. Ethical Animal Research Cadaver material was included in the study with signed consent from the horse owners.

AB  - Introduction The equestrian arenas at the 2012 Olympic Games were constructed on a unique raised platform. Arena surfaces can be implicated in risk of injury and affect performance, therefore functional properties were examined to ensure preparation was appropriate for this unusual construction. The objective of this work was to assess surface hardness, load carrying capacity and uniformity during the development of a suitable surface for the 2012 Olympic Games. Data were compared from the Olympic site at a test event in 2011, pre-London 2012 and from developmental test arenas on and off a raised platform. Methods In-situ systematic sampling was used across arenas. A biomechanical surface tester quantified load carrying capacity (peak load), a Clegg impact hammer was used to assess hardness (peak deceleration) and moisture data were analysed in the laboratory. Contour maps and GLMs (applying the arena's structural features as explanatory variables where appropriate) were used to highlight surface heterogeneity. Results Significant variation in peak deceleration across the surface was detected at the test event in 2011 (P<0.0001). Peak load (P<0.0001) and peak deceleration (P<0.0001) were higher pre-London 2012, partly due to enhanced stiffness of the base layer. Higher moisture content found pre-London 2012 (P<0.001) was considered beneficial for surface consolidation. There was no significant difference between data collected on or off a raised platform following the developmental work. Results highlight the importance of effective water management and sub-surface construction. Conclusions Findings from this work guided decisions made by the surface providers for the 2012 Olympic Games and advanced understanding of methods most appropriate for assessing arenas in-situ.

AB  - Introduction Degenerative changes in sacroiliac joints (SIJ) are reported to cause poor performance in horses. The aim of this study was to document the frequency and nature of changes in SIJ surfaces of Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses and to correlate gross morphology and marginal new bone formation to age, body weight and history of back pain. Methods SIJ surfaces from 37 deceased TBs retired from the Hong Kong Jockey Club were photographed and measurements taken to facilitate subjective and objective analysis of gross changes. SIJ surfaces were described, and the surface area of the joint surfaces determined from the photographs, using Image J. Area and shape of the joint surfaces were recorded and SIJs were graded and allocated a type according to pre-determined criteria. Changes were compared for horses with and without clinical records of back pain. Results Mean age was 6.6?±?2.3 years; weight 494?±?35?kg; with no differences between horses with (n?=?14) and without (n?=?23) a history of back pain. There was no relationship between bodyweight (r?=?0.08) or age (r?=?0.13) and SIJ surface area. SIJs of the back pain group were affected by obvious gross pathology that showed certain characteristics. There was a relationship between surface area of joint and degree of marginal bone formation (P<0.001). SIJs from the group of TBs with no back pain had fewer and less obvious gross findings. Conclusions Clinical evidence of back pain, which may reasonably be expected to have affected the horse's racing performance, was associated with characteristic gross pathology of the SIJ.

AB  - Introduction Tail deviation in horses is anecdotally viewed as an indicator of lameness. Compensatory mechanisms in lame horses are well documented, however there is no information published on the relationship between lameness and tail carriage in horses. The objectives of this study were to quantify differences in tail carriage in relation to the type of lameness (front/hind, left/right) and to establish a relationship with confounding variables. Methods Videos of 150 horses presented for lameness examination were evaluated. Tail carriage angles were measured in 50 horses and subjectively assessed using a categorical 4-point scale in 100 horses. Lame leg(s), lameness score(s), age, sex, breed, duration and cause of lameness were recorded. Differences in tail carriage between lameness types were assessed using paired T-tests (continuous data) or chi-square tests (categorical data). Logistic regression evaluated the effect of degree and duration of lameness, and age on degree of tail deviation. Results 87.2% of the horses showed some degree of tail deviation. The mean?±?SD tail angle was 92?±?14.5° (90°?=?midsagittal) for forelimb and 87?±?11.2° for hindlimb lameness. The mean?±?SD tail angle was 91.1?±?17.3° for right-sided and 89.5?±?16.9° for left forelimb lameness; 89.8°?±?8.8 for right and 86.5°±?9.8 for left hindlimb lameness with no statistically significant difference between front/hind (P?=?0.52) or left/right lameness (P?=?0.237). No statistically significant correlation was found between degree and duration of lameness, age of horse and presence or degree of tail deviation. Conclusions No significant relationship between tail carriage and lameness was identified in this study and tail carriage should therefore not be considered an indicator for lameness.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred racehorses often experience periods of detraining due to locomotor disorders and subsequent rehabilitation. We hypothesised that regularly exercising horses at different intensities during a period of detraining would differentially maintain their cardiopulmonary and O2 transport capacities. Methods Twenty-seven Thoroughbred horses trained for 18 weeks then underwent 12 weeks of detraining according to one of three protocols: 1) cantering at 70% maximal rate of O2 consumption (VO2max) for 3?min/d for 5?d/wk (C group), 2) walking for 1?h/d for 5?d/wk (W group) and 3) stall rest (S group). Standardised treadmill exercise tests were performed before and after detraining during which cardiopulmonary and O2 transport variables were measured. Data were analysed with two-way ANOVA and pairwise comparisons made with Tukey's test. Significance was defined as P≤0.05. Results Mass-specific VO2max, maximal cardiac output and maximal stroke volume of all groups decreased after detraining with no differences between groups. The run time to exhaustion, speed eliciting VO2max, speed eliciting maximal heart rate and speed at which plasma lactate concentration reached 4?mmol/l of the C group did not change but those of the W and S groups decreased after detraining. Arterial-(mixed-venous) O2 concentration difference did not change after detraining in any group, and maximal heart rate decreased in the W and S groups. Conclusions These results suggest it may be possible to identify a minimum threshold exercise intensity or protocol during detraining in horses that maintains significant elements of performance-related variables and minimises reductions in O2 transport capacity.

AB  - Introduction Muscle conformation is often discussed among practitioners and it is sometimes suggested that specific training strategies affect muscle conformation. This study attempted to investigate; 1) if it is possible for practitioners to judge whether a horse is subjected to pace training or not based on subjective analysis of hind-end muscle conformation and 2) which terminology practitioners would use when doing this. Methods Photos were taken from behind (transverse plane) in 10 Icelandic horses trained for mounted pace racing and 11 used for riding but not pacing. Body condition score was 7.4 and 7.5 (SE 0.3, P>0.05) in pacers and non-pacers, respectively (9 degree scale, ANOVA, Tukey test). Three experienced horse practitioners (A, B, C) were informed that the 21 photos showed horses trained for pace racing and horses not trained as pacers and they were instructed to separate photos into two groups based on their subjective impression of muscle conformation. Results Practitioner A divided horses into groups called ?even? (n?=?13) and ?narrow? (n?=?8); B into groups called ?strong? (n?=?11) and ?weak? (n?=?10); and C into ?high? (n?=?9) and ?wedged? ? (n?=?12). The practitioners assumed that ?even?, ?strong? and ?high? horses were pacers and 10, 10 and 12 observations were correct in practitioner A, B and C, respectively (mean?±?SD: 51?±?5%). The number of cases where all practitioners agreed and grouping also matched pacers and non-pacers were 7. Conclusions It appears not to be possible to judge whether an Icelandic horse is pace trained based on observations of the hind-end musculature. The terminology used appeared to refer either to the conformation or to a presumed strength. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Introduction Fatalities are recognized as a consequence of prolonged endurance exercise but data documenting incidence and causes is limited. Methods Numbers of horse starts and fatalities were obtained from the American Endurance Ride Conference (AERC) website (www.aerc.org) and further details about fatalities were obtained from horse owners and attending veterinarians. Annual incidence rates were calculated and odds ratios for region and ride length were determined. Results From 2002?2013 there were 252,738 horse starts in AERC sanctioned rides and 67 fatalities attributable to the demands of endurance exercise were documented. 46/67 horses were eliminated while 21 successfully completed the ride and were deemed fit to continue. Thirteen horses died while euthanasia was performed in the remaining 54 instances, and 51% had necropsy examinations performed. 81% of the fatalities developed acute abdominal pain and necropsy findings included gastric rupture in 12%. Fatalities were also related to financial constraints as 28% of riders declined fluid therapy, referral to surgical facilities, and/or surgery when recommended. Horses competing in the Central and Midwest regions appeared at lesser risk, while those in the Southwest and Northeast regions appeared at greater risk, but low numbers of fatalities precluded reaching statistical significance. In contrast, the risk of fatality was 2 (1 fatality per 3,711 starts) and 12 (1 fatality per 648 starts) times more likely for participation in 80 and 160?km rides, as compared to competition in Limited Distance (40 to 56?km) rides (1 fatality per 8,057 starts). Conclusions Overall fatality rates were low; however, risk increased with ride distance. Acute abdominal pain was the most common clinical presentation.

AB  - Introduction Human athletes have been characterized as either ?good drinkers? or ?poor drinkers? on the basis of voluntary water intake during and after endurance exercise. Similarly, riders of endurance horses have described some horses to be better drinkers than others; however, there are no data in horses to substantiate these claims. Methods Voluntary fluid intake (FI) by twenty four 2-year-old Arabian horses that performed 45?60?km of treadmill exercise in four experiments was recorded. All horses were raised similarly and had no training except a 12 week conditioning period before each experiment. Mean FI intake (each horse performed three or four exercise tests in each experiment) was subjected to cluster analysis to separate horses into poor, average, and excellent drinking groups. FI was also correlated to body weight (BW) loss at the end of the exercise test. Results Cluster analysis separated horses into poor drinkers (n?=?10, FI 8.7?±?0.7 liters and BW loss of 2.2?±?0.4%); average drinkers (n?=?11, FI 14.1?±?0.6 liters and BW loss of 1.8?±?0.2%); and excellent drinkers (n?=?3, FI 24.9?±?0.2 liters and BW loss of 0.7?±?0.3%). FI was inversely correlated with BW loss (R values between ?0.53 and ?0.87 for all four experiments, P<0.01). Conclusions These data, in groups of young, similarly trained horses, are the first to support that there are innate differences in voluntary drinking during and after endurance exercise in this species.

AB  - Introduction Continuous monitoring of core body temperature may provide useful information about the thermal response to metabolic heat load and environmental challenges. The aim of this study was to evaluate a telemetric gastrointestinal (GI) pill (Equivital?) measuring gastrointestinal temperature (GT) during endurance exercise. It was hypothesised that a temperature and metabolic heat profile could be established. Methods The GI pill was administered to 6 horses by nasogastric tube (n?=?3) or modified-drench gun (n?=?3), the day before competition. During competition, GT, skin temperature and heart rate (HR) were recorded (by Equivital? belt). Other data collected included body weight and rectal temperature (RT), GPS/HR monitor information, and environmental conditions using a data logger. Metabolic heat production was calculated [1] and GT correlations were explored using simple correlation estimates (P<0.05). Results Data were collected from 6 horses during 80?km (n?=?4 horses) and 100?km (n?=?2) competition days with mean data loss of 7.4% (±2.4%). GT profiles showed increasing temperature with cumulative metabolic heat production, and time to reach maximum GT was 2.14?6.29?h (maximum GT range: 38.4?39.5°C). During exercise (7?h 6?min?±?1?h 3?min duration), mean and maximum speeds ranged from 10.1?14.5?km/h and 23.5?30.8?km/h, respectively. No correlation was found between GT and HR, skin, or environment temperature. Maximum GT increased with bodyweight (r?=?0.775, P?=?0.08). GT was systematically higher than RT (mean difference +0.46°C). Conclusions GT was recorded successfully during competition with minimal data loss. The GI pill has great potential as a method to further investigate thermoregulation in horses under field conditions.

AB  - Introduction Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytology is a major diagnostic method for detecting exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) and inflammatory airway disease (IAD) in racehorses. Our hypothesis was that training and racing would increase the incidence of IAD and EIPH. Methods On three different occasions (day-1, ?30 and ?60), BAL fluid was obtained from both lungs of 14 Standardbred trotters with similar age and training level. Cytological inclusion criteria were neutrophils >10%, and/or mast cells ≥5%, and/or eosinophils ≥5% for IAD, and haemosiderophage/macrophage (H/M) ratio >20% for EIPH. Since previously found not to be equivalent, both samples from each horse were independently investigated. Horse status (?IAD?,?EIPH?, ?mixed?, or ?control?) at each time point was based on cytological profiles from both lungs. Cell proportions were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Haemosiderophage proportions and H/M were significantly higher on day-60 compared to day-1. No significant difference was observed for other cell proportions. On day-1, 5 horses were ?control?, 2 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-30, 3 horses were ?control?, 4 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH?, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-60, 3 horses were ?control?, 0 ?IAD?, 3 ?EIPH?, and 8 ?mixed?. Despite the different horses? distribution within each category, an overall increase in EIPH was observed. Five of the 7 horses classified ?control? or ?IAD? on day-1 presented EIPH on day-30 and/or ?60. EIPH was detected in 11/14 horses (78.6%) on day-60, versus 7/14 horses (50%) on day-1. Conclusions The incidence of EIPH, but not IAD, significantly increased during a racing season. This evolution should be considered when assessing BAL fluid cytology in racehorses.

AB  - Introduction It has been debated which airway sampling method, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspirate (TA), is superior in evaluating equine respiratory disease. Most studies suggest BAL is the best sampling method due to better correlation with lung histopathology. In this study we compared BAL and TA results of athletic non-Thoroughbred horses with chronic respiratory signs or exercise intolerance during 2009?2013. Methods 64 horses, 2?25 years of age (16 Coldbloods, 30 Warmbloods, 11 Standardbreds, 7 ponies) with recurrent or chronic (duration >1 month) respiratory signs or exercise intolerance that were subject to both BAL and TA sampling at rest were included. Neutrophil counts >5% in BAL and >20% in TA were considered abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results Both BAL and TA were abnormal in 29 horses and normal in 26 horses. 7 horses had only abnormal TA and 2 horses only abnormal BAL. Correlation was found between the amount of mucus in the trachea and both BAL (P?=?0.002) and TA (P<0.001) neutrophil percentage. Neutrophil (P<0.001), eosinophil (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P?=?0.008) and macrophage (P?=?0.004) percentages correlated between BAL and TA. Conclusions In our university hospital population, mucus in the trachea was a good indicator of airway neutrophilia. Unlike previous studies, in only 14% of the horses the interpretation of BAL and TA result was different with TA being slightly more sensitive at detecting neutrophilia. However, a gold standard for detecting inflammation in the equine airways is still lacking and the type and severity of the disease may greatly influence the best choice of sampling method.

AB  - Introduction There are few refereed blinded controlled documentations of skeletal analgesic efficacy of firocoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. The objective was to test the hypotheses that intravenous firocoxib and phenylbutazone are comparable in efficacy and that both are more efficacious in alleviating lameness than placebo in an adjustable heart bar shoe model of equine foot pain. Methods Eight healthy adult horses (5 Thoroughbreds, 3 Quarter horses, mean age 8.3?±?0.9 years, age range 4?13 years) underwent weekly intravenous treatments 1 hour after lameness induction. Treatments were isotonic saline placebo (1?ml/45?kg body weight), phenylbutazone (4.4?mg/kg), and firocoxib (label dosage 0.09?mg/kg). Treatments were randomly assigned and administered by co-investigators who had no input on Heart Rate (HR) and Lameness Score (LS) measurements. Another investigator who was unaware of treatment assignments monitored HR and LS every 20?min for 5 hours after lameness induction and then hourly through 12 hours after treatment. One and two weeks later treatments were shuffled and the experiment was repeated. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test were used to identify analgesic effects at a significance level of P<0.05. Results HR and LS were not different between saline and firocoxib. Post-treatment phenylbutazone HR (2.3?3.3, 5, and 10 hours) and LS (2.3?8 hours) were lower than saline (P<0.05). Phenylbutazone HR (10 and 12 hours) and LS (1.67?11 hours) were lower than firocoxib (P<0.05). Conclusions It was concluded that firocoxib at this label dosage was not different than placebo and that phenylbutazone was more effective than firocoxib and saline.

AB  - Introduction Resistance training provided by underwater (UWT) treadmills may enhance strength and fatigue resistance of superficial digital flexor muscle thereby reducing tendon injury. This study examined effects of UWT and land (LT) treadmill training on SDF and gluteal muscle. Methods Six unfit horses (3???2 crossover design, 60d detraining period) walked on UWT and LT for 5d/week for 8 weeks (up to 40?min/day). A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed 2 weeks before, and after L or UW training, and V180?bpm and La10.5?m/s calculated. Resting and post-SET gluteal and SDF muscle biopsies were obtained. Muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], fiber type composition and min/max fiber diameters were analysed. Comparisons were made using GLM or ANOVA, mean?±?SD and significance of P<0.05. Results Post-exercise SDF muscle lactate increased 3?4 fold to 30?±?12 (UWT) and 41?±?15 (LT) mmol/kg dw post-exercise. Post-exercise gluteal muscle lactate increased 2 fold to 55?±?18 (UWT) and 62?±?18 (LT) mmol/kg. No significant differences were found between UW and L post-exercise muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], V180 or LA10.5 or fiber type composition. Gluteal fiber diameters decreased significantly with UW and L training. Fiber diameters in SDF muscle decreased with training to a significantly lesser extent after UW vs. L training. Conclusions At maximal speed, both SDF and gluteal muscle have a significant anaerobic response which was not impacted by UWT or LT training at a walk. UWT may be of benefit by attenuating the training induced decrease in fiber sizes in SDF muscle thereby enhancing SDF muscle strength.

AB  - Introduction Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism during muscle contraction and in the balance of anaerobic and aerobic energy production. This study evaluated mitochondrial respirometry in skeletal muscle of eventing horses before and after an intense effort. Methods Fourteen Brazilian Sport Horses 4 to 6 years old performed an incremental velocity test on a high speed treadmill inclined to 3% and galloped at speeds up to 8?m/s until exhaustion. Biopsies from the gluteus medius muscle were obtained before and immediately after the end of the test. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by O2K oxygraph of high resolution (Oroboros). The results were standardized by minute and per gram of wet weight of muscle and expressed as mean?±?SD. Plasma lactate was measured using a spectrophotometer. Results were compared by paired t?test (P<0.05). Results The maximal respiration value of mitochondria did not change in gluteus medius muscle of horses at exhaustion. However, there was an increase in stage 3 mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate/malate substrate, and also an increase of non-mitochondrial respiration after exercise. Lactate values before and after exercise were 0.4?±?0.1?mmol/L and 12.1?±?4.6?mmol/L, respectively. Conclusions There is little change in mitochondrial respirometry in the gluteus medius muscle after intense exercise indicating predominantly anaerobic metabolism in the muscle of the eventing horses, as supported by the high plasma lactate concentrations after the test. The increase of oxidase reactions after intense exercise is related to an increase in non-mitochondrial respiration.

AB  - Introduction Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in assessing MPS in horses has not been evaluated. Determination of MPS requires steady-state tracer plasma enrichment and serial muscle biopsy. Given that MPS is often assessed in response to exercise and that muscle biopsy in the standing horse typically requires sedation, the influence of exercise and sedation on tracer kinetics was determined. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) IV and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?hrs. Pharmacokinetic modeling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6 hours of infusion after loading. Horses then received the same dose and completed a 12-minute exercise test and were sedated with xylazine 0.4?mg/kg IV. Plasma D5-Phe enrichment was determined every 5?15 minutes for 2 hours after both exercise and sedation. Results The mean rate of phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56?umol/kg/hr (SD 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41?umol/kg (SD 8.8). A loading dose of 3.3?umol/kg and an infusion rate of 4.5?umol/kg/hr D5-phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently, confirmed to achieve steady state tracer concentration at 5.6?9.1% APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). Conclusions D5-phenylalanine is a suitable metabolic tracer in the horse as a steady-state can be achieved, however interventions should be taken into account.
