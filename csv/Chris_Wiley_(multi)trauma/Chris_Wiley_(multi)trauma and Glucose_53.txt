AB  - Abstract Therapeutic treatment targeting one cell type is considered ineffective in remedying any injury to the central nervous system (CNS). Perlecan, a multi-functional, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, shows diverse effects on distinct cell types, suggesting that it is one of the candidates that can augment the regenerative mechanisms in the injured CNS. Therefore, we examined the functions of perlecan in CNS cells in vitro by using perlecan purified from bovine kidney. Perlecan-coated cell culture plates, unlike their type I/III collagen-coated counterparts, did not inhibit the adhesion of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) and neurons. The coated perlecan and the perlecan added to the culture medium suppressed astrocyte proliferation; however, perlecan added to the medium promoted NS/PC proliferation. Neurons were promoted to extend their neurites on the perlecan-coated substrate, and perlecan added to the medium also showed a similar effect. NS/PC proliferation and neurite extension is a major regenerative reaction in CNS injury, whereas excess proliferation of astrocytes cause hypertrophy of glial scars, which repels neurons. Our in vitro study suggests that perlecan is an attractive candidate to promote regenerative mechanisms and to suppress reactions that hamper regenerative processes in cases of CNS injury.

AB  - Abstract Gestational diabetes mellitus, however currently defined, is relatively rare in a UK Caucasian population, but is much more common in other ethnic groups. There is likely soon to be better agreement on diagnostic levels of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy, but there is still considerable reluctance to start insulin therapy. There is now good evidence that insulin administered twice daily during the third trimester to mothers who have even a mild degree of hyperglycaemia will reduce fetal size, and in particular fetal adiposity. In relation to recent concepts of the transgenerational passage of Type 2 diabetes and obesity, further epidemiological investigation is required. Insulin treatment in pregnancy may also prove to have a role in prevention of Type 2 diabetes in the next generation. Diabet. Med. 18, 960?964 (2001)

AB  - Abstract Traditional risk factors explain most of the risk associated with coronary heart disease, and after adjustment for risk factors family history was believed to contribute very little to population-attributable risk of coronary heart disease. However, the INTERHEART study demonstrated an independent association of family history of coronary heart disease with acute myocardial infarction. To assess this relationship more comprehensively in multiple datasets in different populations, we carried out a detailed review of the available evidence. Case-control studies involving 17,202 cases and 30,088 controls yielded a pooled unadjusted odds ratio (random-effects model, overall I2 = 64.6%, P = 0.000) of 2.03 (95% confidence interval: 1.79?2.30), whereas cohort studies that included 313,837 individuals yielded an unadjusted relative risk for future coronary heart disease (random-effects model, overall I2 = 88.7%, P = 0.000) of 1.60 (95% confidence interval: 1.44?1.77). Although the presence of family history of coronary heart disease indicates a cumulative exposure of shared genes and environment, the risk estimates for family history did not attenuate significantly after adjustment for conventional coronary heart disease risk factors in several studies. It is probably an oversimplification to dichotomize the family history variable into a simple ?yes? or ?no? risk factor, as the significance of family history is influenced by several variables, such as age, sex, number of relatives, and age at onset of disease in the relatives. Moreover, a quantitative risk-assessment model for the family history variable, such as the ?family risk score,? has a positive linear relationship with coronary heart disease. More studies are warranted to assess the benefits and risks of intensive interventions, both targeted individually and at the family level, among individuals with a valid family history and borderline elevated risk factors.

AB  - Contents Sheep and goat production is an important economic activity in Spain with an increasing interest in milk production. Multiovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) and In vitro Embryo Production (IVEP) are assisted reproductive technologies aimed at increasing the genetic diffusion of females. In vitro embryo production is a multi-step methodology comprising the following procedures: (i) In vitro Maturation (IVM) of oocytes recovered directly from the follicles, (ii) In vitro Fertilization (IVF) or co-incubation of capacitated spermatozoa with in vitro matured oocytes and (iii) In vitro culture (IVC) of zygotes up to the blastocyst stage. In vitro embryo production from oocytes recovered from prepubertal females is called JIVET (Juvenile in vitro Embryo Transfer) and allows shortened generation intervals and increased genetic gain. Embryo production together with embryo cryoconservation would allow large-scale embryo marketing, a pathogen-free genetic movement and easier and cheaper germplasm commercial transactions. Commercial Embryo activity in small ruminants is low compared to cows in the European Union (data from the European Embryo Transfer Association) and in the world (data from the International Embryo Transfer Association). There is less IVEP research in small ruminants compared to other livestock species. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current status of IVEP of small ruminant with an emphasis on (i) description of the main methodologies currently used for IVM, IVF and IVC of embryos (ii) comparing procedures and outputs from JIVET and IVEP of adult females and (iii) the future research perspectives of this technology.

AB  - Summary Flaxseed proteins are potent multi-functional ingredients for food formulation owing to their techno-functionalities, food preservation capacity, and health benefits. A possible synergistic effect with mucilage on their functionalities could be valuable even though this co-product in flaxseed may limit the protein yield during their production processes. Their techno-functional properties could also be considered in mixture with other flax bioactive components such as lignans and fibre to enhance the value of the flaxseed meal. The present paper reviews flaxseed protein uses in food and their health benefits. New perspectives according to consumers? demand for products with health promoting bioactive components are also suggested.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess if positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, without hemodynamic impairment in horses during anesthesia. Design Prospective, randomized study. Animals Thirteen isoflurane-anesthetized healthy horses. Methods After 60¬†minutes of anesthesia with spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation was initiated with an inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 10?20¬†mL¬†kg?1 and respiratory rate adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Constant PEEP of 5 cmH2O was continued (control group; n¬†=¬†6) or titrated (PEEP group; n¬†=¬†7) by increasing and decreasing PEEP from 5 to 20 cmH2O at 15-minute intervals. The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow collection of blood for pH and blood gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output (CO) using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary assessment was recorded before PEEP titration and after 15¬†minutes at each PEEP value. Results In the PEEP group, static compliance (range) (Cst 278?463¬†mL cmH2O?1) was significantly higher and the shunt fraction ( 7?20%) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [P(A-a)O2 95?325¬†mmHg] were significantly lower than in the control group [Cst of 246?290¬†mL¬†cmH2O?1, of 16?19%, P(A-a)O2 of 253?310¬†mmHg; p¬†<¬†0.05]. CO (mean¬†¬±¬†SEM) was lower in the PEEP group (23¬†¬±¬†2¬†L¬†minute?1) at 20 cmH2O PEEP than in the control group (26¬†¬±¬†4¬†L¬†minute?1, p¬†<¬†0.05), with no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure or central venous pressure. Conclusions PEEP titration significantly improved gas exchange and lung compliance, with a small decrease in CO at the highest PEEP level. Clinical relevance Gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during inhalation anesthesia can be treated using PEEP titration from 5 to 20¬†cmH2O, without clinically important hemodynamic effects in healthy horses.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common secondary complications of diabetes mellitus, causing severe and prolonged morbidity. However, clinical and experimental studies have reported that careful glucose control may prevent, stabilize, and/or reverse neuropathy and other chronic diabetic complications. Unfortunately, insulin therapy does not prevent the development or progression of chronic lesions in the vessels, kidneys, eyes, or nerves of the diabetic patient. There is great interest in investigating other forms of endocrine replacement therapy, such as transplantation of the pancreas or of the islets of Langerhans (IT). Diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) evolution is characterized by progressive demyelination and axonal loss and is manifested by signs and symptoms on physical examination and abnormalities in nerve conduction studies (NCS). NCS provide reliable, noninvasive, objective measures of peripheral nerve function and constitute the most important technique for the evaluation of the severity of DP in clinical trials. Several research groups have demonstrated that skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density is another method minimally invasive and repeatable that provides direct pathologic evidence of axonal damage in diabetic neuropathy. Fifty-one consecutive IDDM patients with or without end stage renal disease were enrolled at the moment of islet (Is), kidney (KD), kidney-pancreas (KP) or kidney-islet (KI) transplantation. Patients underwent skin biopsy punch, neurologic examination and neurophysiological investigation. Particularly, 20?pts underwent KP tx, 16?KD tx, 10 islet tx and 5 KI. The patients were comparable for duration of diabetes, dialysis (when present), age, lipid profile. In half of the patients a follow-up of 2 years has been reached. After KP tx, and partially with KI, a complete normalization of glycometabolic control has been achieved, with statistically lower HbA1c in comparison with KD group (KP?=?6.2; 0.1% vs. KD?=?8.4; 0.5%; p?<?0.01). In the KI/Is group, a long-term restoration of islet endocrine function has been achieved, with insulin independence. When this has been lost, a persistent secretion of C-peptide was shown for a long period of time. This was correlated with a global improvement quality of life and vascular structure. Preliminary results will be presented.

AB  - Abstract: Revolutionary advances in tissue engineering are redefining approaches to tissue repair and transplantation through the creation of replacement tissues that remain biointeractive after implantation, imparting physiologic functions as well as structure to the tissue or organ damaged by disease or trauma.1,2 Over the last decade this field has moved from ?science fiction? to ?science fact? with the research-oriented acceptance of its potential to regulatory approvals allowing commercial products to be available for use in many countries. The maintenance of tissue integrity, functionality, and viability from cell seeding through product manufacture, shipping, and end-use has been accomplished through innovations in design and scale-up of both tissue growth and preservation processes. These unique systems have enabled the delivery of tissue-engineered products that are uniform inter- and intra-lot, readily available as off-the-shelf products, easy to use, and efficacious. Skin replacement products are the most advanced, with several tissue-engineered wound care materials on the market in the U.S. and in several international communities.3-5 The potential impact of this field is far broader, offering novel solutions to the medical field for drug screening and development, genetic engineering, and total tissue and organ replacement.

Future perspectives The stimuli for neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative disorders are multi-factorial and may include genetic predisposition, environmental factors, cellular stressors such as oxidative stress and free radical production, bioenergy failure, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, disruption of Ca2+-regulating systems, mitochondrial dysfunction and misfolded protein accumulation. Cellular stress disrupts functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a critical organelle for protein quality control, leading to induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress may contribute to neurodegeneration in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the molecular events occurring during ER stress and the unfolded protein response and it specifically evaluates the evidence suggesting the ER stress response plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Introduction Body composition including percentage of fat, fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) is an important consideration for athletes. An evaluation of FFM in racehorses concluded that racing performance is positively correlated with FFM both pre- and post-training. Athletic performance is influenced by interactions among the environment and genes that influence anatomical, metabolic and physiological traits relevant to exercise. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of genetic variation in six candidate genes with functions in growth and metabolism (IL1RA, PTPN1, MC3R, IGF1, LEPR and MSTN) on FFM in Thoroughbreds. Methods FFM was calculated from rump fat thickness measured ultrasonographically in 110 two-year-old Thoroughbred horses-in-training in the same yard after two (T2) and eight (T8) months of training. Twenty-one SNPs in six genes were selected from the EquCab2.0 SNP database and were genotyped for all horses using custom Sequenom SNP genotyping assays. Quantitative tests of association were performed between SNPs and FFM at T2 and T8, and the FFM ratio between the two time points (T2?:?T8) using PLINK software. Results Two SNPs in both the IGF1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1) and PTPN1 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1) genes were significantly associated with FFM (T2) (P<0.05). The two IGF1?SNPs and two LEPR (Leptin Receptor) gene SNPs were significantly associated with FFM (T8) (P<0.05). One LEPR?SNP was significantly (P<0.005) associated with changes in FFM (T2?:?T8). Conclusions These results suggest a genetic contribution to FFM variation in Thoroughbreds. Further validation will determine whether these SNPs may be used to predict the effects of training on FFM.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies, using reflective skin markers, are commonly used to investigate equine neck motion in equitation science and for rehabilitation purposes. In order to interpret the registrations accurately, the degree of skin displacement has been described for the limbs and back, but not for the neck. The aim of the present study was to investigate the degree of skin displacement in the equine neck. Methods Radiopaque skin markers were applied to the skin over the first six cervical vertebrae of six healthy horses. Radiographs were taken in three standardized neck positions in the sagittal plane: control (horizontal neck), ?on the bit? and ?nose to carpus?. The scales of the images were normalized and calculation of skin displacement was performed by use of a coordinate system, dividing the displacement into measurements on an x-axis parallel to the vertebra's longitudinal axis and a y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis. The non-parametric paired Wilcoxon rank test was employed to study the differences in distances in x- and y-directions, and statistical significance was set to P<0.05. Results Between control and ?nose to carpus? positions, there were significant differences in the marker locations, related to the underlying vertebra, in x-line for C1?6, and in y-line for C3?6. The differences in marker locations were between 3?¬±?9 and 44?¬±?14?mm, depending on the marker. Conclusions The outcome of this study indicates that skin displacement is an important factor to consider when investigating equine neck motion with skin marker methodology. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by a local Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments (Uppsala, Sweden), with written consent from the horse owners. Sources of funding:?none.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the horse and rider partnership is a challenging and complex area. There is limited scientific research regarding the occurrence of misalignments in the horse and rider, and if there is any relationship between the two. This study investigated asymmetry of single horse and rider combinations focusing on pelvis asymmetry. Methods 14 single horse/rider combinations (minimum 6 month partnership) on the same daily routine were assessed. Horses and riders were assessed for misalignments of the pelvis, spine, and neck by a fully qualified human and animal (McTimoney) practitioner on the same day. Triplicate measurements of rider dorsal iliac crest (IC) distance (nearest 0.2?cm) and degree of tilt (0d.p) were recorded, sitting and standing, using a PALM palpation meter to calculate IC height discrepancy. Triplicate horse tuber coxae (TC) heights (nearest 0.5?cm) were measured using a plumb line. Difference between means indicated direction and value of asymmetry relative to symmetry of zero. Student's t-test and Pearson's Product Moment correlation examined asymmetry relationships. Results Mean rider IC height discrepancy, standing, was 0.89?¬±?0.64?cm and sitting, 1.00?¬±?0.66?cm. Mean TC height discrepancy was 1.3?¬±?1.6?cm. Asymmetry of the pelvis was a feature of 93% of horse/rider combinations, 85% occurring in the same direction. There was a significant positive correlation between horse TC and rider IC height discrepancies (r2?=?0.4, F?=?8.24, P?=?0.014). Conclusions This study provides positive evidence of a relationship between the direction of horse pelvic rotation and rider pelvic tilt and also between the degree of tilt and rotation. This has implications for physical therapy treatment of horse and rider. Further research of causal effect relationships of the asymmetries is recommended. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were reviewed by the McTimoney Chiropractic College Ethical Review Committee. Sources of funding:?none. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Introduction The simplest model of circular locomotion is a point mass moving uniformly on a circle. To produce circular motion, a centripetal force is generated. This study investigated contributions of individual limbs to the net centripetal force in horses trotting on a circle. Methods Six horses trotted on a 6?m diameter circle at their preferred speed. Optical motion capture (Motion Analysis Corp) recorded kinematics, while six force plates (AMTI) recorded ground reaction forces (GRF). Whole body center of mass (CoM) was computed using a 23-segment rigid body model. The GRF of each limb was expressed at the CoM in cylindrical coordinates centered at a best-fit circle of the ground path of the CoM. Average vertical, tangential and radial force components were computed for each limb over the whole stride duration. Forces were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Results The maximum ground-path deviation of the CoM from the best-fit circle among all trials was only 2.8% of the radius. The forelimbs contributed an average centripetal (radial) force of 0.49 ¬± 0.16?N/kg (mean ¬± SD, normalized to body mass), which was significantly greater (P<0.001) than the hind limb contribution of 0.36 ¬± 0.13?N/kg. There was no significant difference between inside and outside limbs. Conclusions The contribution of individual limbs to the centripetal force provided a direct indication of their role in circular locomotion. The forelimbs generated significantly more centripetal force, possibly in direct relation to their greater support of the body mass against gravity.

AB  - Introduction Direct measurement of peak vertical force in equine forelimbs and hindlimbs under training conditions has not been achieved to date. This measurement is possible using dynamometric horseshoes (DHSs). The objectives of this study were to investigate, on a firm surface, the effect of speed on stride parameters and on vertical loading in the forelimb (FL) compared to the hindlimb (HL). Methods Right front and hind hooves of 5 trotters were equipped with a DHS. A linear corridor was delimited on a firm sand training track. Each horse alternately repeated trials (harness trot) at 25, 35 and 40?km/h (4 to 6 times at each speed). For each trial, stride parameters and dynamic variables (peak vertical force and impulse, vertical loading rate) were analysed for 10 successive strides. Correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the association between speed and the studied variables; linear mixed-effects regression models were used to test the significance (P<0.05) of these associations. Results Stance and stride duration, and their ratio (duty factor) were linearly correlated with speed (r<-0.82), both in FL and HL. Peak vertical force was the only variable for which r was higher in HL (r?=?0.80 vs. 0.50 in FL). The relationship between vertical loading rate and speed had the highest r of all dynamic variables (r?=?0.87 and 0.83, respectively in FL and HL; r?=?-0.75 and ?0.60 for vertical impulse). Conclusions The linear relation between peak vertical force and speed demonstrated in the hindlimb differs from previous studies at lower speed. These results stress the necessity of performing biomechanical measurements under real training conditions.

AB  - Introduction Minimal research has examined the effect of draft loading on equine muscle activity. It is hypothesised that increases in draft load of 10 and 20% body mass (BM) will increase EMG intensity and duration of vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) during walk. Methods Data were collected from six Irish Cob geldings (11?¬±?4 years; height: 1.47?¬±?0.05?m; BM: 490?¬±?65?kg) all trained to draft-load. A modified lorry tyre was used as a loading platform. Surface EMG electrodes were positioned over VL and GL. An accelerometer placed on the left hind hoof collected kinematic data. EMG and accelerometer data at a draft load equivalent to 0 (zero load), 10 and 20% BM were recorded as the horses were led at walk in a 20?m straight line. A stopwatch determined mean speed over 20?m. Mean kinematic and EMG values were determined for 10 consecutive strides. EMG intensities were normalised to each horse. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test explored data normality. Friedman test (P<0.05) compared between conditions. A pair-wise Wilcoxon signed ranks test identified where the differences lay. Results Data for one horse was excluded because of poor accelerometer data. The remaining horses (n?=?5) maintained a constant velocity (1.10?¬±?0.02?m/s {SD}) between conditions (P>0.7). VL and GL increased their muscular activity in terms of EMG intensity and duration of contraction with increasing draft load from 0 to 10% and 10 to 20% BM (P?=?0.04; n?=?5). Conclusions Draft loading can be utilised for strength training following injury or to improve athletic performance.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred foals are born with fully developed hooves and stand within minutes. A ring in the horn occurs at birth and grows down the hoof wall, marking the fetal hoof (distal) and foal hoof (proximal). Birth rings in hoof horn have been noted in other species and used to estimate age. Hoof wall renewal in all ages of horse has been poorly reported; horn growth and complete hoof capsule renewal has not been measured in Thoroughbred foals. Partial hoof wall avulsions are relatively common. The objective was to measure the time taken for the fetal hoof of a newborn foal to grow out and be replaced by hoof grown since birth. Methods Thoroughbred foals (N?=?150) on four Newmarket stud farms were studied during June to September. The age of the foal and the day that routine hoof trimming removed the remnants of the fetal hoof of the front hooves was recorded. Foals that were on restricted exercise, ill or where the remnants of the fetal hoof still remained after trimming were excluded from the data. 45 foals fulfilled the criteria. The data were tabulated in Excel, analysed in Minitab and assessed for normality (Anderson-Darling). Results The mean age at which the fetal hoof grew out was 145?¬±?15 days (95% confidence interval, 141.77?147.16). Conclusions Thoroughbred foals replace the fetal hoof at twice the speed given for mature horses (270?365 days). Knowing the time of hoof renewal will allow accurate predictions of healing to be made in cases of partial hoof wall avulsion and other hoof lesions.
