AB  - Introduction Despite dressage popularity, little research exists in relation to the rider's posture and effect on aids given to the horse. The aim was to investigate asymmetry during sitting trot and shoulder-in between varying rider abilities. Methods Full body kinematics were collected at 120?Hz (XSENS MVN Biomech) for 10 novice (age 28?±?12 years, height?=?168?±?7?cm) and 10 advanced (age 29?±?6 years, height?=?163?±?4?cm) predominantly right handed participants, with one left handed rider in each group. Range of motion for right hip, left hip, right knee, left knee, right ankle, left ankle, ASIS vertical movement, trunk rotation were generated in Visual 3D. Results Independent t-tests demonstrated significant differences between groups within right and left hip external rotation when straight (P?<?0.001, d?=?2.52; P?=?0.02, d?=?1.25), shoulder-in right (P?=?0.01, d?=?1.47; P?=?0.02, d?=?1.31), only significant in right hip within shoulder-in left (P?=?0.01, d?=?1.30). Axial rotation to the right was found in all conditions, with the range significantly (P<0.05) increased between groups in straight and shoulder-in right, as did right ASIS vertical excursion when riding straight (P?=?0.01, d?=?1.90), and left ASIS excursion within shoulder-in left (P?=?0.04, d?=?1.03). Conclusions Right trunk axial rotation is considered closely linked to right hand dominance, rotating the rider's trunk to the dominant rein aid. Left shoulder-in scored higher which may be because right trunk rotation is one of the aids given to the horse when executing this dressage movement.

AB  - Introduction The position and magnitude of the ground reaction force (GRF) relative to the hoof influences loading within the limbs. In this study, we investigated changes to the point of force application (PFA) of the GRF in horses walking and trotting on circles compared to a straight line. Methods 8 horses were lunged in 6?m diameter circles (left and right), and led straight, at walk and trot over force plates on firm ground. Hoof-mounted retro-reflective markers were tracked using a motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corp). The PFA was computed in a hoof-local coordinate system during 2018 strides. The instantaneous PFA was weighted by the GRF magnitude to compute an average PFA position within the hoof print for each total stance phase. The average PFAs were analyzed using an ANOVA in which type of locomotion (circle or straight), gait (walk or trot) and hoof (fore or hind) were used as independent variables. A Tukey post-hoc analysis identified pair-wise differences. Results At trot, the PFA moved toward the center of the circle by 19.8?±?10?mm (mean?±?SD, P<0.001). At walk there was no significant difference in PFA between straight and circle. The hoof (fore or hind) did not significantly affect the PFA shift. Conclusions The significant medio-lateral shift of PFA suggests that the balance of limb loading changes during circular locomotion. This is likely to affect the medio-lateral balance in the distal joints and cause sub-optimal loading of limb structures.

AB  - Introduction Controversy surrounds certain head and neck postures in sport horses and their potential impact on the nuchal ligament. Methods Three dead near-term equine foetuses in lateral recumbency with upper-side neck musculature removed to expose the nuchal ligament were placed in 6 head and neck positions (HNP's) between extreme hyperflexion and hyperextension, along with 3 thoracic positions: Low, Medium and High. In each of these 18 positions, the funicular length, lamella dorsoventral width at the level of C4, and craniocaudal length of the 5 major lamella bands of the nuchal ligament were measured manually. Results In intermediate HNP's (HNP1, HNP2), thoracic postures significantly impacted nuchal ligament measurements. Compared to the Medium thorax position, depression and elevation of the thorax decreased lamella sheet widths by 24% (P?=?0.014) and 11% (P?=?0.267) respectively for HNP1, and by 8% (P?=?0.01 for both depression and elevation) for HNP2. More extreme head and neck positions were not associated with any change in measurements of the nuchal ligament with changes in thoracic position. Conclusions A decreased width suggests increased tension in an elastic structure. Hence, if the anatomical connections are similar in adults, extreme head and neck postures may reduce the effect that thoracic posture might have on the nuchal ligament in certain unnatural positions required in sport horses and may interfere with normal elastic energy storage in the nuchal ligament during movement.

AB  - Introduction The biomechanical effects of training on gait in the Thoroughbred are not fully understood. We aimed to assess the effect of training, surface and incline on stride parameters. Methods 40 two-year-old Thoroughbred racehorses entering training were recruited and followed from December 2012 until September 2013. Gait analysis was performed at eleven time points by equipping each horse with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with inbuilt GPS, mounted on the dorsum immediately caudal to the most caudal palpable lumbar dorsal spinous process. Horses were exercised as per their regular training regimen on a variety of training surfaces and inclines. Data were analysed using custom software written in Matlab (Mathworks, UK), and statistical analysis was performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Austria). A linear mixed model was used, with horse as a random effect and weeks in training, training surface, curve and incline as fixed effects. Results A total of 85,497 strides at speeds of between 6.00 and 19.03?ms-1 were analysed. Stride length increased by 0.33?m ±?4.3?x?104 with each 1?ms-1 increase in velocity. Training causes a reduction in stride length of 0.004?±?0.0001?m per week and an increase in stride frequency of 1.29?x?103?± 4.1?x?105 per week. Shallow inclines, steep inclines and declines cause a decrease in stride length of 0.07?±?0.003?m, 0.10?±?0.005?m and 0.04?±?0.004?m respectively. Turf and peat moss training surfaces caused an increase in stride length of 0.03?±?0.004?m and 0.06?±?0.007?m respectively. Conclusions This study provides an insight into the effects of external factors on the gait of young Thoroughbreds in training. Ongoing research will further investigate these effects and interactions. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

AB  - Introduction Evaluating responses of horses to diagnostic analgesia is subject to bias. Pelvic movement symmetry can be measured accurately with inertial sensors, but it is unclear which of the many symmetry measures best reflect changes. It was hypothesised that objective parameters mimicking commonly observed visual parameters used by veterinarians (difference between upward/downward sacral movement and between amplitudes of left and right tuber coxa motion) would show the largest, most consistent responses. Methods 13 horses underwent visual lameness scoring and independent gait assessment with inertial sensors during clinical lameness investigations. Multiple movement symmetry parameters were calculated and changes before/after diagnostic analgesia regressed against change in lameness grade. Confidence intervals of slopes of regression lines were assessed to identify significant changes. Results All parameters showed variation between horses and across lameness grades. Three measures documented a consistent increase in symmetry for each grade of change in lameness score: difference between sacral displacement minima, and upward movement difference and range of motion difference between the tubera coxae. A change in symmetry of 9?13% for each grade of increase in lameness can be expected. Conclusions The three most promising pelvic parameters for consistent quantification of changes due to diagnostic analgesia in the hindlimb of lame horses were identified. Difference in upward movement between left and right tuber coxae is the most sensitive but requires simultaneously focusing on pelvic and limb movements and may therefore be more difficult to assess visually. Showing a similar response to diagnostic analgesia, the difference in movement amplitude between left and right tuber coxae may be more easily perceived since it does not require simultaneous focus on limb movement.

AB  - Introduction The effect of bits on the mouth of the horse is a source of controversy in animal welfare discussions. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of two different bits on tensile forces in side reins applied to exercising horses. Methods Ten Warmblood horses (2 mares, 8 geldings; mean age: 12.4?±?5.3 years) were assessed during walk and trot on a treadmill. Side reins were used to position the horse's head so that the nose was nearly vertical. Two different bits were utilised: a double jointed snaffle (bit 1) and a mullen mouth snaffle (bit 2). Rein forces were measured with an electronic sensor based on a force sensing resistor (27?g, sample rate 120?Hz, Interlink Electronics corp.), synchronized with a kinematic system (10 cameras, 120?Hz, Motion Analysis corp.). The force sensors were calibrated with masses of 1?Kg (=9.81?N) and 4?Kg (=39.24?N). Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS. Normality of data was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test and data were analysed with repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results Maximum tensile forces differed significantly between the two bits. Maximum forces at walk were 16?±?1.9?N using bit 1 and 15.7?±?1.9?N using bit 2. At trot the forces (12.7?±?2.0?N bit 1; 10.4?±?1.8?N bit 2) were significantly reduced compared to walk. There was no significant difference between left and right rein forces. Conclusions The type of bit has an effect on the tensile forces in the side reins and hence on the forces exerted on the mouth of the horse.

AB  - Introduction There has been limited evaluation of biomechanical parameters during flight and their relationship to subjective assessments of jumping technique in ridden show-jumping horses. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up and after jumping a 15-fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day one and twice on day two; the second round on day 3 was an 8-fence jump-off. Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to determine limb and back angles at 25%, 50% and 75% of the flight phase over four fences using markers placed at pre-determined locations. Technique grades (1?10) were assigned per fence by an international coach. Technique grades and kinematics were correlated using a Spearman's rank correlation test. Results Forelimb and hindlimb take-off distance and technique grade (4?7/10) were positively correlated (r?=?0.29, 0.27, P≤0.01). Thoracolumbar angle (range 178?184°) at 25% and 75% of flight and neck/trunk angle (NT) at 50% and 75% of flight were negatively correlated with technique grade (r?=?-0.20 {P?=?0.04}, -0.20 {P?=?0.03}, -0.21 {P?=?0.03}, and ?0.28 {P<0.01} respectively). Conclusions Only weak correlations were evident, however, the findings suggest that increased take-off distance may be desirable for improvements in subjectively evaluated technique. The relationship between TL extension and improved technique grades may be explained by improved back stabilisation. Decreased NT and TL extension at 75% flight could suggest that back stabilisation and raising the neck in preparation for landing are associated with better jumping technique. Subjective grading of jumping technique appears to be influenced by kinematic features during flight.

AB  - Introduction Ultrasonography is used for functional assessment of deep peri-vertebral muscles in people with neck pain. This study evaluated intra-operator and inter-operator reliability and repeatability of ultrasound image acquisition (US) and muscle cross-sectional area measurement (CSA) of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the equine cervical spine. Methods Two US operators independently acquired 60 unilateral US images per horse from 5 standing horses (mean?±?SD: age: 12.1?±?10.5 years) at spinal levels C3-C6 (m. multifidus) and C2-C5 (m. longus colli). Each operator traced each image blindly three times (n?=?360 per operator) to calculate CSA. ANOVA analysis compared CSA across all subjects within and between operators for effects of vertebral level, reliability of image acquisition and repeatability of CSA calculation. Results Intra-operator results for m. multifidus were 72% (ICC) and 5% (CV), and 90% (ICC) and 4% (CV) between operators. Image acquisition was unreliable at C6. Intra-operator results for m. longus colli were 100% (ICC) and 0% (CV), and 77% (ICC) and 0% (CV) between operators. Image acquisition was unreliable at C2. CSA for both muscles was largest at C4 and C5. Conclusions Ultrasonography could be used reliably and repeatably for CSA measurement of m. multifidus and m. longus colli in the mid-cervical spine of the horse. Further studies will determine reliability across time and CSA side-side symmetry in horses with neck pain.

AB  - Introduction Hydrotherapy is increasingly applied within the equine industry for rehabilitation and therapy. Substantial anecdotal evidence exists suggesting the benefits of its application but while there is extensive literature on the use of aqua-treadmills in humans and canines there is comparatively little in equines. Therefore, limited research exists supporting the role of the aqua-treadmill in current therapy practices. This study aimed to investigate the effect of water depth on pelvic movement during aqua-treadmill exercise. Methods Eight horses were trotted on an aqua-treadmill at four water depths specifically measured to individual horses (P3, fetlock, MC3, carpus). Pelvic displacement was recorded using an optical motion capture system to collect coordinates from markers placed on the tuber sacrale, tuber coxae, withers and lumbar spine. Data were processed using custom written scripts (Matlab?) and ANOVA was performed. Results All subjects demonstrated a significant increase in vertical displacement of the pelvis as water depth increased from P3 to carpus while displacement symmetry was not significantly altered with a change in water depth. Conclusions The common practice of increasing water depth to intensify the physical demands of the exercise while maintaining the desired movement symmetry is supported. Having knowledge of how a horse moves on an aqua-treadmill is vital for tailoring specific therapy in order to most successfully rehabilitate the horse from injury. Investigation of the effects of increasing water depth on asymmetric horses should be carried out to further support its application as a tool for rehabilitation.

AB  - Introduction Exercising horses one, two, or three times per week during 6 weeks using two intervals with near-maximal speed over 100?m elicited a decrease of VLa4, a widely accepted parameter of fitness and competitive success of horses (speed at which, under defined conditions, the blood lactate concentration reaches 4?mmol/l). Therefore, two field studies were performed to examine the possibility of avoiding decline in VLa4 with this type of exercise. Methods Study 1) 6 horses were submitted to the same exercise as above once per week during the first 2 weeks of a conditioning period (CP) adding one interval in each exercise session every 2 weeks for the following 6 weeks. Study 2) 6 horses did the same as horses in study 1 plus once per week an exercise bout at their individual VLa2 during 35 minutes. Before, every 2 weeks during, and 2 weeks after the CP, horses were subjected to standardized exercise tests to determine their VLa4 (and VLa2 where convenient) and maximal speed (speedmax). The effect of conditioning on VLa4 and speedmax was examined using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Fisher's test. Results In study 1 mean VLa4 declined during the first 4 weeks of CP but increased to the initial level thereafter (P<0.05) while speedmax remained the same over time. In study 2 VLa4 decreased continuously (P<0.01) while speedmax increased (P<0.01). Conclusions The results might be important to train horses racing over different distances.

AB  - Introduction Eventing is a challenging equestrian discipline. Insight into causes of wastage and withdrawal from competition is essential for animal welfare and economic reasons. Methods Twenty-nine animals selected for the European Championship (EC) in 2010 (9 ponies) and 2011 (20 horses) were followed prospectively monitoring fitness using standardized exercise tests. Causes of withdrawal were noted. Data were analyzed using logistic-regression, likely-ratio-tests, Fisher-exact-test, general-linear-model and Chi-square tests as appropriate. Results Seventeen weeks before EC 17 horses and 9 ponies were tested: mean VLa4 was 10.3?±?0.4?m/s and 7.8?±?0.9?m/s respectively, and V200 was 11.4?±?0.8?m/s and 9.6?±?0.7?m/s respectively. Six weeks before EC 16/20 horses and 6/9 ponies were withdrawn, mainly for locomotor injury: 9/16 horses (P<0.001), 4/6 ponies (P?=?0.011). Other reasons were ?not-meeting-competition-criteria? (4/16 horses, 2/6 ponies) and ?being sold? (3/16 horses). Divided on the basis of VLa4 and ?recovery-HR-during-SET-I? into good (GP) and average performers (AP), AP were more likely to be injured (50%) than GP (0%, P?=?0.05). In a subpopulation (n?=?10, all condition training sessions evaluated for HR and speed) HRpeak was significantly lower in horses staying sound (186?±?9 beats/min) compared to horses withdrawn because of injury (201?±?5 beats/min; P?=?0.016). Conclusions For the European Championship 45% of national selection horses were unavailable because of locomotor injuries. GP at the beginning of the season were less likely to become injured than AP. HRpeak during condition training showed predictive value for future injuries.

AB  - Introduction Blood is often collected from performing poorly horses to measure blood variables that may indicate a reason. However, intense exercise affects many blood variables and therefore time of sampling can affect the interpretation of results. This study examined the behaviour of blood variables after racing to determine the magnitude of the changes and to determine when it is better to collect samples. Methods Blood was sampled in 17 Standardbred racehorses 3 and 2 days before as well as 2 and 3 days after racing. GGT, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, CK, AST, LDH and cortisol were measured in plasma, and haematocrit, haemoglobin, number of erythrocytes, total white blood cells, granulocytes and lymphocytes were measured in EDTA blood. Parametric data was analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher test; non-parametric data with Friedman test and Wilcoxon test. Results Plasma Ca concentration was lower on day 3 after racing than on day 2 before racing (P<0.01). P concentration and GGT activity were higher at days 2 and 3 after racing compared to before racing (P?=?0.01). Erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin were higher at day 2 after racing than before and 3 days after racing (P<0.01). The other variables were not affected. Conclusions Some slight but significant changes in blood variables have to be taken in account when interpreting biochemical and haematologic variables for poor performance diagnosis in Standardbreds. It seems preferable to take blood samples on the third day after racing than on the second day.

AB  - Introduction Polo is a popular sport; teams compete in matches comprising 4?6 chukkas, each between 7?10 minutes. Players commonly change ponies between chukkas, but changing within a chukka, known as ?half-chukkering? is permitted. This is believed to ?save? the horse by preventing fatigue and facilitating recovery. This study evaluated the impact of half versus full chukka playing strategies in low goal polo; team handicap 0?4 goals. Methods Resting heart rates (HR) were established for 48 polo-ponies deemed of comparable fitness by riders, competing in low-goal tournaments; riders selected their playing strategy either full-chukka (n?=?32) or half-chukkering (n?=?16). HR was recorded at the end of play and during recovery; for the full-chukka and 2nd half-chukka period at +2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 minutes, and until ponies returned to play after the 1st half-chukka, >6 minutes. ANOVA analyses investigated HR variation during recovery between ponies playing full-chukkas and the 2nd half-chukka period, and within the two half-chukkas played. Results At the end of play, full-chukka horses? mean HR were 95?±?13.1?bpm, compared to their 2nd half-chukka counterparts at 103?±?7.7?bpm, which was not significant. Significant differences in HR did occur throughout the subsequent recovery period: at 2 minutes (P<0.003) and between 4?20 minutes (P<0.0001), with full-chukka ponies recovering faster. No differences occurred during recovery between the two half-chukka periods although mean HR differed at the end of play (1st: 100?±?7.7?bpm; 2nd: 103?±?7.8?bpm). Conclusions Playing strategies influence cardiovascular recovery; full-chukka ponies recover faster than those playing in consecutive half-chukkas. Preparation of half-chukka ponies may predispose to reduced fitness levels compared to full-chukka ponies. Implementing a full-chukka playing strategy is advocated to optimise pony welfare and performance in low-goal polo.

AB  - Introduction Swedish Standardbred trotters are usually not clipped during the cold season but routinely showered and blanketed after exercise. Yet, the effects on heat dissipation have not been thoroughly studied. Methods Six Standardbred geldings were tested during three consecutive days, acting as their own control when: 1) showered, 2) showered and blanketed, 3) neither showered nor blanketed. The exercise consisted of 20?min trot (maximum heart rate 172?bpm), preceded and followed by 5?min walk. Rectal- (RT) and skin temperature (ST), respiration rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) were recorded: before exercise in the horses? boxes, after harnessing, after 5?min walk, at stops during four sequences of low and high intensity trotting, after 5?min walk (stable aisle), after showering and blanketing and at intervals of 15?30?min during recovery in boxes until one hour after exercise. Blankets remained on horses until test completion. Results Data were analyzed with Proc Mixed Model in SAS. Ambient temperature was 7.2?±?0.2°C (relative humidity 63.5?±?1.0%) in the stable and 1.0?±?1.0°C (54.3?±?1.2%) outdoors. Showering decreased ST of the neck (mean?±?SE, 32.0?±?0.4°C) compared to when horses were not showered (35.1?±?0.4, P<0.05). Showering also decreased ST of the hind leg (31.4?±?0.5, P<0.05). RT, RR and HR did not differ between treatments (P>0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, showering is efficient for cooling down whereas blanketing compromised heat dissipation.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to validate a field standardized exercise test (SET) adapted for young endurance horses and to evaluate the effects of age/conditioning level on speed and heart rate values. Methods The study involved 31 horses of Arabian origin bred specifically for endurance and aged 4?yo (n?=?11), 5?yo (n?=?13) or 6?yo (n?=?7). The SET consisted of a warm-up, followed by 15 (4?yo), 30 (5?yo) or 45 (6?yo) minutes of canter at a comfortable steady speed, and finished with 500 meters of fast gallop. Heart rate (HR) was recorded continuously during the SET. The velocities at which HR reached 160 and 200 beats per minute (V160 and V200) were calculated by the linear regression of HR versus speed. Results All horses were able to complete the SET. Resting HR was higher in 4?y than in 5?y and 6?y (P<0.05 via Student's t test). HR and velocities during the SET did not vary significantly with age. Mean?±?SD values for 4?yo, 5?yo and 6?yo respectively are as follows: Resting HR: 47.5?±?7.2, 42.3?±?3.2, 41.3?±?5.4?bpm; HRcanter: 162.7?±?14.3, 156.9?±?17.3, 161.4?±?10.7?bpm; Vcanter: 22.6?±?0.9, 22.4?±?1.2, 23.3?±?1.6?km/h; HRsprint: 191.3?±?18.1, 181.7?±?18.5, 184.1?±?16.2?bpm; Vsprint: 30.3?±?3.0, 31.5?±?6.4, 35.3?±?6.9?km/h; V160: 25.8?±?3.5, 24.8?±?5.0, 27.1?±?5.8?km/h; V200: 36.8?±?6.1, 37.4?±?7.3, 44.3?±?10.9?km/h; Post-exercice lactatemia: 7.4?±?4.5, 13.5?±?3.6, 5.6?±?3.4?mmol/l. These values perfectly fit with those described previously for adult endurance horses. Conclusions The proposed field SET involved both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism reproducing the progress of an endurance race. Further studies are being conducted to discriminate if possible the effects of age from those of conditioning.

AB  - Introduction Exertional myopathies are a common cause of exercise intolerance in the equine athlete, and Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy (PSSM) is a widely described muscular disease. It is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal glycogen in myofibers due to a genetic defect in the skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1) enzyme. We hypothesized that energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in muscular mitochondria might be impaired in type-1 PSSM-affected horses. Methods Eight horses with a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis were tested for the GYS1 mutation. Muscle biopsies were collected and used for histological analysis and high resolution respirometry (HRR). HRR values from 3 groups of horses (5 PSSM-positive horses, 3 horses with a history of myopathy but PSSM-negative and 16 healthy controls) were compared using a linear mixed model to take into account repeated (2?3 times) measurements made for each horse. Results In 5/8 horses histology revealed an accumulation of abnormal glycogen in myofibers. These 5 horses also tested positive for the GYS1 mutation. A severe depression of maximal OXPHOS capacity was observed by HRR in 7/8 horses with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with lower values in PSSM-positive cases (4/5). Conclusions Our study shows a severely decreased OXPHOS capacity in PSSM-affected horses. PSSM is considered primarily a defect in glycogen synthesis but altered OXPHOS might play a central role in its pathogenesis.

AB  - Introduction In an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) for Icelandic horses, gaits are scored from 5?10 and there is an option for judges to add standardized comments on the gaits. The aim of this study was to test if comments given on pace were related to horses? plasma lactate concentration (Lac) post BEFT, with the hypothesis that some of the comments would be related to Lac. Methods Data was collected from 157 horses (age 4?11 years) at a BEFT in Iceland in 2011. Venous blood samples were obtained after exercise and lactate concentration determined. Judges? comments were obtained from Worldfengur. The comments that could be given were: ?good speed?, ?clear beat?, ?sure?, ?big movements?, ?good suspension?, ?long strides? (positive comments); and ?lack of speed?, ?unsure?, ?four-beat?, ?short strides?, ?changing gait? and ?jumping out of gait? (negative comments). Results were separated into two groups (within each comment); horses/pace with the comment and horses/pace without the comment. Data were analysed via ANOVA (Proc GLM, SAS) including sex, age group, comment, average speed and distance (P<0.05). Results Lac was higher when pace had comments ?good speed? and ?sure? than when no comment was given (23.6?±?1.2 vs. 17.9?±?0.5, P<0.001; and 20.2?±?0.9 vs. 18.1?±?0.6, P<0.05) and was lower when pace had comments ?lack of speed? and ?unsure? (16.8?±?1.0 vs. 19.2?±?0.6; and 16.2?±?1.0 vs. 19.3?±?0.5, P<0.05). No other significant effects on Lac were observed. Conclusions Horses with pace subjectively judged as fast and ?sure? had higher blood lactate concentration indicating that successful pace is more anaerobic than less successful pace. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the National Animal Research Committee of Iceland. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Introduction Calculating the total plasma concentration of carbon dioxide (ctCO2) from the results of blood gas and pH analysis assumes that the value for pK1? is constant and approximates 6.095. The objective of this study was to verify both assumptions in equine plasma. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected pre-race from 115 trained Standardbreds into 3?mL partially evacuated plastic tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood pH (pHb) and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) were measured in one tube using a blood gas and pH analyser (Radiometer ABL-700). The second tube was anaerobically centrifuged and ctCO2 was measured (Beckman EL-ISE analyser). Plasma pK1? was calculated for each horse using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, measured values for pHb, pCO2, and plasma ctCO2, and the value for the solubility of CO2 in plasma at 37C (S?=?0.0307?{mmol/L}/mmHg) whereby: pK1??=?(pHb?+?0.01)?log10({ctCO2-S???pCO2}/{S???pCO2}), with the term (pHb?+?0.01) representing the pH in plasma. The calculated value for pK1? was standardized to pHb?=?7.40 using the Severinghaus equation such that dpK1?/dpH?=??0.044. Non-parametric statistical procedures were used to determine the median value and 95% confidence interval (CI) for pK1?. Results The median value for pK1? at pHb?=?7.40 was 6.097, and the 95% CI for pK1? was 6.063?6.123. Conclusions The 95% CI for pK1? in equine plasma from trained Standardbreds is narrow and includes the assumed fixed value of 6.095. Our findings support the use of blood gas and pH analysis to calculate plasma ctCO2 in order to detect the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents in horses.

AB  - Introduction Differentiating left ventricular (LV) dilatation caused by aortic regurgitation (AR) from athletic eccentric LV hypertrophy can be challenging. In human medicine, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and 2D speckle tracking (2DST) are used to distinguish ?athlete's heart? from pathological conditions. Methods 40 healthy horses (group 1) were compared to 13 horses with moderate AR (group 2) and 11 horses with severe AR (group 3), all with an end diastolic LV internal diameter (LVIDd) within maximal reference limits (≤14.2?cm). Fractional shortening (FS) was measured from a short-axis M-mode at chordal level. Peak TDI velocities during systole (S), early (E) and late (A) diastole were measured in the LV free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IVS). Global longitudinal strain was measured by 2DST. Groups were compared by a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Results The study included Warmbloods (n?=?52), trotters (n?=?9) and Thoroughbreds (n?=?3), used for jumping, dressage, racing and eventing. Group 2 (15?±?5 years; P<0.001) and 3 (20?±?4 years; P<0.001) were older than group 1 (8?±?4 years). LVIDd in group 3 (13.1?±?0.7 cm) was higher compared to group 1 (11.5?±?0.8?cm; P<0.001) and 2 (12.0?±?0.8?cm; P?=?0.003) but FS was not different. Peak S in IVS was higher in group 2 (6.6?±?1.5?cm/s; P?=?0.001) and 3 (9.0?±?1.7?cm/s; P<0.001) compared to group 1 (4.4?±?1.8?cm/s), indicating hyperkinetic septal motion. Peak E in LVFW was lower in group 2 (18.6?±?5.2?cm/s;P?=?0.001) and 3 (19.3?±?3.9?cm/s; P?=?0.006) compared to group 1 (24.4?±?4.6?cm/s), indicating decreased early filling velocity. Longitudinal strain was not different between groups. Conclusions TDI shows potential for differentiating AR-induced LV remodeling from athletic eccentric hypertrophy in horses.

AB  - Introduction Measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is the gold standard for assessing aerobic capacity, but in horses requires use of stationary equipment and a high-speed treadmill. Study objectives were to evaluate a portable system designed to measure VO2 in a field setting and to describe these measurements in a cohort of untrained Thoroughbreds. Methods Ventilatory parameters and VO2 were measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbreds (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask with customized software validated for horses galloping on a treadmill with an open-circuit flow-through gas collection system. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. Data was collected as horses travelled riderless up a 2% inclined woodchip track. Pre- and 5 minute post-exercise plasma lactate ([La5]), HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded and analysed by unpaired t-test and Pearson's correlation (P ≤ 0.05). Results All horses tolerated the mask and saddle pad. Exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm and [La5] 22.7?±?5.5?mmol/l. Average VO2peak, based on 6 breaths, was 117.7?±?24.1?ml/kg/min, breathing frequency 125.8?±?7.1?bpm, inspiratory volume 13.2?±?1.7?L, expiratory volume 13.4?±?1.9?L and minute ventilation 1669.3?±?193.3?L/min. VO2peak was not significantly different between colts (112.2?±?27.7?ml/kg/min) and fillies (121.4?±?21.3?ml/kg/min). There were no correlations between VO2peak and other measured parameters. There was a positive linear correlation between VO2peak and HRpeak (P?=?0.046, R2?=?0.16). Conclusions VO2peak values were similar to published reports for yearling Thoroughbreds. The high exercise intensity and linear relationship between VO2peak and HRpeak provides confidence in the system for field studies of aerobic capacity in untrained, unridden horses.
