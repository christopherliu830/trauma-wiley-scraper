AB  - Introduction Horses have a large intestinal reserve of water and electrolytes that can be absorbed to replace sweat fluid losses during endurance exercise. As a consequence, the abdomen develops a ?tucked-up? appearance; however, data documenting changes in abdominal circumference during endurance exercise are lacking. Methods Abdominal circumference was measured directly (in triplicate with a measurement tape to nearest cm) every 15-km at three sites (front, middle, and back) in six 2-year-old Arabian horses that completed four 60-km bouts of treadmill exercise. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA and compared to body weight (BW) loss by correlation analysis. Results Abdominal circumference decreased at all three sites during the exercise test (1.8?±?0.7, 1.4?±?0.7, and 3.1?±?1.3?cm for front, middle, and back, respectively, [representing 1?2% of total circumference]) with the greatest decrease (>50% of total) occurring during the initial 15-km of the exercise test. Changes in abdominal circumference during each step of the exercise test were significantly correlated with BW changes (R values 0.18?0.39, P<0.05 for all). Conclusions These data support the clinical observation that the abdomen decreases in size during endurance exercise and that the largest changes are observed in the earlier stages of exercise, similar to the initial greater decrease in BW that has been documented in several studies during the initial half of endurance competitions.

AB  - Introduction Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Haemorrhage (EIPH) results from hypertensive episodes associated with intense exercise and can negatively impact athletic performance. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) secretion from pulmonary endothelium is increased during pulmonary disease. This study investigated the effects of furosemide administration on ACE activity, and hypothesised a positive association between EIPH and post-race plasma ACE. Methods Blood samples from 73 horses were collected after racing. ACE activity was measured using a fluorometric method. Respiratory endoscopy determined occurrence and grade of EIPH. Comparison of horses treated or not with furosemide before racing and the occurrence of EIPH were conducted by independent sample t-tests. In addition, regression analysis was used to investigate the association between ACE activity and EIPH grade for all horses. Other variables analysed included time to endoscopy and haematocrit. Results Mean ACE activity in horses not treated with furosemide (n?= 47; 91.7?±?15.9) was significantly higher (P?=?0.002) than in treated horses (n?=?26; 79.6?±?13.9). When EIPH positive horses were analysed separately, those treated with furosemide (n?=?20; ACE 78.2?±?11.9) had significantly lower ACE (P?=?0.009) than non-treated horses (n?=?17; ACE 90.9?±?15.9). Regression analysis indicated a polynomial relationship between mean ACE activity and EIPH grade (0, 1, 2 or 3?+?4?+?5; adjusted r2?=?0.99; P<0.001). No other comparisons were statistically significant. Conclusions Results indicated associations between ACE activity, EIPH grade and furosemide administration and investigation of the potential use of ACE as a biomarker for EIPH severity in controlled studies are warranted.

AB  - Introduction There are no refereed blinded controlled documentations of the skeletal analgesic efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone. The objective was to test the hypothesis that intravenous dexamethasone is more efficacious in alleviating lameness than placebo in a reversible adjustable heart bar shoe model of equine foot pain. Methods Eight healthy horses (7 Thoroughbreds, 1 Warmblood, aged 6.5?±?3.3 years, age range 2?11 years) underwent weekly intravenous treatments 1 hour after lameness induction. Treatments were isotonic saline placebo at 1?ml/45?kg bwt, or dexamethasone (2?mg/ml in polyethylene glycol) at 0.045?mg/kg bwt, a typical dose used twice daily in the USA for anti-inflammatory effect. Treatments were randomly assigned and administered by a co-investigator who had no input on Heart Rate (HR) and Lameness Score (LS) measurements. Another investigator unaware of treatment assignments monitored HR and LS every 20?min for 5 hours after lameness induction and then hourly through 12 hours post-treatment. One week later treatment assignments were reversed and the experiment was repeated. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test were used to identify significant effects at P<0.05. Results After treatment, mean HR and LS were not different between treatments (P>0.05). HR and LS remained elevated over pre-lameness values throughout the 13-hour post-lameness monitoring period (P<0.05). Conclusions It was concluded that intravenous dexamethasone was no more effective than saline placebo. Neither treatment was effective at alleviating lameness over a 12-hour post-treatment period in this model. Dexamethasone at 0.045?mg/kg bwt should not affect acute foot lameness during equine exercise or performance.

AB  - Introduction Gastric ulcers are commonly found in equine athletes and there is evidence suggesting phenylbutazone may increase the incidence. In human athletes, gastric permeability has been shown to increase with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use with potential to negatively affect performance and recovery. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phenylbutazone on gastric mucosa and permeability. Methods 18 Arabian horses were examined via gastroscopy on day 0, 42, 49, 56, and 63, with ulceration in both the squamous and glandular regions scored from 0 to 4. For seven days commencing after the day 42 evaluation, horses received 4.4?mg/kg BW phenylbutazone twice daily PO. On day 49, sucrose (1?g/kg bwt) was administered via nasogastric tube, with blood and urine samples collected for 90?min and 4?h, respectively, to assess gastric permeability. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 with Proc MIXED. Results Ulcer scores increased from day 42 to day 49 (P<0.0001) with prevalence of grade 2 or greater ulceration being 33% on day 42 compared with 94% on day 49. Scores decreased from day 49 to 56 and, though continuing to decrease, had not returned to baseline scores by day 63. Squamous scores increased from day 0 to day 49 and remained elevated through day 63, while glandular scores were highest on day 49 but had decreased by day 56 (P<0.05). Sucrose concentration increased (P<0.0001) in both plasma and urine after phenylbutazone administration. Conclusions Besides exacerbating gastric ulcers, phenylbutazone contributes to gastric permeability and, particularly when combined with strenuous exercise, may impair recovery and increase illness susceptibility.

AB  - Introduction In endurance racing, horses are required to complete distances of up to 160?km in a single day. To date, the energy expenditure (EE) of such effort has not been quantified. This study aimed to evaluate EE during a 160?km endurance race from heart rate (HR) monitoring. Methods Three weeks before competing, two endurance horses (H1 and H2) were submitted to a field exercise test to determine their individual VO2-HR relationship. VO2 and HR were recorded simultaneously at trot (13?14?km/h for 10?min), and at canter (18?19?km/h for 10?min, and 22?23?km/h for 5?min), using the equine K4b2, a portable metabolic measurement system. H1 was then enrolled in Monpazier CEI and H2 in Florac CEI. HR was monitored from 2 minutes before the start to the finishing line of each loop. EE of exercise was calculated from individual VO2-HR relationship and caloric equivalent of oxygen. Results H1 and H2 completed the race at an average speed of 17.02 and 14.46?km/h, respectively. Mean HR was 108?±?8 and 124?±?24 and peak HR was 169 and 204 for H1 and H2, respectively. The proportion of time spent at HR≥180 was 0 and 2.7% for H1 and H2 respectively. EE of exercise was evaluated at 177 and 240?MJ for H1 and H2 respectively. Conclusions A 160-km endurance race might present a considerable energy cost, at least 5 times the EE of non-working state.

AB  - Introduction High concentrate diets increase the risk of several health problems and high energy forage diets could therefore be an alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the number of horses and the number of races performed at the age of three by a group of 16 Standardbred horses fed a forage only-diet from the age of 1.5 years (F) with the results of their siblings (S). Methods To F-horses, a forage diet was offered ad libitum (10.2?11.7?MJ metabolisable energy, 10?16% crude protein/kg dry matter) and supplemented daily with minerals and vitamins to meet requirements. F-horses were trained by pupils at the National Trotting School during supervision of professional trainers. For each individual in the F-group, the mean racing results from a maximum of five older siblings (same mother) were used for the S-group (5 siblings, n?=?9; 4-3 siblings, n?=?4 and 1?2 siblings, n?=?3). The siblings selected were born closest in time in relation to the F individual. S-horses were trained by different trainers and it was assumed that they had been fed a conventional high concentrate diet. Racing results were obtained from the Swedish Trotting Association. ANOVA and a Tukey test were used to analyse differences between groups. Results There was no difference in the number of horses that competed (F: 56% vs S: 54%, SE 10) and in the number of races performed (F: 1.6 vs S: 2.9, SE 0.5). Conclusions The study indicates that a forage-only diet may not be a limitation to achieve conventional training results and could therefore be an alternative to conventional diets.

AB  - Introduction Marcha is typically a low intensity/medium duration exercise that has the potential to induce oxidative stress. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that supplementation with oil would alter biomarkers of oxidative stress in four-beat gaited horses during marcha training. Methods Eleven gaited horses underwent training for 60?min (?60% consisting of marcha at ?3.5?m/s) 3?d/wk for eight weeks. Subjects were fed elephant grass (?15?kg/day) and concentrate (?5?kg/day). They were also supplemented with 300?mL of oil per os (vitamin E: 300?IU/kg, omega-3: 300?g/kg; omega-6: 80?g/kg) and had free access to water and salt. Blood samples were collected before and after four and eight weeks of supplementation for the measurement of GPx, SOD, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, TPP, urea, creatinine and uric acid. ANOVA and Tukey tests were used for statistical analysis (P<0.05). Results Increases in GPx (?12%), SOD (?51%) and uric acid (?19%) were observed after 8 week of supplementation (P<0.05). There were changes (P<0.05) in [urea] and [creatinine]; however, there were no changes (P>0.05) in RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit or WBC. Published research has demonstrated that administration of supplements with antioxidants enhances the antioxidant system and protects against oxidative stress during exercise. Supplementation with oil, rich in vitamin E, omega-3 and -6, produced a beneficial increase in antioxidant capacity in gaited horses during training. Conclusions The elevation in [GPx], [SOD] and [uric acid] in the present study offers a strategy to counterbalance the physiologic processes that overwhelm endogenous antioxidants during training.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -? Prion diseases ?? Future perspectives The stimuli for neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative disorders are multi-factorial and may include genetic predisposition, environmental factors, cellular stressors such as oxidative stress and free radical production, bioenergy failure, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, disruption of Ca2+-regulating systems, mitochondrial dysfunction and misfolded protein accumulation. Cellular stress disrupts functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a critical organelle for protein quality control, leading to induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress may contribute to neurodegeneration in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the molecular events occurring during ER stress and the unfolded protein response and it specifically evaluates the evidence suggesting the ER stress response plays a role in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Summary Urine is a natural by-product of metabolism. It is a liquid vehicle by which waste is eliminated from the body. Normal urine is one of many shades of yellow, depending upon the degree to which it is concentrated. The yellow hue results from one of urine's constituents, partially oxidized urobilinogen. Various pathologies may cause urine to take on an abnormal color. Browns, oranges, and creams are observed in various diseased states; however, red urine is most commonly seen in clinical practice. The appropriate medical term for red urine is hematuria. Hematuria reflects the presence of blood in the urine. The etiologies of hematuria are diverse. Hematuria most often results from bleeding disorders, urinary tract infection (UTI), and urinary tract inflammation. Urinary tract obstruction (UTO), urolithiasis, and neoplasia were discussed in Chapter 65 as additional causes of hematuria. This chapter emphasizes UTI and feline idiopathic cystitis as two frequent causes of hematuria in the dog and cat. Urinalysis and urine culture with sensitivity testing are important diagnostic tools that can facilitate case management.

AB  - Two littermates, a young male and female boxer, were admitted to the Utrecht University?s Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals within a three month period. Both dogs suffered from anaemia caused by chronic intestinal blood loss, vomiting and weight loss. In both cases, there was no response to conservative medical management. Eventually, the dogs suffered significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage that resulted in collapse. Gastroduodenoscopy and exploratory surgery showed a duodenal diverticulum in both dogs. This is the first report that describes this congenital anomaly in two siblings.

AB  - Abstract A scoping review was conducted to characterise evaluations of community-based exercise programmes (CBEPs) delivered by fitness instructors to people with neurological conditions. Literature published from 1946 to April 2014 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the grey literature were searched. Search terms included community, programme, exercise, adult, brain disease and spinal cord disease. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. One author reviewed full-text articles to evaluate eligibility. Studies were included if the study objective was to evaluate an exercise programme, the programme was community-based and delivered by fitness instructors, exercise participants were ≥18 years of age and had a neurological condition, and a full-text article was available and written in English. After reviewing 1785 titles and abstracts, 18 (1.01%) articles describing 15 studies were included in the review. One author completed data abstraction from the included studies. A second reviewer independently verified the extracted data for accuracy. Exercise programmes most commonly included people with stroke (47%) and Parkinson's disease (40%), incorporated a stand-alone (80%), multi-component (20%), group (67%), individual (20%) and combined format (13%), strength training (40%) and functional/task-oriented training (40%), reported a minimum walking requirement (67%), and involved a healthcare professional (HCP) with various roles (53%), including training (27%), advising and supporting (33%). The most commonly examined participant outcomes were health-related quality of life (60%) and functional balance (47%). More research is needed to develop CBEPs targeting individuals with low ambulatory function and multiple neurological conditions, to develop recommendations for the involvement of HCPs in CBEPs and document their involvement, and to evaluate system-level outcomes such as cost, healthcare utilisation and impact on caregivers. The findings support a number of considerations to guide future research into CBEPs delivered by fitness instructors for individuals with neurological conditions.

AB  - Emesis is a common presenting sign in small animal practice. It requires a rational approach to management that is based upon a sound understanding of pathophysiology combined with logical decision making. This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Application of the lactose 13C-ureide breath test (LUBT) for measurement of equine orocaecal transit time (OCTT) has not been reported previously. The ability to assess OCTT noninvasively, and to investigate its relationship to gastric emptying rate and small intestinal transit, would be of both clinical and research value. Objectives: 1) Assessment of the LUBT in healthy horses, with comparison of induced versus noninduced test protocols. 2) Application of a new dual stable isotope breath test (lactose 13C-ureide and 13C-octanoic acid) for gastrointestinal transit measurement. Hypothesis: The LUBT will allow quantification of equine OCTT, and test efficacy will be enhanced by prior administration of lactose 12C-ureide as shown in vitro. The dual tracer breath test will permit simultaneous measurement of gastric emptying, OCTT and small bowel transit times. Methods: Induced and noninduced LUBTs were performed in 3 healthy mature horses in randomised order using a standard test meal and protocol. Combined LUBT and 13C-octanoic acid breath tests (13C-OABT) were performed in 4 individuals on 4 occasions at weekly intervals. Expiratory isotopic recovery was modelled to allow generation of gastric emptying data, small bowel transit times and caecal transit parameters. Results: The induction protocol for the LUBT increased the rate and magnitude of expiratory 13CO2 significantly. Mean ± s.d. values for OCTT, caecal lag phase (tlag) and caecal t1/2 using the induced LUBT were 3.24 ± 0.65 h, 5.62 ± 1.22 h and 6.31 ± 1.21 h, respectively. Dual stable isotope tests resulted in the production of 2 discrete peaks in expiratory 13CO2 in 15/16 tests from which gastric t1/2, OCTT and small bowel transit (SBT) parameters could be calculated. Conclusions: The induced LUBT provides a reliable noninvasive measure of equine OCTT and can be paired with the 13C-OABT to provide further information about small intestinal motility.

AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

AB  - Summary Priapism due to sickle cell disease is a common but less well characterized complication of the disorder. It represents a ?medical emergency? with the key determinant of outcome being the duration of penile ischaemia and time to detumescence of <4 h associated with a successful treatment outcome. Management can be outpatient-based and consists of pre-emptive strategies for early stuttering attacks based on prior health education of the association between the 2 disorders, non pharmacological management, outpatient penile aspiration and irrigation with or without instillation of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists for acute episodes and secondary prophylaxis to prevent the high rates of recurrences. The evidence to recommend medical prophylaxis is sparse but based on a consensus of experts and small phase 2 or III clinical trials. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) involving normal and dysregulated erectile physiology, scavenger haemolysis and nitric oxide pathway paves way for the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in medical prophylaxis of stuttering attacks. These agents will need to be studied in multi-centre randomized phase III trials before they become standard of care. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to enhance ?sexual wellness? and prevent erectile dysfunction in this sexually vulnerable group.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Resilience and recovery are of increasing importance in the field of alcohol dependence (AD). This paper describes how imaging studies in man can be used to assess the neurobiological correlates of resilience and, if longitudinal, of disease trajectories, progression rates and markers for recovery to inform treatment and prevention options. Methods Original papers on recovery and resilience in alcohol addiction and its neurobiological correlates were identified from PubMed and have been analyzed and condensed within a systematic literature review. Results Findings deriving from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies have identified links between increased resilience and less task-elicited neural activation within the basal ganglia, and benefits of heightened neural pre-frontal cortex (PFC) engagement regarding resilience in a broader sense; namely, resilience against relapse in early abstinence of AD. Furthermore, findings consistently propose at least partial recovery of brain glucose metabolism and executive and general cognitive functioning, as well as structural plasticity effects throughout the brain of alcohol-dependent patients during the course of short-, medium- and long-term abstinence, even when patients only lowered their alcohol consumption to a moderate level. Additionally, specific factors were found that appear to influence these observed brain recovery processes in AD, e.g. genotype-dependent neuronal (re)growth, gender-specific neural recovery effects, critical interfering effects of psychiatric comorbidities, additional smoking or marijuana influences or adolescent alcohol abuse. Conclusions Neuroimaging research has uncovered neurobiological markers that appear to be linked to resilience and improved recovery capacities that are furthermore influenced by various factors such as gender or genetics. Consequently, future system-oriented approaches may help to establish a broad neuroscience-based research framework for alcohol dependence.

AB  - A 12-month-old beagle presented for anorexia, pyrexia and vomiting. The dog had been treated intermittently with antibiotics and corticosteroids for inappetence and lethargy since five months of age. Previous laboratory abnormalities included macrocytosis and neutropenia. At presentation, the dog was lethargic, febrile and thin. Laboratory examination findings included anaemia, a left shift, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Multiple, small, hypoechoic, round hepatic lesions were observed on abdominal ultrasound. Cytological examination of hepatic fine needle aspirates revealed a fungal infection and associated pyogranulomatous inflammation. The dog's general condition deteriorated despite supportive measures and treatment with fluconazole, and owners opted for euthanasia before hypocobalaminaemia was identified. Subsequent genomic analysis revealed a CUBN:c.786delC mutation in a homozygous state, confirming hereditary cobalamin malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Similar to human infants, dogs with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome may rarely be presented for infectious diseases, distracting focus from the underlying primary disorder.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are often culture-expanded in vitro. Presently, expansion medium (EM) for MSC is supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, increasing cost, variable composition and potential risks associated with bovine antigens call for alternatives. Platelet lysate (PL) has shown promise as an alternative supplement. Objectives To determine how equine umbilical cord blood (CB) MSC proliferate in EM enriched with PL or FBS at various concentrations. Study design Randomised dose escalation study. Methods Platelet concentrate was generated from 5 equine whole blood samples through a double centrifugation method and standardised to 1 ? 1012 platelets/l prior to a freeze/thaw cycle to produce PL. Pooled PL or pooled FBS was added to EM at concentrations of 5% to 60%. Proliferation of 4 equine CB-MSC cultures was determined after 4 days using a resazurin semiquantitative assay. Results Cord blood-MSC proliferated with a dose-dependent response with no significant difference found between PL and FBS up to a 30% concentration. Beyond 30%, proliferation fell in the PL-cultured cells, while continued dose-dependent proliferation was noted in the FBS-cultured cells. Despite reduced cell numbers in high PL concentrations, live/dead staining revealed that adherent cells remained viable. Conclusions Expansion medium enriched with PL can support short-term equine CB-MSC proliferation at conventional culture concentrations. Based on the unexpected suppression of CB-MSC at higher PL concentrations, an in vivo dose study is indicated to investigate if combinational therapies of CB-MSC and platelet-rich plasma are associated with synergistic or antagonistic effect on CB-MSC function.

AB  - This report describes a case of neutrophilic dermatosis in a dog, with a number of clinical and pathological similarities to human pyoderma gangrenosum. A seven-year-old, female German shepherd dog with a history of non-erosive idiopathic polyarthritis was presented with severe facial swelling, bilateral erosivoulcerative lesions on the muzzle and multiple, eroded, dermal-subcutaneous nodules on the cranial trunk. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a necrotising neutrophilic dermatitis. No infectious agents could be detected using specific stains, immunohistochemistry, serology and bacterial aerobic, anaerobic or fungal cultures. A sterile neutrophilic dermatosis resembling human pyoderma gangrenosum was presumptively diagnosed, and the patient showed an excellent response to treatment with prednisone and ciclosporin.
