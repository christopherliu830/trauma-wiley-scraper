AB  - Summary This chapter deals with those syndromes whose primary symptomatology is characterized by acquired impairments in one or more cognitive domains. Under DSM-5, these syndromes are collectively referred to as the ?Neurocognitive Disorders.? In the chapter, under ?Major Neurocognitive Disorder,? the syndromes of dementia and amnestic disorder are treated separately. After treating delirium, major neurocognitive disorder (including dementia and amnestic disorder), and minor neurocognitive disorder, the chapter turns to a number of disorders, each considered in DSM-5, which, if merely mild, may cause a minor neurocognitive disorder and which, if more severe, may cause a major neurocognitive disorder. These disorders include: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance-induced neurocognitive disorders (e.g., alcoholic dementia), HIV infection, prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease), Parkinson's disease and, finally, Huntington's disease.

AB  - This report describes a case of neutrophilic dermatosis in a dog, with a number of clinical and pathological similarities to human pyoderma gangrenosum. A seven-year-old, female German shepherd dog with a history of non-erosive idiopathic polyarthritis was presented with severe facial swelling, bilateral erosivoulcerative lesions on the muzzle and multiple, eroded, dermal-subcutaneous nodules on the cranial trunk. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a necrotising neutrophilic dermatitis. No infectious agents could be detected using specific stains, immunohistochemistry, serology and bacterial aerobic, anaerobic or fungal cultures. A sterile neutrophilic dermatosis resembling human pyoderma gangrenosum was presumptively diagnosed, and the patient showed an excellent response to treatment with prednisone and ciclosporin.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are often culture-expanded in vitro. Presently, expansion medium (EM) for MSC is supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, increasing cost, variable composition and potential risks associated with bovine antigens call for alternatives. Platelet lysate (PL) has shown promise as an alternative supplement. Objectives To determine how equine umbilical cord blood (CB) MSC proliferate in EM enriched with PL or FBS at various concentrations. Study design Randomised dose escalation study. Methods Platelet concentrate was generated from 5 equine whole blood samples through a double centrifugation method and standardised to 1 ? 1012 platelets/l prior to a freeze/thaw cycle to produce PL. Pooled PL or pooled FBS was added to EM at concentrations of 5% to 60%. Proliferation of 4 equine CB-MSC cultures was determined after 4 days using a resazurin semiquantitative assay. Results Cord blood-MSC proliferated with a dose-dependent response with no significant difference found between PL and FBS up to a 30% concentration. Beyond 30%, proliferation fell in the PL-cultured cells, while continued dose-dependent proliferation was noted in the FBS-cultured cells. Despite reduced cell numbers in high PL concentrations, live/dead staining revealed that adherent cells remained viable. Conclusions Expansion medium enriched with PL can support short-term equine CB-MSC proliferation at conventional culture concentrations. Based on the unexpected suppression of CB-MSC at higher PL concentrations, an in vivo dose study is indicated to investigate if combinational therapies of CB-MSC and platelet-rich plasma are associated with synergistic or antagonistic effect on CB-MSC function.

AB  - Two dogs were presented within 24 hours to the Department of Small Animal Medicine and Surgery at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover for investigation of the sudden onset of neurological abnormalities following a walk in the same park. One dog was observed ingesting a piece of meat. Analysis of urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from each of the dogs identified the presence of barbiturates. Both dogs recovered with supportive treatment. This is the first report to describe the use of toxicological urinalysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the diagnosis of barbiturate intoxication in dogs.

AB  - This is the first annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Rather than publish only new references, the previous list has been totally revised. Approximately one quarter of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. In addition, the bibliography has been expanded to include a number of new topics, with over one hundred more references. In preparing this revised list, many good articles were, of necesssity, excluded. The number of publications pertinent to clinical geriatrics has grown quickly over the past year. Preference, as before, was given to recent publications, since they usually provide a list of the important earlier articles. Most of the references are less than five years old; the exceptions deal with specific issues not covered as well in the subsequent literature. An occasional review article is cited to cover gaps in the geriatric literature or merely to amplify aspects of common diseases that have been widely ignored outside of geriatric medicine. Most of the references selected deal specifically with an elderly patient population. Exceptions include those dealing with diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study from a geriatric viewpoint exists, e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. All studies in geriatrics are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, relative obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The first set of references (I) includes synopses on the causation of aging, the second (II) on the systems known to degenerate with advancing age. The next two topics (III, IV) are clinically related: one deals with the basic distinctions of the geriatric patient and the other with the ancillary services available. As geriatrics is basically a multidisciplinary field, the bulk of the references are cited by pertinent specialty.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study This is the first study comparing stemness features of equine mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from amniotic membrane and bone marrow. Objectives To investigate an alternative and noninvasive stromal cell source for equine tissue engineering. Study design In vitro experimental study of the characteristics of equine mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from amnion and bone marrow. Methods Cells isolated from amniotic membrane and bone marrow were analysed for proliferation (growth curve, doubling time, colony forming unit). Immunocytochemical detection of pluripotency markers and gene expression of stromal cell markers were also performed and these cells were studied for multilineage plasticity. Results Amniotic stromal cells (AMSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BM-MSCs) both exhibited mature stromal cell-specific gene expression and immunocytochemical properties, but showed substantial differences in their proliferative and differentiation potential. The mean doubling time for AMSCs was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that observed for BM-MSCs (1.17 ± 0.15 vs. 3.27 ± 0.19 days, respectively). Compared to AMSCs, BM-MSCs also demonstrated a significantly (P<0.05) lower clonogenic capability (one fibroblast-like colony forming unit from a mean of 590.15 cells seeded for BM-MSCs vs. 242.73 cells seeded for AMSCs). BM-MSCs did not differentiate into glial cells, and the osteogenic differentiation process was longer than for AMSCs. Conclusions and potential relevance The amniotic membrane could be a valuable source of MSCs to be used both for allogenic and/or autologous therapies. The noninvasive nature and low cost of collection, the rapid proliferation along with a greater differentiation potential and the ?off the shelf? preparation potential could make AMCs useful for cell therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings, underlying etiologies, treatment, and outcome associated with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) in cats; and to identify clinical feature differences among cats with asthma associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (AASSP) versus nonasthma-associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (NAASSP). Design Retrospective case series. Setting University teaching hospital. Animals Sixteen client-owned cats with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Domestic short hair was the predominant breed in this study (n = 15). The median age was 8 years old (range: 7 weeks to 17 years) with no sex predilection. Fourteen cats were affected by multi-lobar pulmonary pathology of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes. Asthma was the most common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax (25%). Ten of 12 treated cats survived the initial episode of spontaneous pneumothorax to discharge with medical management, including all 4 cats with AASSP. Reoccurrence was documented in 4 cats. Pulmonary lobectomy was curative for 1 cat with congenital accessory lung lobe emphysema. No difference in clinical presentation was identified between cats with AASSP and cats with NAASSP. Conclusions Feline SSP is frequently associated with extensive pulmonary pathology. Supportive medical management is most appropriate, except in rare cases with focal congenital abnormalities that may benefit from surgical intervention. AASSP appears to carry a good prognosis for short-term outcome (survival to discharge). Clinical assessment, imaging, and invasive diagnostics were required to differentiate between AASSP and NAASSP.

AB  - ABSTRACT A retrospective study of 27 dogs with deep mycoses was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of initial laboratory results in determining a diagnosis. Fifteen cases of disseminated blastomycosis, five cases of disseminated histoplasmosis and seven cases of gastrointestinal phycomycosis were studied. Haematologic results consistent with a chronic inflammatory disease (mild to moderate anaemia and moderate to marked monocytosis) were common findings in blastomycosis and phycomycosis. Cases of histoplasmosis were characterized by a more severe anaemia with a neutrophilia and left shift. The severe anaemia present in three out of five (3/5) dogs with histoplasmosis was apparently due to myelophthisis and intravascular erythrocyte fragmentation. Coagulation function tests and/or the haemograms suggested the presence of microangiopathic haemolysis in four dogs with histoplasmosis. Clinical chemistry results in blastomycosis and phycomycosis were usually unremarkable. Hepatic lesions in histoplasmosis were suggested by increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and decreases in serum albumin. Cytology was frequently diagnostic for blastomycosis (11/13 cases) and histoplasmosis (3/4 cases) but was inconsistent in phycomycosis (1/3 cases).

AB  - ABSTRACT Dilated cardiomyopathy is the usual cause of congestive heart failure in the dobermann pinscher and was the presumptive diagnosis in an eight-year-old female dobermann pinscher presented for dyspnoea and syncope. This was supported by thoracic radiography and electrocardiographic evidence of ventricular tachycardia. An echocardiogram revealed a left atrial tumour as the principal cause of cardiac failure. Pathological examination confirmed that the tumour was a large aortic body carcinoma in an unusual location. Multifocal myocardial infarctions were also found. This unusual case demonstrates the importance of a complete cardiological examination as part of a diagnostic work up and confirms the necessity of echocardiography as one of the examination methods.

AB  - Abstract Probe techniques for monitoring in vivo chemistry (e.g., electrochemical sensors and microdialysis sampling probes) have significantly contributed to a better understanding of neurotransmission in correlation to behaviors and neurological disorders. Microfabrication allows construction of neural probes with high reproducibility, scalability, design flexibility, and multiplexed features. This technology has translated well into fabricating miniaturized neurochemical probes for electrochemical detection and sampling. Microfabricated electrochemical probes provide a better control of spatial resolution with multisite detection on a single compact platform. This development allows the observation of heterogeneity of neurochemical activity precisely within the brain region. Microfabricated sampling probes are starting to emerge that enable chemical measurements at high spatial resolution and potential for reducing tissue damage. Recent advancement in analytical methods also facilitates neurochemical monitoring at high temporal resolution. Furthermore, a positive feature of microfabricated probes is that they can be feasibly built with other sensing and stimulating platforms including optogenetics. Such integrated probes will empower researchers to precisely elucidate brain function and develop novel treatments for neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background and objective:? Many trace elements play important roles in activating or inhibiting enzymatic reactions, by competing with other elements and metalloproteins for binding sites, by affecting the permeability of cell membranes and by other mechanisms. They play important roles in the oxidant/antioxidant balance. As such, trace elements are thought to be involved directly or indirectly in the pathogenesis of several diseases. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect trace elements (Se, Mn and Zn) intravenously administered on the period the COPD patients spend on mechanical ventilation. Methods:? In a randomized double-blinded controlled trial a set of 120 subjects (40 normal volunteers and 80 COPD) were recruited. Serum concentration levels of Se, Mn and Zn were determined for all enrolled subjects with Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy. COPD patients received intravenous supplementation of the above trace elements and the period the patients spent on mechanical ventilation was determined. Results:? There was a significant reduction (P?=?0.013) in the period the patients with COPD spent on the mechanical ventilation when received intravenous supplementation (9.4?±?7.3?days) compared with the COPD patients who received placebo (17.8?±?7.6?days). Conclusions:? Trace element (Se, Mn and Zn) status is altered in critically ill patients with COPD. The supplementation achieved a reduction in the period those patients spent on the mechanical ventilation. A larger multi-centre trial is required to confirm this preventive effect and to explore its applicability to other critical care conditions.

AB  - A 72-year-old female, who had slight impaired glucose tolerance, was diagnosed the second stage of carcinoma of the vulva. On the second day after radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphadenectomy, the center of the wound changed color into deep purple. On the 8th postoperative days, the swelling of the wound extended over the mons pubis and a thigh, so the infected wound, which reached the epimysium, was opened for the debridement. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram negative bacilli were detected from the wound. Firstly, the wound was cleaned by a physiological salt solution, streptokinase, and sulfadiazine silver. The gynecologist and nurses in charge discussed about the therapy under the consultation of a dermatologist and treated the wound by the wet treatment that a piece of gauze moisten by a physiological salt solution was exchanged 3 or 4 times a day after disinfecting by povidone iodine. On the13th postoperative days, the infection was controlled and on the19th days the skin was grafted from a thigh. After the successful skin grafting the patient was discharged. Carcinoma of the vulva tends to occur in elder women. Wounds are often dissociated because of an interruption in the circulation by the excessive extension of the skin. From the successful experience of wet treatment after a surgical wound infection, we recognized the necessity of close observation on surgical site and the importance of cooperation of the doctors and the nurses in charge.

AB  - Abstract Some nuclear-encoded proteins are imported into higher plant plastids via the endomembrane (EM) system. Compared with multi-protein Toc and Tic translocons required for most plastid protein import, the relatively uncomplicated nature of EM trafficking led to suggestions that it was the original transport mechanism for nuclear-encoded endosymbiont proteins, and critical for the early stages of plastid evolution. Its apparent simplicity disappears, however, when EM transport is considered in light of selective constraints likely encountered during the conversion of stable endosymbionts into fully integrated organelles. From this perspective it is more parsimonious to presume the early evolution of post-translational protein import via simpler, ancestral forms of modern Toc and Tic plastid translocons, with EM trafficking arising later to accommodate glycosylation and/or protein targeting to multiple cellular locations. This hypothesis is supported by both empirical and comparative data, and is consistent with the relative paucity of EM-based transport to modern primary plastids.

Chronic colic was defined as colic signs observed, daily for 3 days or longer, except when masked by analgesics. The diagnosed causes of chronic colic included colonic impaction (31%), peritonitis (16%), enteritis/colitis (7%), colonic displacement/torsion (6%) and lymphosarcoma (4%). A variety of other diseases were diagnosed in a small number of cases, including intestinal adhesions, ileal obstructions, grass sickness, liver disease, caecal impactions, thromboembolic disease, intussusceptions etc. No diagnosis was reached in 8% of cases. Diagnosis was relatively easily achieved in most cases of colonic impaction and peritonitis by results of transrectal palpation and evaluation of peritoneal fluid. Specific clinical features, transrectal palpation, abdominal paracentesis and laboratory evaluations of blood were helpful in the diagnosis of some of the other diseases, but exploratory laparotomy remained necessary in a few cases to achieve a diagnosis.

AB  - Summary Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare multi-organ recessive disease mainly characterised by pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal defects, short stature and bone marrow failure (BMF). As in many other BMF syndromes, SDS patients are predisposed to develop a number of haematopoietic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. However, the mechanism of cancer predisposition in SDS patients is only partially understood. In light of the emerging role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the regulation of bone marrow homeostasis, we assessed the ability of MSCs derived from SDS patients (SDS-MSCs) to recreate a functional bone marrow niche, taking advantage of a murine heterotopic MSC transplant model. We show that the ability of semi-cartilaginous pellets (SCPs) derived from SDS-MSCs to generate complete heterotopic ossicles in vivo is severely impaired in comparison with HD-MSC-derived SCPs. Specifically, after in vitro angiogenic stimuli, SDS-MSCs showed a defective ability to form correct networks, capillary tubes and vessels and displayed a marked decrease in VEGFA expression. Altogether, these findings unveil a novel mechanism of SDS-mediated haematopoietic dysfunction based on hampered ability of SDS-MSCs to support angiogenesis. Overall, MSCs could represent a new appealing therapeutic target to treat dysfunctional haematopoiesis in paediatric SDS patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The regrowth of amputated appendage extremities and the distal tips of digits represent models of tissue regeneration in multiple vertebrate taxa. In humans, digit tip injuries, including traumatic amputation and crush injuries, are among the most common type of injury to the human hand. Despite clinical reports demonstrating natural regeneration of appendages in lower vertebrates and human digits, current treatment options are suboptimal, and are complicated by the anatomical complexities and functions of the different tissues within the digits. Results: In light of these challenges, we focus on recent advancements in understanding appendage regeneration from model organisms. We pay special attention to the cellular programs underlying appendage regeneration, where cumulative data from salamanders, fish, frogs, and mice indicate that regeneration occurs by the actions of lineage-restricted precursors. We focus on pathologic states and the interdependency that exists, in both humans and animal models, between the nail organ and the peripheral nerves for successful regeneration. Conclusions: The increased understanding of regeneration in animal models may open new opportunities for basic and translational research aimed at understanding the mechanisms that support limb regeneration, as well as amelioration of limb abnormalities and pathologies.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.
