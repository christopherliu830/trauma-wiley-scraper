AB  - Immunoassays have long been an important set of tools in clinical laboratories for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Over the last two decades, there has been growing interest in utilizing CE as a means for conducting immunoassays with clinical samples. The resulting method is known as a CE immunoassay. This approach makes use of the selective and strong binding of antibodies for their targets, as is employed in a traditional immunoassay, and combines this with the speed, efficiency, and small sample requirements of CE. This review discusses the variety of ways in which CE immunoassays have been employed with clinical samples. An overview of the formats and detection modes that have been employed in these applications is first presented. A more detailed discussion is then given on the type of clinical targets and samples that have been measured or studied by using CE immunoassays. Particular attention is given to the use of this method in the fields of endocrinology, pharmaceutical measurements, protein and peptide analysis, immunology, infectious disease detection, and oncology. Representative applications in each of these areas are described, with these examples involving work with both traditional and microanalytical CE systems.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The aim of this study was to establish a standardized approach to the initial care of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS). DKA and HHS are metabolic emergencies. Effective and efficient management is the responsibility of the multidisciplinary team. The admission of patients to the intensive care unit (ICU) with DKA and HHS is rare, and management of patients? diverse problems is prone to error because of a lack of familiarity. Aim:? The paper?s aim is to set the developmental process of a clinical guideline following a review of the literature. Discussion:? This clinical guideline is based on a review of the evidence available within the literature in the early phase of resuscitation. Collaborative working among the multidisciplinary team through clinical practice group was the method adopted. Management of DKA and HHS is divided into three main areas: intravenous fluid replacement, insulin therapy and electrolyte management. The controversy associated with the administration of sodium bicarbonate is discussed. Conclusion:? Effective treatment requires a rapid initial assessment of the patient based on current medical history and clinical presentation. To this end, a quick reference algorithm and guide to management were also developed. Key criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment are provided and complications of treatment are addressed. The formation of the practice development group that led to this innovation is outlined, and in conclusion, the success of the group is reflected upon.

AB  - Abstract Recent advancements in bioanalytical techniques have led to the development of novel and robust diagnostic approaches that hold promise for providing optimal patient treatment, guiding prevention programs and widening the scope of personalized medicine. However, these advanced diagnostic techniques are still complex, expensive and limited to centralized healthcare facilities or research laboratories. This significantly hinders the use of evidence-based diagnostics for resource-limited settings and the primary care, thus creating a gap between healthcare providers and patients, leaving these populations without access to precision and quality medicine. Smartphone-based imaging and sensing platforms are emerging as promising alternatives for bridging this gap and decentralizing diagnostic tests offering practical features such as portability, cost-effectiveness and connectivity. Moreover, towards simplifying and automating bioanalytical techniques, biosensors and lab-on-a-chip technologies have become essential to interface and integrate these assays, bringing together the high precision and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques with the connectivity and computational power of smartphones. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of clinical smartphone diagnostics and its contributing technologies, as well as their wide range of areas of application, which span from haematology to digital pathology and rapid infectious disease diagnostics.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to explore the effects and mechanisms of Icarisid II (ICA-II) on enhancing the cellular cGMP in rat corpus cavernosum tissue (RCCT). Diabetes mellitus Wistar rats were induced by streptozotocin, and diabetic ED rats were selected for the RCCT culture by apomorphine. ICA-II was extracted and purified from Icariin (ICA) by enzymatic method. The RCCT was treated with ICA-II, ICA and Sildenafil at different concentrations. cGMP and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities were checked respectively by enzyme immunoassay. Meanwhile, nNOS, iNOS and eNOS in RCCT were checked by western blot. ICA-II evaluated the intracellular cGMP to 8.01?±?1.02?pmol?mg?1?min?1, which is much weaker than that from Sildenafil (12.4?±?1.16?pmol?mg?1?min?1) (P?<?0.05). There is no significant difference between ICA-II and ICA. With the treatment of 10??m ICA-II for 24 and 48?h, nNOS expression was significantly increased in RCCT (P?<?0.05), while the eNOS expression level was very low without any change. Notably, ICA-II increased the intracellular NOS activity significantly in vitro in RCCT. Except the PDE5 inhibitory effect, ICA-II increases the intracellular cGMP through the enhancement of nNOS expression and NOS activity in RCCT in vitro. ICA-II implies a potential compound for neurogenic erectile dysfunction by NO?cGMP pathway.

AB  - Abstract Background Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis usually results from traumatic inoculation with the fungus and generally occurs in immunosuppressed men. Cladosporium, Exophiala, and Alternaria spp. are commonly implicated pathogens. Objectives We present a case of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis caused by Rhytidhysteron sp. that was refractory to conventional antifungal therapy. Case report A 72-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes presented with a multiloculated, large cystic swelling over the right dorsal foot. Laboratory findings and x-rays of the chest and left foot were normal. Results Adequate control of the patient's diabetes was achieved, and the swelling was excised under itraconazole/terbinafine coverage. Histology showed multiple areas of neutrophilic abscess, epithelioid cells, foreign body giant cells, and multiple septate hyphae and yeast-like cells. Dematiaceous fungus was cultured but failed to produce spores. Sequencing of the isolate showed a match of > 99% with Rhytidhysteron rufulum. The patient demonstrated no response after one year of therapy with itraconazole/terbinafine. Weekly infiltration of the lesion with liposomal amphotericin B resulted in its complete resolution within 15 weeks. Conclusions Lesions of phaeohyphomycosis appear morphologically similar regardless of the organism implicated. Hence, their diagnosis rests entirely on the clinicopathological and microbiological presentation. Molecular studies may be required to identify a fungus if attempts to grow it in artificial culture media fail. Rhytidhysteron spp. are not known as pathogens in humans, and no treatment protocol exists. Intralesional amphotericin was highly effective in our patient and caused no systemic adverse effects. Voriconazole and posaconazole are effective against disseminated/visceral phaeohyphomycotic infections, but their efficacy against Rhytidhysteron spp. remains unstudied.

AB  - Aims This trial consisted of a 24-week multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study and a 52-week open label extension study to assess the efficacy and safety of evogliptin, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, compared to sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin alone. Methods Adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N?=?222) with HbA1c 6.5% to 11% who were receiving stable doses of metformin (≥1000?mg/d) were randomized 1:1 to add-on evogliptin 5?mg (N?=?112) or sitagliptin 100?mg (N?=?110) once daily for 24?weeks. The primary efficacy analysis consisted of a comparison of the change from baseline HbA1c at week 24. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the HbA1c difference between treatments was <0.35%. Results Mean changes in HbA1c following addition of evogliptin or sitagliptin were ?0.59% and ?0.65%, respectively. The between-group difference was 0.06% (2-sided 95% confidence interval, ?0.10 to 0.22), demonstrating non-inferiority. After the 52-week treatment, evogliptin caused a persistently decreased level of HbA1c (?0.44%?±?0.65%, P ?<?.0001). In general, both treatments were well tolerated, with incidences and types of adverse events comparable between the two groups. Hypoglycaemic events, mostly mild, were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with evogliptin and in 2.8% of patients treated with sitagliptin for 24?weeks. Conclusions Evogliptin 5?mg added to metformin therapy effectively improved glycaemic control and was non-inferior to sitagliptin and well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that was inadequately controlled by metformin alone.

AB  - Abstract Background Skeletal muscle is central to locomotion and metabolic homeostasis. The laboratory worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been developed into a genomic model for assessing the genes and signals that regulate muscle development and protein degradation. Past work has identified a receptor tyrosine kinase signalling network that combinatorially controls autophagy, nerve signal to muscle to oppose proteasome-based degradation, and extracellular matrix-based signals that control calpain and caspase activation. The last two discoveries were enabled by following up results from a functional genomic screen of known regulators of muscle. Recently, a screen of the kinome requirement for muscle homeostasis identified roughly 40% of kinases as required for C. elegans muscle health; 80 have identified human orthologues and 53 are known to be expressed in skeletal muscle. To complement this kinome screen, here, we screen most of the phosphatases in C. elegans. Methods RNA interference was used to knockdown phosphatase-encoding genes. Knockdown was first conducted during development with positive results also knocked down only in fully developed adult muscle. Protein homeostasis, mitochondrial structure, and sarcomere structure were assessed using transgenic reporter proteins. Genes identified as being required to prevent protein degradation were also knocked down in conditions that blocked proteasome or autophagic degradation. Genes identified as being required to prevent autophagic degradation were also assessed for autophagic vesicle accumulation using another transgenic reporter. Lastly, bioinformatics were used to look for overlap between kinases and phosphatases required for muscle homeostasis, and the prediction that one phosphatase was required to prevent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was assessed by western blot. Results A little over half of all phosphatases are each required to prevent abnormal development or maintenance of muscle. Eighty-six of these phosphatases have known human orthologues, 57 of which are known to be expressed in human skeletal muscle. Of the phosphatases required to prevent abnormal muscle protein degradation, roughly half are required to prevent increased autophagy. Conclusions A significant portion of both the kinome and phosphatome are required for establishing and maintaining C. elegans muscle health. Autophagy appears to be the most commonly triggered form of protein degradation in response to disruption of phosphorylation-based signalling. The results from these screens provide measurable phenotypes for analysing the combined contribution of kinases and phosphatases in a multi-cellular organism and suggest new potential regulators of human skeletal muscle for further analysis.

AB  - A 42 year old man was referred to the Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit because of a 12 month history of an inflammatory eruption affecting his neck. He was patch tested to our standard series, textile series and his own medicaments. At the 48 hour reading the patches were removed and there were large areas of unusual painful superficial erosions where the patch test tape ? Scanporä had been in contact with the skin. This appearance was difficult to explain. He denied interfering with the patches. The erosions were dressed with non-adherent dressings held in place by a different tape- Microporeä. At the 96 hour reading these dressings were removed and in the areas under the Microporeä tape there were further erosions around the edge and also some thin walled vesicles and small bullae. There were ++ allergic reactions to sodium metabisulphite, disperse blue 35, 124 and 106 all of which were felt to be relevant as he had used Trimovateâ cream and regularly wore dark nylon clothing when refereeing lacrosse matches. A biopsy was taken for histology and immunofluorescence from an area of blistering. This demonstrated suprabasal acantholysis with vesicle formation. There were occasional corps ronds. The immunofluorescence was negative. Anti-epidermal (skin) antibodieswere also negative. This striking and alarming clinical presentation after removal of patch tests had been encountered once previously in our Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit. The possibility that the disorder was artefactual either due to an irritant introduced under the tapes or perhaps due to a contaminant within the tape adhesive was considered but no conclusion was reached In this case the clue to diagnosis became apparent at the second patch test reading when small vesicles and bullae could be seen at the edge of where the Microporeâ had been. A diagnosis of Hailey Hailey disease (HHD) trigered by the trauma caused by the adhesive tapes and their removal was made. The relatively persistent nature of his presenting problem makes Grover?s disease less likely. The affected sites healed after two weeks. Allergic contact dermatitis particularly to medicaments is reported to be a frequent complication and routine patch testing has been advocated1. There has been a previous report of blistering at the site of patch testing however he was an individual already known to have HHD2. Despite having patch tested around 30 000 people in the last 22 years this complication had not been encountered until this year. We present this case whose clinical features are distinctive as we feel similar instances may have been or will be seen by colleagues. Diagnosis may be difficult if there are no blisters in association with the painful erosions.

AB  - Objectives Two large multicenter randomised trials were performed in France to assess whether systematic screening with an artery uteroplacental Doppler (AUD) in low-risk pregnant women followed by the prescription of low-dose aspirin in cases with abnormal results reduced the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and of preeclampsia. Study design and population The first trial ?Seine Saint-Denis? (SSD) trial included 3317 low-risk pregnant women (multi and primigravidae) in 17 French maternity Hospitals and the second ?Erasme? trial included 1869 primigravidae in 12 centres. In the Doppler group, the AUD was performed between 20 and 24?weeks, and women with abnormal results received 100?mg of aspirin daily until the 35th week. Results In the Doppler group, 232 patients (15.7%) had an abnormal result in the SSD trial and 20% in the ERASME trial. The predictive value of the AUD was comparable to that reported in the studies of low-risk populations, but with a low sensitivity. Finally, IUGR, whether defined by the third or tenth percentile, and preeclampsia did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in both trials. Conclusions There is no proof justifying the recommendation of a systematic AUD in a low-risk population, even if abnormal results are followed by aspirin treatment and increase in prenatal surveillance. Future studies must assess predictive tests that can be performed early in pregnancy and can identify populations at very high risk of preeclampsia and IUGR. Only when all of these conditions are fulfilled can aspirin prove its efficacy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Physical activity (PA) has been shown to prevent many conditions and treat many others. While it is an effective treatment for peripheral vascular disease (PVD), no studies have analyzed the effect of PA in preventing PVD. METHODS: Men and women in the Framingham Heart Study have been examined biannually since 1948 for the presence of PVD and other cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as well as for CVD risk factors (smoking, Metropolitan weight, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy). PA was assessed in 1956?58 using the previously validated Framingham Physical Activity Index. Subjects were ranked based on weighted PA levels, then grouped into quartiles. We examined the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up, adjusting for baseline levels of CVD risk factors and for the presence of other CVD. We included the 1745 men and 2220 women free of PVD and CVD at baseline who answered the physical activity questions and survived to at least the first follow-up. RESULTS: Among those free of other CVD, the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up was 4.3% and 5.3% in men and 2.3% and 4.5% in women. Including those who developed other CVD first, the incidence of PVD at 20 and 36 years of follow-up was 6.6% and 11.1% in men and 3.9% and 7.9% in women. For both men and women, there was no difference in the incidence of PVD between the least active quartile and any of the three more active quartiles. This lack of a difference held up in both the analyses adjusted only for age and in those adjusted for CVD risk factors. There was also no difference whether or not patients with other CVD were included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that while PA may be an effective treatment for PVD, it does not appear to prevent PVD.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to compare sonographic measurements of subcutaneous tissue (SQ) in fetuses of gestational diabetic mothers (GDM), and in normal fetuses. Methods SQ was measured as the subcutaneous tissue area of mid upper arm (FMA), mid-thigh (FMT) (cross sectional area minus bone and muscle area), abdominal (FA) and subscapular fat (FS), thickness. Fifty-six GDM were enrolled in the study. Normal values were obtained from fetuses of normal pregnancies (BMI 21.3?±?0.64 Kg/m2; one hour glucose test <?140?mg/dL) (30 patients). Treatment was based on diet alone, or diet plus insulin according to postprandial glicemia. Longitudinal ultrasound examinations were performed every four weeks, in normal pregnancies, and in GDM pregnancies. Results Fetal SQ measurements were significantly correlated to gestational age both in normal and GDM fetuses (P?<?0.05). At the time of diagnosis GDM fetuses had significantly higher values for all SQ measurements compared to AGA fetuses; these differences were not found during therapy. 26?32?weeks diagnosis 32?36?weeks therapy normal GDM normal GDM p FA 0.32?±?0.01 0.38?±?0.01 Ns 0.45?±?0.02 0.47?±?0.02 0.001 FS 0.28?±?0.01 0.36?±?0.17 Ns 0.41?±?0.36 0.44?±?0.02 0.001 FMA 1.97?±?0.12 2.55?±?0.19 Ns 3.83?±?0.33 4.24?±?0.21 0.01 FMT 3.12?±?0.20 4.10?±?0.37 Ns 5.91?±?0.42 6.94?±?0.43 0.01 Conclusions GDM is associated with increases in fetal SQ from the second trimester. A strict glycemic control can reduce these differences to negligible values. These new measurements can be adopted to monitor the efficacy of therapy in GDM pregnancies.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) differs from S. epidermidis isolated from normal flora in terms of its capacity to induce activation of caspase-1 and release of IL-1? in human neutrophils. The amount of active caspase-1 was determined over 6 h by detecting Ac-YVAD-AMC fluorescence in human neutrophils incubated with S. epidermidis isolates from PJIs (ST2) or normal flora. The amount of IL-1? was detected by ELISA in neutrophil supernatants after 6 h of incubation. Mean IL-1? release was lower after incubation with S. epidermidis from PJIs compared to isolates from normal flora, but no statistically significant difference was found in active caspase-1. Substantial inter-individual differences in both active caspase-1 and IL-1? were noted. These results suggest that evasion of innate immune response, measured as reduced capacity to induce release of IL-1? from human neutrophils, might be involved in the predominance of ST2 in S. epidermidis PJIs, but that other microbe-related factors are probably also important.

AB  - Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as crucial players in chromatin regulation. Their diversity allows them to partake in the regulation of numerous cellular processes across species. During development, long and short ncRNAs act in conjunction with each other where long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are best understood in establishing appropriate gene expression patterns, while short ncRNAs (sRNAs) are known to establish constitutive heterochromatin and suppress mobile elements. Additionally, increasing evidence demonstrates roles of sRNAs in several typically lncRNA-mediated processes such as dosage compensation, indicating a complex regulatory network of noncoding RNAs. Together, various ncRNAs establish many mitotically heritable epigenetic marks during development. Additionally, they participate in mechanisms that regulate maintenance of these epigenetic marks during the lifespan of the organism. Interestingly, some epigenetic traits are transmitted to the next generation(s) via paramutations or transgenerational inheritance mediated by sRNAs. In this review, we give an overview of the various functions and regulations of ncRNAs and the mechanisms they employ in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic marks and multi-generational transmission of epigenetic traits.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - Labels on cosmetics with statements such as ?recommended by dermatologists?, ?allergy-tested?, ?hypo-allergenic?, and more recently ?for use on intolerant? or for ?sensitive skin? have become very popular. Indeed, many ingredients are used precisely because of their low irritancy potential. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of contact allergic reactions from such cosmetic products. During the last few months several of these substances have been identified as allergens. Examples are: ? Alkylglucosides, e.g. coco-, decyl-, and laurylglucosides, which are condensation products of the corresponding fatty alcohols with glucose, are widely used as emulsifiers in skin-care products, mild surfactants and cleansing agents, as well as in fragrance products, hair dyes, sunscreens and tanning products. ? Ethylhexylglycerin (syn.: octoxyglycerin) is used as a skin conditioning agent (and for miscellaneous purposes). ? Methoxy PEG-17 and PEG-22/dodecyl glycol copolymers, which are alkoxylated alcohols and synthetic polymers, are used as emulsion stabilizers and suspending and viscosity-increasing agents, and also as skin-conditioning agents. ? Butylene glycol and pentylene glycol are aliphatic alcohols with applications similar to those of propylene glycol, which is considered to be more irritant and allergenic. These agents are widely used in a wide variety of cosmetic products because of their solvent, humectant and antibacterial effects. Butylene glycol is also usd as a fragrance ingredient and as a skin conditioner.
