AB  - Labels on cosmetics with statements such as ?recommended by dermatologists?, ?allergy-tested?, ?hypo-allergenic?, and more recently ?for use on intolerant? or for ?sensitive skin? have become very popular. Indeed, many ingredients are used precisely because of their low irritancy potential. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of contact allergic reactions from such cosmetic products. During the last few months several of these substances have been identified as allergens. Examples are: ? Alkylglucosides, e.g. coco-, decyl-, and laurylglucosides, which are condensation products of the corresponding fatty alcohols with glucose, are widely used as emulsifiers in skin-care products, mild surfactants and cleansing agents, as well as in fragrance products, hair dyes, sunscreens and tanning products. ? Ethylhexylglycerin (syn.: octoxyglycerin) is used as a skin conditioning agent (and for miscellaneous purposes). ? Methoxy PEG-17 and PEG-22/dodecyl glycol copolymers, which are alkoxylated alcohols and synthetic polymers, are used as emulsion stabilizers and suspending and viscosity-increasing agents, and also as skin-conditioning agents. ? Butylene glycol and pentylene glycol are aliphatic alcohols with applications similar to those of propylene glycol, which is considered to be more irritant and allergenic. These agents are widely used in a wide variety of cosmetic products because of their solvent, humectant and antibacterial effects. Butylene glycol is also usd as a fragrance ingredient and as a skin conditioner.

AB  - The European chub, Leuciscus cephalus (Cyprinidae), is a fish species employed in bioindication for the effects of endocrine disruption chemicals (EDC) upon the reproductive system. In applied histopathology, a useful tool in aquatic ecotoxicology, detailed knowledge on the intact structural integration of an organism is an indispensable prerequisite for the diagnosis of pathological alterations. This is particularly evident for gonadal structures in bioindication for the effects of EDCs interacting with the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal-liver axis. However, little is known about the histology of L. cephalus until now, especially the extratesticular duct system is widely disregarded. Therefore, in the present study the testicular efferent duct system was described for three phases of testicular development (pre-spawning, spawning, post-spawning). Testicular main ducts were analyzed by means of histology and transmission electron microscopy. Additional techniques applied were lectin histochemistry to determine the secretory activity of epithelial cells, as well as immunohistochemistry to demonstrate cell proliferation activity and muscle actin to show distribution and amount of contractile cells. Remarkable variations of the extratesticular ducts mainly concerning the epithelium, were observed during the reproductive phases. Contribution of the main ducts? epithelia (secretion and cellular detachment) and of degenerating spermatocytes, as sources of carbohydrates and phospholipids, to the seminal fluid were confirmed. Epithelial cell proliferation and secretory activity were dependent on the spawning phase of the specimen. Lectin binding experiments in the present study demonstrated sugar residues (mannose, glucose, galactose, N-acetyl-glucosamine) in the epithelial cell cytoplasm and apical glycocalyx, which is important in cell recognition. In the stroma of the testicular efferent ducts, a high number of cells expressed muscle actin and tropomyosin indicating the ducts? contractile potential for the transportation of seminal fluid towards release. Adjacent to these contractile cells, numerous nerve fibres were found indicating neuronal control of sperm fluid flow.

AB  - Abstract Stress-induced cortical alertness is maintained by a heightened excitability of noradrenergic neurons innervating, notably, the prefrontal cortex. However, neither the signaling axis linking hypothalamic activation to delayed and lasting noradrenergic excitability nor the molecular cascade gating noradrenaline synthesis is defined. Here, we show that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone-releasing neurons innervate ependymal cells of the 3rd ventricle to induce ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) release for transport through the brain's aqueductal system. CNTF binding to its cognate receptors on norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus then initiates sequential phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase with the Ca2+-sensor secretagogin ensuring activity dependence in both rodent and human brains. Both CNTF and secretagogin ablation occlude stress-induced cortical norepinephrine synthesis, ensuing neuronal excitation and behavioral stereotypes. Cumulatively, we identify a multimodal pathway that is rate-limited by CNTF volume transmission and poised to directly convert hypothalamic activation into long-lasting cortical excitability following acute stress.

AB  - The complexity of neurodevelopment, the rapidity of early neurogenesis, and over 100 years of research identifying environmental influences on neurodevelopment serve as backdrop to understanding factors that influence risk and severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This Keynote Lecture, delivered at the May 2016 annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, describes concepts of causation, outlines the trajectory of research on nongenetic factors beginning in the 1960s, and briefly reviews the current state of this science. Causal concepts are introduced, including root causes; pitfalls in interpreting time trends as clues to etiologic factors; susceptible time windows for exposure; and implications of a multi-factorial model of ASD. An historical background presents early research into the origins of ASD. The epidemiologic literature from the last fifteen years is briefly but critically reviewed for potential roles of, for example, air pollution, pesticides, plastics, prenatal vitamins, lifestyle and family factors, and maternal obstetric and metabolic conditions during her pregnancy. Three examples from the case-control CHildhood Autism Risks from Genes and the Environment Study are probed to illustrate methodological approaches to central challenges in observational studies: capturing environmental exposure; causal inference when a randomized controlled clinical trial is either unethical or infeasible; and the integration of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences on development. We conclude with reflections on future directions, including exposomics, new technologies, the microbiome, gene-by-environment interaction in the era of ?omics, and epigenetics as the interface of those two. As the environment is malleable, this research advances the goal of a productive and fulfilling life for all children, teen-agers and adults. Autism Res 2018, 11: 554?586. ? 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary This Keynote Lecture, delivered at the 2016 meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, discusses evidence from human epidemiologic studies of prenatal factors contributing to autism, such as pesticides, maternal nutrition and her health. There is no single cause for autism. Examples highlight the features of a high-quality epidemiology study, and what comprises a compelling case for causation. Emergent research directions hold promise for identifying potential interventions to reduce disabilities, enhance giftedness, and improve lives of those with ASD.

AB  - SUMMARY Treatment by injection or infusion is widespread in China. Using the common cold as a tracer condition, we explored the reasons for over-prescription of injections and infusions in Guizhou, China. Interviews with prescribers, patients and key informants were supplemented by focus groups. These revealed how historical ideas encourage unnecessary use of percutaneous treatment: faith in the healing power of needles is locally attributed to association with acupuncture. Many patients and some staff believe that injections per se are therapeutic. However, the structure of health service financing and remuneration now reinforces this irrational faith. Market-based reforms have attempted to control costs and increase productivity with an incentive scheme which rewards prescribers financially for over-prescription in general and for use of injections and infusions in particular. Aggressive marketing has displaced oral treatment from health facilities into independent pharmacies, leaving doctors functioning mainly as injection providers. There is a need for a multi-faceted response encompassing education and reform of financial incentives to reduce the use of unnecessary treatment. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In 1998 we began to develop multi-lingual educational material for apprentice schools. This material was highly graphical, consisting of overheads with explanatory notes. The kit also included clinical slides, an introductory videotape, and handcream samples. By early 2000, 300 kits had been distributed to teachers of apprentices all over Switzerland. Teachers rapidly embraced the kit thanks to its simplicity and ease of use. Feedback was also gratifyingly high among those outside teachers per se: health professionals, safety engineers and others involved in prevention, even outside Switzerland. By 2004, however, we had made a total paradigm shift: kits were out, the Internet was in. The advantages were obvious, both in quantity and in quality. We could reach more people and we could reach them better. When we made 300 kits our budget reached its limit, but with the virtually free Internet, using only one highly developed digital course, we can now reach a potentially limitless audience. Moreover, we can refine, update and amend our material continuously. Our main course includes defining and preventing contact dermatitis, defining the special requirements of such varied users as hairdressers, bricklayers and machinists. It also shows how to avoid misuse of protective gloves. The course still involves an intense use of graphics, but they were redrawn from scratch for the Internet to maximize simplicity, immediacy and elegance. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - Abstract As an endogenous neuroprotectant agent, adenosine is extensively distributed and is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS). Under physiological conditions, the concentration of adenosine is low intra- and extracellularly, but increases significantly in response to stress. The majority of adenosine functions are receptor-mediated, and primarily include the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R). Adenosine is currently widely used in the treatment of diseases of the CNS and the cardiovascular systems, and the mechanisms are related to the disease types, disease locations, and the adenosine receptors distribution in the CNS. For example, the main infarction sites of cerebral ischemia are cortex and striatum, which have high levels of A1 and A2A receptors. Cerebral ischemia is manifested with A1R decrease and A2AR increase, as well as reduction in the A1R-mediated inhibitory processes and enhancement of the A2AR-mediated excitatory process. Adenosine receptor dysfunction is also involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and epilepsy. Thus, the adenosine receptor balance theory is important for brain disease treatment. The concentration of adenosine can be increased by endogenous or exogenous pathways due to its short half-life and high inactivation properties. Therefore, we will discuss the function of adenosine and its receptors, adenosine formation, and metabolism, and its role for the treatment of CNS diseases (such as cerebral ischemia, AD, depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and sleep disorders). This article will provide a scientific basis for the development of novel adenosine derivatives through adenosine structure modification, which will lead to experimental applications.

AB  - Abstract Ideal material characteristics for tissue engineering or regenerative medicine approaches to volumetric muscle loss (VML) include the ability to deliver cells, growth factors, and molecules that support tissue formation from a system with a tunable degradation profile. Two different types of human hair-derived keratins were tested as options to fulfill these VML design requirements: (1) oxidatively extracted keratin (keratose) characterized by a lack of covalent crosslinking between cysteine residues, and (2) reductively extracted keratin (kerateine) characterized by disulfide crosslinks. Human skeletal muscle myoblasts cultured on coatings of both types of keratin had increased numbers of multinucleated cells compared to collagen or MatrigelTM and adhesion levels greater than collagen. Rheology showed elastic moduli from 102 to 105 Pa and viscous moduli from 101 to 104 Pa depending on gel concentration and keratin type. Kerateine and keratose showed differing rates of degradation due to the presence or absence of disulfide crosslinks, which likely contributed to observed differences in release profiles of several growth factors. In vivo testing in a subcutaneous mouse model showed that keratose hydrogels can be used to deliver mouse muscle progenitor cells and growth factors. Histological assessment showed minimal inflammatory responses and an increase in markers of muscle formation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - The relative inefficiency of the islet purification process may hamper obtaining enough islets for transplantation even with adequate pre-purification counts. In this study, we determined the effect of an additional purification step on total islet yields and pancreas utilization at our center. Twenty-five pancreata were processed using the automated method followed by continuous gradient purification (CGP), and the less pure islet fractions were subjected to additional rescue gradient purification (RGP). CGP and RGP islets were combined and transplanted into patients with type 1 diabetes. CGP and RGP islets showed no significant differences in cell viability, insulin secretion in vitro and function when transplanted into chemically diabetic mice. Mean RGP contribution to the final preparation was 27.9 ± 19.9%. In 12 of 25 preparations, CGP yielded <5000 IEQ/kg of recipient body weight, and inclusion of RGP islets to the final preparation allowed to obtain the minimal islet number required for transplantation. Transplanted islets resulted in sustained C-peptide production, HbA1C normalization and insulin-independence or reduced insulin requirements. Taken together, our data suggest that RGP islets are comparable in terms of viability and potency to CGP islets. RGP may be of assistance in maximizing the number of islet preparations successfully used in transplant protocols.

AB  - Introduction:? The pathomechanisms of bovine laminitis are still poorly understood. Isolated perfused organ models are promising tools to study the biological mechanisms that lie behind diseases. They are preferable for ethical and financial reasons but also for experimental necessities. Aims:? To develop an isolated haemoperfused distal cow limb model, basing on an already existing porcine limb model used in experiments studying the effects of bioactive molecules. Methods:? Isolated limbs and blood were obtained from routinely slaughtered cows and subsequently perfused in the laboratory of a biotech company (Vitro-Tec, Berlin) with expertise in organ perfusion. A standard perfusion apparatus enables perfusion for up to six hours under close to physiological conditions. Perfusion pressure and flow were calculated based on values available for horses and pigs. The oxygen saturation was kept at 100% and the pH between 7.35 and 7.45. Glucose was added as nutrient. The lactate concentration was measured as a parameter for oxygen supply and free haemoglobin as an indicator for haemolysis. Potassium content and pressure served as vitality indicators. Additionally, morphological criteria of tissue integrity were assessed using light and electron microscopy. Results:? A constant flow of 150?200?ml/min was optimal. The resulting pressure ranged from 30 to 117?mmHg. Light microscopy revealed, with exception of a few thromboses, no cellular damage after 4?h. The perfusion was successfully extended to 5?h. Then first pressure related alterations including vascular dilatations and cellular degeneration occurred in the dermal lamellae but not in the other regions. Potassium never exceeded physiological values. Conclusion:? The model is now available for experiments. Equipment and technical implementation have been standardized and described in a standard operating procedure. The model will be challenged by bioactive molecules such as lactate, neuropeptides and chemokines. Ischaemic conditions will be simulated and studied.

AB  - Abstract The present study was designed to provide an appropriate micro-environment for regenerating axotomized neurons and proliferating/migrating cells. Because of its intrinsic permissive properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability, we chose to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of a chitosan-based biopolymer. The biomaterial toxicity was measured through in vitro test based on fibroblast cell survival on thermogelling chitosan lactate hydrogel substrate and then polymer was implanted into a C2 hemisection of the rat spinal cord. Animals were randomized into three experimental groups (Control, Lesion and Lesion?+?Hydrogel) and functional tests (ladder walking and forelimb grip strength tests, respiratory assessment by whole-body plethysmography measurements) were used, once a week during 10 weeks, to evaluate post-traumatic recoveries. Then, electrophysiological examinations (reflexivity of the sub-lesional region, ventilatory adjustments to muscle fatigue known to elicit the muscle metaboreflex and phrenic nerve recordings during normoxia and temporary hypoxia) were performed. In vitro results indicated that the chitosan matrix is a non-toxic biomaterial that allowed fibroblast survival. Furthermore, implanted animals showed improvements of their ladder walking scores from the 4th week post-implantation. Finally, electrophysiological recordings indicated that animals receiving the chitosan matrix exhibited recovery of the H-reflex rate sensitive depression, the ventilatory response to repetitive muscle stimulation and an increase of the phrenic nerve activity to asphyxia compared to lesioned and nonimplanted animals. This study indicates that hydrogel based on chitosan constitute a promising therapeutic approach to repair damaged spinal cord or may be used as an adjuvant with other treatments to enhance functional recovery after a central nervous system damage. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) has been postulated to be a key regulator involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration of sensory hair cells. Here we have addressed the potential functions of FGF2 during the formation and regeneration of the auditory epithelium in chicken and mice. By using viral gene transfer, based on herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1), we show that ectopically applied FGF2 drastically increases the number of cells expressing early hair cell markers during embryonic development in avians. Intriguingly, FGF2 does not stimulate cell division during this process. These data suggest that FGF2 plays a role during differentiation of sensory hair cells in avians. To address the potential functions of FGF2 during murine inner ear development, we analyzed FGF2 mouse mutants. Mice lacking FGF2 showed normal formation of the inner ear, and no abnormalities were observed at the adult stage. Moreover, FGF2 mouse mutants showed similar hearing thresholds compared with those observed in control mice before and after noise damage. Therefore, endogenous FGF2 appears not to be essential for the development or functional maintenance of the auditory organ in mammals. In light of these results, the differential roles of FGF2 in the vertebrate inner ear are discussed with respect to its previously postulated functions. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Vascular anomalies encompass a broad spectrum of tumours and malformations as classified by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. Despite being one of the most common congenital abnormalities, they are often misunderstood in clinical practice: use of the term ?haemangioma? to denote any vascular anomaly still occurs. They are found frequently in the head and neck, often as complex lesions that require multidisciplinary management which necessitates an accurate diagnosis. Precise radiological assessment is therefore crucial. This pictorial review will briefly discuss the current classification system of vascular anomalies and the optimal radiological tools for their evaluation.

AB  - In-vitro and in-vivo data suggest the efficacy of various skin protection measures in the prevention of hand dermatitis (HD). The aims and objectives of this intervention study was to quantify the efficacy of skin protection (SP) measures and UVB hardening in the prevention of HD. SP measures were compared against UVB hardening in a controlled clinical trial of 94 apprentices. The apprentices were assigned to the intervention arms class-wise. Baker apprentices involved in a previous follow-up study served as an additional historic control group representing no intervention. The apprentices were interviewed and examined in a standardised way at the beginning of the vocational training and at four follow-ups. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured at the back of the hands. Point prevalence of HD in the groups after 6 months was highest in the controls (C)(29.1%) followed by the UVB-group (19.4%) and the SP group (13.3%). UVB hardening and SP measures were associated with a reduction in HD prevalence by 9.7%(95%CI ?8.5 to 28.1) and 15.8%(95%CI ?2.4 to 33.9), respectively. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed atopy (OR?=?4.74, 95%CI 1.12?20.11, p?=?0.035) and skin care (OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.16?0.86, p?=?0.023) to be independent risk factors. Application of SP measures reduced the OR for HD 0.8 (95%CI 0.17?3.70) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.09?1.23) fold compared to the UVB and C group, respectively. The trends in the clinical results were confirmed by statistically significant differences in TEWL values. Apprentices in the SP group consistently had a lower prevalence of HD compared to the apprentices in the UVB and C group. These trends were reinforced by statistically significant differences in TEWL levels. A multi-centre trial is recommended to confirm the efficacy of SP measures in a larger randomised study.

AB  - Patient X: A 67-year-old Caucasian man slips on a patch of ice. He has abrasions to his hands and has sustained significant damage to his hip. At the emergency room, he informs clinicians he takes atorvastatin, metformin, and glimepiride to treat hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). X-rays reveal a fractured hip, which will require total hip replacement surgery.

AB  - Primary subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis can rarely be caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. Only two cases have been reported and we present the histologic and culture findings of another. A 32-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a two-year history of multiple, recurrent, tender, ulcerated skin nodules with purulent drainage involving an area measuring approximately 27.0???15.0?cm on her upper back. She had been involved in a tornado at age 10 and had sustained traumatic implantation of wood splinters in this area. Sections of the excision showed scattered dark pinpoint foci with surrounding suppuration extending to the deep aspect of the specimen. Histology demonstrated features of phaeohyphomycosis ? foci of granulomatous and acute inflammation with central clusters of dematiaceous fungal hyphae within a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Chains of brown-pigmented septate hyphae and unicellular conidia were identified. Culture revealed pigmented septate, branched hyphae and unbranched acropetal chains of conidia with no attachment hila. Dark gray, velvety colonies formed in one week on a potato dextrose agar plate incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. These culture features were characteristic of Cladophialophora bantiana. Despite surgical excision and itraconazole therapy, her skin lesions persisted for the next two years necessitating a re-excision.
