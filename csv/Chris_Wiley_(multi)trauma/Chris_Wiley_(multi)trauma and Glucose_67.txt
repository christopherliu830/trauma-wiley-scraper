AB  - Hospitalization for major surgery or critical illness often associates with cognitive decline. Inflammation and dysregulation of the innate immune system can exert broad effects in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS), yet the mechanisms underlying memory impairment after surgery remain poorly understood and without effective therapy. Endogenous regulation of acute inflammation is providing novel approaches to treat several disease states including sepsis, pain, obesity and diabetes. Resolvins are potent endogenous lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation that display immunoresolvent actions. Here, using a mouse model of surgery-induced cognitive decline we report that orthopedic surgery affects hippocampal neuronal-glial function, including synaptic transmission and plasticity. Systemic prophylaxis with aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1: 7S,8R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid, as little as 100 ng dose per mouse) improved memory decline following surgery and abolished signs of synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, delayed administration 24 h after surgery also attenuated signs of neuronal dysfunction postoperatively. AT-RvD1 also limited peripheral damage by modulating the release of systemic interleukin (IL)-6 and improved other clinical markers of tissue injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role of AT-RvD1 in modulating the proinflammatory milieu after aseptic injury and protecting the brain from neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. These findings provide novel and safer approaches to treat postoperative cognitive decline and potentially other forms of memory dysfunctions.?Terrando, N., Gómez-Galán, M., Yang, T., Carlström, M., Gustavsson, D., Harding, R.

AB  - Effect of pretreatment with intrathecal excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists on the development of pain behavior caused by plantar incision. (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) Anesthesiology 2000;93:489?496. This study examined the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluRs) on the development of pain behavior after plantar incision. Rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were anesthetized with halothane. Fifteen minutes before an incision was made, drug [40 nmol MK-801; 20 nmol NBQX; or 200 nmol [(+)-MCPG] or vehicle was injected intrathecally followed by an infusion of the same drug for 75 min. Withdrawal thresholds to calibrated von Frey filaments applied adjacent to the wound and response frequencies to a blunt mechanical stimulus applied directly to the wound were measured before incision and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after incision and then once daily for 6 days. Preincision treatments with antagonists against the NMDA (MK-801) and Group I and II metabotropic receptors [(+)-MCPG] did not inhibit the development of mechanical hyperalgesia caused by incision. Preincision treatment with the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX increased withdrawal thresholds at 1 and 2 h and on postoperative day 1 compared with the vehicle group; response frequencies were reduced 1 and 2 h after incision and on postoperative day 2 (P < 0.05). In an additional group, postincision treatment with NBQX was similar to preincision treatment. Conclude spinal NMDA and MGluR antagonists may not be useful for preventing postsurgical pain. Spinal non-NMDA receptor antagonists reduced pain behaviors, but a preventive effect using preincision treatment was not apparent. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The incisional model using rats was developed by Dr. Brennan and colleagues for the study of acute surgical pain. In a previous study, they showed that blockade of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors, but not blockade of NMDA receptors nor mGluR receptors reduces postincisional pain if administered after the incision is made. This study shows the same is true if the receptor antagonists are administered before the incision is made. However, the effect is not particularly marked and; therefore, pursuit of non-MNDA excitatory amino transmitter receptor blockers for the prevention of postincisional pain would not likely be fruitful. The results of the study do require us to rethink how postincisional pain differs from other experimental pains and the phenomena of ?wind-up? attributed to activation of the NMDA receptor. Worth keeping in mind is that incisional pain does not equal surgical pain, which may involve traumatic injury to nerves and produce a neuropath pain, which strongly indicates involvement of NMDA receptors.

AB  - Abstract The lack of endogenous repair following spinal cord injury (SCI) accounts for the frequent permanent deficits for which effective treatments are absent. Previously, we demonstrated that low sulfated modified heparin mimetics (LS-mHeps) attenuate astrocytosis, suggesting they may represent a novel therapeutic approach. mHeps are glycomolecules with structural similarities to resident heparan sulfates (HS), which modulate cell signaling by both sequestering ligands, and acting as cofactors in the formation of ligand?receptor complexes. To explore whether mHeps can affect the myelination and neurite outgrowth necessary for repair after SCI, we created lesioned or demyelinated neural cell co-cultures and exposed them with a panel of mHeps with varying degrees and positions of their sulfate moieties. LS-mHep7 enhanced neurite outgrowth and myelination, whereas highly sulfated mHeps (HS-mHeps) had attenuating effects. LS-mHeps had no effects on myelination or neurite extension in developing, uninjured myelinating cultures, suggesting they might exert their proregenerating effects by modulating or sequestering inhibitory factors secreted after injury. To investigate this, we examined conditioned media from cultures using chemokine arrays and conducted an unbiased proteomics approach by applying TMT-LC/MS to mHep7 affinity purified conditioned media from these cultures. Multiple protein factors reported to play a role in damage or repair mechanisms were identified, including amyloid betaA4. Amyloid beta peptide (1?42) was validated as an important candidate by treating myelination cultures and shown to inhibit myelination. Thus, we propose that LS-mHeps exert multiple beneficial effects on mechanisms supporting enhanced repair, and represent novel candidates as therapeutics for CNS damage.

AB  - Abstract Deciphering the human brain pathophysiology remains one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Neurological disorders represent a significant proportion of diseases burden; however, the complexity of the brain physiology makes it challenging to model its diseases. Simple in vitro models have been very useful for precise measurements in controled conditions. However, existing models are limited in their ability to replicate complex interactions between various cells in the brain. Studying human brain requires sophisticated models to reconstitute the tangled architecture and functions of brain cells. Recently, advances in the development of three-dimensional (3D) brain cell culture models have begun to recapitulate various aspects of the human brain physiology in vitro and replicate basic disease processes of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and microcephaly. In this review, we discuss the progress, advantages, limitations, and future directions of 3D cell culture systems for modeling the human brain development and diseases.

AB  - Abstract Skin tissue engineering is a possible solution for the treatment of extensive skin defect. The ultimate goal of skin tissue engineering is to restore the complete functions of native skin, but until now the structures and functions of skins are only partially restored. By negative immunoselection (CD45 and glycophorin A), we isolated and cultivated adult human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) that are of multilineage differentiation potential. In this study, we first demonstrated that by using gelatin/thermo-sensitive poly N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAAm) and the immunocompromised mice model, the hBMSCs possess the differentiation potential of epidermis and the capability of healing skin wounds. The in vitro observations and the results of the scanning electron microscope showed that the hBMSCs can attach and proliferate in the gelatin/thermo-sensitive pNIPAAm. To further monitor the in vivo growth effect of the hBMSCs in the skin-defected nude mice, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was transduced into the hBMSCs by the murine stem cell viral vector. The results showed that the rates of cell growth and wound recovery in the hBMSC-treated group were significantly higher than those in the control group, which was only treated with the gelatin/pNIPAAm (p < 0.01). More importantly, the re-epithelialization markers of human pan-cytokeratin and E-cadherin were significantly increased on day 7, day 14, and day 21 after the hBMSC-scaffold with the pNIPAAM in the mice with skin defects (p < 0.05). Moreover, the stem cell markers of human CD13 and CD105 were gradually decreased during the period of wound healing. In sum, this novel method provides a transferring system for cell therapies and maintains its temperature-sensitive property of easy-peeling by lower-temperature treatment. In addition, the in vitro and in vivo GFP imaging systems provide a new imaging modality for understanding the differentiation process and the effective expression of stem cells in wound healing. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Brain insulin resistance, induced by neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, contributes to neurodegeneration, that is, processes that are associated with A? accumulation and TAU hyperphosphorylation. Here, we tested the effect of chronic administration of melatonin (MLT) on brain insulin resistance and cognition deficits caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) in aged rats. Results showed that MLT supplementation attenuated peripheral insulin resistance and lowered hippocampal oxidative stress levels. Activated microglia and astrocytes and hippocampal levels of TNF-α in HFD-fed rats were reduced by MLT treatment. Melatonin also prevented HFD-induced increases in beta-amyloid (A?) accumulation and TAU phosphorylation in the hippocampus. In addition, impairments of brain insulin signaling elicited by long-term HFD were restored by MLT treatment, as confirmed by ex vivo insulin stimulation. Importantly, MLT reversed HFD-induced cognitive decline as measured by a water maze test, normalized hippocampal LTP and restored CREB activity and BDNF levels as well as cholinergic neuronal activity in the hippocampus. Collectively, these findings indicate that MLT may exhibit substantial protective effects on cognition, via restoration of brain insulin signaling.

AB  - Essentials The lectin pathway's MASP-1/2 activates coagulation factors but the trigger of the activation is unknown. MASP-1/2 activation was assessed by quantifying complexes between MASPs and antithrombin/C1-inhibitor. Activated platelets and fibrin were demonstrated to activate MASP-1 and MASP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may represent a crossroad between the complement and the coagulation systems. Summary Background The activated forms of the complement lectin pathway (LP) proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 are able to cleave the coagulation factors prothrombin, fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in vitro. In vivo studies also show that MASP-1 is involved in thrombogenesis. Objectives To clarify the not yet identified mechanisms involved in triggering activation of the LP during thrombotic reactions. Methods Novel sandwich-ELISAs for detection of complexes between MASP-1 or MASP-2 and the serpins C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) or antithrombin (AT), were used to specifically detect and quantify the activated forms of MASP-1 and MASP-2. Results Activated platelets were shown by flow cytometry to bind Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 but not MBL, which was associated with activation of MASP-1 and MASP-2. We also demonstrated that fibrin and the plasmin-generated fibrin fragment DD in plasma, bind and activate MASP-1 and MASP-2. As demonstrated by the ELISA and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, the fibrin-associated activation was reflected in a specific inactivation by AT during clotting without the assistance of heparin. In all other cases the MASPs were, as previously reported, inactivated by C1-INH. In systemic lupus erythematosus patients with thrombotic disease and in polytrauma patients, the levels of activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 in complex with both AT and C1-INH were associated with markers of thrombotic disease and contact/coagulation system activation. Conclusions MASP-1 and MASP-2 are activated during blood clotting. This activation is triggered by activated platelets and by the generation of fibrin during thrombotic reactions in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a novel activation/amplification mechanism in thromboinflammation.

AB  - Biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants (BTFIs) have been in routine clinical use to facilitate healing for nearly five decades. Amongst the variety of biomaterials used, silk-based biomaterials (SBBs) have been widely used clinically viz. sutures for centuries and are being increasingly recognized as a prospective material for biomedical textiles. The ease of processing, controllable degradability, remarkable mechanical properties and biocompatibility have prompted the use of SBBs for various BTFIs for extracorporeal implants, soft tissue repair, healthcare/hygiene products and related needs. The present Review focuses on BTFIs from the perspective of types and physical and biological properties, and this discussion is followed with an examination of the advantages and limitations of BTFIs from SBBs. The Review covers progress in surface coatings, physical and chemical modifications of SBBs for BTFIs and identifies future needs and opportunities for the further development for BTFIs using SBBs.

AB  - Abstract Acute poisonings represent a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prognostic utility of the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters combined with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in acute poisoning with different xenobiotics, upon admission in the hospital, was not evaluated. This prospective observational cohort study included 229 acutely poisoned non-diabetic adults, with a median age of 44 years (range 18?90 years), 50.7% women, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 8.7%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, the left ventricle kinetic abnormalities, the E-wave deceleration time (EDT) and BNP correlated significantly with mortality in acutely poisoned patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that only EDT [odds ratio (OR) 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54?7.69, p 0.003], BNP (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02?2.55, p 0.04) and age (OR 2.66, 95% CI: 1.23?5.76, p 0.013) are predictive for mortality. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis proved EDT [area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.85; CI: 0.76?0.94; p 0.001], BNP (AUC, 0.83; CI: 0.75?0.91; p 0.001) and age (AUC, 0.82; CI: 0.74?0.90; p 0.001) as indicators for fatalities. In hospitalized patients acutely intoxicated with undifferentiated poisons, EDT as a parameter of left ventricle diastolic function and BNP are useful to early predict mortality.

AB  - Summary Malignant insulinomas are very rare endocrine tumours with a variable clinical course. We describe a 51-year-old man who had two large insulinomas resected from the body of the pancreas and 19 years later, having again become symptomatic, was found to have hepatic metastases. Medical treatment with diazoxide and octreotide failed to control his symptoms, but repeated hepatic embolization effected both symptomatic and biochemical improvements for a further 5 years. When symptoms recurred but further embolization failed to control his symptoms the hepatic metastases were treated by outpatient percutaneous radio-frequency ablation. He remains symptom-free 18 months later and levels of insulin and pro-insulin have nearly normalized. The survival, with liver metastases, for 27 years in a man with a malignant insulinoma has not been described previously. Malignant insulinoma may follow a rather indolent course and symptoms respond well to locally destructive therapies. Hepatic embolization is less traumatic than hepatic lobe resection and radio-frequency ablation offers an alternative if vascular access to the tumour is no longer possible.

A broad range of analytes, including hematological parameters, can be reliably determined in mouse blood, if appropriate samples are available. Here we describe recommended techniques for blood collection from mice and the considerations that have to be taken into account to get adequate samples for hematological investigations.

In addition, a total of 82 free flaps using microvascualr anastomosis were sued; 24 flow-through anterior thigh flaps, 13 flow-throuh thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps (or latissimus dorsi MC flap), 8 paraumbilical (or deep inferior epigastric artery ) perforator flap, 6 saphenous venous flaps, 7 combined flaps, and 24 others. In conclusions, small ulcers could be repaired with minimal invasive methods including local perforator flaps and small muscle flaps under local anesthesia. Free flow-through flaps and free bypass flaps (for diabetic gangrene with ASO), and combined osteocutaneous flaps (for massive segmental defects after resecting advanced carcinoma) are indicated for large ischemic defects.

AB  - ABSTRACT Online health infomediaries are emerging as a critical element in the healthcare sector to support and influence individuals? health and wellness decisions. The business success and effectiveness of health infomediaries depend on the active and sustained engagement of patients. Although the growth in the number of participants in an infomediary is expected to add value by increasing the diversity of information that is potentially exchanged, the infomediary cannot survive without the sustained engagement of existing users. The challenge is to understand the underlying processes at the operational workflow level of an infomediary that can lead to sustained engagement of patients. For an infomediary to increase engagement, it needs to know not only what motivates participants to join an infomediary but also what keeps them engaged in various stages of participation or transitions. In this study, we employ a Markov Chain modeling approach, along with an analysis of the user activities data, to understand the underlying mechanism of patient engagement along with several transition states in an online health infomediary. We tracked 127,610 members, with more than 1 million activities involved in an online health infomediary that supports cosmetic and reconstructive surgery patients over one year. Patients? decisions for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery are health and well-being choices that rely not only on patients? current situation but also on the knowledge and experience of others. This relevance of the health infomediary context is explored in this study. We sampled the activities of 32,505 active users? activities with data on more than 500,000 activities. We analyzed the dynamics of user behaviors by modeling longitudinal transition probabilities across different states of participation. Additional analyses and robustness checks, using text-mined data from the users? activities, are introduced to gain nuanced insights into user engagement. Our study provides several practical implications for the design and management of an online health infomediary.

AB  - Abstract In the last decade much progress has been made in research using animal models of developmental psychopathology. The field has moved from the demonstration of long-term impacts of early adversity on behavioral and physiological development and the role of genetic risks for vulnerability, to including transgenerational transmission of stress-induced phenotypes through epigenetic modifications. Additional and critical paradigm shifts have also taken place, including increased focus on ecologically and ethologically valid animal models, research on resilience, the adolescent transition as a period of brain and behavioral reorganization, and sex differences. In this chapter we review recent literature using rodent and nonhuman primate animal models that examines the biological mechanisms through which the early environment programs neurobehavioral, cognitive, and physiological development. We discuss the evolutionary role of this plasticity on behavioral development, as it has an adaptive value in changing environments. Because of maternal care's critical role in early environment, we focus on models that study the effects of mother?infant relationship disruption and dissect the mechanisms by which maternal care regulates the development of brain circuits that control emotional and social behaviors of relevance for developmental psychopathology. Finally, we discuss developmental sensitive/critical periods as windows of opportunity for plastic adaptation of developing organisms to the environment that, if taken too far?as in the case of early traumatic experiences such as childhood maltreatment?lead to maladaptive developmental trajectories (psychopathology, pathophysiology). Animal models of early life adversity are paramount to understand the basic mechanisms and principles that translate early experience into developmental outcomes in our own species.

AB  - Summary Lithium is widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, but despite its proven therapeutic efficacy, the molecular mechanisms of action are not fully understood. The present study was undertaken to explore lithium effects of the MEK/ERK cascade of protein kinases in astrocytes and neurons. In asynchronously proliferating rat cortical astrocytes, lithium decreased time- and dose-dependently the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, with 1?mm concentrations achieving 60 and 50% inhibition of ERK and MEK, respectively, after a 7-day exposure. Lithium also inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest. In serum-deprived, quiescent astrocytes, pre-exposure to lithium resulted in the inhibition of cell cycle re-entry as stimulated by the mitogen endothelin-1: under this experimental setting, lithium did not affect the rapid, peak phosphorylation of MEK taking place after 3?5?min, but was effective in inhibiting the long-term, sustained phosphorylation of MEK. Lithium inhibition of the astrocyte MEK/ERK pathway was independent of inositol depletion. Further, compound SB216763 inhibited Tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and stabilized cytosolic ?-catenin, consistent with the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK-3?), but failed to reproduce lithium effects on MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest. In cerebellar granule neurons, millimolar concentrations of lithium enhanced MEK and ERK phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, again through an inositol and GSK-3? independent mechanism. These opposing effects in astrocytes and neurons make lithium treatment a promising strategy to favour neural repair and reduce reactive gliosis after traumatic injury.
