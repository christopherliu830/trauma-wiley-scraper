AB  - 1 Human hand vein endothelial cells were isolated from blood obtained by traumatic venepuncture. Cells were identified as endothelial by staining with endothelium-specific antibodies. The subject groups studied were (i) non-pregnant, (ii) pregnant (mean, 35 weeks gestation) and (iii) pre-eclamptic women (mean, 36 weeks gestation). 2 Fura-2 was used to measure agonist-induced responses in intracellular Ca2+ in single endothelial cells isolated and maintained in vitro. All of the cells examined responded to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with a large transient increase in Ca2+ followed by a sustained plateau. 3 The responses to ATP were significantly larger in the cells from pregnant women than in those from non-pregnant and pre-eclamptic women, but no other differences were observed. The amplitudes of the responses to ATP were (means ± s.e.m.) 0.56 ± 0.04, 1.42 ± 0.24 and 0.65 ± 0.09 fura-2 ratio units for cells from non-pregnant, pregnant and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively. 4 In cells isolated from non-pregnant subjects, the amplitude of the responses to carbachol, histamine and bradykinin were all smaller than those activated by ATP: 5.1, 13.9 and 4.4 %, respectively. Not all cells responded to these agonists: 25 % responded to carbachol, 70.5 % responded to histamine and 12.5 % responded to bradykinin. Sixty-five per cent of the cells from normotensive pregnant subjects responded to bradykinin compared with 25 % in the non-pregnant and 13.9 % in the pre-eclamptic subjects. 5 These data suggest that there may be differences in the responsiveness of venous endothelial cells in pregnancy and that pre-eclamptic cells behave differently.

AB  - Abstract This paper reviews the preclinical literature related to the effects of stress on neurobiological and neuroendocrine systems. Preclinical studies of stress provide a comprehensive model for understanding neurobiological alterations in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The pathophysiology of stress reflects long-standing changes in biological stress response systems and in systems involved in stress responsivity, learning, and memory. The neural circuitry involved includes systems mediating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, norepinephrine (locus coeruleus), and benzodiazepine, serotonergic, dopaminergic, neuropeptide, and central amino acid systems. These systems interact with brain structures involved in memory, including hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Stress responses are of vital importance in living organisms; however excessive and/or repeated stress can lead to long-lasting alterations in these circuits and systems involved in stress responsiveness. Intensity and duration of the stressor, and timing of the stressor in life, have strong impact in this respect. Depression and Anxiety 15:126?147, 2002. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Adhesions are a common and unfortunate consequence of most abdominal surgical operations, which start to form within three hours of surgery. Some patients form extensive permanent adhesions that can cause abdominal or pelvic pain, infertility and bowel obstruction. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the extent of this problem and the cost to the Health Service, and although there are numerous approaches to prevent adhesion formation by careful laparoscopic or microsurgical techniques or the use of various adhesion barriers, no method so far has proved completely efficacious in randomised controlled trials. This article reviews the pathogenesis of adhesions, the epidemiological data and the various methods used to try to prevent their formation.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Abstract? Citicoline is a therapeutic agent widely used in the treatment of brain injury, for example in cerebrovascular disease or traumatic accidents. Unfortunately, the strong polar nature of this drug prevents it crossing the blood-brain barrier. In this paper, the possibility of efficiently trapping citicoline in liposomes to improve its therapeutic effects is reported. The citicoline-encapsulation efficiency, drug leakage and size analysis of various liposome systems were studied. The real therapeutic effectiveness of these citicoline liposome formulations was evaluated by biological assay. The effects of free and liposome encapsulated citicoline on survival rate of ischaemic reperfused male Wistar rats (80?100 g) were investigated. Of the phospholipid mixtures used in citicoline liposome formulation the best in terms of delivery and therapeutic effects was 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine:dipalmitoyl-dl-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine: cholesterol (7:4:7 molar ratio). This phospholipid mixture was also assayed for brain conjugated diene levels in rats, since this parameter is an index of lipid peroxidation in rat cerebral cortex during post-ischaemic reperfusion. A citicoline-loaded phospholipid mixture has produced an increase in rat survival rate of about 24% and a reduction in diene levels of 60%, compared to the free drug.

AB  - Background Endoscopic skull-base surgery (ESBS) is employed in the management of diverse skull-base pathologies. Paralleling the increased utilization of ESBS, the literature in this field has expanded rapidly. However, the rarity of these diseases, the inherent challenges of surgical studies, and the continued learning curve in ESBS have resulted in significant variability in the quality of the literature. To consolidate and critically appraise the available literature, experts in skull-base surgery have produced the International Consensus Statement on Endoscopic Skull-Base Surgery (ICAR:ESBS). Methods Using previously described methodology, topics spanning the breadth of ESBS were identified and assigned a literature review, evidence-based review or evidence-based review with recommendations format. Subsequently, each topic was written and then reviewed by skull-base surgeons in both neurosurgery and otolaryngology. Following this iterative review process, the ICAR:ESBS document was synthesized and reviewed by all authors for consensus. Results The ICAR:ESBS document addresses the role of ESBS in primary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, intradural tumors, benign skull-base and orbital pathology, sinonasal malignancies, and clival lesions. Additionally, specific challenges in ESBS including endoscopic reconstruction and complication management were evaluated. Conclusion A critical review of the literature in ESBS demonstrates at least the equivalency of ESBS with alternative approaches in pathologies such as CSF rhinorrhea and pituitary adenoma as well as improved reconstructive techniques in reducing CSF leaks. Evidence-based recommendations are limited in other pathologies and these significant knowledge gaps call upon the skull-base community to embrace these opportunities and collaboratively address these shortcomings.

AB  - Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is commonly used in combination with the installment of titanium implants. The application of a membrane to exclude non-osteogenic tissues from interfering with bone regeneration is a key principle of GBR. Membrane materials possess a number of properties which are amenable to modification. A large number of membranes have been introduced for experimental and clinical verification. This prompts the need for an update on membrane properties and the biological outcomes, as well as a critical assessment of the biological mechanisms governing bone regeneration in defects covered by membranes. The relevant literature for this narrative review was assessed after a MEDLINE/PubMed database search. Experimental data suggest that different modifications of the physicochemical and mechanical properties of membranes may promote bone regeneration. Nevertheless, the precise role of membrane porosities for the barrier function of GBR membranes still awaits elucidation. Novel experimental findings also suggest an active role of the membrane compartment per se in promoting the regenerative processes in the underlying defect during GBR, instead of being purely a passive barrier. The optimization of membrane materials by systematically addressing both the barrier and the bioactive properties is an important strategy in this field of research.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with the various disorders of consciousness, sleep, and conditions requiring neurointensive care support. The role of an intensive care unit is to maintain normal physiological homeostasis while actively treating the underlying cause of any physiological derangement. Neurological complications on the ICU are usually caused by metabolic encephalopathy, seizures, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, stroke or neuromuscular disorders but multiple complications are common. Sleep medicine is an evolving field with wide variability in knowledge of each individual sleep disorder. The chapter lists the most recent classification that is based on common complaints (insomnia or hypersomnias) as well as presumed aetiological basis (circadian rhythm disorders) or organ system from which problems arise (sleep-related breathing disorders). It also explains the issues involved in determining brain death. The diagnosis of brain death is necessary when withdrawal of artificial life support is considered and if the possibility of organ donation exists.

AB  - Summary Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, required for the degradation of glycosphingolipids. Clinical manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bone disease and a bleeding diathesis, frequently resulting in presentation to haematologists. Historically managed by splenectomy, transfusions and orthopaedic surgery, the development of specific therapy in the form of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in the 1990s has resulted in dramatic improvements in haematological and visceral disease. Recognition of complications, including multiple myeloma and Parkinson disease, has challenged the traditional macrophage-centric view of the pathophysiology of this disorder. The pathways by which enzyme deficiency results in the clinical manifestations of this disorder are poorly understood; altered inflammatory cytokine profiles, bioactive sphingolipid derivatives and alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment have been implicated. Further elucidating these pathways will serve to advance our understanding not only of GD, but of associated disorders.

AB  - Abstract The primary aim of this qualitative study, which was based on interviews with 24 patients with diabetes mellitus, was to identify factors that influence patients? willingness and ability to adhere to prescribed medicines, to recommend lifestyle choices and to acquire a deeper understanding of the way these factors influence adherence. The starting point for the study was our belief that it may be of pivotal importance for health professionals to address patients? life experiences, present life situations and cultural background, as well as their conceptions and attitudes, in order to understand why some patients have or may encounter difficulty in following treatment recommendations and realising treatment goals. Four main themes related to the primary research questions were identified. Patients with diabetes may regard diabetes as a lifelong follower but not a real problem: a trifle in relation to the daily struggle with difficulties; something out of one's control; something not worth giving up the good things in life for. In our opinion, the main result of this study is that patients may view diabetes as a marginal problem in relation to other burdens and troubles in life, such as other somatic diseases and symptoms, mental illnesses due to previous traumatic experiences, concerns for loved ones and economy. We argue that the desired goals in terms of adherence and outcomes for patients with diabetes in general need to be adapted to what is desirable and realistic for the individual patient.

AB  - Summary Nutrition has become more than just the provision of energy substrates, amino acid building blocks, and maintenance of vitamin and mineral concentrations. It is apparent that certain nutrients (antioxidants, fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, arginine, probiotics) and glycemic control exhibit the ability to enhance the immune response to a variety of stressors in critically ill veterinary patients and that their administration may have survival benefit. Acute protein-energy malnutrition predisposes to impaired immune competence; poor wound healing and an increased incidence of dehiscence; an increased incidence of wound infection and systemic sepsis; cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle weakness; and major organ failure and death. In addition, hepatic lipidosis is a common consequence of acute malnutrition in the cat. Enteral feeding should be used any time the intestinal tract (motility, digestion, and absorption) is functional. Enteral nutrition preserves gut epithelial structure and function better than does parenteral nutrition.
