AB  - Controversy exists over the role of stress and depression in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Depression has been shown to increase the risk for progressive insulin resistance and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple studies, whereas the association of stress with diabetes is less clear, owing to differences in study designs and in forms and ascertainment of stress. The biological systems involved in adaptation that mediate the link between stress and physiological functions include the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous and immune systems. The HPA axis is a tightly regulated system that represents one of the body's mechanisms for responding to acute and chronic stress. Depression is associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal alterations in the diurnal cortisol curve, including a blunted cortisol awakening response and flattening of the diurnal cortisol curve. Flattening of the diurnal cortisol curve is also associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this article, we review and summarize the evidence supporting HPA axis dysregulation as an important biological link between stress, depression, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - ?Three-layered micelles? (3LM) composed of two triblock copolymers, poly(L-lactide)-b-polyethyleneimine-b-poly(L-lactide) (PLLA-PEI-PLLA) and poly(L-lactide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(L-lactide) (PLLA-PEG-PLLA) are designed to combine electrostatic interaction and solvent-induced condensation of DNA. The low molecular weight PLLA-PEI-PLLA is synthesized by a facile amine-protection/deprotection approach and employed as a gene vector, compacting DNA as a polyplex core in the organo-micelles. The individual organo-micelle is further encapsulated within a PLLA-PEG-PLLA amphiphilic micelle leading to an aqueous stable colloidal dispersion. The resulting spherical 3LM possess a hydrodynamic diameter of ca. 200?nm and zeta potential close to neutral and display excellent stability to competing polyanions such as dextran sulfate in neutral pH (7.4). Such high stability is attributed to the complete shielding of the PEI/DNA polyplex core with an impermeable hydrophobic intermediate layer. However, greater than 90% of the encapsulated DNA are released within 30?min when exposed to slightly acidic pH (4.5). Based on our findings, a new class of non-viral delivery system for nucleic acids with superb stability and stealth properties is identified.

AB  - The pharmacological activities of tetrahydropyridine (THP) derivatives are dependent on the substituent ring moiety. In this study, we investigate the anti-inflammatory activities of 12 newly synthesized substituted N-[3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)methyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydrobenzamide/benzene sulfonamides (9a?l) in murine BV-2 microglial cells. All compounds were initially screened for attenuation of nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1?µg/mL)-activated microglial cells. The data show that only SO2-substituted THPs were effective at sub-lethal concentrations (IC50 values of 12.92?µM (9i), 14.64?µM (9j), 19.63?µM (9k)) relative to L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine positive control (IC50?=?3.1?µM). The most potent SO2-substituted compound (9i) also blocked the LPS-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and attenuated the release of several cytokines including IL-1α, IL-10, and IL-6. These findings establish the moderate immuno-modulating effects of SO2-substituted THP derivatives.

AB  - The particular combination of polydeoxyribonucleotides, l-carnitine, calcium ions, proteolytic enzyme and other ingredients acts in a synergetic way in the regeneration of skin and connective tissues. This new formulation of active principles was tested in vitro as a cell and tissue culture medium and in vivo for various preparations in support of tissue regeneration. In vitro, the new blend allowed the maintenance of skin biopsies for more than 1?year in eutrophic conditions. Immunocytochemical analyses of fibroblasts isolated from these biopsies confirmed a significant increase of the epidermal and connective wound-healing markers such as collagen type I, collagen type IV, cytokeratin 1 (CK1), CK5, CK10 and CK14 versus controls. To examine the effects of the new compound in vivo, we studied impaired wound healing in genetically diabetic db/db mice. At day?18, diabetic mice treated with the new composition showed 100% closure of wounds and faster healing than mice treated with the other solutions. This complex of vital continuity factors or life-keeping factors could be used as a tissue-preserving solution or a cosmetic/drug/medical device to accelerate wound healing in the treatment of patients with deficient wound repair to promote the regeneration of cutaneous and connective tissues (injuries?wound, dermatitis) and prevent the recurrent relapses.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hMSCs) hold regenerative medicine potential due to their availability, in vitro expansion readiness, and autologous feasibility. For neural repair, hMSCs show translational value in research on stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury. It is pivotal to establish multimodal in vitro systems to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying neural actions of hMSCs. Here, we describe a platform protocol on how to set up organotypic co-cultures of hMSCs (alone or polymer-scaffolded) with explanted adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) to determine neural injury and recovery events for designing implants to counteract neurotrauma sequelae. We emphasize in vitro hMSC propagation, polymer scaffolding, hMSC stemness maintenance, hMSC-DRG interaction profiling, and analytical formulas of neuroinflammation, trophic factor expression, DRG neurite outgrowth and tropic tracking, and in vivo verification of tailored implants in rodent models of SCI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Uterus transplantation has recently proved that infertility in women with uterine factor infertility can be cured. It is still an experimental procedure with numerous critical details remaining to be established, including tolerance to warm and cold ischemic insults. In preparation for human uterus transplantation trials, most teams use the sheep as a model system for research and team training, since the vasculature and the uterus is of similar size as in the human. We, therefore, aimed to develop an ex vivo sheep uterus reperfusion platform that mimics the reperfusion situation so that initial assessments and comparisons can be performed without the need for costly and labor-intensive in vivo transplantation experiments. Material and methods Isolated sheep uteri were perfused with the preservation solution IGL-1 and were then exposed to cold ischemia for either 4 (n = 6) or 48 hours (n = 7). Uteri were then reperfused for 48 hours under normothermic conditions with an oxygenated recirculating perfusate containing growth factors and synthetic oxygen carriers. Histological and biochemical analysis of the perfusate was conducted to assess reperfusion injury. Results Quantification of cell density indicated no significant edema in the myometrium or in the endometrium of uteri exposed to 4 hours cold ischemia and then a normothermic ex vivo reperfusion for 48 hours. Only the outer serosa layer and the inner columnar luminal epithelial cells were affected by the reperfusion. However, a much faster and severe reperfusion damage of all uterine layers were evident during the reperfusion experiment following 48 hours of cold ischemia. This was indicated by major accumulation of extracellular fluid, presence of apoptotic-labeled glandular epithelial layer and vascular endothelium. A significant accumulation of lactate was measured in the perfusate with a subsequent decrease in pH. Conclusions We developed a novel ex vivo sheep uterus model for prolonged perfusion. This model proved to be able to distinguish reperfusion injury-related differences associated to organ preservation. The experimental setup is a platform that can be used to conduct further studies on uterine ischemia- and reperfusion injury that may lead to improved human uterus transplantation protocols.

AB  - Abstract Fatal ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and starvation may produce characteristic basal vacuolization of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC). Septic ketoacidosis has recently been recognized clinically as a distinct condition in which septicemia can lead to elevation of ketones and various anions unrelated to diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, or caloric deprivation. We report four lethal cases with significantly elevated vitreous ketones secondary to sepsis and/or severe localized infection in individuals with no history of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, or starvation. Three of four cases exhibited typical basal vacuolization of RTEC. We suggest that septic ketoacidosis is an appropriate cause of death in the forensic setting where sepsis or severe localized infection is found with significant ketoacidosis (?-hydroxybutyrate > 5 mmol/L)?in the absence of diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, starvation, or other states associated with accelerated ketogenesis. The finding of basal vacuolization of RTEC in such cases provides morphological support for the underlying metabolic derangement.
