AB  - Abstract Encephalitis is a complex neurological syndrome caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. The management of encephalitis is challenging because: the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy is broad; there is often rapid disease progression; it often requires intensive supportive management; and there are many aetiologic agents for which there is no definitive treatment. Patients with possible meningoencephalitis are often encountered in the emergency care environment where clinicians must consider differential diagnoses, perform appropriate investigations and initiate empiric antimicrobials. For patients who require admission to hospital and in whom encephalitis is likely, a staged approach to investigation and management is preferred with the potential involvement of multiple medical specialties. Key considerations in the investigation and management of patients with encephalitis addressed in this guideline include: Which first-line investigations should be performed?; Which aetiologies should be considered possible based on clinical features, risk factors and radiological features?; What tests should be arranged in order to diagnose the common causes of encephalitis?; When to consider empiric antimicrobials and immune modulatory therapies?; and What is the role of brain biopsy?

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT ??The mean catalytic activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes (HLM) of Japanese origin were found to be lower than the corresponding mean values of Caucasian HLM, but the distribution patterns of data in these studies were not well addressed. ??Interindividual variations in metabolic activities of Chinese HLM samples were reported for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but little is known about the difference in CYP activities between Chinese and Caucasian HLM samples. ??The vast majority of the preceding studies were based on the measurement of metabolite formation rates at a certain fixed substrate concentration, rather than enzyme kinetic analyses. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS ??Significant differences in metabolic capability were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 with the median values lower for the Chinese HLM samples vs. the Caucasian samples, which were associated with differences in Michaelis constant or maximum velocity. ??Despite negligible differences in metabolic capability for CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A, Michaelis constant of CYP2B6 appeared to have a significant ethnic difference. AIM The most common causes of variability in drug response include differences in drug metabolism, especially when the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved. The current study was conducted to assess the differences in CYP activities in human liver microsomes (HLM) of Chinese or Caucasian origin. METHODS The metabolic capabilities of CYP enzymes in 30 Chinese liver microsomal samples were compared with those of 30 Caucasian samples utilizing enzyme kinetics. Phenacetin O-deethylation, coumarin 7-hydroxylation, bupropion hydroxylation, amodiaquine N-desethylation, diclofenac 4?-hydroxylation (S)-mephenytoin 4?-hydroxylation, dextromethorphan O-demethylation, chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation and midazolam 1?-hydroxylation/testosterone 6?-hydroxylation were used as probes for activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A, respectively. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the differences. RESULTS The samples of the two ethnic groups were not significantly different in cytochrome-b5 concentrations but were significantly different in total CYP concentrations and NADPH-P450 reductase activity (P < 0.05). Significant ethnic differences in intrinsic clearance were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1; the median values of the Chinese group were 54, 58, 26, and 35% of the corresponding values of the Caucasian group, respectively. These differences were associated with differences in Michaelis constant or maximum velocity. Despite negligible difference in intrinsic clearance, the Michaelis constant of CYP2B6 appeared to have a significant ethnic difference. No ethnic difference was observed for CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A. CONCLUSIONS These data extend our knowledge on the ethnic differences in CYP enzymes and will have implications for drug discovery and drug therapy for patients from different ethnic origins.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate the success of different surgical and nonsurgical techniques in the management of cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or otorhinorrhea. Study Design Retrospective case analysis. Methods Ninety-two patients with confirmed diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or otorhinorrhea treated at our institution between 1976 and 1998 were followed up long-term by retrospective chart review and patient interviews. Results Conservative treatment was successful in most cases of cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or otorhinorrhea resulting from head injury (26 of 29 patients). In contrast, surgical intervention was required in all but 1 of 53 patients with cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or otorhinorrhea caused surgically. The primary operative success rate was 76.9%. When relapse occurred, the interval ranged from 0 days to 24 months (mean interval, 3.9 mo; median, 1.3 mo). All leaks requiring surgery eventually were closed successfully. Surgical results were chronologically dependent. Before 1989, 11 failures occurred in 37 primary procedures. After 1989, only 4 failures occurred in 28 primary procedures. Of seven patients undergoing primary dural closure alone, three (43%) had recurrence of the leak. Closure rates were highest among patients in whom a multilayer technique for leak closure was used: combining a primary graft or sealing material such as bone wax, free muscle, or fascia for closure of the defect with additional autologous free grafts or allogenic materials. This resulted in a 2-year closure rate of 100% compared with a 2-year rate of 75.4% for patients whose primary closure was supported by a single layer of autologous or allogenic material (P = .034). Fibrin glue with primary closure alone did not have additional benefit. Postoperative meningitis occurred in two patients and was treated without sequelae. Conclusions Conservative treatment should be reserved for cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or otorhinorrhea resulting from head injury. Postoperative and nontraumatic cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or otorhinorrhea should have early operative intervention. A multilayer technique combining allogenic materials with free autologous grafts is recommended.

AB  - Abstract Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a nanocellulose form produced by some nonpathogenic bacteria. BC presents unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that make it a very versatile material and has found application in several fields, namely in food industry, cosmetics, and biomedicine. This review overviews the latest state-of-the-art usage of BC on three important areas of the biomedical field, namely delivery systems, wound dressing and healing materials, and tissue engineering for regenerative medicine. BC will be reviewed as a promising biopolymer for the design and development of innovative materials for the mentioned applications. Overall, BC is shown to be an effective and versatile carrier for delivery systems, a safe and multicustomizable patch or graft for wound dressing and healing applications, and a material that can be further tuned to better adjust for each tissue engineering application, by using different methods.

AB  - Summary Infections of the nervous system can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or protozoa. They may affect the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain parenchyma, spinal cord, nerve roots, peripheral nerve or muscle. Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may be divided into meningitis, encephalitis and focal suppuration or inflammation. The understanding of neurological infection has been advanced by new techniques of molecular diagnosis, in particular wider availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect bacterial and viral nucleic acid in CSF, and improved imaging of brain and spinal cord. The development of the antiretroviral drugs which have made HIV a chronic medical disorder rather than an inexorably fatal one. Although the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) has declined, the prevalence has increased. Neurological immune reconstituition inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) mainly associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and HIV itself has also proved difficult to diagnose and manage.

Recent developments raise the possibility that the next several years will see the range of applications in which they are used broaden considerably, with an associated expansion in both the number and type of individuals who consider them to be a valuable option. To describe this new landscape, a review of recent patent submissions covering the period 1 January 2014 to 1 February 2017 was undertaken. The results show that in the main, areas where contact lenses will be applied include drug delivery, visual augmentation and biosensing.

AB  - Abstract Exceptional mechanical and electrical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT) have attracted neuroscientists and neural tissue engineers aiming to develop novel devices that interface with nervous tissues. In the central nervous system (CNS), the perinatal chloride shift represents a dynamic change that forms the basis for physiological actions of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, a process of fundamental relevance for normal functioning of the CNS. Low intra-neuronal chloride concentrations are maintained by a chloride-extruding transporter, potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2). KCC2's increasing developmental expression underlies the chloride shift. In neural injury, repressed KCC2 expression plays a co-contributory role by corrupting inhibitory neurotransmission. Mechanisms of Kcc2 up-regulation are thus pertinent because of their medical relevance, yet they remain elusive. Here, it is shown that primary CNS neurons originating from the cerebral cortex, cultured on highly-conductive few-walled-CNT (fwCNT) have a strikingly accelerated chloride shift caused by increased KCC2 expression. KCC2 upregulation is dependent on neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) and, furthermore, on calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, which is linked to VGCC-mediated calcium-influx. It is also demonstrated that accelerated Kcc2 transcription in brain-slices prepared from genetically-engineered reporter mice, in which Kcc2 promoter drives luciferase, when the cerebral cortex of these mice is exposed to fwCNT-coated devices. Based on these findings, whether fwCNT can enhance neural engineering devices for the benefit of neural injury conditions associated with elevated neuronal intracellular chloride concentration?such as pain, epilepsy, traumatic neural injury and ischemia?can now be addressed. Taken together, our novel insights illustrate how fwCNTs can promote low neuronal chloride in individual neurons and thus inhibitory transmission in neural circuits.
