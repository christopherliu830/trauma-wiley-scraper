AB  - Summary Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is the anatomic loss of intestine. This can be congenital in origin via intestinal atresia, or acquired via massive enterectomy or multiple resections for a variety of vascular and non-vascular reasons. Some patients will be able to retain their nutritional autonomy, while others will require varying degrees and duration of specialized nutritional support because of intestinal failure. Treatment of these patients revolves around the correction and prevention of macro- and micronutrient deficiencies, and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance via control of dietary and other enteral as well as parenteral intake, and control of fluid losses. Individualized and tailored nutritional management for patients with SBS helps to optimize intestinal absorption, leading to nutritional independence such that a patient can resume as normal a lifestyle as possible. Complications may develop however, from either SBS or its therapy. Some of these may be life-threatening and will lead to the need for isolated intestine, intestine/liver, or multivisceral transplantation. Otherwise, surgical management includes anastomosis of residual colon to residual small intestine in order to utilize carbohydrate salvage for enhanced nutrient and fluid assimilation, and intestinal tapering procedures for dilated, nonfunctional intestinal segments.

AB  - Abstract Microfabrication and nanotechnology have significantly expanded the technological capabilities for monitoring and modulating neural activity with the goal of studying the nervous system and managing neurological disorders. This feature article initially provides a tutorial-like review of the prominent technologies for enabling this two-way communication with the nervous system via electrical, chemical, and optical means. Following this overview, the article discusses emerging high-throughput methods for identifying device attributes that enhance the functionality of interfaces. The discussion then extends into opportunities and challenges in integrating different device functions within a small footprint with the goal of closed-loop control of neural activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and reduced adverse tissue response. The article concludes with an outline of future directions in the development and applications of multifunctional neural interfaces.

AB  - ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs type 4) is a metalloprotease capable to degrade chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans leading to cartilage destruction during arthritis or to neuroplasticity during spinal cord injury (SCI). Although ADAMTS-4 is an inflammatory-regulated enzyme, its role during inflammation has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAMTS-4 in neuroinflammation. First, we evidenced an increase of ADAMTS-4 expression in the ischemic brain hemisphere of mouse and human patients suffering from ischemic stroke. Then, we described that ADAMTS-4 has predominantly an anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS. Treatment of primary microglia or astrocyte cultures with low doses of a human recombinant ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure decreased NO production and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including NOS2, CCL2, TNF-α, IL-1? and MMP-9. Accordingly, when cell cultures were transfected with silencing siRNA targeting ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure, the production of NO and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased. Finally, the feasibility of ADAMTS-4 to modulate neuroinflammation was investigated in vivo after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Although ADAMTS-4 treatment did not influence the lesion volume, it decreased astrogliosis and macrophage infiltration, and increased the number of microglia expressing arginase-1, a marker of alternatively activated cells with inflammation inhibiting functions. Additionally, ADAMTS-4 increased the production of IL-10 and IL-6 in the peri-ischemic area. By having anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative roles, ADAMTS-4 may represent an interesting target to treat acute CNS injuries, such as ischemic stroke, SCI or traumatic brain injury.

AB  - ABSTRACT This prospective study assessed in-hospital mortality from diabetic foot ulcer in relation to the demographic, clinical and laboratory features at presentation. Forty-two patients admitted with diabetic foot ulcer were followed up from admission till discharge from hospital. Those who survived or died were compared for any differences in demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation. The mean age and duration of diabetes for the 42 patients were 56.1 ± 1.9 years and 8.3 ± 1.1 years, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate amongst the 42 subjects was 40.5%. Ulcer grade 4, leucocytosis and anaemia were more prevalent in those who demised in comparison with survivors.

AB  - Abstract The increasing global prevalence of diabetes mellitus presents a significant challenge to healthcare systems today. Although diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy are well-established complications of diabetes, there is a paucity of research examining the impact of dysglycaemia on the olfactory system. Olfaction is an important sense, playing a role in the safety, nutrition and quality of life of an individual, but its importance is often overlooked when compared with the other senses. As a result, olfactory dysfunction is often underdiagnosed. The present review article aims to present and discuss the available evidence on the relationship between diabetes and olfaction. It also explores the associations between olfactory dysfunction and diabetes complications that could explain the underlying pathogenesis. Finally, it summarizes the putative pathological mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in diabetes that require further investigation.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.

AB  - Abstract In search of druggable synthetic lipids that function as potential modulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity, we synthesized sulfoglycolipid IG20, which stimulates neuritic outgrowth. Here, we have explored its effects on ion channels and exocytosis in bovine chromaffin cells. IG20 augmented the rate of basal catecholamine release. Such effect did not depend on Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores; rather, IG20-elicited secretion entirely dependent on Ca2+ entry through L-subtype voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. Those channels were recruited by cell depolarization mediated by IG20 likely through its ability to enhance the recruitment of Na+ channels at more hyperpolarizing potentials. Confocal imaging with fluorescent derivative IG20-NBD revealed its rapid incorporation and confinement into the plasmalemma, supporting the idea that IG20 effects are exerted through a plasmalemmal-delimited mechanism. Thus, synthetic IG20 seems to mimic several physiological effects of endogenous lipids such as regulation of ion channels, Ca2+ signaling, and exocytosis. Therefore, sulfoglycolipid IG20 may become a pharmacological tool for investigating the role of the lipid environment on neuronal excitability, ion channels, neurotransmitter release, synaptic efficacy, and neuronal plasticity. It may also inspire the synthesis of druggable sulfoglycolipids aimed at increasing synaptic plasticity and efficacy in neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain?spinal cord injury. The novel synthetic sulfoglycolipid IG20 mimics several physiological effects of endogenous lipids such as regulation of ion channels, Ca2+ signaling, and exocytosis. This profile may eventually drive enhanced synaptic plasticity and efficacy.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.
