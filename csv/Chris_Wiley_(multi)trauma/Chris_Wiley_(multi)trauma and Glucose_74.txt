AB  - Abstract The increasing global prevalence of diabetes mellitus presents a significant challenge to healthcare systems today. Although diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy are well-established complications of diabetes, there is a paucity of research examining the impact of dysglycaemia on the olfactory system. Olfaction is an important sense, playing a role in the safety, nutrition and quality of life of an individual, but its importance is often overlooked when compared with the other senses. As a result, olfactory dysfunction is often underdiagnosed. The present review article aims to present and discuss the available evidence on the relationship between diabetes and olfaction. It also explores the associations between olfactory dysfunction and diabetes complications that could explain the underlying pathogenesis. Finally, it summarizes the putative pathological mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in diabetes that require further investigation.

We provide practice guidelines aiming to increase DCD pancreas utilization. We review risk assessment and donor selection criteria. We report suggested factors in donor and recipient clinical management and provide an overview of the activities and outcomes of vascularized pancreas and islet transplantation.

AB  - Summary Delirium, also commonly referred to as encephalopathy, is an alteration in a patient's level of consciousness, arousal, and alertness, typically manifesting with confusion and disorientation. Coma is a state of profound impairment in the level of arousal characterized by complete unresponsiveness. Delirium and coma are symptom complexes with diverse etiologies and degrees of severity, resulting from dysfunction of bilateral cerebral hemispheres or of the ascending reticular activating system (RAS). Etiologic categories considered include metabolic derangement, toxicity or withdrawal, systemic or CNS infection, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and supra- and infra-tentorial lesions causing coma. Both delirium and coma are potentially life-threatening situations and should be assessed and managed emergently. Critical diagnostic possibilities include profound hypo- or hyper-glycemia or other perilous but correctible metabolic derangements; cerebral hemorrhage or imminent herniation warranting neurosurgical intervention; meningitis or encephalitis warranting urgent antibiotics/antivirals; and alcohol withdrawal warranting prompt administration of appropriate benzodiazepines.

AB  - Anticipated shortages in donated blood supply have prompted investigation of alternative approaches for in vitro production of red blood cells (RBCs), such as expansion of conditional immortalization erythroid progenitors. However, there is a bioprocessing challenge wherein factors promoting maximal cell expansion and growth-limiting inhibitory factors are yet to be investigated. The authors use an erythroblast cell line (ImEry) derived from immortalizing CD71+CD235a+ erythroblast from adult peripheral blood for optimization of expansion culture conditions. Design of experiments (DOE) is used in media formulation to explore relationships and interactive effects between factors which affect cell expansion. Our in-house optimized medium formulation produced significantly higher cell densities (3.62?±?0.055)???106?cells?mL?1, n?=?3) compared to commercial formulations (2.07?±?0.055)???106?cells?mL?1, n?=?3; at 209?h culture). Culture media costs per unit of blood is shown to have a 2.96?3.09 times cost reduction. As a proof of principle for scale up, ImEry are expanded in a half-liter stirred-bioreactor under controlled settings. Growth characteristics, metabolic, and molecular profile of the cells are evaluated. ImEry has identical O2 binding capacity to adult erythroblasts. Amino acid supplementation results in further yield improvements. The study serves as a first step for scaling up erythroblast expansion in controlled bioreactors.

AB  - Abstract Pigmented orthochromatic leukodystrophy and hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids are two adult onset leukodystrophies with neuroaxonal spheroids presenting with prominent neurobehavioral, cognitive and motor symptoms. These are familial or sporadic disorders characterized by cerebral white matter degeneration including myelin and axonal loss, gliosis, macrophages and axonal spheroids. We report clinical, neuroimaging and pathological correlations of four women ages 34?50 years with adult onset leukodystrophy. Their disease course ranged from 1.5?8 years. Three patients had progressive cognitive and behavioral changes; however, one had acute onset. Neuroimaging revealed white matter abnormalities characterized by symmetric, bilateral, T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense Magnetic Resonance Imaging signal involving frontal lobe white matter in all patients. Extensive laboratory investigations were negative apart from abnormalities in some mitochondrial enzymes and immunologic parameters. Autopsies demonstrated severe leukodystrophy with myelin and axonal loss, axonal spheroids and macrophages with early and severe frontal white matter involvement. The extent and degree of changes outside the frontal lobe appeared to correlate with disease duration. The prominent neurobehavioral deficits and frontal white matter disease provide clinical-pathologic support for association pathways linking distributed neural circuits sub-serving cognition. These observations lend further support to the notion that white matter disease alone can account for dementia.

AB  - Abstract Few treatments for human diseases have received as much investigation in the past 20 years as probiotics. In 2017, English-language meta-analyses totaling 52 studies determined the effect of probiotics on conditions ranging from necrotizing enterocolitis and colic in infants to constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy in adults. The strongest evidence in favor of probiotics lies in the prevention or treatment of 5 disorders: necrotizing enterocolitis, acute infectious diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and infant colic. Probiotic mechanisms of action include the inhibition of bacterial adhesion; enhanced mucosal barrier function; modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems (including induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells); secretion of bioactive metabolites; and regulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Future research is needed to identify the optimal probiotic and dose for specific diseases, to address whether the addition of prebiotics (to form synbiotics) would enhance activity, and to determine if defined microbial communities would provide benefit exceeding that of single-species probiotics.

AB  - 1. Head injury is the major cause of death and severe disability in young adults. Evidence from clinical studies shows ischaemic brain damage to be the major determinant of bad outcome, and that a proportion of this (perhaps up to 40%) is delayed, thus offering an opportunity for 'prophylactic' therapy. 2. Laboratory studies in several relevant animal models of human head injury (fluid percussion, subdural haematoma, and focal ischaemia by middle cerebral occlusion) indicate that excitatory amino acids are important mediators of brain damage. Pretreatment with NMDA antagonists has shown that the extent of ischaemic damage may be dramatically reduced in these models (68% reduction in the cat MCA occlusion model, 54% in the rat subdural haematoma model). 3. Trials of NMDA antagonists in human head injury are therefore strongly indicated.
