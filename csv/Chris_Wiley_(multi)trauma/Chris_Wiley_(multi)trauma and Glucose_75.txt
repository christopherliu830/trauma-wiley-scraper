AB  - 1. Head injury is the major cause of death and severe disability in young adults. Evidence from clinical studies shows ischaemic brain damage to be the major determinant of bad outcome, and that a proportion of this (perhaps up to 40%) is delayed, thus offering an opportunity for 'prophylactic' therapy. 2. Laboratory studies in several relevant animal models of human head injury (fluid percussion, subdural haematoma, and focal ischaemia by middle cerebral occlusion) indicate that excitatory amino acids are important mediators of brain damage. Pretreatment with NMDA antagonists has shown that the extent of ischaemic damage may be dramatically reduced in these models (68% reduction in the cat MCA occlusion model, 54% in the rat subdural haematoma model). 3. Trials of NMDA antagonists in human head injury are therefore strongly indicated.

AB  - Abstract Few treatments for human diseases have received as much investigation in the past 20 years as probiotics. In 2017, English-language meta-analyses totaling 52 studies determined the effect of probiotics on conditions ranging from necrotizing enterocolitis and colic in infants to constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy in adults. The strongest evidence in favor of probiotics lies in the prevention or treatment of 5 disorders: necrotizing enterocolitis, acute infectious diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and infant colic. Probiotic mechanisms of action include the inhibition of bacterial adhesion; enhanced mucosal barrier function; modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems (including induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells); secretion of bioactive metabolites; and regulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Future research is needed to identify the optimal probiotic and dose for specific diseases, to address whether the addition of prebiotics (to form synbiotics) would enhance activity, and to determine if defined microbial communities would provide benefit exceeding that of single-species probiotics.

AB  - Backgyound: Specific morbidity related to underfeeding and overfeeding necessitates the design of nutrition support regimens that provide calories equal to those required on the basis of energy expenditure. This prospective multicenter trial was designed to determine what percent of patients in long-term acute care facilities receive feeding appropriate to their needs and whether accuracy of feeding has an impact on patient clinical status. Methods: Patients on mechanical ventilation who were hospitalized at 32 Vencor Hospitals over a 9-week period and who were receiving only enteral nutrition by continuous infusion at a presumed goal rate were evaluated once by indirect calorimetry (IC) while on feeding. Caloric intake over the preceding 24 hours was determined by physician orders and by patient intake/output (I/O) record. Caloric requirements were defined by measured resting energy expenditure (REE) + 10% for activity. Degree of metabolism was defined by the ratio: (measured REE/Harris?Benedict predicted REE) X 100, and the degree of feeding by the ratio: (calories provided/calories required) X 100. Results: IC was performed on 335 patients (mean, 11.2 patients per center; range, 1 to 32), of which 72 were excluded for nonphysiological results or failure to achieve steady state, 21 for receiving parenteral nutrition, and 29 for not being on mechanical ventilation at time of testing. The 213 study patients were 58.7% male with mean age 70.1 years (range, 20 to 90 years). Measured REE was <25 kcal/kg in 66.2% of patients and 25 to 35 kcal/kg in 28.6%. Barely half (48.4%) of this patient population was hypermetabolic. Based on physician orders, the majority of patients (58.2%) were overfed, receiving> 110% of required calories, and 12.2% were underfed, receiving <90% of requirements. Discrepancies based on I/O records, however, suggested that 36.1% of patients received <90% of those calories ordered. By either basis, only about 25% of patients received feeding within 10% of required calories. The percent of patients being overfed varied between centers, ranging from 32.2% to 92.8%, and was not affected by years of facility IC experience or volume of IC studies per month. The pattern of caloric provision as measured by degree of feeding correlated inversely to degree of metabolism (p <.0001, R 2 =.24). Accuracy of feeding had an impact on ventilatory status, as degree of feeding correlated inversely with minute ventilation (p=.001, R 2 =.05). Degree of overfeeding also led to significant increases in azotemia (p =.033, R 2 =.02). Extrapolating study data over 1 year, reduction in excess volume of enteral formula would have resulted in a cost savings of up to $1.3 million for the Vencor system. Conclusions: Because energy expenditure is difficult to predict on the basis of conventional equations, patients in long-term acute care facilities routinely are overfed and underfed, with only 25% receiving calories within 10% of required needs. Measuring a patient's energy requirement at least once by IC is important, because the degree of metabolism predicts how easily a patient will be underfed or overfed. The amount of infused calories should be compared with caloric requirements measured by IC, because the accuracy or degree of underfeeding or overfeeding has an impact on ventilatory status and the likelihood for developing azotemia. Although physician practice or bias may reduce the optimal clinical effect, the use of IC to determine caloric requirements may result in significant cost savings.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 116, 396?405. Abstract Injury-induced expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in the CNS induces neuronal apoptosis and prevents neuronal regrowth. The mechanisms regulating injury-induced p75NTR expression are poorly characterized but previous studies have established that reductions in extracellular osmolarity which mimic cytotoxic edema induce p75NTR gene expression through pathways that activate the Sp1 transcription factor. In this report, we examined how extracellular osmolarity converges on Sp1 to regulate p75NTR expression. We report that levels of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), the enzyme that mediates O-linked attachment of GlcNAc, are reduced by extracellular hypo-osmolarity and that global levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation and of Sp1 show a corresponding decline. We demonstrate that chemical and RNAi-based treatments that reduce cellular O-GlcNAcylation facilitate p75NTR induction by hypo-osmolarity, directly linking protein O-GlcNAcylation to p75NTR induction. To determine if Sp1 O-GlcNAc content regulates p75NTR expression, we replaced endogenous Sp1 with a Sp1 mutated at O-GlcNAc target residues. This O-GlcNAc-deficient form of Sp1-enhanced p75NTR expression, demonstrating that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 negatively regulates p75NTR expression. We conclude that a stress-induced decline in the O-GlcNAc content of Sp1 drives expression of p75NTR.

AB  - Summary Modern in vivo neuroimaging is a growing field in which a variety of physical methods provide information about the anatomy, regional activity, and molecular states of the brain. Neuroimaging has played a pivotal role in our understanding of the pathophysiology of mental disorders. We are now starting to see the expansion of imaging into clinical psychiatric practice beyond obtaining structural scans to ?rule out organic? etiologies for altered mental states, as imaging tests yield valuable diagnostic information. This chapter will review neuroimaging techniques to help the practicing psychiatrist understand scientific reports in the psychiatric literature, and to consider ways in which neuroimaging might serve patients now and in the future.

AB  - This study was conducted to know the impact of cryopreservation on caprine fetal adnexa derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the basic stem cell characteristics. Gravid caprine uteri (2?3 months) were collected from local abattoir to derive (amniotic fluid [cAF], amniotic sac [cAS], Wharton's jelly [cWJ], and cord blood [cCB]) MSCs and expanded in vitro. Cells were cryopreserved at 3rd passage (P3) using 10% DMSO. Post-thaw viability and cellular properties were assessed. Cells were expanded to determine growth kinetics, tri-lineage differentiation, localization, and molecular expression of MSCs and pluripotency markers; thereafter, these cells were transplanted in the full-thickness (2???2cm2) rat skin wound to determine their wound healing potential. The post-thaw (pt) growth kinetics study suggested that cWJ MSCs expanded more rapidly with faster population doubling time (PDT) than that of other fetal adnexa MSCs. The relative mRNA expression of surface antigens (CD73, CD90, and CD 105) and pluripotency markers (Oct4, KLF, and cMyc) was higher in cWJ MSCs in comparison to cAS, cAF, and cCB MSCs post-thaw. The percent wound contraction on 7th day was more than 50% for all the MSC-treated groups (pre and post-thaw), against 39.55% in the control group. On day 28th, 99% and more wound contraction was observed in cAF, cAF-pt, cAS-pt, cWJ, cWJ-pt, and cCB, MSCs with better scores for epithelization, neovascularization, and collagen characteristics at a non-significant level. It is concluded that these MSCs could be successfully cryopreserved without altering their stemness and wound healing properties. J. Cell.
