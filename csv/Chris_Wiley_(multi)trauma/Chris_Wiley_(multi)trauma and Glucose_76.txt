AB  - This study was conducted to know the impact of cryopreservation on caprine fetal adnexa derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the basic stem cell characteristics. Gravid caprine uteri (2?3 months) were collected from local abattoir to derive (amniotic fluid [cAF], amniotic sac [cAS], Wharton's jelly [cWJ], and cord blood [cCB]) MSCs and expanded in vitro. Cells were cryopreserved at 3rd passage (P3) using 10% DMSO. Post-thaw viability and cellular properties were assessed. Cells were expanded to determine growth kinetics, tri-lineage differentiation, localization, and molecular expression of MSCs and pluripotency markers; thereafter, these cells were transplanted in the full-thickness (2???2cm2) rat skin wound to determine their wound healing potential. The post-thaw (pt) growth kinetics study suggested that cWJ MSCs expanded more rapidly with faster population doubling time (PDT) than that of other fetal adnexa MSCs. The relative mRNA expression of surface antigens (CD73, CD90, and CD 105) and pluripotency markers (Oct4, KLF, and cMyc) was higher in cWJ MSCs in comparison to cAS, cAF, and cCB MSCs post-thaw. The percent wound contraction on 7th day was more than 50% for all the MSC-treated groups (pre and post-thaw), against 39.55% in the control group. On day 28th, 99% and more wound contraction was observed in cAF, cAF-pt, cAS-pt, cWJ, cWJ-pt, and cCB, MSCs with better scores for epithelization, neovascularization, and collagen characteristics at a non-significant level. It is concluded that these MSCs could be successfully cryopreserved without altering their stemness and wound healing properties. J. Cell.

AB  - Summary A system was developed for objective prediction of survival, which could be applied to all critically ill patients, regardless of disease, at an early stage of hospitaluation. Such a system would allow risk assessment of groups for experimental studies according to probability of survival and it might allow us to avoid expenditure of scarce clinical resources on animals with little chance of survival. The prospective study included 200 critically ill dogs: 93 females and 107 males, representing 62 breeds. With survival defined as alive 30 days after admisssion to ICU the overall mortality rate was 40.5% (81 of 200 dogs). Data collected included signalment and parameters that reflected vital organ function, the severity of physiologic derangement and the extent of physiologic reserve. We recorded the most abnormal value for each parameter within 24 hours of admission to ICU and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze four different weighting systems. The best model had a concordance 0f 86.5% with outcome, and it was then re-evaluated to determine whether individual variables could be eliminated without losing predictive accuracy. Fourvariables were eliminated, resulting in a final model with 18 variables which had 86.3% concordance with outcome. At a 0.5 cut-off for predicted risk, the model had sensitivity Of 69%, specificity ficity of 86% and positive predictive value of 77%. A Receiver Operating Curve was constructed using serial cut-offs for predicted outcome from 0.1 to 0.9, and the area under the curve was 0.89. Thus, an equation was generated that gives an estimate of the probability of survival.

AB  - Background: Although nutrition therapy is favorably considered as an assistant therapeutic measure in critical illness, little data evaluate its role in gastrointestinal fistula patients with severe sepsis after an open abdomen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of early nutrition therapy in that population. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent open abdomen management for gastrointestinal fistula and severe sepsis from January 2001 to June 2009. Nutrition therapy, fistula, abdominal closure, and demographics were noted. Succus entericus reinfusion (SER) was performed for high-output volume or multiple fistulae. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether enteral nutrition (EN) was initiated within 14 days after admission. Delivery route of nutrients, mortality, complications, and time to abdominal closure were compared among groups. Results: Eighty-two patients were included. Fifty-six (68.3%) patients survived to discharge. Forty-one (50%) patients received SER. EN was initiated within 14 days in 36 patients, with a mean initiation time at 8.3 ± 3.4 days; 46 patients did not start any EN within 14 days (29.9 ± 20.9 days). The mean age, BMI, APACHE II score, and fistula characteristics were similar between groups. The abdominal closure was accomplished more rapidly in patients fed within 14 days (142.8 vs 184.5 days, P = .017), with decreased mortality (11.1% vs 47.8%, P < .001). Conclusions: Nutrition therapy plays an important role in the management of gastrointestinal fistula with severe sepsis. Early EN could be successfully delivered for that population, with improved mortality risk.

AB  - Summary The anesthesia of caged of birds is unique not only from the aspect of anatomy and physiology, but also due to unique requirements for anesthetic equipment, monitoring, and species-specific pharmacology. The medical history and husbandry of the pet bird is essential for preanesthetic evaluation. Body temperature is monitored continuously throughout anesthesia. Appropriate means of physical restraint must be assessed for each patient and appropriate stabilization and supportive care prepared prior to handling. Sedatives and tranquilizers are used to decrease anxiety and fear during induction. However, most tranquilizers lack analgesia. Injectable anesthetics are more commonly used in the field due to the ease of transport compared with inhalant anesthetic delivery equipment. Birds may be more sensitive to the toxic effects of local anesthetics than mammals. Due to the rapid rate at which birds may decompensate under anesthesia, monitoring is the most important aspect of avian anesthesia body weight.

AB  - Summary This chapter summaries neurological manifestations of disorders of other body systems and outlines some basic elements of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. It presents an overview of the range of neurological disease encountered in general medicine. The neurological consequences of aortic or cardiac disorders can be devastating. The chapter considers ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) ? the main clinical result of embolism from the heart or great vessel. Thyroid disorders can have a major impact on neurological function; they affect any part of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerves or muscle, mainly via high or low levels of circulating T4 and T3 or immune-mediated damage. It is especially important to recognise neurological manifestations of thyroid disease, as the symptoms will usually respond to appropriate treatment. The chapter summarizes the clinical features of abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.

AB  - BackgroundSampling the dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) allows the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dermatological drugs to be studied directly at their site of action. Dermal open-flow microperfusion (dOFM) is a recently developed technique that can provide minimally invasive, continuous, membrane-free (thus unfiltered) access to the dermal ISF. Herein, we evaluate the clinical applicability and reliability of novel wearable dOFM devices in a clinical setting. Methods Physicians inserted 141 membrane-free dOFM probes into the dermis of 17 healthy and psoriatic volunteers and sampled dermal ISF for 25 h by using wearable push-pull pumps. The tolerability, applicability, reproducibility, and reliability of multiple insertions and 25 h continuous sampling was assessed by pain scoring, physician feedback, ultrasound probe depth measurements, and 25 h-drift and variability of the sodium relative recovery. Results Insertion pain was moderate and decreased with each additional probe. Probe insertion was precise, although slightly deeper in lesional skin. The wearable push-pull pump enabled uninterrupted ISF sampling over 25 h with low variability. The relative recovery was drift-free and highly reproducible. Conclusion dOFM sampling devices are tolerable and reliable for prolonged continuous dermal sampling in a multiprobe clinical setting. These devices should enable the study of a wide range of drugs and their biomarkers in the skin.
