AB  - Abstract This review updates previous similar papers published in JFT in 2000, 2009 and 2014. It presents evidence from meta-analyses, systematic literature reviews, narrative literature reviews and controlled trials for the effectiveness of systemic interventions for families of children and adolescents with common mental health problems and other difficulties. In this context, systemic interventions include both family therapy and other family-based approaches such as parent training, or parent implemented behavioural programmes. The evidence supports the effectiveness of systemic interventions either alone or as part of multimodal programmes for sleep, feeding and attachment problems in infancy; recovery from child abuse and neglect; conduct problems, emotional problems, eating disorders, somatic problems, and first episode psychosis.

AB  - Summary Reperfusion therapy for treatment of acute ischemic stroke is aimed at restoring blood flow to an infarcting area of the brain. The goal of this therapy is to minimize ischemic damage and thus maximize physical and functional outcome from ischemic stroke. Currently available reperfusion therapies are intravenous administration of rt-PA, intra-arterial thrombolysis, and mechanical embolectomy. In this chapter, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome data, and potential risks associated with these therapies are discussed. Key studies that have evaluated these therapies are also discussed. An algorithm outlining decision making with respect to therapy selection is incorporated into the chapter.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents few different approaches to investigating some common neurological disorders. Common neurological conditions typically have distinctive clinical features often related to the anatomical site of the pathological process. A dermatome is a region of skin innervated by a single dorsal spinal nerve root. Lesions of each cranial nerve can lead to characteristic focal neurological signs. Imaging is a key investigative modality for many neurological disorders. Some modalities include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X-ray. The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), obtained via a lumbar puncture (LP), is useful in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Muscle biopsy can be used to investigate certain neuromuscular pathologies, e.g. dystrophy, myositis, myopathy, etc. Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a role in the management of a number of conditions, including epilepsy, sleep disorders, and coma states. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers the clinical management of pregnancies complicated by pre-gestational diabetes, as well as the screening and management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It tabulates the main types of diabetes seen in obstetric practice. The 2002 CEMACH audit of 3800 pregnancies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed some fetal complications (perinatal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality) among women with type 1 and type 2 DM. Women with type 1 DM are at greater risk of recurrent and severe hypoglycaemia and retinopathy. In order to significantly limit early fetal loss and congenital abnormalities women need optimal glycaemic control prior to pregnancy. To achieve this, women with pre-gestational diabetes ideally need to plan their pregnancies, be given pre-conception counselling and continue contraception until good glycaemic control has been achieved. Finally, the chapter discusses the long-term health consequences for the child of a diabetic pregnancy.

AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Summary Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has relevant consequences on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers, and is one of the principal causes of hospitalization in cirrhosis. Also, HE is a marker of poor prognosis. Its diagnosis requires an accurate and work-up to consider confounders, factors of vulnerability, and precipitation. The detection and monitoring of the covert expression of HE, which require psychometric or neurophysiologic investigation having their own specific characteristics and value, is considered in detail. Understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this condition, treatment options are highlighted in their meaning, so that clinical practice is greatly helped by this comprehensive update.

AB  - Abstract The increasing engineering of carbon-based nanomaterials as components of neuroregenerative interfaces is motivated by their dimensional compatibility with subcellular compartments of excitable cells, such as axons and synapses. In neuroscience applications, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used to improve electronic device performance by exploiting their physical properties. Besides, when manufactured to interface neuronal networks formation in vitro, CNT carpets have shown their unique ability to potentiate synaptic networks formation and function. Due to the low optical transparency of CNTs films, further developments of these materials in neural prosthesis fabrication or in implementing interfacing devices to be paired with in vivo imaging or in vitro optogenetic approaches are currently limited. In the present work, we exploit a new method to fabricate CNTs by growing them on a fused silica surface, which results in a transparent CNT-based substrate (tCNTs). We show that tCNTs favor dissociated primary neurons network formation and function, an effect comparable to the one observed for their dark counterparts. We further adopt tCNTs to support the growth of intact or lesioned entorhinal?hippocampal complex organotypic cultures (EHCs). Through immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological field potential recordings, we show here that tCNTs platforms are suitable substrates for the growth of EHCs and we unmask their ability to significantly increase the signal synchronization and fiber sprouting between the cortex and the hippocampus with respect to Controls. tCNTs transparency and ability to enhance recovery of lesioned brain cultures, make them optimal candidates to implement implantable devices in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract Many studies on stem cell plasticity are challenging the concept that stem cells contain an intrinsically predefined, unidirectional differentiation program. This means that the developmental fate of a stem cell is dependent on the general potential of the cell (pre-determined stem cell fate) as well as on microenvironmental cues, such as stimuli from growth factors (stem cell niche). Here, we reviewed reports that examined the hepatocyte differentiation ability of stem cells from two different sources: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. All of those stem cells revealed the ability to give rise to hepatocyte-like cells using different induction strategies. However, it is still not clear which of those stem cells would be the best source for hepatocyte replacement or which would be the best protocol. We herein present the current knowledge regarding available protocols and factors used in order to obtain functional hepatocytes from stem cells.
