AB  - Compilations of articles important to the pharmacist practicing in the emergency department have not been published. Consistent with other specialty areas of practice, a collection of important literature is valuable for both the new and experienced clinician. A diverse breadth of medical problems are represented that were felt to be the most pertinent issues facing the emergency medicine pharmacist; however, it is not intended to be a complete representation of available literature.

AB  - Abstract Previously, we have shown that ethanol-induced apoptosis in cultured neurons is accompanied by changes in cellular lipid profiles. In the present study, the effects of ethanol on brain lipid metabolism were studied using 7-day-old C57BL/6ByJ mice, which display apoptotic neurodegeneration upon exposure to ethanol. The brain lipids were extracted 4?24?h after the ethanol or saline treatment, and analyzed by TLC. We found that the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol ester, ceramide, and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine increased significantly in the brains of ethanol-treated mice compared to those of saline-treated mice. Concomitantly, ethanol reduced Thr172 phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α subunits. Ethanol also reduced phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a substrate of AMPK and a lipogenic enzyme known to be activated by dephosphorylation. In contrast, lipid profiles of 19-day-old mouse brains, which scarcely manifested neurodegeneration upon ethanol exposure, were not significantly affected by ethanol. Also, the basal levels of Thr172-phosphorylated AMPK α were lower in these brains than in 7-day-old mouse brains, and no detectable changes in the phosphorylation status were observed by ethanol treatment. Our findings indicate that the ethanol-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration observed in mice during restricted developmental periods is accompanied by alterations in both the lipid content and the activity of AMPK in the brain.

AB  - Research on fisheries bycatch and discards frequently involves the assessment of reflex impairment,injury, or blood physiology as means of quantifying vitality and predicting post-release mortality, but exceptionally few studies have used all three metrics concurrently. We conducted an experimental purse seine fishery for Pacific salmon in the Juan de Fuca Strait, with a focus on understanding the relationships between different sublethal indicators and whether mortality could be predicted in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) bycatch. We monitored mortality using a ~24-h net pen experiment (N = 118) and acoustic telemetry (N = 50), two approaches commonly used to assess bycatch mortality that have rarely been directly compared. Short-term mortality was 21% in the net pen experiment (~24 h) and estimated at 20% for telemetry-tagged fish (~48?96 h). Mortality was predicted by injury and reflex impairment, but only in the net pen experiment. Higher reflex impairment was mirrored by perturbations to plasma ions and lactate, supporting the notion that reflex impairment can be used as a proxy for departure from physiological homeostasis. Reflex impairment also significantly correlated with injury scores, while injury scores were significantly correlated with plasma ion concentrations. The higher time-specific mortality rate in the net pen and the fact that reflexes and injury corresponded with mortality in that experiment, but not in the telemetry-tagged fish released into the wild could be explained partly by confinement stress. While holding experiments offer the potential to provide insights into the underlying causes of mortality, chronic confinement stress can complicate the interpretation of patterns and ultimately affect mortality rates. Collectively, these results help refine our understanding of the different sublethal metrics used to assess bycatch and the mechanisms that can lead to mortality.
