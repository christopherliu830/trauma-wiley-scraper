AB  - Clinical investigation of late onset Alzheimer's disease requires establishment of simple clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria as neuropathological confirmation is not possible in the ordinary victim. Explicit criteria for the selection of mildly impaired victims in a 4-month trial of treatment and the need for new, more careful methods of dementia typing are discussed.

AB  - Although the enteral route of enteral feeding is the preferred method of nutrition support for critically ill patients, this important therapeutic strategy is not without risk. In human subjects, the digestion and absorption of nutrients induce typical hemodynamic changes, consisting of an increase in mesenteric blood flow at the expense of reduced systemic blood pressure. On rare occasion when providing aggressive enteral nutrition to critically ill patients, common symptoms of gastrointestinal intolerance may progress to a syndrome of abdominal distention, hypotension, and shock, with the development of small bowel ischemia or necrosis. Although the incidence of small bowel ischemia secondary to enteral feeding is low, the overall clinical outcome is still poor and carries a high mortality rate. Enteral feeding is well tolerated and is probably beneficial in most critically ill patients before and after a period of hypotension. Although enteral nutrition may be used with caution during the period of hypotension, evidence of poor gastrointestinal function (increased nasogastric tube output, unexplained abdominal pain, and abdominal distention), or development of dilated loops of bowel or intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis) on radiographic studies should be interpreted as potential indicators of gut ischemia. With progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevention of ischemic injury to the intestinal mucosa, the strategy of aggressive enteral feeding for critically ill patients may result in a reduction in this major complication and enhanced functional recovery from severe illness.

AB  - Summary Surgical procedures in ferrets are similar to those performed in dogs and cats, and require tools such as microsurgical instruments, magnifying loupes, smaller suture sizes, body temperature support devices, and smaller retractors. This chapter discusses surgical diseases and various surgeries, including abdominal surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, ovariohysterectomy, and anal sacculectomy. Many of the surgical diseases presented require aggressive and challenging operative procedures. Some form of magnification is recommended for surgery in patients weighing less than 1 kg. The major disadvantage of performing surgery under magnification is that it generally requires more time to complete a procedure. Surgical diseases of the gallbladder of the ferret are not common; however, cholecystotomy and cholecystecomy are the most common extrahepatic biliary tract (EHBT) surgeries performed. One such technique, craniotomy, is described in detail. Ferrets tolerate such procedures well.

AB  - Abstract Understanding the mechanisms implicated in the initial attachment, development, and maturation of a biofilm phenotype are of tremendous importance for their effect on the medical, industrial, and public health arenas. This review explores the current understanding of the nature of biofilms and the impact that molecular interactions between the bacteria themselves, as well as between bacteria and the host, may have on biofilm development and phenotype using the nonmotile Gram-positive coccus, Staphylococcus aureus, as an example.

AB  - Abstract Aim? To determine population-based rates and outcomes of pre-gestational diabetes mellitus (pre-GDM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnancy. Methods? This was a cross-sectional study, using linked population databases, of all women, and their infants, discharged from hospital following birth in New South Wales (NSW) between 1 July 1998 and 31 December 2002. Women with, and infants exposed to pre-GDM or GDM were compared with those without diabetes mellitus for pregnancy characteristics and outcomes. Results? Women with a singleton pregnancy (n = 370 703) and their infants were included: 1248 women (0.3%) had pre-GDM and 17 128 (4.5%) had GDM. Of those women with pre-GDM, 57% had Type 1 diabetes, 20% had Type 2 diabetes and for 23% the type of diabetes was unknown. Major maternal morbidity or mortality was more common in women with pre-GDM (7.9%) [odds ratio (OR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6, 3.9] and in women with GDM (3.1%) (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1, 1.4) when compared with women without diabetes (2.6%). Major infant morbidity or mortality occurred more frequently in infants exposed to pre-GDM compared with no diabetes (13.6% vs. 3.1%) (OR 5.0, 95% CI 4.2, 5.8) and in infants exposed to GDM compared with no diabetes (3.2% vs. 2.3%) (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3, 1.5). Conclusions? Pre-GDM and GDM continue to be associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, women with GDM have adverse outcomes less frequently. Rates of GDM and pre-GDM appear to be increasing over time. Clinicians should consider the potential for adverse outcomes, and arrange referral to appropriate services.

AB  - Early graft function is a major determinant of long-term outcomes after renal transplantation. Recently, recipient diabetes was identified as a risk factor for poor initial graft function in living donor renal transplantation. To further explore this association, we performed a paired analysis of deceased donor renal transplants from January 1994 to December 2005. A total of 25,523 transplant pairs were analyzed via conditional logistic regression. Diabetic recipients were older (53.16 vs. 46.75 years, p < 0.01), had a lower average panel reactive antibody (12% vs. 15%, p < 0.01) and fewer prior transplants (0.07 vs. 0.12, p < 0.01). Recipient diabetes, age, male gender, African American race, elevated peak panel reactive antibody and increased cold ischemia time were independent risk factors for delayed graft function. Specifically, diabetic recipients had increased risk of DGF on univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23?1.42, p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis confirmed this association but the risk differed by recipient gender; with diabetes having a greater effect in women (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.45?1.91, p < 0.01) compared to men (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.15?1.43, p < 0.01). It is unknown whether the deleterious impact of recipient diabetes on graft function after renal transplantation results from perioperative hyperglycemia or the chronic sequelae of diabetes.
