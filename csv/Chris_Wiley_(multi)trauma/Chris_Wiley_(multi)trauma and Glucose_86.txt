AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the consensus of skin care advice given by nurses during radiotherapy. Sixty-seven nurses, identified through nine Belgian radiotherapy departments, responded to a questionnaire survey consisting of 58 items regarding prevention and management of erythema, dry desquamation and moist desquamation. Consensus for a given advice was categorized as small if less than 50% of the nurses gave the same answer, as moderate if between 50% and 75% and as large when more than 75%. Overall, 33% of the items showed small consensus, 29% showed moderate consensus and 38% showed large consensus. The highest consensus was seen for advice in cases of moist and dry desquamation. There was less agreement in the case of erythema and it decreased further for preventive advice. Some skin care techniques that were frequently used by the nurses cannot be supported by the literature. Also, some techniques recommended by the literature are not frequently used. Further, few differences (P?<?0.05) between nurses working in a university hospital and the ones working in a non-university hospital were found in terms of advice given to patients. To increase consensus on skin care issues more conclusive research is needed. Of equal importance is the translation of existing research results into daily clinical practice.

AB  - Summary Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30?40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury. It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal surgery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modifiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

AB  - Clinical and experimental evidence confirms that delivery of nutrients via the gastrointestinal tract reduces septic morbidity in critically injured patients. Early enteral feeding seems to maintain mucosal integrity and to support the gut as an important immunologic organ that may affect other areas of the body. There is increasing evidence to suggest that specific nutrients are especially beneficial in maintaining intestinal host-defense function in times of critical illness and injury.

AB  - Neurotoxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy treatment, with unclear molecular mechanisms. Clinical studies suggest that the most frequent neurotoxic adverse events affect memory and learning, attention, concentration, processing speeds and executive function. Emerging preclinical research points toward direct cellular toxicity and induction of neuroinflammation as key drivers of neurotoxicity and subsequent cognitive impairment. Emerging data now show detectable levels of some chemotherapeutic agents within the CNS, indicating potential disruption of blood brain barrier integrity or transport mechanisms. Blood brain barrier disruption is a key aspect of many neurocognitive disorders, particularly those characterized by a proinflammatory state. Importantly, many proinflammatory mediators able to modulate the blood brain barrier are generated by tissues and organs that are targets for chemotherapy-associated toxicities. This review therefore aims to explore the hypothesis that peripherally derived inflammatory cytokines disrupt blood brain barrier permeability, thereby increasing direct access of chemotherapeutic agents into the CNS to facilitate neuroinflammation and central neurotoxicity.
