AB  - Neurotoxicity is a common side effect of chemotherapy treatment, with unclear molecular mechanisms. Clinical studies suggest that the most frequent neurotoxic adverse events affect memory and learning, attention, concentration, processing speeds and executive function. Emerging preclinical research points toward direct cellular toxicity and induction of neuroinflammation as key drivers of neurotoxicity and subsequent cognitive impairment. Emerging data now show detectable levels of some chemotherapeutic agents within the CNS, indicating potential disruption of blood brain barrier integrity or transport mechanisms. Blood brain barrier disruption is a key aspect of many neurocognitive disorders, particularly those characterized by a proinflammatory state. Importantly, many proinflammatory mediators able to modulate the blood brain barrier are generated by tissues and organs that are targets for chemotherapy-associated toxicities. This review therefore aims to explore the hypothesis that peripherally derived inflammatory cytokines disrupt blood brain barrier permeability, thereby increasing direct access of chemotherapeutic agents into the CNS to facilitate neuroinflammation and central neurotoxicity.

AB  - Research on depression in non-Western settings has focused on ?somatization,? defined as recurrent bodily complaints among persons with psychological distress. Such studies have often recorded higher rates of somatization in non-Western groups compared to Western settings, fueling speculation about cross-cultural differences in the physical manifestation of psychiatric disorders. However, few of these studies have rigorously considered possible physical explanations before diagnosing cases as somatization. For example, bodily complaints may result from comorbid nonpsychiatric physiological illness as opposed to psychological distress exclusively. The present study employs a biocultural framework to investigate the power of comorbid physiological and psychological illness versus somatization to influence bodily complaints. This study examines depression in rural Nepal, focusing on jhum-jhum, a form of paresthesia (subjective numbness or tingling), from a cultural standpoint of its emic explanation and a medical model of its pathogenesis. This study identified a 42 percent prevalence of jhum-jhum (N = 316), with the group reporting jhum-jhum being more depressed than the non-jhum-jhum group. Without further physical diagnosis, those depressed individuals with jhum-jhum might be diagnosed as somatizers. However, in a subsample of individuals (N = 65) with jhum-jhum and high depression scores, physical pathology associated with two-thirds of jhum-jhum cases. After accounting for physiological associations, the estimated prevalence of somatization is no higher than observed in Western settings. These findings suggest, therefore, that claims of cross-cultural differences in somatization should be examined with attention to the local burden of physical disease using adequate biological and cultural methods for assessing comorbidity.

AB  - Summary Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30?40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury. It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal surgery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modifiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

AB  - Background This study investigated the clinical efficiency of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) using uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer. Methods The clinical data of 83 patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2016 to February 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. ERAS was applied to 38 patients (ERAS group), while 45 patients received conventional surgical treatment (control group). The operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS), postoperative duration of chest tube placement, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were compared between the groups. Results Surgeries were conducted successfully in all patients, and no mortality occurred during the perioperative period. The ERAS group had better VAS on the third postoperative day, shorter chest tube duration, and shorter length of hospital stay (P?<?0.05). No differences between the groups in terms of operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, VAS on the first postoperative day, or complication rate were found (P?>?0.05). Conclusions ERAS using uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for NSCLC patients is safe and practicable, and could also reduce the length of hospital stay.

AB  - BACKGROUND The AABB compiles an annual synopsis of the published literature covering important developments in the field of transfusion medicine. An abridged version of this work is being made available in TRANSFUSION, with the full-length report available as Appendix S1 (available as supporting information in the online version of this paper). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Papers published in late 2017 and 2018 are included, as well as earlier papers cited for background. Although this synopsis is comprehensive, it is not exhaustive, and some papers may have been excluded or missed. RESULTS The following topics are covered: ?big data? and ?omics? studies, emerging infections and testing, platelet transfusion and pathogen reduction, transfusion therapy and coagulation, transfusion approach to hemorrhagic shock and mass casualties, therapeutic apheresis, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. CONCLUSION This synopsis may be a useful educational tool.
