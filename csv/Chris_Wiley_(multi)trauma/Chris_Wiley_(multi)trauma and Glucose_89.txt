AB  - The number of new drugs for treating neurotrauma is rapidly expanding. Emerging theories regarding the mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury provide the scientific basis for evaluating these new agents. Some of the most promising mechanisms for intervention are ionotropic channel antagonism, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and neurotrophic factor augmentation. Many of these new agents are undergoing clinical trials to establish their roles in therapy.

AB  - Abstract Various bacterial components (e.g., endotoxin, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycans, DNA) induce or enhance inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system and/or are directly toxic in eukariotic cells (e.g., hemolysins). When antibiotics which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis kill bacteria, smaller quantities of proinflammatory or toxic compounds are released in vitro and in vivo than during killing of bacteria by ?-lactams and other cell-wall active drugs. In general, high antibiotic concentrations liberate lower quantities of bacterial proinflammatory or toxic compounds than concentrations close to the minimum inhibitory concentration. In animal models of Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis/sepsis and of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, a lower release of proinflammatory bacterial compounds was associated with a reduced mortality or neuronal injury. Pre-treatment with a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor reduced the strong release of bacterial products usually observed during treatment with a ?-lactam antibiotic. Data available strongly encourage clinical trials comparing antibiotic regimens with different release of proinflammatory/toxic bacterial products. The benefit of the approach to reduce the liberation of bacterial products should be greatest in patients with a high bacterial load.

AB  - Abstract Critical illness, more precisely defined as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), occurs in 20%?50% of patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 1 week in an intensive care unit. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and myopathy (CIM), singly or in combination, occur commonly in these patients and present as limb weakness and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. Critical illness myopathy can be subdivided into thick-filament (myosin) loss, cachectic myopathy, acute rhabdomyolysis, and acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care. SIRS is the predominant underlying factor in CIP and is likely a factor in CIM even though the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids predominate in CIM. Identification and characterization of the polyneuropathy and myopathy depend upon neurological examination, electrophysiological studies, measurement of serum creatine kinase, and, if features suggest a myopathy, muscle biopsy. The information is valuable in deciding treatment and prognosis. Muscle Nerve, 2005

AB  - Summary Stroke is the leading cause of disability and fifth major cause of mortality in US. Not all strokes result in observable clinical symptoms. The prevalence of silent strokes in the Framingham offspring study was about 10%. These ?silent? strokes, or perhaps less ?eloquent? strokes, are part of the white matter disorders related to cerebrovascular disease. The risk of stroke increases with age, doubling for each successive decade after 55 years of age. The goals of general emergency management in acute stroke are to stabilize the patient, facilitate cerebral perfusion, and prevent medical complications such as aspiration. A brain imaging study is performed in all patients with suspected stroke. Computer tomography (CT) is widely available, less expensive, and easy to perform, taking only a couple of minutes to scan the brain. The acute neurological complications of ischemic stroke include malignant brain edema, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke, and seizures.

AB  - Abstract This review outlines some of the analytical challenges associated with the analysis of microdialysis (MD) samples, in particular, the minute complex sample volumes that are often encountered. In MD sampling many different low-molecular-weight molecules can be collected, but the research findings are often limited by the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the analytical technique that is coupled to the dialysis probe. Therefore it is critical that a lot of consideration is given in selecting the most suitable analytical method including the most appropriate detector. This review aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a range of commonly used analytical methods employed in MD. In Section 1, a brief overview of the MD technique is described, followed by a discussion on some of the advantages and drawbacks of this sampling technique. Sections 2 and 3 examine analytical and other technical considerations regarding analysis, with special emphasis on the factors that specifically influence analytical detection. Section 4 outlines the most commonly employed analytical techniques used in MD, including HPLC coupled with various detectors. Detail is given regarding the LOD and LOQ for many applications using each detector. As MS is of such high importance in MD, a special sub-section has been devoted to it. The importance of CE is also highlighted, with specific applications described. In addition, analytical techniques that do not appear to have found routine use in MD are discussed. Section 5 is concerned with recent innovations in chemical separation techniques, in particular MCE and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Specific applications of the coupling of these techniques with MD are highlighted, along with technical challenges associated with miniaturization. In the Section 6, the future outlook of MD is discussed. Techniques other than electrophoretic- and chromatographic based separation methods are outside the scope of this review.

AB  - Despite a stringent donor selection, human islet isolation remains frustratingly unpredictable. In this study, we measured acute insulin response to arginine (AIRarg), an in vivo surrogate measure of islet mass, in 29 human deceased donors before organ donation, and correlated values with the outcome of islet isolation. Thirteen isolations (45%) met the threshold for clinical islet transplantation. Among all measured donor characteristics, the only discriminating variable between successful or unsuccessful isolations was donor AIRarg (p < 0.01). Using a threshold of 55 ?IU/mL (ROC curve AUC: 72%), isolation was successful in 12/19 donors with high AIRarg and in 1/10 donors with low AIRarg (p < 0.001). The negative and positive predictive values were 90 and 63%, respectively. If used to select donors in the entire cohort, AIRarg would have increased our success rate by 40% and avoided 56% of unsuccessful isolations while missing only 8% of successful preparations. Our results suggest that donor AIRarg is markedly superior to body mass index (BMI) and other criteria currently used to predict isolation outcome. If routinely performed in deceased donors, this simple test could significantly reduce the failure rate of human islet isolation.
