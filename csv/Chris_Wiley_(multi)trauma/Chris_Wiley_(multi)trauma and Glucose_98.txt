AB  - Abstract Objective: To alert emergency veterinarians of a life-threatening soft tissue infection, necrotizing fasciitis (NF) that mimics non life-threatening cellulitis. In this report, the rapid clinical progression, systemic effects produced by NF, and its successful treatment in a dog is described. Case Summary: A 2-year-old, male, castrated Doberman Pinscher was presented for lameness. Clinical and laboratory findings suggested sepsis. Rapid progression of the infection, as well as surgical and histopathological findings were characteristic for necrotizing fasciitis of a pelvic limb caused by ?-hemolytic streptococcus infection. Aggressive supportive care included intravascular fluid therapy, intravenous antibiotics, plasma transfusions, nutritional support, as well as repeated surgical debridement and drainage. Mid-femoral limb amputation was required to halt the progression of the necrotizing fasciitis. New Information Provided: This is the first detailed description of successful treatment of necrotizing fasciitis caused by ?-Hemolytic streptococcus in the dog.

AB  - Summary Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5% of visits to the emergency department. Although most patients presenting with acute abdominal pain have minor problems, about 18?25% of patients have a serious enough condition to warrant hospital admission for investigation and treatment, and about 10% of patients need emergency or urgent surgery. It usually results from gastrointestinal disorders, but other causes, which include a spectrum of medical and surgical conditions, must not be forgotten. Most commonly, acute abdominal pain is due to luminal obstruction, inflammation, perforation, volvulus or torsion, and intestinal ischemia. The two immediate goals in the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain are to decide if the patient needs admission to hospital and to ascertain whether urgent or emergency surgery is needed. A number of tests and investigations are available to guide the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, but only an astute clinician can obtain the information that is needed from a patient, choose the best investigations, and plan appropriate treatment. The desire to obtain an accurate preoperative diagnosis should not be allowed to delay therapeutic intervention in the critically ill or unstable patient.

AB  - Abstract. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common primary vasculitis of adults. The incidence of this disease is practically nil in the population under the age of 50?years, then rises dramatically with each passing decade. The median age of onset of the disease is about 75?years. As the ageing population expands, it is increasingly important for ophthalmologists to be familiar with GCA and its various manifestations, ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic. A heightened awareness of this condition can avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is well known that prompt initiation of steroids remains the most effective means for preventing potentially devastating ischaemic complications. This review summarizes the current concepts regarding the immunopathogenetic pathways that lead to arteritis and the major phenotypic subtypes of GCA with emphasis on large vessel vasculitis, novel modalities for disease detection and investigative trials using alternative, non-steroid therapies.

AB  - Summary: Background: Liver metastases are much more common than primary malignant tumours of the liver, and diagnosis is largely based on imaging findings. Thus, the radiologist plays a key role in the management of patients with suspected liver metastases by accurately detecting or excluding liver metastases. A variety of imaging techniques can be used for this purpose. ?Methods: We have reviewed the literature addressing the diagnostic yield of different imaging modalities for the detection of liver metastases. Emphasis is laid upon the preoperative evaluation of colorectal liver metastases with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. ?Results: Sonography is a widely available and low-cost examination technique, but it has limitations in the detection of metastases, with an overall sensitivity of approximately 50?%. Preliminary experience with contrast-enhanced sonography is promising, as this technique is able to depict subcentimetre lesions more accurately. The standard imaging technique for staging in patients with extrahepatic neoplasms at high risk for developing liver metastases is contrast-enhanced helical CT, with a reported sensitivity of 58???85?%. The development of multidetector array CT has recently expanded CT to the ?third dimension? by providing excellent multiplanar imaging capability. CT during arterial portography (CTAP), which has been the ?gold standard? of preoperative liver imaging, has largely been abandoned because of its invasiveness and its high rate of false positive diagnoses (13???31?%) due to tumour-like perfusion defects in the liver. MR imaging with liver-specific contrast agents has been shown to be at least as accurate as CTAP, with a sensitivity of 85???90?%. In many institutions, contrast-enhanced MR imaging has become the procedure of choice for preoperative assessment. Positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) may help in the characterization of small liver lesions and in the detection of extrahepatic spread of disease. ?Conclusions: The diagnostic strategy for assessing liver metastases must take into account (i) the histology of the primary neoplasm, (ii) the clinical situation, and (iii) the planned therapeutic procedure, thereby ensuring that the optimal radiological examination is chosen.

AB  - Abstract The introduction of insulin therapy for the management of diabetes mellitus is arguably the greatest milestone in the history of modern medicine. ?-cell replacement therapy is the only treatment that reestablishes and maintains long-term physiological normoglycemia. Until recently, successful clinical outcomes of pancreas transplantation for patients with long-standing diabetes were much superior to that of islet transplantation. Significant advances in islet isolation and purification technology, the development of more specific and less diabetogenic immunosuppressants and the prophylactic administration of antiviral agents have rekindled a worldwide interest in islet transplantation. This chapter will review the rationale of islet transplantation and the development of islet isolation and purification. The challenges facing clinical islet transplantation in the twenty-first century will also be introduced.
