AB  - Summary: Background: Liver metastases are much more common than primary malignant tumours of the liver, and diagnosis is largely based on imaging findings. Thus, the radiologist plays a key role in the management of patients with suspected liver metastases by accurately detecting or excluding liver metastases. A variety of imaging techniques can be used for this purpose. ?Methods: We have reviewed the literature addressing the diagnostic yield of different imaging modalities for the detection of liver metastases. Emphasis is laid upon the preoperative evaluation of colorectal liver metastases with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. ?Results: Sonography is a widely available and low-cost examination technique, but it has limitations in the detection of metastases, with an overall sensitivity of approximately 50?%. Preliminary experience with contrast-enhanced sonography is promising, as this technique is able to depict subcentimetre lesions more accurately. The standard imaging technique for staging in patients with extrahepatic neoplasms at high risk for developing liver metastases is contrast-enhanced helical CT, with a reported sensitivity of 58???85?%. The development of multidetector array CT has recently expanded CT to the ?third dimension? by providing excellent multiplanar imaging capability. CT during arterial portography (CTAP), which has been the ?gold standard? of preoperative liver imaging, has largely been abandoned because of its invasiveness and its high rate of false positive diagnoses (13???31?%) due to tumour-like perfusion defects in the liver. MR imaging with liver-specific contrast agents has been shown to be at least as accurate as CTAP, with a sensitivity of 85???90?%. In many institutions, contrast-enhanced MR imaging has become the procedure of choice for preoperative assessment. Positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) may help in the characterization of small liver lesions and in the detection of extrahepatic spread of disease. ?Conclusions: The diagnostic strategy for assessing liver metastases must take into account (i) the histology of the primary neoplasm, (ii) the clinical situation, and (iii) the planned therapeutic procedure, thereby ensuring that the optimal radiological examination is chosen.

AB  - Abstract It is recognised that the commonest organic cause for impotence is diabetes. It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.

AB  - Silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) are one of the most widely used engineered nanoparticles and can been found in a wide range of consumer products. Despite their massive global production scale, little is known about their potential effects in the context of unintended exposure or ingestion. Using TR146 cells as an in vitro model of the human oral buccal mucosa, the uptake, spatial intracellular distribution, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammatory response, and cytotoxic effects of commercial SiO2 NPs are examined. SiO2 NPs are shown to dock and cross the cellular membrane barrier in a dose?time-dependent manner. Confocal sectioning reveals translocation of SiO2 NPs into the cell nucleus after 12 h of exposure. A concentration threshold of more than 500 ? 10?6 m is observed, above which SiO2 NPs are shown to exert significant oxidative stress with concomitant upregulation of inflammatory genes IL6 and TNFA. Further analysis of the p53 pathway and a series of apoptotic and cell cycle biomarkers reveals intracellular accumulation of SiO2 NPs exert marginal nanotoxicity. Collectively, this study provides important information regarding the uptake, intracellular distribution, and potential adverse cellular effects of SiO2 NPs commonly found in consumer products in the human oral epithelium.

AB  - Abstract The effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 on expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, TrkB, in neurons cultured from the cerebral cortex of 18-day-old embryonic rats were examined. BDNF mRNA was significantly increased from 24?48 hr after the TGF-?1 treatment over 20 ng/ml. Accumulation of BDNF protein in the culture medium was also potentiated by TGF-?1, although the intracellular content of BDNF was nearly unchanged. The enhancement of BDNF mRNA expression was suppressed by the co-presence of decorin, a small TGF-?-binding proteoglycan that inhibits the biological activities of TGF-?s. mRNA expression of full-length TrkB, the bioactive high-affinity receptor for BDNF, was also upregulated after treatment with TGF-?1. These observations suggest that: 1) TGF-?1 potentiates BDNF/TrkB autocrine or local paracrine system; and 2) the neurotrophic activity of TGF-?1 is partly responsible for the BDNF induced by TGF-?1 itself. To test this latter possibility, we examined the neuronal survival activity of TGF-?1 with or without K252a, a selective inhibitor of Trk family tyrosine kinases. TGF-?1 significantly enhanced neuronal survival, but the co-presence of K252a completely suppressed the activity, demonstrating the involvement of Trk receptor signaling in TGF-?1-mediated neuronal survival in cultured rat cortical neurons. These results seem to be in line with recent findings by other investigators that some neurotrophic factors including BDNF require TGF-?s as a cofactor to exert their neurotrophic activities. J.

AB  - SUMMARY Animal reproductive biotechnology is continually evolving. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of early embryonic mortality and embryo development in domestic animals, which has improved the selection and success of in vitro technologies. Yet our knowledge is still relatively limited such that identifying a single embryo with the highest chance of survival and development for transfer remains challenging. While invasive methods such as embryo biopsy can provide useful information regarding the genetic status of the embryos, morphological assessment remains the most common evaluation. A recent shift, however, favors alternative, adjunct approaches for non-invasive assessment of an embryo's viability and developmental potential. Various analytical techniques have facilitated the evaluation of cellular health through the metabolome, the assessment of end products of cellular metabolism, or by analyzing spent media for small RNAs. This review discusses the application of noninvasive approaches for ascertaining the health and viability of in vitro-produced bovine embryos. A comparative analysis of noninvasive techniques for embryo assessment currently being investigated in cattle and humans is also discussed. Mol. Reprod.
