AB  - Abstract The intranuclear architectural protein that is termed high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) was recently identified as a potent proinflammatory mediator when present extracellularly. HMGB1 has been demonstrated to be a long-searched-for nuclear danger signal passively released by necrotic, as opposed to apoptotic, cells that will induce inflammation. Furthermore, HMGB1 can also be actively secreted by stimulated macrophages or monocytes in a process requiring acetylation of the molecule, which enables translocation from the nucleus to secretory lysosomes. Subsequenttransport out of the cells depends on a secretion signal mediated by either extracellular lysophophatidyl-choline or ATP. HMGB1 passively released from necrotic cells and HMGB1 actively secreted byinflammatory cells are thus molecularly different. Extracellular HMGB1 acts as a cytokine by signaling via the receptor for advanced glycated end-products and via members of the Toll-like receptor family. The initiated inflammatory responses include the production of multiple cytokines, chemoattraction of certain stem cells, induction of vascular adhesion molecules and impaired function of intestinalepithelial cells. Therapeutic administration of HMGB1 antagonists rescues mice from lethal sepsis, even when initial treatment is delayed for 24?h after the onset of infection, establishing a clinically relevant therapeutic window that is significantly wider than for other known cytokines.

AB  - Although originally described as a highly conserved nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, transcription and repair, high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) has emerged as a key mediator in the regulation of immune responses to infection and sterile injury by exhibiting all the properties of a prototypic ?alarmin?. These include rapid passive release in response to pathogenic infection and/or traumatic injury, active secretion providing for chemotactic and cytokine-like function and an ability to resolve inflammation, including tissue repair and remodelling. In this review, we will give an overview of the post-translational modifications necessary for such diversity in biological activity, concentrating particularly on how differences in oxidation of highly conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues can potentiate inflammatory responses and dictate cellular fate. We will also review the most recent literature on HMGB1 and its involvement in the pathophysiology of sepsis and cancer, as well as cancer therapy-induced mucositis.

AB  - Summary: Tissue damage occurs often in the life of mammals and is usually repaired. Dying cells are swiftly phagocytosed, but before disappearing, they alert surrounding cells to activate homeostatic programs. They release signals that recruit inflammatory cells to the site of injury, promote cell migration and cell division to replace dead cells, and activate the immune system in anticipation of microbial invasion. Many of these events involve high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a nuclear protein that is released passively when necrotic cells lose the integrity of their membranes. HMGB1 behaves as a trigger of inflammation, attracting inflammatory cells, and of tissue repair, recruiting stem cells and promoting their proliferation. Moreover, HMGB1 activates dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes their functional maturation and their response to lymph node chemokines. Activated leukocytes actively secrete HMGB1 in the microenvironment. Thus, HMGB1 acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and sustains long-term repair and defense programs. DCs secrete HMGB1 several hours after contact with the first maturation stimulus; HMGB1 secretion is critical for their ability to reach the lymph nodes, to sustain the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, to prevent their activation-dependent apoptosis, and to promote their polarization towards a T-helper 1 phenotype. These immune responses will also be directed against self-antigens that DCs process at the time of injury and can lead to autoimmunity.

AB  - Escin, a natural triterpene saponin mixture obtained from the horse chestnut tree (Aesculus hippocastanum), has been used for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), hemorrhoids, and edema. However, it is unclear how escin protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by pro-inflammatory high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1). Here, we report that escin can suppress (a) HMGB1-induced overexpression of the aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water channel in endothelial cells and (b) HMGB1-induced increases in endothelial cell permeability. This is the first report that escin inhibits AQP1 and alleviates barrier dysfunction in HMGB1-induced inflammatory response.

AB  - Abstract The deleterious impact of concomitant muscle injury on fracture healing and limb function is commonly considered part of the natural sequela of orthopedic trauma. Recent reports suggest that heightened inflammation in the surrounding traumatized musculature is a primary determinant of fracture healing. Relatedly, there are emerging potential therapeutic approaches for severe muscle trauma (e.g., volumetric muscle loss [VML] injury), such as autologous minced muscle grafts (1 mm3 pieces of muscle; GRAFT), that can partially prevent chronic functional deficits and appear to have an immunomodulatory effect within VML injured muscle. The primary goal of this study was to determine if repair of VML injury with GRAFT rescues impaired fracture healing and improves the strength of the traumatized muscle in a male Lewis rat model of tibia open fracture. The most salient findings of the study were: (1) tibialis anterior (TA) muscle repair with GRAFT improved endogenous healing of fractured tibia and improved the functional outcome of muscle regeneration; (2) GRAFT repair attenuated the monocyte/macrophage (CD45+CDllb+) and T lymphocyte (CD3+) response to VML injury; (3) TA muscle protein concentrations of MCP1, IL-10, and IGF-1 were augmented in a proregenerative manner by GRAFT repair; (4) VML injury concomitant with osteotomy induced a heightened systemic presence of alarmins (e.g., soluble RAGE) and leukocytes (e.g., monocytes), and depressed IGF-1 concentration, which GRAFT repair ameliorated. Collectively, these data indicate that repair of VML injury with a regenerative therapy can modulate the inflammatory and regenerative phenotype of the treated muscle and in association improve musculoskeletal healing.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in young individuals worldwide. However, the understanding of TBI at secondary phase remained obscure, and more knowledge of the pathophysiology of TBI is necessary. In this study, we examined the influence of bone fracture (BF) on TBI and investigated whether blocking high mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein, an inflammatory mediator, could be effective to alleviate TBI. We found neurological severity was significantly increased by BF at 4 days post-TBI with longer removal time of adhesive tape and higher percentage of left turn in the corner test compared to TBI treatment alone. Additionally, higher brain lesion volume and severer brain oedema in TBI + BF mice supports the negative effect of BF on TBI. HMGB1 level was significantly stimulated by BF, suggesting the important role of HMGB1 in the development of secondary TBI. Notably, ablation of HMGB1 significantly reduced this negative influence of BF on TBI. These results suggest that HMGB1 can be massively induced by the systemic immune activation triggered by BF, which in turn aggravates inflammation. Blocking HMGB1 reduced the inflammatory effect of BF and therefore helps lessen the severity of secondary TBI. In conclusion, these results provided the evidence that anti-HMGB1 may be an effective and feasible method to alleviate TBI.

AB  - Abstract Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a widely used clinical anesthetic with proven anti-inflammatory effects. Both high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and pyroptosis play an important role in the inflammatory response to infection and trauma. Thus far, there have been no studies published addressing the effect of DEX on HMGB1 and pyroptosis. In order to fill this gap in the literature, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were exposed to HMGB1 (4?µg/mL) with or without DEX (50??M) pretreatment. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1? (IL-1?), and IL-18], phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and P38, and the activation of caspase-1 were measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, confocal microscope, and flow cytometry, respectively. We found that DEX protected against HMGB1-induced cell death of BMDMs. In addition, DEX suppressed the generation of TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-18 as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. Moreover, DEX inhibited caspase-1 activation and decreased pyroptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the protective effect of DEX in mediating HMGB1-induced cellular injury, thus indicating that DEX may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of infection and trauma-derived inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA), an age-related degenerative joint disease, is pathologically characterized by articular cartilage degeneration and synovial inflammation. Nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV or CCN3), a matricellular protein, is a primary member of the CCN family (Cyr61, Ctgf, NOV) of proteins and is involved in various inflammatory disorders. Previous studies reported that CCN3 might play a therapeutic role in OA. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed the expression of CCN3 was decreased in human and rat OA articular cartilage. Recombinant CCN3 ameliorated the IL-1?-induced matrix catabolism, as demonstrated by MMP1, MMP3, MMP13, ADAMTS5 and iNOS expression, in vitro. In addition, the degradation of cartilage matrix such as collagen 2 and aggrecan could be reversed by CCN3. Furthermore, we found CCN3 promoted autophagy as Atg5, Beclin1 and LC3-II expression were increased. High-mobility group box 1 was negatively correlated with CCN3 in IL-1?-induced osteoarthritis responses, and HMGB1 is involved in the protective effect of CCN3 in OA. Moreover, CCN3 overexpression decreased the expression of HMGB1 and reversed the IL-1? induced MMPs production. Additionally, recombinant CCN3 or CCN3 overexpression attenuated the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway induced by IL-1?. Our study presents new mechanisms of CCN3 in osteoarthritis and indicates that CCN3 can serve as a novel potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two categories of joint overloading cause post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA): single acute traumatic loads/impactions and repetitive overloading due to incongruity/instability. We developed and refined three classes of complementary models to define relationships between joint overloading and progressive cartilage loss across the spectrum of acute injuries and chronic joint abnormalities: explant and whole joint models that allow probing of cellular responses to mechanical injury and contact stresses, animal models that enable study of PTOA pathways in living joints and pre-clinical testing of treatments, and patient-specific computational models that define the overloading that causes OA in humans. We coordinated methodologies across models so that results from each informed the others, maximizing the benefit of this complementary approach. We are incorporating results from these investigations into biomathematical models to provide predictions of PTOA risk and guide treatment. Each approach has limitations, but each provides opportunities to elucidate PTOA pathogenesis. Taken together, they help define levels of joint overloading that cause cartilage destruction, show that both forms of overloading can act through the same biologic pathways, and create a framework for initiating clinical interventions that decrease PTOA risk. Considered collectively, studies extending from explants to humans show that thresholds of joint overloading that cause cartilage loss can be defined, that to at least some extent both forms of joint overloading act through the same biologic pathways, and interventions that interrupt these pathways prevent cartilage damage. These observations suggest that treatments that decrease the risk of all forms of OA progression can be discovered. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? A vast literature extolling the benefits of melatonin has accumulated during the past four decades. Melatonin was previously considered of importance to seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythmicity. Currently, it appears to be a versatile anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative agent, a molecule with immunomodulatory actions and profound oncostatic activity, and also to play a role as a potent neuroprotectant. Nowadays, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement with differential availability as an over-the-counter aid in different countries. There is a widespread agreement that melatonin is nontoxic and safe considering its frequent, long-term usage by humans at both physiological and pharmacological doses with no reported side effects. Endeavors toward a designated drug status for melatonin may be enormously rewarding in clinics for treatment of several forms of neurotrauma where effective pharmacological intervention has not yet been attained. This mini review consolidates the data regarding the efficacy of melatonin as an unique neuroprotective agent in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Well-documented actions of melatonin in combating traumatic CNS damage are compiled from various clinical and experimental studies. Research on traumatic brain injury and ischemia/reperfusion are briefly outlined here as they have been recently reviewed elsewhere, whereas the studies on different animal models of the experimental spinal cord injury have been extensively covered in this mini review for the first time.

AB  - Summary Aim Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a growing and largely underestimated problem without defined etiology. Herein, we sought to determine the relationship between cognitive decline, blood?brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and inflammation, namely high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), after surgery in aged rats. Methods Aged rats were randomly assigned as surgery group (n = 45, splenectomy under general anesthesia), anesthesia (n = 45, 2% isoflurane for 2 h), and naïve control (n = 15). Markers of inflammation were measured in plasma and brain. Blood?brain barrier ultrastructure and permeability were measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and IgG immunohistochemistry. Cognitive function was assessed in a reversal learning version of the Morris water maze (MWM). Results Surgical trauma under general anesthesia caused distinct changes in systemic and central proinflammatory cytokines. Levels of HMGB1 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of operated animals. Immunohistochemistry and TEM showed BBB disruption induced by surgery and anesthesia. These molecular changes were associated with cognitive impairment in latency with the MWM up to postoperative day 3. Conclusions HMGB1 and RAGE signaling appear pivotal mediators of surgery-induced cognitive decline and may contribute to the changes in BBB permeability after peripheral surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) often leads to high mortality, and there is as yet no effective drug treatment. The present study aimed to investigate protective effects of mogroside IIIE (MGIIIE, a cucurbitane-type triterpenoid from Siraitia grosvenorii Fruits) in experimental ALI and its underlying mechanism. MGIIIE (1, 10 0r 20 mg/kg) was orally administered for 1 h before a single intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg). MGIIIE treatment dose-dependently suppressed pulmonary oedema, pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α and HMGB1) release and higher MPO activity in lung tissues induced by LPS challenge. Molecular researches showed that mogroside IIIE (20 mg/kg) not only increased the phosphorylation of adenosine 5?-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) but suppressed the over-expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). In addition, MGIIIE also inhibited the activation of MAPKs and nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B) signalling in lung tissues from LPS-challenged mice. Similar antiinflammatory effects of MGIIIE were obtained in LPS-treated macrophages. Compound C (a pharmacological AMPK inhibitor) obviously reversed the antiinflammatory effect of MGIIIE in LPS-induced ALI mice. Taken together, AMPK activation plays a crucial role in the antiinflammatory effects of MGIIIE in LPS-induced ALI by down-regulating TLR4/MAPK/NF-?B signalling pathways.

AB  - Abstract Altered inflammation in the early stage has long been assumed to affect subsequent steps of the repair process that could influence proper wound healing and remodeling. However, the lack of explicit experimental data makes the connection between dysregulated wound inflammation and poor wound healing elusive. To bridge this gap, we used the established rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model for studying the causal effect of dysregulated inflammation. We induced an exacerbated and prolonged inflammatory state in these wounds with the combination of trauma-related stimulators of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and damage-associated molecular patterns from a dermal homogenate. In stimulated wounds, a heightened and lengthened inflammation was observed based on quantitative measurements of IL-6 expression, tissue polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Along with the high level of inflammation, wound healing parameters (epithelial gap and others) at postoperative day 7 and 16 were significantly altered in stimulated wounds compared to unstimulated controls. By postoperative day 35, scar elevation of stimulated wounds was higher than that of control wounds (scar elevation index: 1.90 vs. 1.39, p?<?0.01). Moreover, treatment of these inflamed wounds with Indomethacin (at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.4%) reduced scar elevation but with adverse effects of delayed wound closure and increased cartilage hypertrophy. In summary, successful establishment of this inflamed wound model provides a platform to understand these detrimental aspects of unchecked inflammation and to further test agents that can modulate local inflammation to improve wound outcomes.

AB  - Abstract High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was originally defined as a ubiquitous nuclear protein, but it was later determined that the protein has different roles both inside and outside of cells. Nuclear HMGB1 regulates chromatin structure and gene transcription, whereas cytosolic HMGB1 is involved in inflammasome activation and autophagy. Extracellular HMGB1 has drawn attention because it can bind to related cell signalling transduction receptors, such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products, Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4 and TLR9. It also participates in the development and progression of a variety of diseases. HMGB1 is actively secreted by stimulation of the innate immune system, and it is passively released by ischaemia or cell injury. This review focuses on the important role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic sterile inflammatory conditions. Strategies that target HMGB1 have been shown to significantly decrease inflammation in several disease models of sterile inflammation, and this may represent a promising clinical approach for treatment of certain conditions associated with sterile inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) presents the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with largely unknown pathogenesis and inefficient therapeutic management. Accumulating data indicate that neuroinflammation, autophagy impairment, α-synuclein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to PD onset; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathophysiological processes are still under elucidation. Interestingly, recent evidence has indicated that High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a DNA-binding protein that can be actively secreted by inflammatory cells and passively released by necrotic cells may play a key role in PD pathogenesis. HMGB1 has been shown to participate in neuroinflammation, modulate autophagy and apoptosis as well as regulate gene transcription. Furthermore, therapeutic targeting of HMGB1 with either anti-HMGB1 antibodies or selective inhibitors, such as glycyrrhizin, has been shown to inhibit neurodegeneration in animal models. This review provides an update of recent data on the emerging role of HMGB1 in PD pathogenesis and discusses potential therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with metabolic alterations in various disease states, including major trauma (e.g., burn injury). Metabolic derangements, including muscle insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia, are a clinically significant complication of major trauma. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor for mitochondrial electron transport, and its reduced form acts as a lipophilic antioxidant. Here, we report that burn injury induces impaired muscle insulin signaling, hyperlactatemia, mitochondrial dysfunction (as indicated by suppressed mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates), morphological alterations of the mitochondria (e. g., enlargement, and loss of cristae structure), mitochondrial oxidative stress, and disruption of mitochondrial integrity (as reflected by increased mitochondrial DNA levels in the cytosol and circulation). All of these alterations were significantly alleviated by CoQ10 treatment compared with vehicle alone. These findings indicate that CoQ10 treatment is efficacious in protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of burned mice. Our data highlight CoQ10 as a potential new strategy to prevent mitochondrial damage and metabolic dysfunction in burn patients.
