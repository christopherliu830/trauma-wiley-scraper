AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the changes in gene expression known up to date that are associated with the application of orthodontic forces to induce orthodontic tooth movement. Histological and immunohistochemical studies have clearly demonstrated that orthodontic forces stimulate remodeling of the periodontal ligament (PDL). The application of orthodontic forces elicits a physical, cellular and molecular response from the PDL for affecting all tissues that constitute the periodontium including blood vessels. In order to achieve tooth movement, remodeling of the alveolar bone surrounding the dental roots is required. Bone remodeling in response to orthodontic forces requires the synchronized action of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and PDL cells. As expected, orthodontic tooth movement evokes a pronounced biological reaction in the dental pulp as well. The pulpal response to orthodontic force involves cell damage, inflammation and wound healing, processes that could adversely affect the dental pulp.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Fever is a fundamental response to infection and a hallmark of inflammatory disease, which has been conserved and shaped through millions of years of natural selection. Although fever is able to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, the very nature of all the molecular thermosensors, the timing and the detailed mechanisms translating a physical trigger into a fundamental biological response are incompletely understood. Here we discuss the consequence of hyperthermic stress in dendritic cells (DCs), and how the sole physical input is sensed as an alert stimulus triggering a complex transition in a very narrow temporal window. Importantly, we review recent findings demonstrating the significant and specific changes discovered in gene expression and in the metabolic phenotype associated with hyperthermia in DCs. Furthermore, we discuss the results that support a model based on a thermally induced autocrine signalling, which rewires and sets a metabolism checkpoint linked to immune activation of dendritic cells. Importantly, in this context, we highlight the novel regulatory functions discovered for IGFBP-6 protein: induction of chemotaxis; capacity to increase oxidative burst and degranulation of neutrophils, ability to induce metabolic changes in DCs. Finally, we discuss the role of IGFBP-6 in autoimmune disease and how novel mechanistic insights could lead to exploit thermal stress-related mechanisms in the context of cancer therapy.

AB  - Abstract Background Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protects the lung from sepsis-induced injury through activating Nrf2-regulated multiple phase 2 detoxification genes, including NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO1). Based on the positive effect of Sirtuin 6 on Nrf2, we aim to explore the potential role of SIRT6 in the mechanism of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Methods Mouse models of sepsis were constructed by instilling intratracheal of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 4?ml/kg). After 48-hour treatment, lung tissues were collected to measure the degree of lung injury. The SIRT6, siSIRT6, and siNrf2 plasmids were cotransfected into various concentrations of LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; 0, 1, 5, 10, and 50??g/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, NQO1, and HO1 was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Results Lung tissues in the model group already had basic characteristics of ALI. Compared with the control model, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were much higher (P?<?0.01), the levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, and Nrf2-modulated detoxification factors were downregulated (P?<?0.01). SIRT6 overexpression decreased the apoptosis below to 10% (P?<?0.01), significantly increased the Nrf2 expression, effectively inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 releases, and enhanced NQO1 and HO1 levels (P?<?0.01). siNrf2 abolished the protective effects of SIRT6 overexpression, including increasing apoptosis and inhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidative genes expressions (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Our study suggested SIRT6 positively regulated Nrf2 expression and activated Nrf2-regulated anti-inflammatory and antioxidative enzymes, which could effectively mitigate LPS-induced HUVECs inflammatory responses. This might reflect the mechanism of ALI induced by sepsis.
