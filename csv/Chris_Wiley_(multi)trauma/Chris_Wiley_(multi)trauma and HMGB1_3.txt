AB  - Abstract Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is a hallmark of sleep apnoea, a condition associated with diverse clinical disorders. CIH and sleep apnoea are characterized by increased reactive oxygen species formation, peripheral and CNS inflammation, neuronal death and neurocognitive deficits. Few studies have examined the role of microglia, the resident CNS immune cells, in models of CIH. Thus, little is known concerning their direct contributions to neuropathology or the cellular mechanisms regulating their activities during or following pathological CIH. In this review, we identify gaps in knowledge regarding CIH-induced microglial activation, and propose mechanisms based on data from related models of hypoxia and/or hypoxia?reoxygenation. CIH may directly affect microglia, or may have indirect effects via the periphery or other CNS cells. Peripheral inflammation may indirectly activate microglia via entry of pro-inflammatory molecules into the CNS, and/or activation of vagal afferents that trigger CNS inflammation. CIH-induced release of damage-associated molecular patterns from injured CNS cells may also activate microglia via interactions with pattern recognition receptors expressed on microglia. For example, Toll-like receptors activate mitogen-activated protein kinase/transcription factor pathways required for microglial inflammatory gene expression. Although epigenetic effects from CIH have not yet been studied in microglia, potential epigenetic mechanisms in microglial regulation are discussed, including microRNAs, histone modifications and DNA methylation. Epigenetic effects can occur during CIH, or long after it has ended. A better understanding of CIH effects on microglial activities may be important to reverse CIH-induced neuropathology in patients with sleep disordered breathing.

AB  - Abstract Recent studies have suggested that changes in serum phosphate levels influence pathological states associated with aging such as cancer, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular function, even in individuals with normal renal function. The causes are only beginning to be elucidated but are likely a combination of endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and cell autonomous effects. We have used an integrated quantitative biology approach, combining transcriptomics and proteomics to define a multi-phase, extracellular phosphate-induced, signaling network in pre-osteoblasts as well as primary human and mouse mesenchymal stromal cells. We identified a rapid mitogenic response stimulated by elevated phosphate that results in the induction of immediate early genes including c-fos. The mechanism of activation requires FGF receptor signaling followed by stimulation of N-Ras and activation of AP-1 and serum response elements. A distinct long-term response also requires FGF receptor signaling and results in N-Ras activation and expression of genes and secretion of proteins involved in matrix regulation, calcification, and angiogenesis. The late response is synergistically enhanced by addition of FGF23 peptide. The intermediate phase results in increased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production and is necessary for the late response providing a functional link between the phases. Collectively, the results define elevated phosphate, as a mitogen and define specific mechanisms by which phosphate stimulates proliferation and matrix regulation. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the cellular response to elevated extracellular phosphate, functionally connecting temporally coordinated signaling, transcriptional, and metabolic events with changes in long-term cell behavior.

AB  - Abstract One of the most overlooked of all serious complications of diabetes is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. There is now clear evidence that suggests activation of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic patients and that these correlate with abnormalities in sympathovagal balance. Dysfunction of the autonomic system predicts cardiovascular risk and sudden death in patients with type 2 diabetes. It also occurs in prediabetes, providing opportunities for early intervention. Simple tests that can be carried out at the bedside with real-time output of information ? within the scope of the practicing physician ? facilitate diagnosis and allow the application of sound strategies for management. The window of opportunity for aggressive control of all the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular events or sudden death with intensification of therapy is with short duration diabetes, the absence of cardiovascular disease and a history of severe hypoglycemic events. To this list we can now add autonomic dysfunction and neuropathy, which have become the most powerful predictors of risk for mortality. It seems prudent that practitioners should be encouraged to become familiar with this information and apply risk stratification in clinical practice. Several agents have become available for the correction of functional defects in the autonomic nervous system, and restoration of autonomic balance is now possible.

AB  - Abstract Cell death is an important biological process that is believed to have a central role in intestinal ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. While the apoptosis inhibition is pivotal in preventing intestinal I/R, how necrotic cell death is regulated remains unknown. Necroptosis represents a newly discovered form of programmed cell death that combines the features of both apoptosis and necrosis, and it has been implicated in the development of a range of inflammatory diseases. Here, we show that receptor-interacting protein 1/3 (RIP1/3) kinase and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein recruitment mediates necroptosis in a rat model of ischaemic intestinal injury in vivo. Furthermore, necroptosis was specifically blocked by the RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1. In addition, the combined treatment of necrostatin-1 and the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD acted synergistically to protect against intestinal I/R injury, and these two pathways can be converted to one another when one is inhibited. In vitro, necrostatin-1 pre-treatment reduced the necroptotic death of oxygen-glucose deprivation challenged intestinal epithelial cell-6 cells, which in turn dampened the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1?), and suppressed high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the subsequent release of HMGB1 into the supernatant, thus decreasing the activation of Toll-like receptor 4 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products. Collectively, our study reveals a robust RIP1/RIP3-dependent necroptosis pathway in intestinal I/R-induced intestinal injury in vivo and in vitro and suggests that the HMGB1 signalling is highly involved in this process, making it a novel therapeutic target for acute ischaemic intestinal injury.

AB  - Summary The paradigm of sepsis as an excessive inflammatory response to infection should now be extended to include activation and/or depression of numerous systems within the body. These include neural, immune, hormonal, bioenergetic and metabolic pathways. The levels of activity of these systems vary both with illness severity and over time. Perturbation of the components of each pathway is independently associated with a heightened mortality risk yet interactions and temporal relationships remain poorly understood. A better delineation of this intricate network and an enhanced ability to monitor these changes should lead to improved targeting of interventions and an avoidance of potentially harmful therapeutic strategies. In addition, greater recognition of the deleterious covert effects on these systems of many therapies currently established as standard management, for example inotropes, antibiotics and sedatives, should hopefully minimise the iatrogenic contribution to mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

AB  - Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the often fatal sequelae of a broad range of precipitating conditions. Despite decades of intensive research and clinical trials there remain no therapies in routine clinical practice that target the dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response that characterises ARDS. Neutrophils play a central role in the initiation, propagation and resolution of this complex inflammatory environment by migrating into the lung and executing a variety of pro-inflammatory functions. These include degranulation with liberation of bactericidal proteins, release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species as well as production of neutrophil extracellular traps. Although these functions are advantageous in clearing bacterial infection, the consequence of associated tissue damage, the contribution to worsening acute inflammation and prolonged neutrophil lifespan at sites of inflammation are deleterious. In this review, the importance of the neutrophil will be considered, together with discussion of recent advances in understanding neutrophil function and the factors that influence them throughout the phases of inflammation in ARDS. From a better understanding of neutrophils in this context, potential therapeutic targets are identified and discussed. ? 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Adult multipotent stem/progenitor cells, with remarkable regenerative potential, have been isolated from various components of the human periodontium. These multipotent stem/progenitor cells include the periodontal ligament stem/progenitor cells (PDLSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), the gingival mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (G-MSCs), and the alveolar bone proper stem/progenitor cells (AB-MSCs). Whereas inflammation is regarded as the reason for tissue damage, it also remains a fundamental step of any early healing process. In performing their periodontal tissue regenerative/reparative activity, periodontal stem/progenitor cells interact with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environmental, through their expressed receptors, which could influence their fate and the outcome of any periodontal stem/progenitor cell-mediated reparative/regenerative activity. The present review discusses the current understanding about the interaction of periodontal stem/progenitor cells with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environment, elaborates on the inflammatory factors influencing their stemness, proliferation, migration/homing, differentiation, and immunomodulatory attributes, the possible underlying intracellular mechanisms, as well as their proposed relationship to the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.
