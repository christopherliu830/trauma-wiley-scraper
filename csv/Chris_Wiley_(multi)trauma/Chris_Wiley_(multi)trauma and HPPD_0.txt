AB  - meyer r.m. & o?brien-pallas l.l. (2010)?Nursing services delivery theory: an open system approach. Journal of Advanced Nursing?66(12), 2828?2838. Abstract Aim.? This paper is a discussion of the derivation of the Nursing Services Delivery Theory from the application of open system theory to large-scale organizations. Background.? The underlying mechanisms by which staffing indicators influence outcomes remain under-theorized and unmeasured, resulting in a ?black box? that masks the nature and organization of nursing work. Theory linking nursing work, staffing, work environments, and outcomes in different settings is urgently needed to inform management decisions about the allocation of nurse staffing resources in organizations. Data sources.? A search of CINAHL and Business Source Premier for the years 1980?2008 was conducted using the following terms: theory, models, organization, organizational structure, management, administration, nursing units, and nursing. Seminal works were included. Discussion.? The healthcare organization is conceptualized as an open system characterized by energy transformation, a dynamic steady state, negative entropy, event cycles, negative feedback, differentiation, integration and coordination, and equifinality. The Nursing Services Delivery Theory proposes that input, throughput, and output factors interact dynamically to influence the global work demands placed on nursing work groups at the point of care in production subsystems. Implications for nursing.? The Nursing Services Delivery Theory can be applied to varied settings, cultures, and countries and supports the study of multi-level phenomena and cross-level effects. Conclusion.? The Nursing Services Delivery Theory gives a relational structure for reconciling disparate streams of research related to nursing work, staffing, and work environments. The theory can guide future research and the management of nursing services in large-scale healthcare organizations.

AB  - Abstract We evaluated the relationship between registered nurse (RN) staffing and six post-surgical complications: pneumonia, septicemia, urinary tract infections, thrombophlebitis, fluid overload, and decubitus ulcers, in a dataset that contained the present on admission (POA) indicator. We analyzed a longitudinal panel of 283 acute care hospitals in California from 1996 to 2001. Using an adaptation of the Quality Health Outcomes Model, we found no statistically significant relationships between RN staffing and the complications. In addition, the signs of the relationships were opposite to those expected. That is, as staffing increased, so did some of the complications. We discuss potential reasons for these anomalous results, including the possibility that increases in RN staffing may result in earlier detection of complications. Other explanations include issues with risk adjustment, the lack of nurse level variables in the model, and issues with the POA indicator itself. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aims To examine the association between nurse skill mix (the proportion of total hours provided by Registered Nurses) and patient outcomes in acute care hospitals. Design A quantitative systematic review included studies published in English between January 2000 ? September 2018. Data sources Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Joanna Briggs Institute were searched. Observational and experimental study designs were included. Mix-methods designs were included if the quantitative component met the criteria. Review methods The Systematic Review guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute and its critical appraisal instrument were used. An inverse association was determined when seventy-five percent or more of studies with significant results found this association. Results Sixty-three articles were included. Twelve patient outcomes were inversely associated with nursing skill mix (i.e., higher nursing skill mix was significantly associated with improved patient outcomes). These were length of stay; ulcer, gastritis and upper gastrointestinal bleeds; acute myocardial infarction; restraint use; failure-to-rescue; pneumonia; sepsis; urinary tract infection; mortality/30-day mortality; pressure injury; infections and shock/cardiac arrest/heart failure. Conclusion Nursing skill mix affected 12 patient outcomes. However, further investigation using experimental or longitudinal study designs are required to establish causal relationships. Consensus on the definition of skill mix is required to enable more robust evaluation of the impact of changes in skill mix on patient outcomes. Impact Skill mix is perhaps more important than the number of nurses in reducing adverse patient outcomes such as mortality and failure to rescue, albeit the optimal staffing profile remains elusive in workforce planning.

AB  - The phenol functionality is involved in diverse biological processes and functions, serving as a proton donor and as a metal-binding ligand. It is commonly found in many biochemicals (such as siderophores and the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan), pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics, metal-chelating agents, and diagnostic agents), and natural products (such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and salicylic acid). In association with other functional groups, the phenol moiety forms various types of metal-binding sites of diverse structures and functions, for example, for iron binding and transport, in enzymes for oxygenation of substrates, and for biotransformation of aromatic compounds. Many environmentally hazardous aromatic compounds such as bisphenol A, PCB, and DDT can be degraded by tyrosinate(phenolate)-containing metalloenzymes from microorganisms, which provides a clue for bioremediation of these toxic substances. Moreover, the phenol-containing wet-adhesive byssal proteins from some clams and mussels has stimulated further development of adhesive materials for medical and other applications; and the study of binding of transferrin with nanoparticles affords better understanding of protein?mineral interfacial interactions. In addition to these naturally occurring metal-phenolate centers, there are many metal complexes of phenol and derivatives that exhibit various catalytic activities and serve as structural and/or functional model systems for tyrosinate-containing metalloproteins.

AB  - Summary This chapter illustrates the metabolic processes involved in the overall metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein including the catabolic processes to produce energy and urea and anabolic processes to form tissue protein and energy stores, glycogen and lipids. It considers the following amino acid disorders: phenylketonuria (PKU) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiencies, maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), homocystinuria (HCU) and tyrosinaemia. For each condition, the prevalence, biochemistry, genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome and non dietetic treatment is described separately. All these amino acid conditions share the same principles of dietary management. Therefore, the dietary management for all conditions is considered in the chapter. A low protein diet is an essential part of the management of organic acidaemias (OAA), e.g. isovaleric acidaemia (IVA), glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1); and the urea cycle disorders (UCD). The chapter describes the provision of a low protein diet and acute management, common to these disorders.
