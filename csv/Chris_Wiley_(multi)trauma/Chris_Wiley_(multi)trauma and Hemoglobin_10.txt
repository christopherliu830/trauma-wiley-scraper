AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the reduction of bleeding and the need for transfusion in elderly intertrochanteric fracture patients. Methods A total of 100 patients with intertrochanteric fractures undergoing surgery were enrolled and randomly allocated to the TXA group in which patients (75.10?±?8.27?years old) were treated with 1 g of TXA, or the control group (77.82?±?6.42?years old) treated with a placebo. Surgery was performed by two senior orthopaedic surgeons from two institutions. The proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) was conducted using the standard procedure. Three outcome measures, including blood loss, transfusion, and complications, were recorded. Blood loss and transfusion were investigated to assess TXA's effectiveness, while complications were investigated to assess TXA's safety. Statistical indicators for blood loss included total, intraoperative, postoperative, and hidden blood loss volumes, calculated by hemoglobin levels, hematocrit levels, and drainage volume. The number and amount of blood transfusions were recorded. Complications associated with surgery, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound hematoma, wound infection, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular accidents, and respiratory infections, were also recorded. Results All patients were followed up for 1?month after surgery. There were no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. The TXA group suffered significantly less total blood loss (563.37?±?197.51 vs 819.25?±?273.96 mL, 95% CI: ?349.49 to ?162.27, P?<?0.01), intraoperative blood loss (140.3?±?80.64 vs 230.5?±?130.56 mL, 95% CI ?132.74 to ?47.66, P?<?0.01), and hidden blood loss (410.42?±?178.23 vs 571.19?±?218.13 mL, 95% CI: ?238.85 to ?82.69, P?<?0.01) than the control group. However, postoperative total blood loss was not significantly different (97.5?±?20.93 vs 94.7?±?35.78 mL; P = 0.63). A total of 5?patients from the TXA group and 27 from the control group received packed RBC for postoperative transfusion, but the mean number of transfusion units was not significantly different between groups. Complications including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebral infarction, hematoma, and infection were observed in both groups, but no significant differences were found. Conclusions In intertrochanteric fracture surgery performed using PFNA, intravenous administration of TXA significantly reduced the risk of intraoperative, total and hidden blood loss, in addition to the need for allogeneic transfusion, without increasing the rate of complications.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Objective This study sought to assess the long-term clinical benefits and predictors of survival of trans-catheter aortic valve closure in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients. Background LVADs have been shown to increase survival and quality of life in patients with end-stage heart failure. However, severe aortic insufficiency (AI) can develop in up to 50% of patients at 12 months resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Trans-catheter treatment of LVAD associated AI has emerged as a potential alternative to surgical treatment. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure using an Amplatzer Multi-Fenestrated Septal Occluder ?Cribriform? device to assess potential clinical and procedural factors associated with survival. Student's t-tests were used to compare baseline patient demographics and procedural characteristics, as well as patient outcomes immediately post procedure and at 6 months. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 10 patients (70% male, median age 59 years) were included. Technical success was accomplished in 100% of patients with a 6 month survival rate of 30% (3/10). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had a higher rate of pre-procedural clinical co-morbidities, an increased likelihood of right ventricular failure, and received larger occluder devices. Conclusions Trans-catheter aortic valve closure successfully treats late severe AI in LVAD patients, however, the presence or development of right heart failure portends a worse prognosis. Further studies are needed to investigate the factors involved in the development of right ventricular failure, and potential treatment, in patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve closure. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Sickle cell diseases or the thalassemias are the most prevalent monogenetic disorders worldwide. In sickle cell disease, transfusions prevent and/or treat complications and ameliorate anemia. In the thalassemias, transfusion prevents the anemia associated with decreased or absent hemoglobin production. The human blood groups are either receptors for the malarial parasite or are involved in the rosetting of red cells infected with the malarial parasite. Alpha thalassemia is the most common single-gene disease in the world. Red cell transfusion has been a therapy for sickle cell disease for decades, becoming more prevalent since the institution of nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT), leukoreduction, and routine red cell phenotyping for transfusion. Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) has a worldwide distribution, but it is more common in malarial areas. The congenital hemolytic anemias are a diverse group of blood diseases that generally do not require red cell transfusion.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - A standardized trauma was inflicted to the lateral side of the calf muscle of 12 New Zealand rabbits, creating a muscle hematoma without external bleeding. The acute hematoma was evaluated within 3 h with radionuclide imaging of red blood cells labelled with 99mTc pertechnetate, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results were compared with the total volume of the hematomas as calculated from histological preparations of each injured muscle. Scintigraphy and T2-weighted MRI accurately detected all hematomas but the calculated volume did not significantly correlate with histology. T1-weighted MRI did not detect the hematomas. Ultrasonography detected all hematomas and also accurately evaluated the volume. In conclusion, scintigraphy, MR imaging and ultrasonography are all sensitive enough to detect an acute muscle injury, but in this investigation only ultrasonography accurately quantified the volume of the hematoma.

AB  - SUMMARY Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery (MOS) whereas hematinic deficiency can delay the recovery from postoperative anemia. Both conditions can, however, be corrected before elective procedures are undertaken. We therefore evaluated the prevalence of anemia and hematinic deficiencies in MOS patients. Demographic and laboratory data were gathered from all MOS patients from a single institution between January 2001 and December 2002. A total of 715 patients (483 women/232 men) entered the study. According to WHO criteria, the prevalence of anemia was 10.5% and increased with age, without gender-related differences. Preoperative hemoglobin was <?13?g/dL in 19.4% of patients, and the prevalence of hematinic deficiencies was 33% for iron, 12.3% for vitamin B12 and 3% for folate. In anemic patients, there were 30.8% with hematinic deficiency anemia (20% with iron-deficiency anemia), 30.8% with anemia of chronic disease and 38.4% with anemia of mixed or indeterminate cause. The prevalence of anemia, as well as of hematinic deficiencies, is high in MOS patients. Therefore, whenever possible, patients undergoing MOS should be assessed early enough to allow for proper investigation and treatment prior to the scheduled procedure.

AB  - Abstract The small intestine plays a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure following circulatory shock. Current results show that reduced perfusion of the small intestine compromises the mucosal epithelial barrier, and the intestinal contents (including pancreatic digestive enzymes and partially digested food) can enter the intestinal wall and transport through the circulation or mesenteric lymph to other organs such as the lung. The extent to which the luminal contents of the small intestine mediate tissue damage in the intestine and lung is poorly understood in shock. Therefore, rats were assigned to three groups: No-hemorrhagic shock (HS) control and HS with or without a flushed intestine. HS was induced by reducing the mean arterial pressure (30 mmHg; 90 min) followed by return of shed blood and observation (3 h). The small intestine and lung were analyzed for hemorrhage, neutrophil accumulation, and cellular membrane protein degradation. After HS, animals with luminal contents had increased neutrophil accumulation, bleeding, and destruction of E-cadherin in the intestine. Serine protease activity was elevated in mesenteric lymph fluid collected from a separate group of animals subjected to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. Serine protease activity was elevated in the plasma after HS but was detected in lungs only in animals with nonflushed lumens. Despite removal of the luminal contents, lung injury occurred in both groups as determined by elevated neutrophil accumulation, permeability, and lung protein destruction. In conclusion, luminal contents significantly increase intestinal damage during experimental HS, suggesting transport of luminal contents across the intestinal wall should be minimized.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Angiosarcoma is a rare form of soft tissue sarcoma. Primary small intestinal angiosarcomas are especially uncommon. The clinical presentations of small intestinal angiosarcomas vary but gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a frequent finding. We present a case of persistent GI bleeding of unknown etiology culminating in operative exploration demonstrating a primary small intestinal angiosarcoma. A discussion of the diagnosis, pathology, and management of angiosarcoma with a review of the current literature is provided including molecular genetics, difficult cases, and current treatment options.

AB  - Spontaneous papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is a rare cardiovascular emergency. We present a 63-year-old male who presents with acute dyspnea who was found to have an anterior PMR, with no evidence of coronary artery disease, infection, or trauma. A review of cases of nonischemic spontaneous PMR published in 2000?2015 identified 11 additional cases of spontaneous PMR. Posterior and anterior papillary muscles involvement was identified in 54.5% and 45.5% of cases, respectively. Rapid identification due to advances in imaging modalities and improved surgical management has led to optimal outcomes in patients with spontaneous PMR.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.
