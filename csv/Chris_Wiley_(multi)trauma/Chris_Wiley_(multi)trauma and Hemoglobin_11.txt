AB  - Case Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) caused by Clostridium butyricum is common in neonates; however, a case of NEC in adults has not been previously reported. An 84-year-old Japanese man developed C. butyricum-related NEC during hospitalization for treatment of stab wounds to the left side of the neck and lower abdomen, without organ damage, and concomitant pneumonia. Outcome The patient developed acute onset of emesis accompanied by shock during his admission; partial resection of the small intestine was carried out due to necrosis. Pathologic findings showed mucosal necrosis and extensive vacuolation with gram-positive rods in the necrotic small intestine. Blood culture tests revealed C. butyricum infection. The patient's condition improved after the surgery. He was moved to a rehabilitation hospital on day 66. Conclusion This study suggests that hospitalized adult patients who receive antibiotic treatment are at risk for NEC.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess quality of life (QOL) in 119 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and 89 hemodialysis (HD) patients using the SF-36 instrument (PF?=?physical function, RP?=?role limitations physical, BP?= bodily pain, GH?=?general health perceptions, VT?=?vitality, SF?=?social function, RE?=?role limitations emotional, MH?=?mental health, MCS?=?mental summary, and PCS?= physical summary). The mean (range) s-creatinine in the CKD group was 325??mol/L (133?809??mol/L). There were no differences in SF-36 scores between CKD and HD patients (Figure). CKD/HD status did not predict MCS or PCS in multivariate analyses controlling for age (p?<?0.01 for PCS), sex, depression (p?=?0.01 for PCS), Charlson comorbidity score (p?<?0.01 for PCS), s-albumin (p?=?0.05 for PCS), hemoglobin, presence of partner, and level of education. We conclude that QOL is related to comorbid illness and decreases even before dialysis is started. Longitudinal studies of QOL in CKD patients are needed to evaluate the influence of dialysis initiation on QOL.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: Resuscitation studies of hypertonic saline using controlled and uncontrolled hemorrhage models yield conflicting results with regard to efficacy. These disparate results reflect the use of models and resuscitation regimens that are not comparable between studies. This study evaluated the effects of comparable and clinically relevant resuscitation regimens of 7.5% sodium chloride/6% dextran 70 (HSD) and 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) in a near-fatal uncontrolled hemorrhage model. Methods: Thirty-six swine (14.2 to 21.4 kg) with 4-mm aortic tears were bled to a pulse pressure of 5 mm Hg (40-45 mL/kg). The animals were resuscitated with either NS or HSD administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates. Group II (n = 12) was resuscitated with 80 mL/kg of NS at a rate of 4 mL/kg/min. Group III (n = 12) received 9.6 mL/kg of HSD at a rate of 0.48 mL/kg/min. In both groups, crystalloid resuscitation was followed by shed blood infusion (30 mL/kg) at a rate of 2 mL/kg/min. Group I (controls; n = 12) were not resuscitated. Results: One-hour mortality was significantly greater in group I (92%) as compared with group II (33%) and group III (33%) (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.004). Intraperitoneal hemorrhage was significantly greater in group II (34 ± 20 mL/kg) and group III (31 ± 13 mL/kg) as compared with group I (5 ± 2 mL/kg) (ANOVA; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters between groups II and III. Conclusion: In this model of severe uncontrolled hemorrhage, resuscitation with HSD or NS, administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates, had similar effects on mortality, hemodynamic parameters, and hemorrhage from the injury site.

AB  - Abstract Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) are a recent innovation in the management of portal hypertension. In 1992, we had previously described an instance of severe hemolysis associated with this procedure. This study was undertaken to define and quantify the true incidence of TIPS-associated hemolysis and its clinical spectrum, as well as to test the hypothesis that portal decompression by TIPS would ameliorate hypersplenism in patients with portal hypertension. A total of 60 patients undergoing TIPS for prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage (n = 40) or refractory ascites (n = 20) were studied. Forty patients with cirrhosis who were followed concurrently served as controls. At entry, both groups were comparable with the exception of increased ascites in the TIPS group. A total of 7 instances of intravascular hemolysis were identified in 60 TIPS patients, whereas none occurred in controls. Of these, 4 patients were asymptomatic and detected on routine laboratory testing. Hemolysis led to a greater than 4-g/dL decrease in hemoglobin in 2 patients, 2- to 3-g/dL decrease in 2 others and a 3- to 4-gm/dL decrease in 1 patient. Two patients were able to compensate for hemolysis and did not develop anemia. In all but 1 case, the findings of hemolysis subsided by 12 to 15 weeks; in 1 patient, orthotopic liver transplantation was associated with resolution of the hemolysis. Overall, no significant changes in white blood cell or platelet counts were observed in patients undergoing TIPS despite adequate portal decompression. We conclude that TIPS-induced hemolysis occurs in approximately 10% of subjects. However, it is self-limited and rarely requires intervention. Potential mechanisms of such hemolysis are discussed. TIPS is also not recommended as a means of improving platelet counts in patients with severe hypersplenism.

AB  - Background Free tissue transfers performed in patients with hematological diseases represent significant challenges for micro-surgeons. There are rare literatures that address the outcome in these patients. Therefore, we collected our database, analyzed the outcome, reliability, and related-management of microsurgical technique in the patients with hematological diseases. Methods A retrospective chart review of 20 patients with hematological disorders who received free tissue transfers during 20-years period in a single microsurgical center was done. Eleven patients who received head and neck reconstruction were found to have hyperfibrinogenemia. Seven patients with reactive thrombocytosis after trauma, and two patients with leukemia had soft tissue defects in the upper and lower extremities. Twenty-six flaps were used for free tissue transfers. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion. Anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) was given postoperatively. Results Twenty-three of the 26 free flaps survived without vascular compromise. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion, and anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 was given to the patients postoperatively. The three failed cases were found in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and needed further reconstruction with another flap. The overall success rate was 88.5% (23/26). Conclusions Hematologic disorder is not a predicted factor of free flap failure. The key factors for success flap survival in patients with hematologic disorders include preoperative knowledge of the medical condition and monitoring potential post-operative complications, aggressive hematologist consultations, and meticulous non-traumatic surgical anastomosis. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis are typically anemic due to a lack of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone required for red blood cell (RBC) production. EPO replacement therapy is complex, often resulting in oscillating hemoglobin (Hb) levels. EPO dosing protocols do not account for endogenous delays and appear to contribute to, if not cause, Hb variability. The Mayo Clinic Anemia Management System (MCAMS) is based on a physiological simulation of the production and lifespan of RBCs, driven by EPO dosage schedules. Patient-specific parameters were found such that simulated Hb levels matched historical Hb levels in response to historical EPO doses. The calibrated model was used to identify new dosing regimens that stabilize Hb. MCAMS has been used to recommend individualized EPO dosage regimens to maintain stable Hb levels within a desired target range for more than 600 patients, improving patient outcomes while reducing medication costs by about 40 percent. ? 2018 System Dynamics Society

AB  - Leukoreduction of blood products is a technique used to prevent leukocyte-induced transfusion reactions. Filters currently used for human blood products achieve at least a 99.9% reduction in leukocyte numbers per unit (450 mL) of blood. Goals of this study were to determine if a prestorage leukoreduction filter could effectively achieve leukoreduction of canine blood and to determine if viability of the leukoreduced red blood cell (RBC) product could be maintained after 35 days of storage. Blood collected from each dog was filtered through a leukoreduction filter at either room temperature or after cooling (4°C) for 4 hours. Filtration efficacy was determined by measurement of pre- and postfiltration leukocyte counts. In vitro viability of RBCs was determined by comparing RBC adenosine triphosphate concentration and percent hemolysis before and after the storage period. In vivo viability of stored cells was determined using a biotin-streptavidin-phycoerythrin labeling technique and flow cytometry. Blood filtered within 30 minutes of collection versus blood filtered after cooling had mean reductions in leukocyte numbers of 88.90 and 99.99%, respectively. The mean ATP and hemoglobin concentrations from the in vitro analysis were comparable to those obtained in previously for canine RBC adequately stored for 35 days. The mean in vivo 24-hour survival of the stored RBC was 84.7%. The leukoreduction filter used did not adversely affect in vitro or in vivo viability of canine RBCs. The filter effectively removed leukocytes from blood, with maximal efficiency of filtration achieved with use of cooled blood.

AB  - Summary Major burn injury remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. With advances in burn care and with the development of experienced multi-disciplinary teams at regionalized burn centers, many children are surviving severe burn injury. As members of the multi-disciplinary care team, anesthesia providers are called upon to care for these critically ill children. These children provide several anesthetic challenges, such as difficult airways, difficult vascular access, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, altered temperature regulation, sepsis, cardiovascular instability, and increased requirements of muscle relaxants and opioids. The anesthesia provider must understand the physiologic derangements that occur with severe burn injury as well as the subsequent anesthetic implications.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.
