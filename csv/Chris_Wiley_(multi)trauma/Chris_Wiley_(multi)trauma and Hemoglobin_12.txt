AB  - BACKGROUND The short shelf-life of fresh platelets limits their efficient inventory management and availability during a massive transfusion protocol. Risk of insufficient availability can be mitigated by building an inventory of cryopreserved platelets (CPs). METHODS A comparative study of fresh apheresis platelets (FAPs) and CPs was performed. Type-O CPs were processed with DMSO frozen at ?80°C and reconstituted in thawed AB plasma. All patients enrolled in the study had the following parameters evaluated on admission: vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure), blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and, in trauma patients, international severity score. Several outcomes were evaluated: 30-day survival, adverse events, quantity of administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate and thromboxane (TXA), and laboratory parameters after transfusion (blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level). RESULTS Twenty-five (25) patients in the study group received transfusions totaling 81?units of CPs. Twenty-one (21) patients in the control group received a total of 67?units of FAPs. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics (p?>?0.05) between groups. Both groups were comparable in clinical outcomes (30-day survival, administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate, TXA, and adverse events). Among posttransfusion laboratory parameters, platelet count was higher in the group transfused with FAPs (97.0 ?109/L) than in the group transfused with CPs (41.5 ?109/L), p?=?0.02025. Other parameters were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION The study suggests that CPs are tolerable and a feasible alternative to FAPs. However, larger randomized studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - A progressive pulmonary disease resulting in severe respiratory failure and death in an average of 3 weeks was diagnosed in 11 young Dalmatian dogs. The dogs were from 4 litters, all genetically related by a common ancestor. The initial clinical signs were tachypnea and noisy respiration. Respiratory distress developed shortly before death and was characterized by strenuous and rapid respirations, along with cyanosis and vomiting. On blood gas analysis, there were severe arterial hypoxemia, hypercapma, and marked alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Radiographically, a diffuse pattern of alveolar, interstitial, and peribronchial densities was observed in the lungs. Most dogs developed pneumomediastinum and gastroesophageal intussusception in the terminal phase of the disease. There was no response to treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, diuretics, or oxygen. At necropsy, the lungs were wet, heavy, and relatively airless. Absence of 1 kidney in 2 dogs and severe internal hydrocephalus in 2 dogs were additional necropsy findings. Pulmonary histopathology included metaplasia and atypia of the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, a nonpurulent inflammatory reaction characterized mainly by mononuclear cells and macrophages, eosinophilic hyaline membrane formation, and focal pulmonary fibrosis. The histological manifestations were typical of acute lung injury. Clinically, the findings were consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), except for the relatively long course. No known risk factors for ARDS, such as trauma, toxin exposure, infection, or endotoxemia could be identified. The relationship of the other abnormalities (ie, renal aplasia, hydrocephalus) to the pulmonary disease also remains obscure. An inherited defect is suspected, because segregation analysis of the 4 litters suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.

AB  - Summary This chapter aims to discuss the incidence, etiology, and risk factors of onychomycosis. Onychomycosis is distributed worldwide with high demographic and ethnic variations in its etiological agents. The incidence of onychomycosis among participants of certain sports is often exacerbated by repeated trauma or concurrent tinea pedis infection. The high prevalence of onychomycosis among diabetics could be explained by the high incidence of peripheral neuropathy and impaired peripheral circulation, both of which are also responsible for the complicated course of onychomycosis in the patients. The risk of onychomycosis in diabetics is almost triple that in non-diabetics and in some epidemiological studies, onychomycosis was diagnosed in more than 50% of diabetic patients. Among the risk factors that increase the susceptibility of the age bracket to tinea unguium are positive family history, participation in sports, and hormonal changes during puberty.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - As baby boomers age, diabetes mellitus, cancer, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and orthopedic disorders are more widespread and the demand for better biomedical devices and functional biomaterials is increasing rapidly. Owing to the good biocompatibility, chemical stability, catalytic efficiency, plasticity, mechanical properties, as well as strength-to-weight ratio, titanium dioxide (TiO2) based nanostructured materials are playing important roles in tissue reconstruction and diagnosis of these diseases. Here, recent advance in the research of nanostructured TiO2 based biomaterials pertaining to bone tissue engineering, intravascular stents, drug delivery systems, and biosensors is described.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane for inhalant anesthesia in red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) in terms of the speed and characteristics of induction; cardiovascular and respiratory parameters while anesthetized; and speed and quality of recovery. Study design? Prospective, cross over, randomized experimental study. Animals? 12 healthy adult red-tailed hawks. Methods? Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane in oxygen via face mask in a crossover, randomized design with a 1?week washout period between each treatment. Hawks were tracheally intubated, allowed to breathe spontaneously, and instrumented for cardiopulmonary monitoring. Data collected included heart rate, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, inspired and expired agent, SpO2, temperature, systolic blood pressure, time to intubation and time to recovery (tracking). Recovery was subjectively scored on a 4 point scale as well as a summary evaluation, by a single blinded observer. Results? No significant difference in time to induction and time to extubation was noted with the administration of isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane. Time to the ability of the bird to follow a moving object with its eyes (tracking) was significantly faster with the administration of sevoflurane and desflurane. All recoveries were scored 1 or 2 and were assessed as good to excellent. No significant difference was noted in heart rate, blood pressure and temperature among the three inhalants. Administration of isoflurane resulted in lower respiratory rates. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Overall, although isoflurane remains the most common inhaled anesthetic in avian practice, sevoflurane and desflurane both offer faster time to tracking, while similar changes in cardiopulmonary function were observed with each agent during anesthesia of healthy red-tailed hawks.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) patients are often inconvenienced when intravenous iron preparations are administered. Formerly, these patients received their medication in the clinic on an off-dialysis day or during in-center hemodialysis (HD). For the last 2 years, 5 patients in our HHD program have been receiving intravenous ferric gluconate during their routine HD session. Procedure:? All patients were trained in the proper administration of ferric gluconate in-center. No test dose was administered. Ferric gluconate was infused via the heparin infusion pump on their HD machine at a rate of 31.25?mg/h. Doses were of either 62.5?mg or 125?mg per session. K/DOQI guidelines for intravenous iron use were adhered to. TSATs greater than 25%, ferritin greater than 100?ng/mL and less than 800?ng/mL, and hemoglobin between 11 and 12?g% were the goals of therapy. Both loading doses (8 doses during sequential HD sessions) and maintenance doses every week or every other week were employed. Results:? Over the last 2 years, 223 doses were administered at home. No serious reactions occurred during the course of therapy. One patient experienced minor nausea and vomiting during one dose, which was thought to be possibly related to the iron infusion. This patient subsequently received ferric gluconate again without difficulty. Conclusion:? Ferric gluconate can be safely administered at home during HHD.

AB  - Abstract Erythrocytes must maintain a biconcave discoid shape in order to efficiently deliver oxygen (O2) molecules and to recycle carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules. The erythrocyte is a small toroidal dielectrophoretic (DEP) electromagnetic field (EMF) driven cell that maintains its zeta potential (?) with a dielectric constant (?) between a negatively charged plasma membrane surface and the positively charged adjacent Stern layer. Here, we propose that zeta potential is also driven by both ferroelectric influences (chloride ion) and ferromagnetic influences (serum iron driven). The Golden Ratio, a function of Phi offers a geometrical mathematical measure within the distinct and desired curvature of the red blood cell that is governed by this zeta potential and is required for the efficient recycling of CO2 in our bodies. The Bio-Field Array (BFA) shows potential to both drive/fuel the zeta potential and restore the Golden Ratio in human erythrocytes thereby leading to more efficient recycling of CO2. Live Blood Analyses and serum CO2 levels from twenty human subjects that participated in immersion therapy sessions with the BFA for 2 weeks (six sessions) were analyzed. Live Blood Analyses (LBA) and serum blood analyses performed before and after the BFA immersion therapy sessions in the BFA pilot study participants showed reversal of erythrocyte rheological alterations (per RBC metric; P = 0.00000075), a morphological return to the Golden Ratio and a significant decrease in serum CO2 (P = 0.017) in these participants. Immersion therapy sessions with the BFA show potential to modulate zeta potential, restore this newly defined Golden Ratio and reduce rheological alterations in human erythrocytes.

AB  - Aim Short sleep duration is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Cerebral blood flow and its regulation are affected by pathological conditions commonly observed in the elderly population, such as dementia, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), stroke, and hypertension. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of sleep duration on cortical oxygenated hemoglobin (OxyHb) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods Seventy-three individuals (age, 70.1?±?3.9?years, 51 men and 22 women) participated in this study. Cortical OxyHb levels were measured with NIRS. We evaluated age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol intake, sleep duration, hypertension, DM, and hyperlipidemia using a questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured using plethysmography. Results Peak OxyHb and area under the NIRS curve significantly decreased in participants with sleep duration <7?h compared with those with sleep duration ≥7?h (0.136?±?0.212?mM·mm vs 0.378?±?0.342?mM·mm, P?=?0.001; 112.0?±?243.6 vs 331.7?±?428.7, P ?=?0.012, respectively). Sleep duration was significantly correlated with peak OxyHb level and area under the NIRS curve (r?=?0.378, P ?=?0.001; r?=?0.285, P ?=?0.015, respectively). Multiple regression analysis, including age, BMI, sex, smoking status, alcohol intake, sleep duration, hypertension, DM, and hyperlipidemia revealed that sleep duration was the only significant independent factor associated with peak OxyHb and area under the NIRS curve (??=?0.343, P ?=?0.004; ??=?0.244, P ?=?0.049, respectively), and smoking status was independently correlated with time to the peak OxyHb (??=??0.319, P ?=?0.009). Conclusion Sleep duration may be an important factor that influences cortical oxygenation in the elderly population.

AB  - Various factors are associated with foot ulceration, including delayed reporting of ulcers, poor glycemic control, and severity of neuropathy. Several studies have looked at the role of nitric oxide in wound healing. However, no studies have examined its role in the occurrence and recurrence of diabetic foot ulceration. In a cross-sectional study we examined the role of neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and plasma nitric oxide (estimated from plasma nitrite and nitrate) levels in diabetic patients with recurrent and non-recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers. Patients with recurrent foot ulcers had higher vibration perception threshold values compared to patients with non-recurrent foot ulcers (47.4 ± 5.7 volts versus 39.5 ± 10.3 volts respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, subjects with recurrent foot ulcers had significantly higher plasma nitric oxide compared to subjects with non-recurrent foot ulcers (46.9 ± 6.3 ?m/L versus 30.2 ± 2.4 ?m/L respectively, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, presence of retinopathy and nephropathy, vibration perception threshold, plasma creatinine, and total nitric oxide, indicated that only vibration perception threshold was independently associated with the presence of an ulcer [odds ratio: 1.26 (1.10-1.46); P <0.001)] and the recurrence of foot ulcers [odds ratio: 1.13 (1.01-1.27); P=0.04)]. This study has shown that although plasma nitric oxide is higher in patients with recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers, severity of neuropathy was the most important factor associated with the development and recurrence of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol with or without 2% benzyl alcohol administered intravenously (IV) as a single induction dose in cats. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six healthy adult cats, three female intact, three male castrated, weighing 4.8 ± 1.8 kg. Methods Cats received 8 mg kg?1 IV of propofol (P) or propofol with 2% benzyl alcohol (P28) using a randomized crossover design. Venous blood samples were collected at predetermined time points to 24 hours after drug administration to determine drug plasma concentrations. Physiologic and behavioral variables were also recorded. Propofol and benzyl alcohol concentrations were determined using high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were described using a 2-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were analyzed using repeated measures anova (p < 0.05). Results Plasma concentrations of benzyl alcohol were below the lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) at all time points for two of the six cats (33%), and by 30 minutes for the remaining four cats. Propofol pharmacokinetics, with or without 2% benzyl alcohol, were characterized by rapid distribution, a long elimination phase, and a large volume of distribution. No differences were noted between treatments with the exception of clearance from the second compartment (CLD2), which was 23.6 and 38.8 mL kg?1 minute?1 in the P and P28 treatments, respectively. Physiologic and behavioral variables were not different between treatments with the exception of heart rate at 4 hours post administration. Conclusions and clinical relevance The addition of 2% benzyl alcohol as a preservative minimally altered the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol 1% emulsion when administered as a single IV bolus in this group of cats. These data support the cautious use of propofol with 2% benzyl alcohol for induction of anesthesia in healthy cats.

AB  - Pelvic exsanguination is usually fatal unless the patient is injured in a city or region that has a sophisticated trauma care system. Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ?? Delayed definitive reconstruction when physiologically stable

AB  - Abstract Among end-stage renal disease patients maintained by hemodialysis, anemia has been managed primarily through erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and intravenous (IV) iron. Following concerns about the cardiovascular (CV) safety of ESAs and changes in the reimbursement policies in Medicare's ESRD program, the use of IV iron has increased. IV iron supplementation promotes hemoglobin production and reduces ESA requirements, yet there exists relatively little evidence on the long-term safety of iron supplementation in hemodialysis patients. Labile iron can induce oxidative stress and is also essential in bacterial growth, leading to concerns about IV iron use and risk of CV events and infections in hemodialysis patients. Existing randomized controlled trials provide little evidence about safety due to insufficient power and short follow-up; recent observational studies have been inconsistent, but some have associated iron exposure with increased risk of infections and CV events. Given the widespread use and potential safety concerns related to IV iron, well-designed large prospective studies are needed to assess to identify optimal strategies for iron administration that maximize its benefits while avoiding potential risks.
