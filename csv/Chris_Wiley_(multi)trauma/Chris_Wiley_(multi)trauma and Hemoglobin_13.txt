AB  - Abstract The in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) is now a powerful technique in biomedical research, especially for tracking specific cells in circulatory system. The current fluorescence-based IVFC is limited to visible spectrum, while near infrared (NIR) dyes have their advantages, such as deeper penetration, less absorption and less scattering for NIR fluorescence. Here, using an NIR in vivo flow cytometer with a 785 nm laser excitation, the measurement of fluorescent dye IR-780 labeled circulating cells is demonstrated. Representative peaks corresponding to NIR fluorescent circulating cells are detected and quantified. In addition, blood flow information, including the blood flow velocity and flow volume per unit time, is obtained. By simultaneous detection of IR-780 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) signals from dual labeled cells, the IR-780 is shown to be a suitable fluorescent dye for multicolor detection by IVFC, including NIR. Thus, the IVFC is extended to the NIR range and shows potential application in biomedical research. ? 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - Background The increasing use of fresh blood group O whole blood in acute trauma medicine makes it important to reevaluate the issue of hemolytic reactions related to the transfusion of ABO-incompatible plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This review summarizes and evaluates published articles and case reports concerning hemolytic reactions in connection with the transfusion of group O whole blood or blood products to nongroup O recipients. Results In 1945-1986, 15 nonmilitary publications reported hemolytic transfusion reactions with group O blood/blood products. All patients recovered except for two fatalities. Late in World War II and during the Korean and Vietnam wars and onward in Iraq and Afghanistan only ?low anti-A, anti-B titer? group O whole blood has been used as universal blood. In spite of a large number of units transfused, there are no reports of hemolytic reactions. Twenty-five publications report hemolytic reactions after transfusion of group O platelets to nongroup O recipients. In all patients but one, the titer of the implicated A- or B-antibody was >100 (saline) or >400 (antiglobulin) and all cases with an infused volume of incompatible plasma <200?mL were related to anti-A or anti-B antiglobulin titers >1000. Conclusion In emergency lifesaving resuscitation, the risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions from transfusion of group O blood to nongroup O recipients constitutes risk that is outweighed by the benefits. A low titer of anti-A/B will minimize the risk for a hemolytic reaction, particularly if the screening is repeated after an immunization episode, e.g., blood transfusion, vaccination, or pregnancy.

AB  - Scurvy is a rarely seen disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. We present a case of scurvy in a 65-year-old man. The patient reported heavy alcohol abuse over the last several years. He also reported that his diet consisted of cheese pizzas only. On physical examination, he was noted to have spontaneous ecchymosis of his lower extremities (denying any history of trauma); poor dentition; and corkscrew hairs on his chest, abdomen, and legs, with associated perifollicular petechia. Punch biopsy of his skin lesions revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation, with some focal perifollicular erythrocyte extravasation. A serum ascorbic acid level was<0.12 mg/dL (normal range, 0.20?1.9 mg/dL). A diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency was made. The patient was successfully treated with 1 g/d vitamin C for the first 5 days, followed by a dose of 500 mg/d. Though scurvy is rarely seen in modern times, it is important to identify who is at risk and to recognize the clear and classic signs and symptoms associated with scurvy. Failure to diagnose this disease can potentially lead to expensive and unnecessary medical tests, as well as missing a very simple treatment that can prevent infection and even death.

AB  - Abstract Minimally invasive techniques enable diagnostics and surgery to be performed through a small incision. This greatly reduces the damage to healthy tissue leading to faster recovery times for the patient. However, the surgeon is deprived of the sensory feedback available with normal surgical techniques. Miniaturised sensors can provide this information about location, diagnostics and the treatment. This application severely limits the size of the device, with some catheters being less than 1 mm in diameter. Catheters are usually defined in multiples of 1/3 mm or 1 french. Further important issues are bio-compatibility, safety and the ability of the sensor to withstand the working environment. Sensors able to meet these demands are improving the efficiency of operations and are opening new opportunities for minimally invasive techniques.

AB  - A 50-year-old Caucasian male presented with generalised skin rash. Gingival hyperplasia and hepatosplenomegaly were also noted. His laboratory data showed hemoglobin of 10.3?g/dL, white blood cell count of 203.6?K/uL and platelet count of 72?K/uL. Peripheral blood smears revealed that 67% of the white blood cells was monoblasts, 25% was promonocytes and atypical monocytes. Bone marrow aspirate smears showed that 97% of the nucleated cells were composed of monoblasts and promonocytes. Approximately 80% of the immature cells showed intense non-specific butyrate esterase activity. The morphologic and cytochemical findings were compatible with a diagnosis of acute monocytic leukaemia. Skin biopsy taken from the left medial thigh revealed a Grenz zone and a dense infiltrate of atypical cells throughout the dermis. The cells were positive for KP1 (CD68) immunohistochemical stain. The findings were consistent with cutaneous manifestation of leukaemia (leukaemia cutis). The patient?s condition deteriorated rapidly despite chemotherapy and expired 10 days after initial presentation. Leukaemia cutis is more common in acute monoblastic/monocytic leukaemia (AMoL) than in other subtypes of leukaemia. Leukaemia gingival hyperplasia is another characteristic feature of AMoL. Dissemination to the skin is generally associated with a poor prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used for most severe acute respiratory distress syndrome cases in specialized centers. Hemocompatibility of devices depends on the size and modification of blood contacting surfaces as well as blood flow rates. An interventional lung assist using arteriovenous perfusion of a low-resistance oxygenator without a blood pump (Novalung, Hechingen, Germany) or a miniaturized ECMO with reduced filling volume and a diagonal blood pump (Deltastream, Medos AG, Stolberg, Germany) could optimize hemocompatibility. The aim of the study was to compare hemocompatibility with conventional ECMO. Female pigs were connected to extracorporeal circulation for 24?h after lavage induced lung injury (eight per group). Activation of coagulation and immune system as well as blood cell damage was measured. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. Plasmatic coagulation was slightly activated in all groups demonstrated by increased thrombin-anti-thrombin III-complex. No clinical signs of bleeding or thromboembolism occurred. Thrombelastography revealed decreased clotting capacities after miniaturized ECMO, probably due to significantly reduced platelet count. These resulted in reduced dosage of intravenous heparin. Scanning electron microscopy of oxygenator fibers showed significantly increased binding and shape change of platelets after interventional lung assist. In all groups, hemolysis remained negligible, indicated by low plasma hemoglobin concentration. Interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentration as well as leukocyte count remained unchanged. Both devices demonstrated adequate hemocompatibility for safe clinical application, although a missing blood pump did not increase hemocompatibility. Further studies seem necessary to analyze the influence of different blood pumps on platelet drop systematically.

AB  - Abstract Hypovolemia and hypotension in traumatized patients as well as those undergoing long-lasting surgical procedures lead to hypoperfusion of tissues. Combined with the trauma of flap elevation and the warm ischemia during performance of the anastomoses, hypoperfusion of flap tissues may lead to flap failure. The influence of hypovolemia, ischemia and reperfusion on flap macro- and microcirculation was studied in an acute experiment on a new musculocutaneous pectoralis flap developed in minipigs. Using a multichannel laser Doppler system we studied, simultaneously and continuously, microcirculatory flow (MBF) in both the skin and muscle of the flap as well as in the contralateral control skin and muscle in anesthetized minipigs (n = 7). Measurements were done before and after raising the flap, after 90 min of flap ischemia, during mild to moderate hypovolemia (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% blood loss) and during and after restoration of blood volume. Electromagnetic flowmetry was used to measure total blood flow (TBF) to the flap. All animals remained hemodynamically stable during the experiment. The flap MBF decreased by 20% in the skin and 25% in the muscle after flap elevation with no changes in the control skin and muscle. After flap ischemia and reperfusion, MBF returned to post-elevation values while TBF showed a significant increase as compared to MBF (P<0.05). Hypovolemia caused a gradual drop in cardiac output (25%) and mean arterial pressure (40%), but both recovered above the baseline after reinfusion of shed blood. Hypovolemia also caused a 60% reduction in MBF in both flap skin and muscle, and only 20?23% in control skin and muscle (P<0.01). After reinfusion of shed blood the MBF in the flap remained 30?40% below and the TBF increased 20% over the baseline. The MBF in control skin and muscle increased more than 20% over baseline (P<0.01). It was concluded that MBF in flap skin and muscle decreased by approximately 20?25% as a consequence of flap elevation, while central parameters remained normal. It was shown that even during moderate hypovolemia, MBF in the flap might decrease to critical levels. We suggest that intensive monitoring of central hemodynamics and continuous LDF monitoring of the flap during and after surgery should be performed in order to restore the blood volume expeditiously and prevent irreversible damage to flap tissues. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Persons with diabetes require surgical procedures at a higher rate and have longer hospital stays than those without diabetes. Approximately 5% of persons with diabetes will require emergency surgery over their lifetime. The actual perioperative glycemic treatment recommendations for a given patient should be individualized, based on factors such as current glycemic control, type of diabetes, nature and extent of surgical procedure, and antecedent diabetes therapy. The management goal is to optimize metabolic control through close monitoring, adequate fluid and caloric repletion, and judicious use of insulin. Other endocrine and metabolic derangements (e.g., adrenal insufficiency; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism; carcinoid crisis; hyponatremia; and hypercalcemia) are also common in the emergency perioperative setting and warrant prompt review and management.

AB  - Atherosclerotic lesion of coronary artery frequently accompanies intimal hyperplasia of radial artery. We have reported that the lesion of radial artery (intimal hyperplasia) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is associated with early access failure (EAF) as well as ischemic heart disease (IHD) (Am J Kidney Dis. 2003; 41: 422?428). Objective:? This study was designed to determine the impact of IHD on the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 125 nondiabetic HD patients who received radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula operation for the first time. We evaluated IHD before the operation through clinical symptoms and electrocardiography and then investigated EAF within 1 year after the operation. We analyzed the access patency rates between the patients with and without IHD, using Kaplan?Meier method and log-rank test. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors of the EAF. Results:? The mean age of the patients was 48?±?14 years, and the number of females was 54 (43.2%). Of the total 125 patients, 19 patients (15.4%) had IHD before the operation. The EAF developed in 23 patients (18.4%) within 1 years after the operation. The access patency rate in the patients with IHD was lower than that in the patients without IHD (39.7 vs. 88.3%, p?<?0.001). IHD and old age were independent risk factors of the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. But sex, smoking history, hypertension, and the levels of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, albumin, and total cholesterol checked before the operation were not associated with the EAF. Conclusion:? This study suggests that IHD is closely associated with EAF in nondiabetic HD patients.

AB  - Objective/Background Historically, the sole option for patients with a dysfunctional native right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) requiring re-establishment of pulmonary competence has been surgical PVR. We sought to compare early outcomes of hybrid pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) combining surgical plication of the main pulmonary artery followed by transcatheter PVR, with a contemporary cohort of surgical PVR patients. Methods Retrospective chart analysis of all patients with a dilated native RVOT eligible for surgical PVR over 36 months was performed. The cohorts included patients with previous tetralogy of Fallot repair (n?=?14), and previous intervention for congenital abnormality of the pulmonary valve (n?=?7). Results Twenty-one patients with a dysfunctional native RVOT met criteria for PVR; 8 using the hybrid procedure (group 1: age, 31.5 +/? 17.4 years) and 13 with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (group 2: age, 31 +/? 18.4 years). Valve delivery was successful in all patients with no procedural mortality. Group 1 had a lesser requirement for blood products (P =< 0.001) and a trend toward shorter hospital stay and higher post-operative hemoglobin. No patients in group 1 received inotropic support post-operatively compared to 54% of patients in group 2. Mean follow-up was 3.4 months for group 1 and 13.6 months for group 2 with the average peak gradient across the RVOT of 20.1 and 15.1 mm Hg respectively (P?=?0.12), all with no more than mild PI. Conclusions Transcatheter hybrid PVR following RVOT plication provides a reasonable alternative to surgical PVR particularly in higher risk cohorts, reducing possible longer-term consequences of repeated runs of CPB. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? An obstetric hemorrhage may occur before or after delivery, but more than 80% of cases occur postpartum. Worldwide, a massive obstetric hemorrhage, resulting from the failure of normal obstetrical, surgical and/or systemic hemostasis, is responsible for 25% of the estimated 358?000 maternal deaths each year. Most women will not have identifiable risk factors. Nonetheless, primary prevention of a postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) begins with an assessment of identifiable risk factors. Women identified as being at high risk of a PPH should be delivered in a center with access to adequately trained staff and an onsite blood bank. A critical feature of a massive hemorrhage in obstetrics is the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which, in contrast to DIC that develops with hemorrhage from surgery or trauma, is frequently an early feature. Data from clinical trials to guide management of transfusion in PPH are lacking. There are likely to be similarities in the management of transfusion in severe PPH to that of major bleeding in other clinical situations, but the pathophysiological processes that contribute to a massive PPH may necessitate different transfusion strategies such as the ratio of red blood cells to plasma components, in particular fibrinogen. Caution should be exercised when considering the appropriate place for recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in the management of a major PPH. An early hysterectomy is recommended for severe bleeding as a result of placenta accreta or uterine rupture. However, in women with uterine atony who have ongoing bleeding in spite of an adequate transfusion, it may be reasonable to consider a trial of rFVIIa before a hysterectomy.
