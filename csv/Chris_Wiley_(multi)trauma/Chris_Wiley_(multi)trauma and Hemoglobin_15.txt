AB  - Intercostal catheter placement is common practice in the management of haemothorax and pneumothorax, with over 12,000 being inserted per year (1) in Australian hospitals. It is however an invasive procedure with the potential for significant iatrogenic injury. This is even more pertinent in the trauma setting where stress levels are high and time may be limited. Historically, complications that have been associated with intercostal catheter placement include: lung parenchymal laceration, bleeding from intercostal vessel injury, cardiac injury, ectopic tube placement, empyema, diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal organ laceration. In an attempt to minimise and avoid these complications, there has been a shift in the teaching of the method of tube placement from that of a trocar technique to the blunt dissection (EMST) approach (2). While this will hopefully reduce the rate of procedural complications, it still may not guarantee clinical practice free of complications. Furthermore when these complications are suspected, there is a need for repeated clinical assessment (at times, independent of imaging) in order to allow the early identification any such iatrogenic injury. The presentation will provide a review of the literature and outline the various forms of iatrogenic injury associated with tube thoracostomy; highlight the importance of clinical reassessment following intercostal catheter placement, with particular reference to a case presentation; and discuss techniques to avoid and minimise potential complications.

AB  - Background The present interdisciplinary consensus review proposes clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthetic practice in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. Methods Studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined and reviewed. The group reached a consensus recommendation after critical appraisal of the literature. Results This consensus statement demonstrates that anaesthesiologists control several preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative ERAS elements. Further research is needed to verify the strength of these recommendations. Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each element of perioperative care pathways, the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ?) Society presents a comprehensive consensus review, clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthesia care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery within an ERAS programme. This unified protocol facilitates involvement of anaesthesiologists in the implementation of the ERAS programmes and allows for comparison between centres and it eventually might facilitate the design of multi-institutional prospective and adequately powered randomized trials.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, and hypertensive emergencies. Takotsubo's syndrome or broken heart syndrome is a transient cardiomyopathy that causes significant cardiac depression and closely resembles acute coronary syndromes. Patients typically present with respiratory failure after a significant upper airway problem with EKG changes including ST segment elevation and T wave inversion, and mildly elevated cardiac enzymes. According to recent guidelines, in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with bare metal or drug eluting stent implantation, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor should be continued for at least 12 months. Elective noncardiac surgeries should be delayed in order to complete a full year of DAPT. Betablockers are drugs of choice for patients with long QT syndrome, which is the most common type of inherited arrhythmia.

AB  - This paper reviews the management of head injuries arising in the rural and remote areas of Queensland. Methodology? Data was obtained from the Queensland Trauma Registry from January 2003 to December 2004, a total of 3,088 patients, 1667 classified as major injury. Queensland is the second largest state in Australia with most of the 4 million population living along the eastern seaboard, mainly in the southeast corner and a widely dispersed rural population in small towns. There are neurosurgical services in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Townsville. Results? Forty percent of patients are referred from another hospital for definitive care with transfer times of up to 10 hours between the referring and definitive care hospital. Of those requiring craniotomy 60% of patients are referred from a another hospital again with lengthy transfer times well beyond the 2 hour transfer time for the deteriorating head injury with intracranial haemorrhage as recommended in the NSA/RACS set of guidelines for the ?Management of Acute Neurotrauma in Rural and Remote Locations?. This paper reviews the problems which include deficient retrieval resources, a reluctance by non-neurosurgeons to perform emergency neurosurgery, a lack of training amongst younger surgeons, and perceived medicolegal issues. The paper also compares the situation in other states and territories. Conclusions? Recommendations are made to improve the delivery of neurotrama care.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief summary of natural history of ursids and practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases. It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) is superior to in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) in terms of survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. However, assistance from family members in performing HHD is not always available to patients, and professional assistance for HHD can be cost prohibitive. For certain patients, ICHD can be impractical due to difficulties in transportation, which may necessitate ambulance transportation or hospitalization for in-hospital hemodialysis (IHHD). We describe 4 patients that have had problems receiving ICHD for various reasons. Two of these patients had problems with transportation, while the other two could not remain on dialysis for the prescribed duration of time and, therefore, received inadequate dialysis. These patients had difficulty while receiving ICHD in meeting the adequacy criteria set by Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative. One of these patients had a neuropsychiatric disorder and displayed disruptive behavior. When these 4 patients were switched to staff-assisted home hemodialysis (SAHD), the dialysis core indicators improved compared with ICHD, and the patients needed significantly fewer hospitalization days. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in patients that cannot be easily transferred, and in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, SAHD can be a less expensive and more efficacious modality of dialysis.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Background and Aim Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) or ?watermelon stomach? is a rare and often misdiagnosed cause of occult upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment includes conservative measures such as transfusion and endoscopic therapy. A recent report suggests that endoscopic band ligation (EBL) offers an effective alternative treatment. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate our experiences with this novel technique, and to compare argon plasma coagulation (APC) with EBL in terms of safety and efficacy. Methods A retrospective analysis of all endoscopies with a diagnosis of GAVE was carried out between 2004 and 2010. Case records were examined for information pertaining to the number of procedures carried out, mean blood transfusions, mean hemoglobin, and complications. Results A total of 23 cases of GAVE were treated. The mean age was 73.9 (55?89) years. Female to male ratio was 17:6 and mean follow up was 26 months. Eight patients were treated with EBL with a mean number of treatments of 2.5 (1?5). This resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the endoscopic appearance and a trend towards fewer transfusions. Of the eight patients treated with EBL, six (75%) patients had previously failed APC treatment despite having a mean of 4.7 sessions. Band ligation was not associated with any short- or medium-term complications. The 15 patients who had APC alone had a mean of four (1?11) treatments. Only seven (46.7%) of these patients had any endoscopic improvement with a mean of four sessions. Conclusions EBL represents a safe and effective treatment for GAVE.

AB  - Abstract Objective The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper. Methods Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition, depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and gel electrophoresis. Results ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference in TNF-α and IL-1? levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment. After treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? were significantly decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes. Conclusion ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical symptoms and the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts.

AB  - Abstract History CaridianBCT apheresis machines require a ~285 mL priming volume (extracorporeal blood) that is withdrawn from the patient in ~10 minutes. Therefore, apheresis in dogs has generally been limited to dogs > ~20 kg to assure <20% of the blood volume is removed in the priming phase. Animals/physical examination Three dogs weighing <14 kg (13.6, 10.5, and 9.9 kg) with lymphoma that underwent apheresis. Management The dogs were premedicated for placement of apheresis catheters with hydromorphone (0.1 mg kg?1) IM. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, to effect, intravenously and general anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Following catheter placement, dogs were allowed to recover from isoflurane but were kept sedated with either a dexmedetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) or a propofol CRI. Real time autologous blood priming was not performed in any of the dogs. Instead, priming solutions were composed of a combination of hetastarch, lactated Ringer's solution, and/or autologous blood that was harvested 4 days before the procedure. During apheresis, dogs received anticoagulant citrate-dextrose, solution-A (ACD-A) to prevent clotting and 10% calcium gluconate as needed to maintain normal ionized calcium concentrations. Dogs were monitored for cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary stability, anemia and lactic acidosis. Follow-up All of the dogs had cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary values within clinically acceptable ranges. Immediately following apheresis all of the dogs were mildly to moderately anemic (PCV; 17?35%) although none of the dogs required a transfusion or had an increased lactate concentration. Conclusions Dogs as small as 9.9 kg can successfully undergo apheresis with a variety of priming solutions. Dexmedetomidine or propofol given as a CRI provides sufficient sedation for this procedure.

AB  - Introduction: The amount of oxygen in blood is an important measure of lung function. There are three ways to quantify the amount of oxygen in blood: 1) the oxygen tension (PO2); 2) the percent of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (HbO2); and 3) the absolute content of oxygen in the blood (ContO2). PO2 is commonly measured. HbO2 and ContO2 are usually calculated from the normal human oxyhemoglobin relationship, but can be measured directly. The canine curve is similar to, but not the same as, that of humans. The purpose of this study was to compare, in dogs, direct measurements of HbO2 and ContO2 with analyzer-calculated values derived using the human oxyhemoglobin curve, and with hand-calculated values derived using a canine oxyhemoglobin curve. Materials And Methods: Arterial and jugular venous samples from 17 healthy dogs were analyzed by an ABL 705 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer, an OSM3 co-oximeter, and a LexO2con oxygen content analyzer. HbO2 was calculated from the measured PO2 using a published formula based on normal canine data (Reeves, 1982), and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. ContO2 values were calculated, and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. Means and standard deviations were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Results: Arterial HbO2 determined by the ABL 705 factory-programmed algorithm, reported by the OSM3 co-oximeter, and calculated from Reeves' canine formula were significantly different (97.1±0.57, 98.2±0.58, and 96.6±0.74, respectively). The calculated canine HbO2 was significantly lower than that measured by the OSM3 or calculated by the ABL for both arterial and jugular venous samples. Calculated and measured arterial and venous ContO2 were similar, as were arterial-venous ContO2 differences. However, values derived from the calculated canine HbO2 (canine-calculated) resulted in the greatest arterial-venous ContO2 difference. Conclusion: ABL-calculated and canine-calculated HbO2 were similar to measured values. Likewise, ABL-calculated, canine-calculated, and OSM3-calculated ContO2 were very similar to measured values. Although some of the values generated by the different methods are statistically significantly different, these differences are unlikely to be clinically important in the healthy dog.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the incidence of canine post-anesthetic aspiration pneumonia (AP) and to identify anesthetic agents, procedures and management factors associated with the development of AP. Study design Multicenter, randomized, case-controlled retrospective study. Animals Two hundred and forty dogs affected with AP and 488 unaffected control dogs. Methods Electronic medical record databases at six Veterinary colleges were searched for dogs, coded for anesthesia or sedation and pneumonia from January 1999 to December 2009. The resultant 2158 records were hand-searched to determine eligibility for inclusion. Diagnosis of AP was made radiographically. Two unaffected control dogs were randomly selected for each affected dog, from a list of dogs that underwent sedation or anesthesia in the same time period and did not develop aspiration pneumonia. Fifty-seven factors were then evaluated for association with aspiration pneumonia. Data analysis was performed using univariate Chi-square or student t-tests, then multivariate logistic regression. Results Incidence of post-anesthetic AP was 0.17%, from 140,711 cases anesthetized or sedated over the 10 year period. Two anesthesia-related events were significantly associated with development of AP: regurgitation and administration of hydromorphone at induction. Administration of anticholinergics was not associated with AP. Procedures associated with increased odds of aspiration pneumonia included laparotomy, upper airway surgery, neurosurgery, thoracotomy and endoscopy. Orthopedic surgery, ophthalmologic surgery, dental procedures, MRI, CT, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, tracheoscopy and neutering were not associated with development of AP. Three patient factors were associated with the development of AP: megaesophagus, and a history of pre-existing respiratory or neurologic disease. Sixty-nine% of dogs with two or more of the above independent predictive variables developed AP. Conclusion and clinical relevance Most anesthetic agents and procedures were not associated with the development of AP. We need to devise and evaluate strategies to protect at risk patients.
