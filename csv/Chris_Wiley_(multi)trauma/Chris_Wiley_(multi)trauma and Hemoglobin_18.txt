AB  - Summary Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent endocrine emergencies in individuals with diabetes mellitus. However, hypoglycemia in the healthy or non-diabetic individual is rare. This review will focus on the pathophysiology, management, and etiology of hypoglycemia in persons with and without diabetes. Hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes will focus on multiple factors including hypoglycemic unawareness, glucose monitoring, medication management, and comorbidities. Hypoglycemia in the non-diabetic individual can have multiple etiologies and poses a diagnostic challenge. It is important to respond quickly and appropriately to acute hypoglycemia in any individual. Although broad, the etiology of hypoglycemia must include a comprehensive and individualized review of medical, family, social, and pharmacologic patient histories.

AB  - Summary Background and objective:? To identify the many roles of the hospital pharmacist in improving the health and outcomes for in-patients experiencing episodes of hyperglycaemia. Methods:? Information for this article was selected from articles found on MEDLINE between 1998 and 2008 on the topics of hospital management of hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes. The article was further developed according to the clinical experiences of the author. Results:? When discussing the identification and treatment of hyperglycaemia in hospitalized patients, it is important to include the many aspects of glycaemic control that can be provided by hospital pharmacists. These include tasks such as patient screening and identification, monitoring glycaemic parameters, documenting therapy and therapeutic end points, and evaluating prescribing habits. Risk evaluation, guideline implementation, and a coordinated multi-disciplinary approach to discharge planning can be used to improve diabetes management by incorporating the entire hospital health-care team in patient care and education. Conclusions:? Hospital pharmacists should develop and implement protocolized care for the management of patients with hyperglycaemia throughout the institution in order to optimize the efficacy and safety of insulin therapy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the efficacy of three surgical approaches for the treatment of cervicothoracic tuberculosis. Methods This is a multicenter retrospective study. We analyzed 74 patients with cervicothoracic tuberculosis who were treated in six institutions between January 2000 and January 2015. There were 37 male and 37 female patients, with an average age of 24?years (range, 5?62?years). The operative method was selected according to the indications. A total of 33?patients underwent one-stage anterior surgery (group A); 16 underwent a combined anterior and posterior surgery (group B) and 25 underwent one-stage posterior surgery (group C). Clinical outcomes, laboratory indexes, and radiological results were analyzed. Results All cases were followed up for approximately 36?96?months post-surgery (average, 39?months). At the last follow-up, patients in all three groups had achieved bone fusion, with pain relief and neurological recovery. No major vessel and nerve injuries were found during the operation. There were significant differences before and after treatment for visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score (P?<?0.001). Three surgical strategies significantly improved kyphosis (P?<?0.001). Conclusion The choice of operation for cervicothoracic tuberculosis should be selected based on the pathological changes, scope, and general physical condition of the patient. The indication for a posterior approach is narrow and it should be used selectively. The combined anterior and posterior approach involved a longer operating time, larger blood loss, and greater trauma, and also required a higher level of surgical skill. Therefore, the indications for this approach should be strictly controlled. Anterior approach surgery for the treatment of cervicothoracic tuberculosis showed excellent efficacy and fewer complications.

AB  - Abstract Background Primary postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity internationally. Research comparing physiological (expectant) and active management of the third stage of labor favors active management, although studies to date have focused on childbirth within hospital settings, and the skill levels of birth attendants in facilitating physiological third stage of labor have been questioned. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of place of birth on the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and the effect of mode of management of the third stage of labor on severe postpartum hemorrhage. Methods Data for 16,210 low-risk women giving birth in 2006 and 2007 were extracted from the New Zealand College of Midwives research database. Modes of third stage management and volume of blood lost were compared with results adjusted for age, parity, ethnicity, smoking, length of labor, mode of birth, episiotomy, perineal trauma, and newborn birthweight greater than 4,000 g. Results In total, 1.32 percent of this low-risk cohort experienced an estimated blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. Place of birth was not found to be associated with risk of blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. More women experienced blood loss greater than 1,000 mL in the active management of labor group for all planned birth places. In this low-risk cohort, those women receiving active management of third stage of labor had a twofold risk (RR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.39?3.22) of losing more than 1,000 mL blood compared with those expelling their placenta physiologically. Conclusions Planned place of birth does not influence the risk of blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. In this low-risk group active management of labor was associated with a twofold increase in blood loss greater than 1,000 mL compared with physiological management. (BIRTH 39:2 June 2012)

AB  - Abstract The effect of recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) on renal and systemic hemodynamics was evaluated in a randomized double-blinded, cross-over study. Sixteen healthy subjects were tested with placebo, or low-dose rhEPO for 2 weeks, or high-dose rhEPO for 3 days. Subjects refrained from excessive salt intake, according to instructions from a dietitian. Renal clearance studies were done for measurements of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the segmentel tubular handling of sodium and water (lithium clearance). rhEPO increased arterial blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and renal vascular resistance, and decreased renal plasma flow in the high-dose rhEPO intervention and tended to decrease GFR. In spite of the decrease in renal perfusion, rhEPO tended to decrease reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal tubule and induced a prompt decrease in circulating levels of renin and aldosterone, independent of changes in red blood cell mass, blood volumes, and blood pressure. We also found changes in biomarkers showing evidence that rhEPO induced a prothrombotic state. Our results suggest that rhEPO causes a direct downregulation in proximal tubular reabsorption that seems to decouple the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system from changes in renal hemodynamics. This may serve as a negative feed-back mechanism on endogenous synthesis of EPO when circulating levels of EPO are high. These results demonstrates for the first time in humans a direct effect of rhEPO on renal hemodynamics and a decoupling of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess the cardiopulmonary effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine for management of isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses. Study design Prospective randomized clinical study. Animals Fourteen isoflurane-anesthetized horses undergoing digital palmar neurectomy. Methods Ephedrine (EPH group; 0.02 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) or phenylephrine (PHE group; 0.002 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) was administered to all horses when mean arterial pressure (MAP) was <60 mmHg. The infusions were ended when the target MAP was achieved, corresponding to a 50% increase over the pre-infusion MAP (baseline). The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow the collection of blood for pH and blood-gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded at baseline and at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after achieving the target MAP. Results In both groups, the MAP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased significantly at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05). The EPH group had a significant increase in cardiac index (CI) and systemic oxygen delivery index at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05) and compared to the PHE group (p < 0.05). The PHE group had significantly higher SVR and no decrease in oxygen extraction compared with the EPH group at 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion (p < 0.05). No significant differences in ventilatory parameters were observed between groups after the infusion. Conclusions Ephedrine increased the MAP by increasing CI and SVR. Phenylephrine increased MAP by increasing SVR but cardiac index decreased. Ephedrine resulted in better tissue oxygenation than phenylephrine. Clinical relevance Ephedrine would be preferable to phenylephrine to treat isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses since it increases blood flow and pressure.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia and quality of recovery in client-owned dogs with intracranial disease undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study design Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals Twenty-five client-owned dogs with intracranial pathology, 13 females and 12 males, ages 11 months to 13 years, weighing between 3.0 and 48.0 kg. Methods Each dog was randomly assigned to receive propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. All dogs were not premedicated, were administered propofol intravenously to effect for induction, intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide tension 30?35 mmHg (4.0?4.7 kPa). Temperature and cardiac output were measured pre- and post-MRI. Scores for mentation, neurological status, ease of maintenance, and recovery were obtained pre- and post-anesthesia. Pulse oximetry, end-tidal gases, arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and requirements for dopamine administration to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg were recorded throughout anesthesia. Results End-tidal isoflurane concentration was 0.73 ± 0.35% and propofol infusion rate was 292 ± 119 ?g kg?1 minute?1. Cardiac index was higher, while HR was lower, with propofol than isoflurane in dogs younger than 5 years, but not in older dogs. Dogs maintained with isoflurane were 14.7 times more likely to require dopamine than propofol dogs. Mentation and maintenance scores and temperature were not different. MAP and diastolic arterial pressure were higher in the propofol group. Recovery scores were better with propofol, although times to extubation were similar. Change in neurological score from pre- to post-anesthesia was not different between treatments. Conclusions Dogs maintained with propofol during MRI had higher arterial pressures, decreased requirements for dopamine, and better recovery scores, compared to dogs maintained with isoflurane. Clinical relevance Propofol anesthesia offered cardiovascular and recovery advantages over isoflurane during MRI in dogs with intracranial disease in this study.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Trace elements are essential for many physiologic processes. In recent years, supplementation has been studied for a variety of indications, including glycemic control, wound healing, antioxidant effect, and anemia. Critical illness, especially states such as burns, traumas, and septic shock, is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress, immune dysfunction, and malnutrition. In these patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition or pharmaceutical supplementation is used to provide essential macronutrients, including trace elements. The purpose of this review is to describe trace element supplementation, including iron, copper, chromium, manganese, selenium, and zinc, and highlight their mechanism, pharmacology, outcome data, and adverse effects.

Methods A 24-year-old male pet shop employee contracted the disease through a minor superficial finger wound on a contaminated rat cage. The disease progressed from a flu-like illness to endocarditis involving first the aortic valve and then the mitral valve and septum. Despite aggressive therapy including two surgical procedures, the patient died from sepsis and multi-organ system failure 59 days after initial injury. Results This is the first reported case of rat-bite fever (RBF) in a pet shop work setting. Conclusions Zoonotic infections may present a significant hazard to workers handling animals.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Human perinatal tissues have been used for over a century as allogeneic biomaterials. Due to their advantageous properties including angiogenecity, anti-inflammation, anti-microbial, and immune privilege, these tissues are being utilized for novel applications across wide-ranging medical disciplines. Given continued clinical success, increased adoption of perinatal tissues as a disruptive technology platform has allowed for significant penetration into the multi-billion dollar biologics market. Here, we review current progress and future applications of perinatal biomaterials, as well as associated regulatory issues.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate an infusion of propofol for anesthesia in comparison to tiletamine-zolazepam anesthesia, evaluating physiological variables and recovery in squirrel monkeys. Study design Prospective non-blinded randomized study. Animals Eight healthy squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), aged 3 years and weighing 0.340?0.695 kg. Methods Premedication was intramuscular midazolam (0.5 mg) and meperidine (4 mg). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous (IV) propofol (4 mg kg?1 minute?1) and maintained with propofol starting at 0.4 mg kg?1 minute?1 (PRO, n = 4) or IV tiletamine-zolazepam (5 mg kg?1) and maintained with supplementary doses of TZ (TZ, n = 4). Cardiopulmonary variables were measured continuously. Arterial blood gases and lactate concentration were measured at the end of anesthesia. Quality and times of recovery were determined. Repeatedly measured data for significant differences were tested between groups with t-test and within groups by anova. Results Median time for induction of anesthesia in PRO was 180 seconds. Mean maintenance infusion rate of propofol was 0.43 ± 0.05 mg kg?1 minute?1, varying during the 1 hour period. One monkey died after administration of TZ; others required 1, 4, or 8 supplemental doses. Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between groups, but hypotension was recorded. Recovery times to ventral recumbency in PRO (32 ± 17 minutes) and TZ (84 ± 11 minutes) and normal ambulation in PRO (58 ± 22 minutes) and TZ (358 ± 109minutes) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Recovery quality was superior in PRO, with less ataxia and fewer unsuccessful attempts to stand. Lactate concentration was not different between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between protocols, aside from the higher incidence of hypotension in PRO, indicating that further studies with a larger number of animals are required. Compared to tiletamine-zolazepam, propofol anesthesia provided faster and superior anesthetic recovery in these animals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High concentrations of lactate approx. 10?mM are characteristic of wound healing. We have previously shown that lactate instigates release of VEGF from macrophages and endothelial cells. Our present study uses an in vivo murine Matrigel model to study how lactate enhances vascular development and repair. METHODS: Matrigel is a reconstituted basement membrane complex, a liquid at 4 degree C. When injected subcutaneously, it reconstitutes as a gel. 30?mgs of finely divided polylactate polymer (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was mixed with 1cc of Matrigel, and 2 injections were made into the dorsum of each of 60 (average 7/group), 6-month-old Swiss Webster mice. The gel implants were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 11 and 16 days post injection, and were fixed in buffered formalin or frozen. Cell migration and vascular development were assessed using H&E, anti-CD31 and anti-MAC3 antibody stainings for leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Cells and vessels were quantified microscopically. RESULTS: Control implants (without polylactate) developed little or no inflammation or angiogenesis. Polylactated implants developed highly significant number of endothelial cells and recognizable vessels at 6 and 9 days. At 11 and 16 days, sizeable vessels with surrounding connective tissue were found. Though a moderate inflammation occurred in the lactate groups, no foreign body reaction was seen. Larger implants of high molecular weight instigated little inflammation and few vessels. CONCLUSION: Slowly released lactate leads to the formation of new vessels. Our results provide support for further clinical applications of lactate polymer in wounds. NIH/NIGMS Trauma Training Grant

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Abstract While laboratory small animal models of cachexia and sarcopenia are well-suited and critical for studying mechanisms and early pre-clinical phases for potential treatments, they are not similar enough to the human conditions to always be good predictors for results in human clinical trials. As a result, translational failures can occur when large-scale human clinical trials are conducted on drugs, even when they appear promising in pre-clinical studies in rodent models. What is needed is a way to more efficiently and successfully translate information gained from basic science and rodent research into human clinical trials that produce effective approved drugs. Naturally-occurring cachexia and sarcopenia in companion animals is a more representative model of human disease that can serve as a stepping stone between basic science and human clinical trials. Many of the common diseases of humans also affect companion animals, particularly pet dogs and cats. Pet dogs and cats commonly develop heart failure, cancer, and kidney disease, as well as acute trauma or illness. The population of elderly companion animals also is increasing as pets' lifespans have become longer. As a result, both cachexia and sarcopenia are very common in companion animals. Studying these conditions in dogs and cats ? either in colonies or in animal clinical trials - can help to identify successful treatments that can benefit both humans and companion animals.

AB  - Background Ultrasound guidance is now a standard nerve localization technique for peripheral nerve block (PNB). Ultrasonography allows simultaneous visualization of the target nerve, needle, local anesthetic injectate, and surrounding anatomical structures. Accurate deposition of local anesthetic next to the nerve is essential to the success of the nerve block procedure. Due to limitations in the visibility of both needle tip and nerve surface, the precise relationship between needle tip and target nerve is unknown at the moment of injection. Importantly, nerve injury may result both from an inappropriately placed needle tip and inappropriately placed local anesthetic. The relationship between the block needle tip and target nerve is of paramount importance to the safe conduct of peripheral nerve block. Methods This review summarizes the evolution of nerve localization in regional anesthesia, characterizes a problem faced by clinicians in performing ultrasound-guided nerve block, and explores the potential technological solutions to this problem. Results To date, technology newly applied to PNB includes real-time 3D imaging, multi-planar magnetic needle guidance, and inline injection pressure monitoring. This review postulates that optical reflectance spectroscopy and bioimpedance may allow for accurate identification of the relationship between needle tip and target nerve, currently a high priority deficit in PNB techniques. Conclusions Until it is known how best to define the relationship between needle and nerve at the moment of injection, some common sense principles are suggested.
