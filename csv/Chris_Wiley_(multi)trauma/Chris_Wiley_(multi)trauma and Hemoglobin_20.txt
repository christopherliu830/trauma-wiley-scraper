Moshe? and Shlomo Shinnar??*Clinical Neurophysiology, Telemetry Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom; ?Departments of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; ?Pediatric Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY and ?Pediatric Neurology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY Summary: Epileptiform discharges not accompanied by obvious clinical events are regarded as subclinical or interictal. They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the cardiovascular responses of ephedrine and dopamine for the management of presurgical hypotension in anesthetized dogs. Study design? Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals? Twelve healthy client-owned dogs admitted for orthopedic surgery; six per group Methods? Prior to surgery, 58 anesthetized dogs were monitored for hypotension [mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60?mmHg] that was not associated with bradycardia or excessive anesthetic depth. Ephedrine (0.2?mg?kg?1, IV) or dopamine (5??g?kg?1?minute?1, IV) was randomly assigned for treatment in 12 hypotensive dogs. Ten minutes after the first treatment (Tx1-10), ephedrine was repeated or the dopamine infusion rate was doubled. Cardiovascular assessments taken at baseline, Tx1-10, and 10?minutes following treatment adjustment (Tx2-10) were compared for differences within and between treatments (p?<?0.05). Results? Ephedrine increased cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), oxygen delivery index (DO2I), and decreased total peripheral resistance (TPR) by Tx1-10, while MAP increased transiently (<5?minutes). The second ephedrine bolus produced no further improvement. Dopamine failed to produce significant changes at 5??g?kg?1?minute?1, while 10??g?kg?1?minute?1 increased MAP, CI, SVI significantly from baseline, and DO2I compared with Tx1-10. The improvement in CI, SVI, and DO2I was not significantly different between treatments at Tx2-10. Conclusions and clinical relevance? In anesthetized hypotensive dogs, ephedrine and dopamine improved cardiac output and oxygen delivery. However, the pressure-elevating effect of ephedrine is transient, while an infusion of dopamine at 10??g?kg?1?minute?1 improved MAP significantly by additionally maintaining TPR.

AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To test the ability of susceptibility weighted images (SWI) and high pass filtered phase images to localize and quantify brain iron. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance (MR) images of human cadaver brain hemispheres were collected using a gradient echo based SWI sequence at 1.5T. For X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, each brain was cut to obtain slices that reasonably matched the MR images and iron was mapped at the iron K-edge at 50 or 100 ?m resolution. Iron was quantified using XRF calibration foils. Phase and iron XRF were averaged within anatomic regions of one slice, chosen for its range of iron concentrations and nearly perfect anatomic correspondence. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to determine if the chemical form of iron was different in regions with poorer correspondence between iron and phase. Results: Iron XRF maps, SWI, and high pass filtered phase data in nine brain slices from five subjects were visually very similar, particularly in high iron regions. The chemical form of iron could not explain poor matches. The correlation between the concentration of iron and phase in the cadaver brain was estimated as cFe [?g/g tissue] = 850?? + 110. Conclusion: The phase shift ?? was found to vary linearly with iron concentration with the best correspondence found in regions with high iron content. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Williams?Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multi-system disorder that requires ongoing management by a primary care physician familiar with the natural history and common medical problems associated with the condition. Some abnormalities are unique to WBS, such as the elastin arteriopathy that often manifests as supravalvar aortic stenosis and hypertension. Still other features, such as diverticulosis, are seen in the general population but tend to present earlier in WBS. Life long monitoring of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems is essential to the clinical management of individuals with Williams?Beuren syndrome. Constipation should be aggressively managed, and symptoms of abdominal pain should prompt an evaluation for diverticulosis/diverticulitis. While the mean IQ of WBS is in the mild mental retardation range, difficulties with attention and anxiety are more likely to negatively impact independent functioning in the adult with WBS. There is no evidence for decline in cognitive ability over time, but adaptive functioning may be improved with treatment of anxiety by both behavior and medical modalities. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the physiological variables, arterial blood gas values, induction of anesthesia quality, and recovery quality using the combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone in dogs. Animals Ten healthy adult Beagle dogs weighing 8.3 ± 3.1 kg. Methods Rectal temperature (T), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and arterial blood gases were measured and recorded prior to intravenous (IV) administration of butorphanol, prior to administration of both midazolam and alfaxalone IV 10 minutes later, then every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. M-mode echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) indices were measured before and 5 minutes after administration of alfaxalone. Qualitative scores for induction of anesthesia and recovery were allocated, duration of anesthesia and recovery were calculated, and adverse events were recorded. Results Scores for induction and recovery quality were excellent. No significant adverse events were observed. Mean ± SD time from induction to extubation and to standing (full recovery) was 29 ± 6 and 36 ± 8 minutes, respectively. There were statistically significant changes in PR, fR and MAP after drug administration. Transient hypercarbia developed after alfaxalone injection. The echocardiographic LV indices were reduced after alfaxalone injection, although those changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions and clinical relevance The combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone provided excellent quality of induction of anesthesia and exerted minimal cardiopulmonary effects in healthy dogs.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Abstract History? Ten dogs weighing 36 (21.4?75)?kg [median (min?max)] and aged 3 (1?9)?years scheduled for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it. Physical Examination? Patients were classified as ASA I or II based on physical examination and basic hematology and biochemistry. Management? Each dog was managed using combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks and procedural sedation with an intravenous infusion of propofol (0.07?0.15?mg?kg?1?minute?1) and dexmedetomidine (1??g?kg?1?hour?1). None of the patients required conversion to general anesthesia as a result of response to surgical stimulation. The level of sedation was considered adequate in all patients and was characterized by occasional head lifting, thoracic limb stretching, yawning, lingual movements and swallowing. The eye position ranged from central to partial ventromedial rotation and was accompanied by spontaneous blinking. Intra-operative cardiovascular and ventilatory variables were considered within acceptable limits. Muscle relaxation at the surgical field was adequate and surgical conditions were indistinguishable from those produced by general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, no additional analgesics were considered necessary. The quality of the recoveries was considered excellent in all cases. Follow up? No additional pain relief was required in any of the dogs within the 10?hours following blockade. All dogs ate 5.5 (3.5?12)?hours after recovery. Ambulation occurred at 4 (2?6)?hours. No evidence of esophagitis or aspiration pneumonitis has been reported during a period of 1?year after the procedures in any of the dogs. Conclusion? When combined with femoral and sciatic nerve blocks, procedural sedation has the potential of being an alternative to general anesthesia for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it in the dog.

AB  - Abstract A new periodontitis classification scheme has been adopted, in which forms of the disease previously recognized as ?chronic? or ?aggressive? are now grouped under a single category (?periodontitis?) and are further characterized based on a multi-dimensional staging and grading system. Staging is largely dependent upon the severity of disease at presentation as well as on the complexity of disease management, while grading provides supplemental information about biological features of the disease including a history-based analysis of the rate of periodontitis progression; assessment of the risk for further progression; analysis of possible poor outcomes of treatment; and assessment of the risk that the disease or its treatment may negatively affect the general health of the patient. Necrotizing periodontal diseases, whose characteristic clinical phenotype includes typical features (papilla necrosis, bleeding, and pain) and are associated with host immune response impairments, remain a distinct periodontitis category. Endodontic-periodontal lesions, defined by a pathological communication between the pulpal and periodontal tissues at a given tooth, occur in either an acute or a chronic form, and are classified according to signs and symptoms that have direct impact on their prognosis and treatment. Periodontal abscesses are defined as acute lesions characterized by localized accumulation of pus within the gingival wall of the periodontal pocket/sulcus, rapid tissue destruction and are associated with risk for systemic dissemination.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - Anemon I is a new monitoring system that can be used to evaluate autonomic nervous system reactivity in real time by showing a simple, easily interpretated quantitative index (0?200), the Anemon Index (AI) (Junke et al. 2000). This study used the AI to evaluate the quality of analgesia during sevoflurane and fentanyl anaesthesia in pigs. Six healthy pigs, weighing 24.76?±?3.40?kg, were induced to anaesthesia with 5% sevoflurane (SEVO) in 5?L?minute?1 oxygen. After endotracheal intubation SEVO was given at 1 MAC (2.66%) in 3?L?minute?1 oxygen. Fentanyl was infused IV at 50?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for the first 30?minutes of anaesthesia, discontinued for 30?minutes, and then infused at 100?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for another 30?minutes. Three mechanical noxious stimuli (needle prick, pin-prick and pressure on the abdomen) were applied for 15?seconds at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. The AI, ECG, invasive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), SpO2 by pulse oximetry, tidal volume, Fe?sevo, Fe?CO2 and respiratory rate were recorded before induction (baseline), after induction, after intubation and extubation, and before and during noxious stimulation at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. Recovery times were recorded. Statistically significant differences were determined by anova. Spearman rank-correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between AI and hemodynamic variables. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered significant. A significant (p?<?0.01) decrease in AI was recorded after anaesthetic induction, from 82.3?±?21.1 to 52.7?±?20.3. After intubation, AI increased slightly, but not significantly, to 71.7?±?27.1. A significant (p?<?0.05) increase of AI occurred after extubation. Nociceptive stimuli did not have any measurable effect either on AI or on recorded cardiovascular variables. There was no movement, respiratory changes, or any other visible response to noxious stimulation. The AI did not change significantly with the different doses of fentanyl. Respiratory depression and apnoea were seen in all animals during the fentanyl infusion; therefore, pigs received intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl resulted in a significant (p?<?0.001) decrease in MAP. Heart rate did not change significantly. There was no correlation between AI and cardiovascular variables (HR and MAP). Endotracheal intubation caused an increase and extubation a greater significant increase in the AI. This suggests that intubation and extubation may represent stressful events during general anaesthesia, although further studies are needed to validate the use of the AI in pigs. Sevoflurane anesthetic induction may not prevent the sympathetic stimulus caused by endotracheal intubation in pigs, as indicated by the increased AI values.

AB  - This study investigated the characteristics of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) produced by mivacurium in the cat. Mivacurium is a short acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase and is expected to have a predictable effect of short duration (Maehr et al. 1991; Gyermek et al. 1999). Thirteen cats (seven females, six males) aged 2?14?years, body mass 3.5?5.9?kg, undergoing corneal surgery were anaesthetized with propofol (3?6?mg?kg?1 IV) after pre-anesthetic medication IM with an opioid alone or in combination with acepromazine (0.02?mg?kg?1) or medetomidine (0.01?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (13 cats) or halothane (1 cat) in oxygen (33%) and nitrous oxide (66%) with mechanical ventilation. Cats were monitored using an ECG, side-stream capnography, and a Doppler flow sensor which was positioned on the pedal artery to estimate systolic blood pressure. The peroneal nerve was stimulated with a train-of-four (TOF) and Double Burst (DBS) pattern using a peripheral nerve stimulator, to assess the degree of NMB. Mivacurium IV (0.1?mg?kg?1) was administered over 10?seconds. The TOF stimulation was applied every 12?seconds until no twitch was apparent (onset time) and continued until the TOF ratio was considered to be 1. Response to DBS stimulation was then assessed until the ratio was 1. The same procedure was followed after recovery of a DBS ratio of 1, if administration of a further dose of mivacurium (0.05?mg?kg?1) was required. Times of onset of NMB, return of the 1st and 4th twitches, TOF and DBS ratio of 1, were recorded, and descriptive analyses performed. The effects of mivacurium on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SAP) and variations in onset and recovery time of NMB between the first bolus and the subsequent doses were determined using a paired Student t-test. The HR and SAP did not change significantly after administration of mivacurium. The onset time was significantly shorter (p?<?0.0001) after administration of the second dose of mivacurium (48?±?8?seconds) compared to the initial dose (107?±?17?seconds). The time to return of the first twitch (11?minutes 12?seconds?±?3?minutes 26?seconds) and to DBS 1 (16?minutes 41?seconds?±?4?minutes 21?seconds) were longer after the first dose than after subsequent doses (8?minutes 56?seconds ±?2?minutes 2?seconds and 18?minutes 28?seconds ±?7?minutes 19?seconds, respectively). However, a second dose of mivacurium was administered in only three cats. Reversal of NMB was never required. Mivacurium is a short acting muscle relaxant in the cat, without apparent cumulative effect after repeated dosing. The time to complete recovery in 97.5% of patients after a single bolus is estimated to be 25?minutes (mean?±?2 SD).

AB  - This clinical study analysed the anaesthetic sparing effect of a medetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) during isoflurane anaesthesia in horses. Forty healthy horses undergoing different types of orthopaedic and soft tissue surgeries were studied in a randomized trial. Orthopaedic surgeries were primarily arthroscopies and splint bone extractions. Soft tissue surgeries were principally castrations with one ovariectomy. All horses received 0.03?mg?kg?1 acepromazine IM 1?hour prior to sedation. Group A (11 orthopaedic and nine soft tissue surgeries), was sedated with 1.1?mg?kg?1 xylazine IV, group B (13 orthopaedic and seven soft tissue surgeries) with 7?µg?kg?1 medetomidine IV. Anaesthesia was induced in both groups with 2.2?mg?kg?1 ketamine and diazepam 0.02?mg?kg?1 IV. Maintenance of anaesthesia was with isoflurane (ISO) in 100% oxygen, depth of anaesthesia was always adjusted by the first author. Group B received an additional CRI of 3.5?µg?kg?1?hour?1 medetomidine. Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), Fe?ISO and Fe?CO2 were monitored with a methane insensitive monitor (Cardiocap 5, Ohmeda, Anandic, Diessenhofen) and noted every 5?minutes. Arterial blood was withdrawn for gas analysis (PaO2, PaCO2) 5?minutes after the induction of anaesthesia and every 30?minutes thereafter. Dobutamine (DOB) was given as a CRI to maintain mean arterial blood pressure above 70?mm?Hg. Data were averaged over time (sum of measurements/number of measurements) and tested for differences between groups by unpaired t-tests. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of body mass (group A, 508?±?73.7?kg; group B, 529.25?±?78.4?kg) or duration of anaesthesia (group A, 125.5?±?36?minutes; group B, 121.5?±?48.4?minutes). The mean Fe?ISO required to maintain a surgical plane of anaesthesia was significantly higher in group A (1.33?±?0.13%) than in group B (1.07?±?0.19%; p?=?2.78???10?5). Heart rate was different between the two groups (group A, 42.2?±?8.3; group B, 32.6?±?3.5; p?=?8.8???10?5). Dobutamine requirements were higher in group A (group A, 0.72?±?0.24??g?kg?1?minute?1; group B, 0.53?±?0.23??g?kg?1?minute?1; p?=?0.023). Respiratory rate, Fe?CO2, PaO2, PaCO2 were not different between the groups. Adjustment of anaesthetic depth subjectively was easier with the medetomidine infusion and isoflurane (group B) than with isoflurane as a sole agent (group A). In group A 12 horses and in group B five horses showed purposeful movements on 27 (A) and 12 (B) occasions. They were given thiopental (group A, 0.0114?mg?kg?1?minute?1; group B, 0.0023?mg?kg?1?minute?1). In group A, a further 17 horses were given ketamine to deepen anaesthesia (52 occasions, 0.00426?mg?kg?1?minute?1) whereas in group B only nine horses needed ketamine (34 occasions, 0.00179?mg?kg?1?minute?1). An infusion of 3.5?µg?kg?1 MED during ISO anaesthesia resulted in a significantly reduced ISO requirement.

AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may potentiate the opioid induced reduction in volatile anaesthetic requirements (Gomez de Segura et al. 1998). This study determined the reduction in the MAC of isoflurane (ISO) produced by ketoprofen (KETO) in dogs anaesthetized with fentanyl (FENT) and ISO. Six healthy female crossbred dogs, weighing 13.5?±?1.3 (mean?±?SD) kg and aged 3.0?±?0.9?years were studied. Approval of the study was obtained from the institutional ethics committee. Anaesthesia was induced in all dogs via a facemask with 5% ISO in 5?L?minute?1 oxygen. The dogs' trachea were intubated and lungs were ventilated to maintain normocapnia (Pe?CO2 4.7?6?kPa, 35?45?mm?Hg). A heating pad was used to maintain body temperature. The animals were anaesthetized four times at one week intervals with the following anaesthetic and analgesic protocols randomly administered. Study 1, MAC (ISO); Isoflurane MAC. Study 2, MAC (ISO?+?FENT); dogs anaesthetized with ISO received a loading dose of 30?µg?kg?1 FENT IV over 20?minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.2?µg?kg?1?minute?1 FENT. Study 3, MAC (ISO?+?FENT?+?KETO1); as study 2 plus 1?mg?kg?1 KETO. Study 4, MAC (ISO?+?FENT?+?KETO2); as study 2 plus 2?mg?kg?1 KETO. The MAC was determined in duplicate by applying a standard electrical stimulus (50?V, 50?H2 over 60?seconds via two needles placed SC over the tarsus). The stimulus was applied 15?minutes after every step change in anesthetic concentration. The Wilcoxon test was applied to data to determine significant differences among MAC measurements. Fentanyl significantly decreased MAC (ISO) from 1.27%?±?0.02% to 0.73%?±?0.08%, a reduction of 42% (p?<?0.05). Ketoprofen 1?mg?kg?1 further decreased the MAC value (although not statistically significantly) with a reduction of 47% from MAC (ISO) (0.67%?±?0.13%) and 8% from MAC (ISO?+?FENT). When KETO 2?mg?kg?1 was given, the reduction in MAC was 50% compared to MAC (ISO) (0.63%?±?0.08%; p?<?0.05) and 14% compared to MAC (ISO?+?FENT) p?<?0.05. Administration of KETO further reduces MAC (ISO) compared to levels observed with FENT alone. The observed reduction may have clinical advantages.

AB  - This study evaluated the antinociceptive and physiologic effects of xylazine (X) and detomidine (D) administered intrathecally (IT) at the lumbosacral space, before and after the injection of atipamezole (A) IV. The study was approved by the National Animal Protection Authorities. Five adult healthy female sheep were anaesthetized with propofol on four occasions to inject the following treatments IT: groups 1 and 2, 0.05?mg?kg?1 X (2?mg?mL?1 saline) IT; groups 3 and 4, 0.01?mg?kg?1 D (0.5?mg?mL?1 saline) IT (Waterman et al. 1988). Nociceptive threshold (TH) was tested by applying pulsed and stepwise enhanced direct current (Ludbrook et al. 1995) at one hind leg pastern and noting the current at the moment of foot lift. Maximum current applied was 40 mA. Baseline TH was measured twice before anaesthesia and every 10?minutes when the sheep regained consciousness. Atipamezole was given IV immediately after reaching maximum analgesic action of X and D as defined by two equal or decreasing TH values and measurements were continued for 90?minutes. The dose of A for groups 1 and 3 was 0.005?mg?kg?1 (0.25?mg?mL?1 saline) IV, and for groups 2 and 4 was 0.0025?mg?kg?1 A (0.25?mg?mL?1 saline) IV. Heart rate (HR), mean direct arterial pressure (MAP), PaO2 and PaCO2 were measured. The differences between measurements recorded before and after treatment were analysed using a paired t-test for the drug effects and a nonparametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test for the comparison between groups. A p-value?<?0.05 was considered significant. All sheep were able to stand before A IV. Threshold baseline value was 4.5?±?1.7 (mean?±?SD) mA for all animals. Xylazine caused a significantly higher TH rise (35.2?±?1.8 mA), faster onset (21.1?±?16.0?minutes) and longer duration of the TH enhancement (104.1?±?8.6?minutes) than D (TH: 16.3?±?7.8 mA, onset: 49.5?±?28.4?minutes, duration: 59.3?±?27.3?minutes). A significant increase in PaCO2 was observed in the X and D treated animals, 0.39?±?0.21?kPa (2.9?±?1.6?mm?Hg) and 0.39?±?0.29?kPa (2.9?±?2.2?mm?Hg), respectively. Heart rate was significantly decreased by ?21?±?17 beats minute?1 for X animals and ?13?±?13 beats minute?1 for D. Mean arterial pressure (?9?±?13?mm?Hg for X and ?1?±?11?mm?Hg for D animals) and PaO2 0.65?±?1.32?kPa (4.9?±?9.9?mm?Hg) for X and 1.45?±?4.19?kPa (10.9?±?31.4?mm?Hg) for D animals) did not change significantly. The nociceptive threshold was not affected by A in any group. Threshold values of all X treated animals before A was 39.3?±?1.4 mA and after was 37.2?±?6.3 (group 1) and 40?±?0 (group 2). Threshold values of all D treated animals before A was 21.0?±?8.3 and after was 19.4?±?7.3 (group 3) and 24.8?±?8.0 (group 4). At the dosages administered intrathecally in this study, X and to a lower degree D induce antinociception without major physiologic changes. Atipamezole up to 0.005?mg?kg?1 IV does not affect the resulting antinociception as assessed by electrical stimulation.

AB  - An economical anaesthetic technique of short duration that can be administered to piglets in the field is desirable for humanitarian reasons, for castration, tail docking or other brief procedures. Using the principles of anaesthetic uptake and distribution, an inhaler was developed to vaporize and administer isoflurane to piglets. The inhaler design consisted of a mask, vaporization chamber and a rebreathing bag. A stopcock provided access for injection of liquid isoflurane onto a wick contained in the vaporization chamber. Inspiratory and expiratory flow of air over the wick enhanced anaesthetic vaporization. The amount of liquid isoflurane required for induction and 2?3?minutes of surgical anaesthesia was calculated using the square root of time model proposed by Lowe & Ernst (1981) for liquid injection, closed circuit anaesthesia in people. Calculations were based on an assumed MAC of 1.4% and the achievement of a target alveolar concentration of 1.3 MAC to provide a surgical plane of anaesthesia. The appropriate isoflurane concentrations in the mask, inhaler, rebreathing bag and the piglet's FRC and tissues were calculated. Original calculations were based on metabolic size (BW0.75) and then converted to weight (kg). Based on the piglet's scale weight, the total microliters of liquid isoflurane required were formulated into a table for field use. Isoflurane was injected into the inhaler stopcock followed by oxygen to fill the rebreathing bag and initiate vaporization. After the mask was placed over the piglet's nose a slide switch was activated to allow gases to move in and out of the inhaler and rebreathing bag. Fifty-seven male piglets weighing (mean?±?SD 3.0?±?0.7?kg) and aged 7.7?±?1.0?days were randomly selected to receive anaesthesia prior to castration. Remaining littermates served as controls for assessing morbidity or mortality. The time to induction, recovery and total anaesthetic time were measured. The Pe?CO2 was measured at the piglet's nostril immediately after the mask was removed at the end of the surgical procedure. Data were analysed in SAS using the Proc Mixed procedure. Inductions were rapid, 47?±?9?seconds, generally with minimal or no resistance. The duration of surgery was 1?2?minutes. Anaesthesia was adequate and recovery was rapid, 122?±?44?seconds. Total time from start to standing was 260?±?51?seconds. The Pe?CO2 was 5.2?±?1.1?kPa (39.4?±?8.4?mm?Hg). There was no morbidity or mortality associated with either group of piglets. After piglets were standing and mobile, they were returned to the sow and other littermates, where they immediately started nursing and were indistinguishable from littermates except by determination of ear notch number. This technique provides safe, rapid anaesthesia and recovery that is appropriate for use by veterinarians for brief field procedures.

AB  - A central eyeball position is often required during sedation or anaesthesia to facilitate examination of the eye. However, use of neuromuscular blockade to produce a central eye position may result in depressed ventilation. This study evaluated the eyeball position, muscle relaxation and changes in ventilation during general anaesthesia after the IV administration of 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium. With client consent, 12 dogs of different breeds, body mass 27.2?±?11.8?kg, aged 5.6?±?2.8?years (mean?±?SD) were anaesthetized for ocular examination. Pre-anaesthetic medication was 0.01?mg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.2?mg?kg?1 butorphanol IV. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol to effect and maintained with 10?mg?kg?1?hour?1 propofol by infusion. The dogs were placed in left lateral recumbency, their trachea intubated and connected to a circle breathing system (FiO2?=?1.0). All dogs breathed spontaneously. The superficial peroneal nerve of the right hind leg was stimulated every 15?seconds with a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation pattern and neuromuscular function was assessed with an acceleromyograph (TOF-Guard). Adequacy of ventilation was measured with the Ventrak 1550. After 10?minutes of anaesthesia to allow stabilisation of baseline values, 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium was administered IV. Minute volume (Vm), tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), Pe?CO2 and maximal depression of T1 and TOF ratio were measured. Data were analysed using a paired t-test. The changes in the eyeball position were recorded. A total of 100?±?33?seconds after the injection of rocuronium, T1 was maximally depressed to 62?±?21% and the TOF ratio to 42?±?18% of baseline values. Both variables returned to baseline after 366?±?132?seconds (T1) and 478?±?111?seconds (TOF). There was no significant reduction in Vm (2.32?±?1.1?L?minute?1), Vt (124.1?±?69.3?mL) and RR (10?±?3.8?breaths?minute?1) and no increase in Pe?CO2 (6.5?±?2.1?kPa (48.8?±?16.1?mm?Hg)) throughout the procedure. The eyeball rotated to a central position 35?±?7?seconds after rocuronium IV and remained there for a minimum of 20?±?7?minutes in all dogs. We conclude that rocuronium at a dose of 0.1?mg?kg?1 can be administered to dogs IV with minimal changes in ventilatory variables. The eyeball is fixed in a central position for at least 20?minutes, which greatly facilitates clinical examination.

AB  - Alpha2 agonists have a significant role in epidural anaesthetic techniques. However, there are few reports regarding epidural administration of these drugs especially in small animals (Greene et al. 1995; Keegan et al. 1995; Vesal et al. 1996). This study compared the haemodynamic effects of xylazine and medetomidine after epidural injection in dogs. Six dogs (four females and two males) weighing 27.5?±?3.39?kg, aged 5.6?±?1.42?years were studied on two separate occasions one month apart. Dogs were sedated with 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam IM and 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine IM. After 20?minutes, a lumbosacral epidural injection of 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine was administered (group X). One month later, following the same sedation, 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine was administered epidurally (group M). Haemodynamic variables (ECG and indirect blood pressure (Doppler)), respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded before (baseline) and then every 5?minutes after the epidural injection, up to 60?minutes. Differences between groups were compared by a paired t-test. Within group changes were compared to basal values by anova. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both groups showed significant reductions in heart rate (106.3?±?7.7 beats?minute?1 baseline versus 67.7?±?7.6 (group M); 91?±?3.8 baseline versus 52.3?±?9 (group X)) and mean arterial blood pressure (113.1?±?12.3?mm?Hg baseline versus 87?±?11 (group M); 118?±?7 baseline versus 91?±?14 (group X)). There were no differences between groups in these variables. After epidural injection, first degree atrioventricular block was recorded significantly more often in group X (50% against 33%) but second degree block was significantly more frequent in group M (66% against 33%). Also 50% of dogs in group X and 66% in group M showed sinus arrest. Respiratory rate decreased significantly in both groups following the epidural injection (20.66?±?0.66?minute?1 baseline versus 16.33?±?4.77 (group M); 37.66?±?0.56 baseline versus 16.33?±?1.81 group X), but no differences between groups were observed. Rectal temperature decreased significantly in group X (38.16?±?0.21) with respect to the basal measurement (39.30?±?0.14?°C). In group M, there was no significant reduction in temperature, however, no statistical difference in rectal temperature was found between groups. This study shows that 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine and 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine produce similar, significant cardiovascular and respiratory changes following lumbosacral epidural administration in dogs.
