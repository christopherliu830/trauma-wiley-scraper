AB  - Introduction Human athletes have been characterized as either ?good drinkers? or ?poor drinkers? on the basis of voluntary water intake during and after endurance exercise. Similarly, riders of endurance horses have described some horses to be better drinkers than others; however, there are no data in horses to substantiate these claims. Methods Voluntary fluid intake (FI) by twenty four 2-year-old Arabian horses that performed 45?60?km of treadmill exercise in four experiments was recorded. All horses were raised similarly and had no training except a 12 week conditioning period before each experiment. Mean FI intake (each horse performed three or four exercise tests in each experiment) was subjected to cluster analysis to separate horses into poor, average, and excellent drinking groups. FI was also correlated to body weight (BW) loss at the end of the exercise test. Results Cluster analysis separated horses into poor drinkers (n?=?10, FI 8.7?±?0.7 liters and BW loss of 2.2?±?0.4%); average drinkers (n?=?11, FI 14.1?±?0.6 liters and BW loss of 1.8?±?0.2%); and excellent drinkers (n?=?3, FI 24.9?±?0.2 liters and BW loss of 0.7?±?0.3%). FI was inversely correlated with BW loss (R values between ?0.53 and ?0.87 for all four experiments, P<0.01). Conclusions These data, in groups of young, similarly trained horses, are the first to support that there are innate differences in voluntary drinking during and after endurance exercise in this species.

AB  - Introduction Continuous monitoring of core body temperature may provide useful information about the thermal response to metabolic heat load and environmental challenges. The aim of this study was to evaluate a telemetric gastrointestinal (GI) pill (Equivital?) measuring gastrointestinal temperature (GT) during endurance exercise. It was hypothesised that a temperature and metabolic heat profile could be established. Methods The GI pill was administered to 6 horses by nasogastric tube (n?=?3) or modified-drench gun (n?=?3), the day before competition. During competition, GT, skin temperature and heart rate (HR) were recorded (by Equivital? belt). Other data collected included body weight and rectal temperature (RT), GPS/HR monitor information, and environmental conditions using a data logger. Metabolic heat production was calculated [1] and GT correlations were explored using simple correlation estimates (P<0.05). Results Data were collected from 6 horses during 80?km (n?=?4 horses) and 100?km (n?=?2) competition days with mean data loss of 7.4% (±2.4%). GT profiles showed increasing temperature with cumulative metabolic heat production, and time to reach maximum GT was 2.14?6.29?h (maximum GT range: 38.4?39.5°C). During exercise (7?h 6?min?±?1?h 3?min duration), mean and maximum speeds ranged from 10.1?14.5?km/h and 23.5?30.8?km/h, respectively. No correlation was found between GT and HR, skin, or environment temperature. Maximum GT increased with bodyweight (r?=?0.775, P?=?0.08). GT was systematically higher than RT (mean difference +0.46°C). Conclusions GT was recorded successfully during competition with minimal data loss. The GI pill has great potential as a method to further investigate thermoregulation in horses under field conditions.

AB  - Introduction Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytology is a major diagnostic method for detecting exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) and inflammatory airway disease (IAD) in racehorses. Our hypothesis was that training and racing would increase the incidence of IAD and EIPH. Methods On three different occasions (day-1, ?30 and ?60), BAL fluid was obtained from both lungs of 14 Standardbred trotters with similar age and training level. Cytological inclusion criteria were neutrophils >10%, and/or mast cells ≥5%, and/or eosinophils ≥5% for IAD, and haemosiderophage/macrophage (H/M) ratio >20% for EIPH. Since previously found not to be equivalent, both samples from each horse were independently investigated. Horse status (?IAD?,?EIPH?, ?mixed?, or ?control?) at each time point was based on cytological profiles from both lungs. Cell proportions were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Haemosiderophage proportions and H/M were significantly higher on day-60 compared to day-1. No significant difference was observed for other cell proportions. On day-1, 5 horses were ?control?, 2 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-30, 3 horses were ?control?, 4 ?IAD?, 2 ?EIPH?, and 5 were ?mixed?. On day-60, 3 horses were ?control?, 0 ?IAD?, 3 ?EIPH?, and 8 ?mixed?. Despite the different horses? distribution within each category, an overall increase in EIPH was observed. Five of the 7 horses classified ?control? or ?IAD? on day-1 presented EIPH on day-30 and/or ?60. EIPH was detected in 11/14 horses (78.6%) on day-60, versus 7/14 horses (50%) on day-1. Conclusions The incidence of EIPH, but not IAD, significantly increased during a racing season. This evolution should be considered when assessing BAL fluid cytology in racehorses.

AB  - Introduction It has been debated which airway sampling method, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspirate (TA), is superior in evaluating equine respiratory disease. Most studies suggest BAL is the best sampling method due to better correlation with lung histopathology. In this study we compared BAL and TA results of athletic non-Thoroughbred horses with chronic respiratory signs or exercise intolerance during 2009?2013. Methods 64 horses, 2?25 years of age (16 Coldbloods, 30 Warmbloods, 11 Standardbreds, 7 ponies) with recurrent or chronic (duration >1 month) respiratory signs or exercise intolerance that were subject to both BAL and TA sampling at rest were included. Neutrophil counts >5% in BAL and >20% in TA were considered abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results Both BAL and TA were abnormal in 29 horses and normal in 26 horses. 7 horses had only abnormal TA and 2 horses only abnormal BAL. Correlation was found between the amount of mucus in the trachea and both BAL (P?=?0.002) and TA (P<0.001) neutrophil percentage. Neutrophil (P<0.001), eosinophil (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P?=?0.008) and macrophage (P?=?0.004) percentages correlated between BAL and TA. Conclusions In our university hospital population, mucus in the trachea was a good indicator of airway neutrophilia. Unlike previous studies, in only 14% of the horses the interpretation of BAL and TA result was different with TA being slightly more sensitive at detecting neutrophilia. However, a gold standard for detecting inflammation in the equine airways is still lacking and the type and severity of the disease may greatly influence the best choice of sampling method.

AB  - Introduction There are few refereed blinded controlled documentations of skeletal analgesic efficacy of firocoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. The objective was to test the hypotheses that intravenous firocoxib and phenylbutazone are comparable in efficacy and that both are more efficacious in alleviating lameness than placebo in an adjustable heart bar shoe model of equine foot pain. Methods Eight healthy adult horses (5 Thoroughbreds, 3 Quarter horses, mean age 8.3?±?0.9 years, age range 4?13 years) underwent weekly intravenous treatments 1 hour after lameness induction. Treatments were isotonic saline placebo (1?ml/45?kg body weight), phenylbutazone (4.4?mg/kg), and firocoxib (label dosage 0.09?mg/kg). Treatments were randomly assigned and administered by co-investigators who had no input on Heart Rate (HR) and Lameness Score (LS) measurements. Another investigator who was unaware of treatment assignments monitored HR and LS every 20?min for 5 hours after lameness induction and then hourly through 12 hours after treatment. One and two weeks later treatments were shuffled and the experiment was repeated. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test were used to identify analgesic effects at a significance level of P<0.05. Results HR and LS were not different between saline and firocoxib. Post-treatment phenylbutazone HR (2.3?3.3, 5, and 10 hours) and LS (2.3?8 hours) were lower than saline (P<0.05). Phenylbutazone HR (10 and 12 hours) and LS (1.67?11 hours) were lower than firocoxib (P<0.05). Conclusions It was concluded that firocoxib at this label dosage was not different than placebo and that phenylbutazone was more effective than firocoxib and saline.

AB  - Introduction Resistance training provided by underwater (UWT) treadmills may enhance strength and fatigue resistance of superficial digital flexor muscle thereby reducing tendon injury. This study examined effects of UWT and land (LT) treadmill training on SDF and gluteal muscle. Methods Six unfit horses (3???2 crossover design, 60d detraining period) walked on UWT and LT for 5d/week for 8 weeks (up to 40?min/day). A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed 2 weeks before, and after L or UW training, and V180?bpm and La10.5?m/s calculated. Resting and post-SET gluteal and SDF muscle biopsies were obtained. Muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], fiber type composition and min/max fiber diameters were analysed. Comparisons were made using GLM or ANOVA, mean?±?SD and significance of P<0.05. Results Post-exercise SDF muscle lactate increased 3?4 fold to 30?±?12 (UWT) and 41?±?15 (LT) mmol/kg dw post-exercise. Post-exercise gluteal muscle lactate increased 2 fold to 55?±?18 (UWT) and 62?±?18 (LT) mmol/kg. No significant differences were found between UW and L post-exercise muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], V180 or LA10.5 or fiber type composition. Gluteal fiber diameters decreased significantly with UW and L training. Fiber diameters in SDF muscle decreased with training to a significantly lesser extent after UW vs. L training. Conclusions At maximal speed, both SDF and gluteal muscle have a significant anaerobic response which was not impacted by UWT or LT training at a walk. UWT may be of benefit by attenuating the training induced decrease in fiber sizes in SDF muscle thereby enhancing SDF muscle strength.

AB  - Introduction Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism during muscle contraction and in the balance of anaerobic and aerobic energy production. This study evaluated mitochondrial respirometry in skeletal muscle of eventing horses before and after an intense effort. Methods Fourteen Brazilian Sport Horses 4 to 6 years old performed an incremental velocity test on a high speed treadmill inclined to 3% and galloped at speeds up to 8?m/s until exhaustion. Biopsies from the gluteus medius muscle were obtained before and immediately after the end of the test. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by O2K oxygraph of high resolution (Oroboros). The results were standardized by minute and per gram of wet weight of muscle and expressed as mean?±?SD. Plasma lactate was measured using a spectrophotometer. Results were compared by paired t?test (P<0.05). Results The maximal respiration value of mitochondria did not change in gluteus medius muscle of horses at exhaustion. However, there was an increase in stage 3 mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate/malate substrate, and also an increase of non-mitochondrial respiration after exercise. Lactate values before and after exercise were 0.4?±?0.1?mmol/L and 12.1?±?4.6?mmol/L, respectively. Conclusions There is little change in mitochondrial respirometry in the gluteus medius muscle after intense exercise indicating predominantly anaerobic metabolism in the muscle of the eventing horses, as supported by the high plasma lactate concentrations after the test. The increase of oxidase reactions after intense exercise is related to an increase in non-mitochondrial respiration.

AB  - Introduction Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in assessing MPS in horses has not been evaluated. Determination of MPS requires steady-state tracer plasma enrichment and serial muscle biopsy. Given that MPS is often assessed in response to exercise and that muscle biopsy in the standing horse typically requires sedation, the influence of exercise and sedation on tracer kinetics was determined. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) IV and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?hrs. Pharmacokinetic modeling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6 hours of infusion after loading. Horses then received the same dose and completed a 12-minute exercise test and were sedated with xylazine 0.4?mg/kg IV. Plasma D5-Phe enrichment was determined every 5?15 minutes for 2 hours after both exercise and sedation. Results The mean rate of phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56?umol/kg/hr (SD 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41?umol/kg (SD 8.8). A loading dose of 3.3?umol/kg and an infusion rate of 4.5?umol/kg/hr D5-phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently, confirmed to achieve steady state tracer concentration at 5.6?9.1% APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). Conclusions D5-phenylalanine is a suitable metabolic tracer in the horse as a steady-state can be achieved, however interventions should be taken into account.

AB  - Introduction Obesity creates many metabolic issues in horses, yet stepwise alterations in mitochondrial capacity and oxidant status during weight loss have not been assessed. Skeletal muscle contains subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM) mitochondria, which respond differently to physiological stimuli, impacting tissue and systemic oxidant status. It was hypothesised that horses would display improved muscle mitochondrial subpopulation function in middle gluteal muscle, and decreases in circulating oxidant status markers during weight loss from an obese (7 to 8) to moderate (5) body condition score (BCS). Methods 8 light-type horses were studied. Mitochondrial subpopulations were isolated through differential centrifugation and all enzymatic activity through colorimetric kinematic assays. Effects of BCS reduction or percent weight loss were evaluated using SAS (mixed procedure with repeated measures). Results Plasma nitrate decreased in response to BCS reduction (P?=?0.06) and percent weight loss (P?=?0.06), whereas erythrocyte total glutathione (P?=?0.06) concentration increased with decreasing BCS. Mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and IV displayed greater activity in SSM than IFM (P≤0.03), while all complexes in IFM had decreased activity due to both weight parameters (P≤0.01). Interactions between subpopulation complex IV activity and weight loss markers (P<0.05) were displayed. Citrate synthase activity, indicating mitochondrial number, was greater in SSM than IFM (P<0.0001) but was unaffected with weight loss. Lipid peroxidation was decreased with BCS change (P?=?0.01) and weight loss (P?=?0.02), displaying greater amounts in SSM than IFM (P≤0.02). Conclusions Alterations in complex activities and lipid peroxidation suggest IFM are more affected by weight loss, with large contributions from complex IV by-products. Mitochondrial component flexibility may contribute individually to disease development and performance of equine athletes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate sources of information used by owners/riders when choosing supplements for competition horses, their opinions on different sources of information and evaluation of factors that affect their decisions. Methods A mixed methods (open and closed questions) online questionnaire was distributed through British Eventing and Dressage websites to owners/riders of dressage and/or event horses, to collect data on the demographics of the owner/rider and their horses, sources of information used when choosing nutritional supplements, and their opinion on these different sources. Data was evaluated using descriptive analysis and Chi-squared tests for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results 757 responses met the inclusion criteria, and owners/riders competed at dressage and eventing from unaffiliated novice to affiliated advanced level. Veterinary surgeons were considered the most reliable source of information, followed by nutritionists, research studies, coach/trainer and other horse owners. ?Other horse owners? were the top source (18% of participants) for the participants' most recent choice of supplement. Respondents with a higher education qualification were significantly more likely to use research papers as a source of information (P<0.005). Owners/riders under 34 years of age were significantly more likely to use a coach / trainer as a source of information (P<0.005). Conclusions Horse owners identified veterinary surgeons, nutritionists and research papers as reliable sources of information, but ultimately most chose their supplement based on recommendations of other owners or coaches/trainers.

AB  - Introduction In Thoroughbreds, genetic variation in myostatin (MSTN g.66493737C/T) is highly predictive of optimum race distance and influences mRNA expression, precocity, skeletal muscle development, two-year-old earnings, speed variables and skeletal muscle fibre type. The aim of this study was to investigate MSTN variation associations with VO2peak in untrained yearling Thoroughbreds. Methods Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbred yearlings (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) from one flat racing yard (November-December). Data was collected as horses freely travelled up an all-weather gallop (2% incline) with no rider. VO2 was measured using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask and associated customized software validated for field testing. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded. MSTN genotypes were determined using a customised Taqman SNP genotyping assay. Tests of association between genotype and phenotype were performed using PLINK software. Results Average exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, and HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm. MSTN genotypes and VO2peak based on 6 breaths were n?=?16 CC, VO2peak?=?119.49?±?21.8; n?=?22 CT, VO2peak?=?116.40?±?-27.2; n?=?3 TT, 115.08?±?20.2.There was no association (P>0.05) between genotype and VO2peak. Conclusions In yearling Thoroughbreds no association between MSTN genotype and untrained peak oxygen consumption was observed. This may be a function of the small number of TT genotype individuals evaluated or a reflection of a requirement for MSTN-associated skeletal muscle entrainment in VO2peak changes resulting from a period of exercise training. Such changes may be associated with MSTN genotype and this requires further investigation. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.

AB  - Introduction PGC-1α and irisin, encoded by the PPARGC1A and FNDC5 genes, play key roles in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise. PPARGC1A gene expression is induced by exercise and has been shown to upregulate FNDC5 expression. Higher levels of FNDC5 have been observed in young male human athletes compared to sedentary controls. FNDC5 gene expression has also been shown in some species to be modulated by myostatin (MSTN), a growth factor that limits muscle hypertrophy. In horses MSTN variation (g.66493737C>T) affects gene expression and racing performance. Thoroughbreds homozygous for the C-allele have significantly higher levels of MSTN?mRNA than homozygous T?:?T horses. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of PPARGC1A and FNDC5 in skeletal muscle to exercise and investigate the relationship with MSTN genotype. Methods Skeletal muscle (gluteus medius) biopsies were taken from untrained yearling Thoroughbreds (n?=?27) at rest and after a ten month period of training at two-years-old. Skeletal muscle gene expression was measured using real-time qRT-PCR assays and data was analysed using qBase software. Results A significant increase in both PPARGC1A (P?=?0.0001, FC?=?1.82) and FNDC5 (P?=?0.039, FC?=?1.72) was observed post-training. A significant positive correlation was found between FNDC5 and PPARGC1A expression levels post training (P?=?0.01, R2?=?0.22). There was no relationship between PPARGC1A or FNDC5 gene expression and MSTN genotype. Conclusions These data indicate a coordinated role for PGC-1α and irisin in the skeletal muscle response to exercise in Thoroughbred horses. Their known roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and brown fat metabolism suggest important roles in the adaptive response to exercise, which is independent of MSTN-determined muscle type.

AB  - Introduction NaHCO3 has been administered prior to racing in an attempt to enhance performance but it remains unclear whether potential ergogenic effects may be due to increased buffering capacity or expanded extracellular fluid volume. Methods Solutions of 1?g/kg of NaCl, KCl, NaHCO3, or KHCO3 in 8?L of water were administered via a nasogastric tube 60?min prior to a high intensity treadmill exercise test (12?m/s to fatigue) to 4 horses in a randomized fashion. Changes in mixed venous plasma electrolyte concentrations (NOVA Biomedical analyser) and run time to fatigue were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Administration of Na and K salts increased Na and K concentrations before and during maximal exercise, respectively. Administration of bicarbonate salts attenuated acidosis and the decrease in bicarbonate concentration during exercise, as compared to Cl salts. Of interest, run time to fatigue was longer (P<0.001, power?=?0.98) after administration of KCl (5.1?±?0.6?min) as compared to both bicarbonate salts (3.7?±?0.6 and 3.6?±?0.8?min for NaHCO3 and KHCO3, respectively), but was not different than run time after NaCl administration (4.3?±?0.8?min). Conclusions Preloading with large amounts of Na and K salts produced expected changes in mixed venous Na and K concentrations but preloading with bicarbonate did not improve performance. Observation of longer run times to fatigue after administration of NaCl or KCl was unexpected and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Introduction The objective was to compare, using a dynamometric horseshoe (DHS), the longitudinal and vertical components of the reaction force and corresponding impulses in the leading and trailing forelimbs of horses landing after a jump on a competition surface. Methods Both forefeet of 3 horses were equipped with a DHS. 1000?Hz films of the right forefoot at landing were synchronized with the DHSs recordings. Within a corridor delimited on a sand arena, each horse jumped a 1.20?m (horse 1) or 1.10?m (horses 2 and 3) high fence while cantering alternatively at both leads. Data were pooled and 37 strides analyzed both for the leading (LF) and trailing (TF) forelimbs. In addition to peak forces and impulses (integral of force over time) in the hoof reference frame, the forces on the right forelimb were projected in the track reference frame to determine true retardatory (TR) and propulsory (TP) phases. Differences between LF and TF were estimated with linear regression models, using generalized estimating equations to adjust for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (for all results, P<0.0005). Results Maximal vertical force and loading rate were respectively 1.2 and 1.4 times higher on TF. TR-longitudinal impulse was 21 times, and TR-vertical impulse 8 times higher in LF, whereas TP-longitudinal impulse was 4 times, and TP-vertical impulse 2 times higher in TF. Conclusions Despite a lower maximal vertical loading, LF plays a major part in the retardatory (load-absorption) phase, while TF is mainly involved in propulsion. Loading of anatomical structures is therefore different in both limbs, which provides insights for interpreting horses' preferred lead at landing depending on which structure is affected.

AB  - Introduction Lungeing is an important part of lameness examination since the circular path is thought to accentuate low-grade lameness. Circle dependent, compensatory movement, and pain related asymmetries make lameness evaluation complex. Subjective evaluation, by watching the horse in motion, is standard practice but studies have shown that inter-observer variation is high when assessing lameness (straight line movement). The aim was to estimate inter- and intra-rater agreement between equine practitioners evaluating lameness from videos of sound and lame horses during lungeing. Methods Equine practitioners (n?=?86), including 43 deemed as experienced, participated in a web-based survey. Horses (n?=?23, including two horses with solar-pressure induced lameness) [defined as forelimb-, hind limb-lame or sound from objective kinematic straight line measurements] trotted on a circle in both directions on soft/hard ground surfaces (one condition/video). Of 104 recordings, 60 were selected of which 10 were repeated (numbers chosen to make compliance possible). The practitioners were asked to report which limb was most lame on each video. Kappa statistics were used to analyze the inter-rater and intra-rater agreement. The ? agreement was set to poor <0.3, acceptable 0.31?0.5, good 0.51?0.8, excellent >0.8. Results Inter-rater agreement kappa (n?=?86) was 0.31 (0.38/0.25 for experienced/less experienced). Evaluating forelimb compared to hind limb lameness agreement increased 11%. Intra-rater agreement kappa (percentiles) was (P10-50-90, 0.21, 0.57, 0.84). Conclusions Since identification of the lame limb/limbs is a prerequisite for successful diagnosis, treatment and recovery, the high inter-observer variation when evaluating lameness during lungeing may decrease the accuracy of lameness examinations.

AB  - Introduction When horses are trotted in-hand, this is predominantly performed with the handler on the horse's left side. In the context of objective gait analysis, this study investigated whether the side a horse is led from affects movement symmetry measures used to quantify lameness. We hypothesised that the side which horses were handled from would have no effect on head and pelvic movement symmetry. Methods Vertical movement of head and pelvis was quantified in 23 horses during trot in-hand with a validated inertial sensor gait analysis system. Established movement symmetry measures commonly used to quantify lameness were calculated for a minimum of 27 strides per condition. Each horse was assessed three times, twice handled from one side, once from the other side, with the initial handling side randomly assigned. Differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments led from the same side were compared to differences when led from the opposite side using a paired t-test (P<0.05) Results Which side a horse was led from had no significant effect on either head (all P>0.754) or pelvic (all P>0.514) movement symmetry. Mean differences for head (and pelvic) movement asymmetry were below 2% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for repeat assessments from the same side and below 4% or 2?mm (0% or 1?mm) for opposite side leads. Conclusions The side from which a horse is led does not significantly affect differences in movement symmetry between repeat assessments. Data analysis should be restricted to trials with consistent head carriage and a minimum of 27 strides (previously reported to give a representative estimate of stride-to-stride variability).

AB  - Introduction Rider movement may influence horse-rider interaction, yet little is known about what physical attributes affect postural stability. This study aimed to compare pelvic control and postural stability of riders on the floor and whilst riding. Methods 33 riders were assessed by a physiotherapist and subjectively graded according to ability to tilt the pelvis in isolation: 1?=?poor, 2?=?better plus compensations, which were either A?=?lumbar spine inclusion B?=?full body lean, 3?=?good. Riders wore markers on (1) greater trochanter of the femur, (2) iliac crest, (3) greater tubercle of the humerus. A marker was placed over the horse's tuber sacrale (4). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) recorded four strides of collected sitting trot in a straight line from the left side. Distance between markers was measured at midstance, maximum hindlimb protraction and retraction. Synchronisation was determined by the difference in time (secs) between the tuber sacrale of the horse and pelvis of the rider at these stride points. One-way ANOVA was used to compare synchronisation between groups. Student's independent t-test was used to compare marker distance. Results For pelvic tilt, no grade 3 riders were seen. Grade 2 riders were more synchronised with the horse during left hind diagonal suspension phase (P?=?0.011) and had smaller horizontal distances between markers 1?2, 2?3 and 1?3 respectively at all points of the stride (midstance: P<0.042; hindlimb protraction: P<0.049; hindlimb retraction: P<0.013). Comparing compensation types, grade A riders were better synchronised with the horse at midstance phase (P?=?0.014). Conclusions Results suggest that control of pelvic movement may have an impact on horse-rider synchronisation.

AB  - Introduction Lameness is the most common health problem of racehorses and may affect both welfare and performance. The aim of this study was to investigate if locomotion asymmetry in a group of young horses was related to delayed qualification for races. Methods Locomotion asymmetry was measured every 1?3 months with a wireless inertial sensor based lameness evaluation system in 16 horses fourteen times between September of the year they were 1-year olds and May of the year they were 3-year olds. As 3-year-olds they passed their qualification race and after this, two subgroups were created for the study based on whether they passed their qualification race before June 21st (early group, n?=?6) or after September 19th (late group, n?=?6). The groups were compared with respect to the differences in vertical head (forelimbs) and pelvis (hindlimbs) movement (as measured by the Lameness Locator, Equinosis) during each stride cycle at trot. The vector sums (VS) of maximum and minimum difference from each sensor were calculated and used for statistical analyses. ANOVA (Proc mixed model including individual {random}, date and group) was used to analyse differences between groups. Results The late group had higher VS for forelimbs (16.0?±?1.0) than the early group (12.6?±?1.0) (P?=?0.04) in total over the whole period. The VS for hind limbs did not differ between groups. Conclusions Front limb locomotion asymmetry in young horses in training is associated with delayed qualification for races. However, further studies are warranted to investigate causality.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies allow the assessment of variations in body position during jumping. This study evaluated changes in kinematic variables in horses during a jumping test. Methods Eight horses equipped with reflective skin markers were submitted to a jumping test consisting of 70 jumps in 4 series of 10, 15, 20 and 25 times each over a 1.10?m vertical obstacle. Six jumps per series were recorded; a heart rate of ≤ 90?bpm was the criterion to begin the next series. A 25?Hz calibrated camera was placed 10?m from the fence, and 2D images were analyzed. The variables were: overtracking at jumping; take-off and landing distances; jump length; distance between lowest point of the fore and hind limb and the fence; height of head, withers and croup in relation to the ground when passing the fence; and maximum withers height at jumping. Data were analysed with an ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test (P<0.05). Results There was a reduction in take-off distance (1.65?m to 1.46?m, P?=?0.03), landing distance (1.99?m to 1.71?m, P?=?0.001), jump length (4.51?m to 4.11?m, P?=?0.005), left forelimb distance height above the fence (9.4?cm to 5.1?cm, P?=?0.03) and maximum withers height at jumping (2.0?m to 1.95?m, P?=?0.001) from the first to the third series. Overtracking before jumping increased from 32?cm to 48?cm (P?=?0.003) and there was a reduction of right forelimb height above the fence from 7.3?cm to 2.9?cm (P?=?0.04), and of withers and croup height above the fence from 2.0?m to 1.95?m (P?=?0.001) and 1.93?m to 1.86?m (P<0.0001) respectively from the first to fourth session. Conclusions The increase in the number of jumps resulted in a decrease of take-off and landing distances, and in the distance between forelimb and fence and the withers and croup height, all indicating decreased jumping efficiency.

AB  - Introduction Lungeing is part of the standard lameness examination, however it systematically affects movement symmetry even in sound horses. We evaluated a method for objective lameness detection on the circle accounting for this asymmetry bias. Methods Twenty-six horses undergoing lameness examination were equipped with inertial sensors (Xsens) on head, sacrum and tubera coxae. Asymmetry in vertical displacement was quantified for trot on straight line and circle using multiple measures. Horses were classified lame when falling outside the directional reference range of sound horses (directional?=??normal? margins and lame limb depending on rein and sign of measure). Objective classification on the circle was compared to subjective evaluation, final diagnoses and objective classification on the straight calculating the proportion of matches. Regression analysis evaluated the association of change in asymmetry between straight line and circle and baseline asymmetry on the straight. Results The match between objective classification on the circle and the exact fore-/hindlimb(s) scored lame subjectively was 81% / 79%. The match with the diagnosed limb(s) was 71% / 85%. There was a high frequency of false positives compared to subjective evaluation. Objective evaluation on the circle added new information compared to assessment on the straight line in 70% (forelimb) / 58% (hindlimb) of instances (contralateral limb lame, bilateral lameness, lame on circle but sound on straight). Change in asymmetry was not associated with baseline lameness (P≥0.062). Conclusions Objective lameness evaluation on the circle makes a valuable contribution to patient assessment: e.g. subtle lameness falling within the margins of ?normal? on the straight or bilateral lameness could be identified. In future, the predictive value of the proposed technique should be determined. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.
