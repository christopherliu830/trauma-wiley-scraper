AB  - Introduction The muscle fibre type (MFT) of the deep epaxial musculature has not been determined in horses. The objective was to determine the MFT distribution in selected muscles of thoracolumbar and hindlimb region of horses. This included deep epaxial and hypaxial muscles that were hypothesised to have a postural stabilising role. A second objective was to examine differences in MFT distribution between Arabians and Quarter horses. Methods Muscle biopsy samples (114) were obtained from 5 Quarter horses, 4 Arabians, and 2 Thoroughbreds. The myosin heavy chain distribution was determined by gel electrophoresis. Mann-Whitney rank test was used to compare the proportional MFT content and differences between breeds. Results Mm. sacrocaudalis dorsalis medialis and diaphragm had the highest proportion of MFT-I, 84.1% (±18.4) and 72.4% (±12.5), respectively. The remaining deep epaxial muscles and the hypaxial m. psoas minor had approximately equal MFT-I and II proportions. Mm. psoas major, iliocostalis, longissimus dorsi and the hind limb muscles contained mostly MFT-IIX: from 50.5% (±12.8) to 67.9% (±7.3). Quarter horses had significantly more MFT-IIX in m. psoas major 60.8% (±9.1) than Arabians 41.9% (±3.2). Arabians had significantly more MFT-I fibres in m. longissimus dorsi 16.9% (±4.6) than Quarter horses 9.9% (±1.4) (P<0.05). Conclusions The MFT distribution of the deep epaxial muscles, mm. psoas minor and diaphragm, suggest a postural stabilizing role in contrast to the fibre type proportions of the hindlimb muscles. The findings can direct diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscular or neuromotor dysfunction in the thoracolumbar and hind limb area.

AB  - Introduction The ability to accurately assess equine oxygen consumption (VO2) under field conditions has been limited by the need for unrestricted gas exchange. Methods Two variations of a mask and an associated electronics control module (ECM) were designed to enable breath-by-breath measurement of airflows with two 8.0?cm diameter pneumotachometers located 7.5?cm in front of each narus and connected to differential pressure transducers mounted on the outside of the mask. The ECM was comprised of electronics for signal filtering to the flow transducers, an oxygen sensing cell, and an analog-to-digital converter all powered by a lithium-ion battery. The battery also powered a pump connected to gas sampling ports between the nares and pneumotachometers. Airflow and oxygen content of inspired and expired gases were recorded through the ECM and electronically transferred to a notebook. VO2 was determined from these recordings by an operator using a customized software analysis program. One mask encased the lower head (E). The other left the jaw free so horse could wear a bit and be ridden (R). Multiple treadmill exercise tests were undertaken by 6 horses to measure VO2max and blood gases. Each mask was worn twice and results compared to those from an open flow-through system (O) by 2-way RMANOVA (P<0.05). Utility of the system was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient of 4 independent raters. Results Blood gases and VO2max (152.0?±?4.0 (mean?±?SEM; O), 147.7?±?4.3 (E), 150.7?±?3.3 (R) ml/(kg.min) were not different between masks. VO2 measures were reproducible for each mask. Agreement between the 4 raters was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient?=?0.99). Conclusions Masks capable of measuring VO2 during field exercise were developed, tested and found accurate by multiple users. Ethical Animal Research Studies performed were approved by the Institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #3807). Sources of funding:?Institutional sources. Competing interests:?Washington State University has filed notice of its intent to apply for a patent for facemask used in this study.

AB  - Introduction The most frequently reported causes of gastric ulcers in horses are fasting, type of feed and management, and the administration of some drugs. More recently, physical exercise has also been pointed out as an important factor in the development of gastric lesions in athletic horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether treadmill exercise predisposes to the occurrence of gastric ulcers in horses. Methods Five Arabian horses were exercised on a high-speed treadmill during twelve weeks. The animals were submitted to gastroscopy before the beginning and the end of the training period. The lesions were classified according to the method proposed by Macallister [1] that assigns scores for number and severity of injuries, with modifications to give a total score for the stomach, considering not only the presence and severity of ulcers, but also other findings as gastritis, hyperkeratosis, desquamation of the mucosa. The results obtained in the two periods were compared using the Wilcoxon test, with significance at P<0.05. Results In the first gastroscopy two animals had very low scores for lesion number and severity and three horses had no injury. In contrast, in the second evaluation, all animals had higher scores. A significant difference was observed between the two periods (before and after training) considering both methods of gastric lesion classification. Conclusions We concluded that Arabian horses exercised on a treadmill may develop gastric lesions. The possible influence of these lesions on athletic performance and other parameters should be considered by researchers who study equine exercise physiology.

AB  - Introduction The evaluation of acid-base balance of horses is important because it detects alterations that affect their performance and health. There are studies relating these changes with endurance type effort, but few regarding sprint exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the fitness level of Quarter Horses performing barrel racing could be differentiated by quantitative acid-base analysis. Methods For this purpose, 10 horses were distributed into two groups: high (HF) and lower (LF) fitness as defined by the trainer. GPS and frequency meter were used for the measurements. Venous blood gas analysis was performed using a portable analyzer (I-stat) before and after exercise. Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and concentration of non-volatile buffers (Atot) were determined. Variables before and after exercise were compared within and between groups by t-test (P<0.05). Results The average track distance was 125?m. There were no differences between maximum or average velocity and heart rate, which were 30.76?±?0.53?km/h, 22.85?±?0.28?km/h, 206?bpm?±?3.91 versus 27.7?±?2.4?km/h, 21.94?±?0.3?km/h and 203?bpm?±?5.77 for the HF and LF groups, respectively. SID values before exercise were significantly lower for the LF group. Both groups showed a significant increase in Atot and AG, while pH, HCO3-, SIG and SID decreased significantly after exercise. Conclusions Metabolic acidosis was observed using both the traditional and the quantitative approach. It was not possible to differentiate the fitness level of horses in the study.

AB  - Introduction Acid-base disturbances are frequently assessed using traditional variables PCO2, pH, and bicarbonate. This study aimed to compare the changes in acid-base balance in horses performing a CEI endurance race (160?km) using traditional and quantitative methodologies. Methods Blood samples were drawn before racing, at the vet-gate (66?km), immediately after racing, and 2 and 15?h after racing from 18 participating horses. The mean velocity of the horses was 17?km/h. PCO2 and pH were measured (I-Stat). Strong ion difference (SID), anion gap (AG), strong ion gap (SIG) and total volatile buffers (Atot) were calculated using formulas from the literature. Data for finishers (F) and non-finishers (N) was compared with an unpaired test. Data collected for finishers at all time-points was compared by repeated ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results PCO2 was lower in group N at the 66?km time-point. In group F, AG had a bimodal behaviour, declining immediately after exercise and then increasing at 2 and 15 hours. There was a slight increase in pH post-exercise. After 2 hours, Atot increased while PCO2 decreased. Compared to SIG immediately after racing, SIG at 2 and 15 hours after racing was decreased. Traditional methodology suggested mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to hyperventilation of the finishers. Quantitative methodology suggested metabolic acidosis reflected by decreasing SID trend and a significant increase of Atot. Conclusions Acid-base imbalances are present in endurance racing horses and differences were found between the traditional and quantitative methods of assessment.

AB  - Introduction During anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, lactate and H+ ions accumulate in muscle fibers and pass into the bloodstream. Monocarboxylate transporter type 1 and its ancillary protein CD147 transport H+ and lactate ions from the plasma into red blood cells, thereby maintaining acid/base homeostasis and retarding systemic acidosis and fatigue. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of CD147 protein in the red blood cells of Arabian horses with different levels of athletic ability. Methods Blood samples were taken from 12 Arabian horses before exercise. The horses were divided into two groups: untrained horses (UH, n?=?6) and 160-km endurance horses (FEI, n?=?6). The amount of CD147 in the plasma membranes of their red blood cells was determined by Western blotting analysis using a human-specific anti-CD147 antibody previously validated for horses. The medians were compared by Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test at 5%. Results CD147 protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45?kDa was found in the red blood cell membranes of the studied horses. The CD147 expression levels of the two groups were not different (P?=?0.065). The observed median values (min?max) were 0.50 (0.37?1.26) and 0.27 (0.09?0.69) arbitrary optical density units for the FEI and UH group respectively. Conclusions Studies must be performed with more horses to determine if a different level of CD147 expression exists in FEI horses related to their intensive training programs or to the genetic traits of each horse.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered in North America for the prophylactic treatment of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Plasma total CO2 concentration (ctCO2) provides a clinically useful screening test for the presence of metabolic acid-base disturbances, including the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents to racehorses. Some racing jurisdictions account for the metabolic alkalosis and increased plasma ctCO2 induced by furosemide administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between pre-race furosemide dose and pre-race plasma ctCO2 in Thoroughbred racehorses. Methods Jugular venous blood was collected anaerobically into 3?mL partially evacuated plastic tubes containing lithium heparin from 226 Thoroughbred horses administered a variable dose of furosemide (150?500?mg IV, n?=?217) 3?4 hours previously or not administered furosemide (n?=?9). Plasma ctCO2 was calculated from the measured values for pH and pCO2 using a blood gas and pH analyzer [Radiometer ABL 700] and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Data was analyzed using multivariable linear regression and P<0.05 was significant. Plasma ctCO2 in mmol/L increased linearly (P?=?0.0006) with furosemide dose in milligrams adjusted for sex (female, stallion, gelding), such that ctCO2?=?33.38???0.71(if female)???0.63(if stallion)?+?0.0040???(furosemide dose). Conclusions Intravenous administration of furosemide (150?500?mg) produces a linear dose-dependent increase in ctCO2 in plasma. High intravenous doses of furosemide (500?mg) have the potential to increase plasma ctCO2 to near the threshold value used to identify the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents. This finding supports an allowance of 2.0?mmol/L for furosemide administration used by some racing jurisdictions in North America.

AB  - Introduction Big respiratory cycles (BRCs) are a sporadic but normal occurrence during galloping exercise. Their relationship to performance capacity as reflected by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is unclear. Methods 7 Thoroughbreds completed multiple incremental exercise tests up to 13?m/s on a treadmill to determine their VO2max while wearing a mask that measured inspired and expired volumes (VI, VE) and VO2 on a breath-by-breath basis. Frequency and duration of BRCs were related to speed and VO2max using regression analysis. Numbers of BRCs for each test were counted and the duration, VI, VE and VO2 of each BRC determined and compared to the corresponding average values of the 5 breaths following the BRCs, and VO2max for the exercise bout. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results The frequency of BRCs was 64% when all speeds and runs were considered. The number and appearance of BRCs varied considerably between horses. BRC numbers were greatest at 6 and 13?m/s and least at 9?m/s, and significantly related by polynomial regression (r2?=?0.90). BRC duration was not related to breathing frequency when all BRCs were considered due to the existence of two distinct clusters of BRCs. The duration of those lasting <1.25?s was inversely related to speed (r2?=?0.77) as were those >1.25?s in length (r2?=?0.55). BRC VI and VE were greater than normal VI and VE and the difference increased linearly (r2?=?0.89 and 0.87, respectively) as speed increased from 6?m/s (VI: 8.0?±?0.6%; VE: 8.9?±?0.7% greater) to 13?m/s (VI: 42?±?2%; VE: 57?±?3% greater). Individual VO2max was not related to the number, length or volume of BRCs. Conclusions The frequency, duration and size of BRCs do not affect VO2max and vary considerably within a given treadmill test and between horses.

AB  - Introduction Eccentric muscle contractions (?negative? work, e.g., downhill running) affect human skeletal muscle differently than concentric contractions, increasing muscle size and strength more than concentric exercise training with reduced oxygen consumption (VO2). Better understanding of skeletal muscle and cardiopulmonary responses to downhill training may indicate a role for this in Thoroughbred training. We hypothesised that Thoroughbreds would reduce metabolic energy cost and cardiopulmonary function when they ran at equivalent speed on a declined treadmill compared with running horizontally or uphill. Methods Five well-trained Thoroughbreds ran for 2-min incremental exercise intervals on a treadmill at 1.7, 3.5, 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0?m/s on a +4% incline, 0% incline (horizontal) and ?4% decline in random order on different days. Cardiopulmonary and O2-transport variables were measured and analysed with two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Holm-?idák pairwise-comparisons. Results Horses ran at all inclines with identical stride frequency and length. At identical uphill speeds they had significantly higher (vs. horizontal) mass-specific VO2 (43% mean increase) and CO2 production (VCO2/Mb), cardiac output (Q/Mb), heart rate, arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2), and reduced arterial O2 tension and saturation; tidal volume tended to be higher (P?=?0.060). Downhill running reduced (vs. horizontal) VO2/Mb (19% mean decrease), VCO2/Mb, Q/Mb and PaCO2. Fractional energy cost increase (incline) and reduction (decline) decreased linearly with increasing speed. Conclusions Thoroughbreds run downhill with lower energy cost than on the level or uphill and the cost changes with speed. It remains to be determined if eccentric training induces skeletal muscle changes in horses.

AB  - Introduction Training related cardiac adaptation is documented in Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds, including an increased incidence of AV valve regurgitation. In Warmbloods less is known about training effects on cardiac function or subclinical valve regurgitation. Methods Fifteen adult untrained Warmbloods (aged 3.8?±?0.7 years) were compared with fifteen adult Warmblood eventers (aged 11.4?±?0.9 years) competing at CIC2* (group 1, n?=?5) and CCI2*, CIC3*, CCI3* and CCI4*levels (group 2, n?=?9) and fifteen healthy adult Warmbloods competing at advanced dressage (group 3, n?=?5), Prix Saint Georges, Intermediate or Grand Prix (group 4, n?=?10) levels (mean age 10.3?±?0.7 years). The presence of heart murmurs, valve regurgitation and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated, and training intensity was scored. A correlation was found between bodyweight and not height. Differences in cardiac morphology were compared using General Linear Models with post-hoc Bonferroni correction (SPSS version 20), using group and bodyweight as covariates. Significance was set at P<0.05. Prevalence of audible heart murmurs and valvular regurgitation was higher in eventers (0?20% and 29?79%, respectively and dressage horses (7?40% and 7?60%, respectively) than controls (0?20% and 7?20%, respectively). Interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd, left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV mean wall thickness (LVMWT) were greater in groups 2 and 4 than controls; group 4 also had a greater pulmonary artery diameter (PAD) and LV posterior wall (LVPWd). Group 1 showed a greater LVMWT; group 4 a greater end point septal separation (EPSS). Training intensity influenced in both categories IVSd and MWT; in eventers also the right ventricular diameter in diastole and in dressage horses also LVPWd, LVM, EPSS and PAD. Elite eventers and dressage horses showed an increased prevalence of audible murmurs and valvular regurgitation. Cardiac adaptations resembled those associated with resistance and endurance training. Increased performance level and training intensity accompanied increased cardiac muscle thickness and volume. These effects should be considered during sales and performance evaluations.

AB  - Introduction Subchondral bone fatigue is an important cause of poor performance, morbidity and mortality in racehorses. Fatigued bone is repaired by remodelling, a process that is attenuated under high cyclical loads, yet the effects of training on remodelling activity in Thoroughbred racehorses is unknown. We hypothesised that remodelling rates are lower in training horses than those that are resting from training. Methods Sections of the palmar metacarpal condyles from Thoroughbred horses that were in race training (n?=?24) or resting from training (n?=?24) at the time of death were examined with light microscopy and back scattered electron microscopy (BSEM). Bone area fraction (B.Ar/T.Ar), and eroded bone surface (E.Pm/T.Ar) were measured within two regions of interest; (1) the lateral parasagittal groove (PS); and (2) the lateral condylar subchondral bone (LC). BSEM variables were analysed for the effect of group (independent samples t-test), region (paired t-test) and interaction with time since change in training status (general linear model). Mean?±?SE are reported. Results For both regions of interest E.Pm/T.Ar was lower in the training horses (PS: 0.39?±?0.06?mm?1, LC: 0.24?±?0.04?mm?1) than in the resting group (PS: 0.65?±?0.07?mm?1, P?= 0.010, LC: 0.85?±?0.10?mm?1, P<0.001). Lower subchondral bone porosity was observed, reflected by higher B.Ar/T.Ar in the LC of training horses (90.8?±?0.6%) than resting horses (85.3?±?1.4%, P?=?0.0010). E.Pm/T.Ar was higher with increased duration of a training period in the lateral condyle (r2?=?0.26, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Race training inhibits remodelling in the subchondral bone of highly loaded areas of the distal metacarpus. Therefore periods of less intense loading are important for allowing repair of subchondral bone fatigue in Thoroughbred racehorses.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered to Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses to reduce the incidence and severity of EIPH. The magnitude and duration of mineral loss following furosemide administration has not previously been measured in horses. Methods Six fit Thoroughbreds (age 6.8?±?1.2?y; bwt 585?±?19?kg) were used in a 3?x?3 Latin square design trial to measure the effect of furosemide on urinary and fecal mineral excretion for 24?h before (?24?h) and 24?h, 48?h and 72?h after a standardized exercise test (SET) on an inclined (3o) high speed treadmill. The treatment groups consisted of an untreated control (C) and two groups (F and FE) which received furosemide (0.5?mg/kg, IV) 4?h before the SET. C and F were fed 60?g/d NaCl and (FE) was fed 200?g/d of an electrolyte mix (14?g?K, 37.7?g?Na and 43.3?g?Cl) for 21 days before the SET. Following the SET the FE group was supplemented with an additional 10?g/d?Ca and 10?g/d?Mg. Results Urinary Ca, P, Na and Cl excretion increased 24?h post treatment in the F and FE groups (P<0.05). 72?h?Ca and Cl balance was decreased in F (P<0.05) and 72?h?Mg and Cl balance was decreased in FE (P<0.05). The digestibility of P and Mg was decreased in FE (P<0.05) and Na digestibility was increased in F and FE (P<0.05). Conclusions A single dose of furosemide negatively affected calcium balance in horses for 72?h post administration. Further research is needed to assess the effect of chronic furosemide use in racehorses on mineral balance and soundness.

AB  - Introduction This study aimed to investigate the possibility of obtaining the beginning and end of stance from a girth-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), by comparing data from the IMU with data from an opto-electronic system. Methods 15 horses were trotted on a treadmill, with markers on hooves and a Girth Marker (GM) on a wireless IMU over the sternum. Proreflex cameras collected 3D marker data. T-tests and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to decipher any difference between diagonally paired limbs; GM and hoof markers; and GM and IMU, the limits of agreement of which were also assessed using a Bland Altman method. Results Timings of diagonally-coupled limbs were not significantly different at beginning (P?=?0.77 and 0.95), or end of stance (P?= 0.60 and 0.46) for right or left diagonal respectively. The diagonal in stance was identifiable from GM y position, with which IMU derived position had 97%, and IMU roll 100% agreement. Stance according to hoof markers did not differ significantly from GM z acceleration at beginning (P?= 0.49?±?0.01, P?= 0.92?±?0.007), or GM z velocity at end (P?= 0.84?±?0.007, P?= 0.83?±?0.007), in right or left diagonal respectively. A strong correlation was seen between beginning and end of stance according to GM and IMU events (each R2>0.99). Relationships between IMU and GM amplitudes were less convincing, with a significant difference at peak acceleration (P<0.05, Standard Deviation?=?2.70?m/s/s, ULOA?=?5.93, LLOA?=??4.66). Conclusions A girth-based IMU can identify temporal stride characteristics in trot on a treadmill, but inferences from amplitude data should be treated with caution until further investigated.

AB  - Introduction Kissing Spines Syndrome (KSS) represents a major challenge in equine practice. Radiographic examination of dorsal spinous processes (DSP) is therefore often included in sale and insurance cases and in diagnosis of back problems. Measurement of interspinous spaces (ISS) on radiographs is often used when evaluating DSPs. Radiographic examination of the equine back usually consists of two to four images causing beam angle differences between the image center and image borders. In addition, radiographs are 2D representations of 3D structures causing superimposition of anatomical structures. The aim of this study was to investigate if x-ray beam angle and superimposition affect radiographic evaluation of ISSs. Methods Beam angle effect was investigated using latero-lateral radiographs of the thoracic DSPs. Importance of superimposition of anatomical structures was investigated by comparing radiographic measurements with measurements in comparable CT and MR images. Cadaver backs from six horses were included. Four had a diagnosis of KSS, while two were considered normal. Backs were placed in an upright position on a flat surface for all images. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model with a single random factor, ISS. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results X-ray beam angle significantly influenced measurement of ISS (P<0.02) with differences of up to 2?mm, when measured three positions apart. ISS widths measured in radiographs were significantly lower than in comparable CT (P<0.0001) and MR (P<0.0001) images with differences of up to 3?mm. Conclusions These findings suggest that radiographic assessment may result in incorrect evaluation of ISSs.

AB  - Introduction The equestrian arenas at the 2012 Olympic Games were constructed on a unique raised platform. Arena surfaces can be implicated in risk of injury and affect performance, therefore functional properties were examined to ensure preparation was appropriate for this unusual construction. The objective of this work was to assess surface hardness, load carrying capacity and uniformity during the development of a suitable surface for the 2012 Olympic Games. Data were compared from the Olympic site at a test event in 2011, pre-London 2012 and from developmental test arenas on and off a raised platform. Methods In-situ systematic sampling was used across arenas. A biomechanical surface tester quantified load carrying capacity (peak load), a Clegg impact hammer was used to assess hardness (peak deceleration) and moisture data were analysed in the laboratory. Contour maps and GLMs (applying the arena's structural features as explanatory variables where appropriate) were used to highlight surface heterogeneity. Results Significant variation in peak deceleration across the surface was detected at the test event in 2011 (P<0.0001). Peak load (P<0.0001) and peak deceleration (P<0.0001) were higher pre-London 2012, partly due to enhanced stiffness of the base layer. Higher moisture content found pre-London 2012 (P<0.001) was considered beneficial for surface consolidation. There was no significant difference between data collected on or off a raised platform following the developmental work. Results highlight the importance of effective water management and sub-surface construction. Conclusions Findings from this work guided decisions made by the surface providers for the 2012 Olympic Games and advanced understanding of methods most appropriate for assessing arenas in-situ.

AB  - Introduction Degenerative changes in sacroiliac joints (SIJ) are reported to cause poor performance in horses. The aim of this study was to document the frequency and nature of changes in SIJ surfaces of Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses and to correlate gross morphology and marginal new bone formation to age, body weight and history of back pain. Methods SIJ surfaces from 37 deceased TBs retired from the Hong Kong Jockey Club were photographed and measurements taken to facilitate subjective and objective analysis of gross changes. SIJ surfaces were described, and the surface area of the joint surfaces determined from the photographs, using Image J. Area and shape of the joint surfaces were recorded and SIJs were graded and allocated a type according to pre-determined criteria. Changes were compared for horses with and without clinical records of back pain. Results Mean age was 6.6?±?2.3 years; weight 494?±?35?kg; with no differences between horses with (n?=?14) and without (n?=?23) a history of back pain. There was no relationship between bodyweight (r?=?0.08) or age (r?=?0.13) and SIJ surface area. SIJs of the back pain group were affected by obvious gross pathology that showed certain characteristics. There was a relationship between surface area of joint and degree of marginal bone formation (P<0.001). SIJs from the group of TBs with no back pain had fewer and less obvious gross findings. Conclusions Clinical evidence of back pain, which may reasonably be expected to have affected the horse's racing performance, was associated with characteristic gross pathology of the SIJ.

AB  - Introduction Tail deviation in horses is anecdotally viewed as an indicator of lameness. Compensatory mechanisms in lame horses are well documented, however there is no information published on the relationship between lameness and tail carriage in horses. The objectives of this study were to quantify differences in tail carriage in relation to the type of lameness (front/hind, left/right) and to establish a relationship with confounding variables. Methods Videos of 150 horses presented for lameness examination were evaluated. Tail carriage angles were measured in 50 horses and subjectively assessed using a categorical 4-point scale in 100 horses. Lame leg(s), lameness score(s), age, sex, breed, duration and cause of lameness were recorded. Differences in tail carriage between lameness types were assessed using paired T-tests (continuous data) or chi-square tests (categorical data). Logistic regression evaluated the effect of degree and duration of lameness, and age on degree of tail deviation. Results 87.2% of the horses showed some degree of tail deviation. The mean?±?SD tail angle was 92?±?14.5° (90°?=?midsagittal) for forelimb and 87?±?11.2° for hindlimb lameness. The mean?±?SD tail angle was 91.1?±?17.3° for right-sided and 89.5?±?16.9° for left forelimb lameness; 89.8°?±?8.8 for right and 86.5°±?9.8 for left hindlimb lameness with no statistically significant difference between front/hind (P?=?0.52) or left/right lameness (P?=?0.237). No statistically significant correlation was found between degree and duration of lameness, age of horse and presence or degree of tail deviation. Conclusions No significant relationship between tail carriage and lameness was identified in this study and tail carriage should therefore not be considered an indicator for lameness.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred racehorses often experience periods of detraining due to locomotor disorders and subsequent rehabilitation. We hypothesised that regularly exercising horses at different intensities during a period of detraining would differentially maintain their cardiopulmonary and O2 transport capacities. Methods Twenty-seven Thoroughbred horses trained for 18 weeks then underwent 12 weeks of detraining according to one of three protocols: 1) cantering at 70% maximal rate of O2 consumption (VO2max) for 3?min/d for 5?d/wk (C group), 2) walking for 1?h/d for 5?d/wk (W group) and 3) stall rest (S group). Standardised treadmill exercise tests were performed before and after detraining during which cardiopulmonary and O2 transport variables were measured. Data were analysed with two-way ANOVA and pairwise comparisons made with Tukey's test. Significance was defined as P≤0.05. Results Mass-specific VO2max, maximal cardiac output and maximal stroke volume of all groups decreased after detraining with no differences between groups. The run time to exhaustion, speed eliciting VO2max, speed eliciting maximal heart rate and speed at which plasma lactate concentration reached 4?mmol/l of the C group did not change but those of the W and S groups decreased after detraining. Arterial-(mixed-venous) O2 concentration difference did not change after detraining in any group, and maximal heart rate decreased in the W and S groups. Conclusions These results suggest it may be possible to identify a minimum threshold exercise intensity or protocol during detraining in horses that maintains significant elements of performance-related variables and minimises reductions in O2 transport capacity.

AB  - Introduction Muscle conformation is often discussed among practitioners and it is sometimes suggested that specific training strategies affect muscle conformation. This study attempted to investigate; 1) if it is possible for practitioners to judge whether a horse is subjected to pace training or not based on subjective analysis of hind-end muscle conformation and 2) which terminology practitioners would use when doing this. Methods Photos were taken from behind (transverse plane) in 10 Icelandic horses trained for mounted pace racing and 11 used for riding but not pacing. Body condition score was 7.4 and 7.5 (SE 0.3, P>0.05) in pacers and non-pacers, respectively (9 degree scale, ANOVA, Tukey test). Three experienced horse practitioners (A, B, C) were informed that the 21 photos showed horses trained for pace racing and horses not trained as pacers and they were instructed to separate photos into two groups based on their subjective impression of muscle conformation. Results Practitioner A divided horses into groups called ?even? (n?=?13) and ?narrow? (n?=?8); B into groups called ?strong? (n?=?11) and ?weak? (n?=?10); and C into ?high? (n?=?9) and ?wedged? ? (n?=?12). The practitioners assumed that ?even?, ?strong? and ?high? horses were pacers and 10, 10 and 12 observations were correct in practitioner A, B and C, respectively (mean?±?SD: 51?±?5%). The number of cases where all practitioners agreed and grouping also matched pacers and non-pacers were 7. Conclusions It appears not to be possible to judge whether an Icelandic horse is pace trained based on observations of the hind-end musculature. The terminology used appeared to refer either to the conformation or to a presumed strength. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Introduction Fatalities are recognized as a consequence of prolonged endurance exercise but data documenting incidence and causes is limited. Methods Numbers of horse starts and fatalities were obtained from the American Endurance Ride Conference (AERC) website (www.aerc.org) and further details about fatalities were obtained from horse owners and attending veterinarians. Annual incidence rates were calculated and odds ratios for region and ride length were determined. Results From 2002?2013 there were 252,738 horse starts in AERC sanctioned rides and 67 fatalities attributable to the demands of endurance exercise were documented. 46/67 horses were eliminated while 21 successfully completed the ride and were deemed fit to continue. Thirteen horses died while euthanasia was performed in the remaining 54 instances, and 51% had necropsy examinations performed. 81% of the fatalities developed acute abdominal pain and necropsy findings included gastric rupture in 12%. Fatalities were also related to financial constraints as 28% of riders declined fluid therapy, referral to surgical facilities, and/or surgery when recommended. Horses competing in the Central and Midwest regions appeared at lesser risk, while those in the Southwest and Northeast regions appeared at greater risk, but low numbers of fatalities precluded reaching statistical significance. In contrast, the risk of fatality was 2 (1 fatality per 3,711 starts) and 12 (1 fatality per 648 starts) times more likely for participation in 80 and 160?km rides, as compared to competition in Limited Distance (40 to 56?km) rides (1 fatality per 8,057 starts). Conclusions Overall fatality rates were low; however, risk increased with ride distance. Acute abdominal pain was the most common clinical presentation.
