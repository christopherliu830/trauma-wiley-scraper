AB  - Introduction Hydrotherapy is increasingly applied within the equine industry for rehabilitation and therapy. Substantial anecdotal evidence exists suggesting the benefits of its application but while there is extensive literature on the use of aqua-treadmills in humans and canines there is comparatively little in equines. Therefore, limited research exists supporting the role of the aqua-treadmill in current therapy practices. This study aimed to investigate the effect of water depth on pelvic movement during aqua-treadmill exercise. Methods Eight horses were trotted on an aqua-treadmill at four water depths specifically measured to individual horses (P3, fetlock, MC3, carpus). Pelvic displacement was recorded using an optical motion capture system to collect coordinates from markers placed on the tuber sacrale, tuber coxae, withers and lumbar spine. Data were processed using custom written scripts (Matlab?) and ANOVA was performed. Results All subjects demonstrated a significant increase in vertical displacement of the pelvis as water depth increased from P3 to carpus while displacement symmetry was not significantly altered with a change in water depth. Conclusions The common practice of increasing water depth to intensify the physical demands of the exercise while maintaining the desired movement symmetry is supported. Having knowledge of how a horse moves on an aqua-treadmill is vital for tailoring specific therapy in order to most successfully rehabilitate the horse from injury. Investigation of the effects of increasing water depth on asymmetric horses should be carried out to further support its application as a tool for rehabilitation. Ethical Animal Research Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee at Moulton College. Owner consent was granted for all subjects and all horses were handled in compliance with British Horse Society standards throughout the trials.

AB  - Introduction Exercising horses one, two, or three times per week during 6 weeks using two intervals with near-maximal speed over 100?m elicited a decrease of VLa4, a widely accepted parameter of fitness and competitive success of horses (speed at which, under defined conditions, the blood lactate concentration reaches 4?mmol/l). Therefore, two field studies were performed to examine the possibility of avoiding decline in VLa4 with this type of exercise. Methods Study 1) 6 horses were submitted to the same exercise as above once per week during the first 2 weeks of a conditioning period (CP) adding one interval in each exercise session every 2 weeks for the following 6 weeks. Study 2) 6 horses did the same as horses in study 1 plus once per week an exercise bout at their individual VLa2 during 35 minutes. Before, every 2 weeks during, and 2 weeks after the CP, horses were subjected to standardized exercise tests to determine their VLa4 (and VLa2 where convenient) and maximal speed (speedmax). The effect of conditioning on VLa4 and speedmax was examined using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Fisher's test. Results In study 1 mean VLa4 declined during the first 4 weeks of CP but increased to the initial level thereafter (P<0.05) while speedmax remained the same over time. In study 2 VLa4 decreased continuously (P<0.01) while speedmax increased (P<0.01). Conclusions The results might be important to train horses racing over different distances.

AB  - Introduction Eventing is a challenging equestrian discipline. Insight into causes of wastage and withdrawal from competition is essential for animal welfare and economic reasons. Methods Twenty-nine animals selected for the European Championship (EC) in 2010 (9 ponies) and 2011 (20 horses) were followed prospectively monitoring fitness using standardized exercise tests. Causes of withdrawal were noted. Data were analyzed using logistic-regression, likely-ratio-tests, Fisher-exact-test, general-linear-model and Chi-square tests as appropriate. Results Seventeen weeks before EC 17 horses and 9 ponies were tested: mean VLa4 was 10.3?±?0.4?m/s and 7.8?±?0.9?m/s respectively, and V200 was 11.4?±?0.8?m/s and 9.6?±?0.7?m/s respectively. Six weeks before EC 16/20 horses and 6/9 ponies were withdrawn, mainly for locomotor injury: 9/16 horses (P<0.001), 4/6 ponies (P?=?0.011). Other reasons were ?not-meeting-competition-criteria? (4/16 horses, 2/6 ponies) and ?being sold? (3/16 horses). Divided on the basis of VLa4 and ?recovery-HR-during-SET-I? into good (GP) and average performers (AP), AP were more likely to be injured (50%) than GP (0%, P?=?0.05). In a subpopulation (n?=?10, all condition training sessions evaluated for HR and speed) HRpeak was significantly lower in horses staying sound (186?±?9 beats/min) compared to horses withdrawn because of injury (201?±?5 beats/min; P?=?0.016). Conclusions For the European Championship 45% of national selection horses were unavailable because of locomotor injuries. GP at the beginning of the season were less likely to become injured than AP. HRpeak during condition training showed predictive value for future injuries.

AB  - Introduction Blood is often collected from performing poorly horses to measure blood variables that may indicate a reason. However, intense exercise affects many blood variables and therefore time of sampling can affect the interpretation of results. This study examined the behaviour of blood variables after racing to determine the magnitude of the changes and to determine when it is better to collect samples. Methods Blood was sampled in 17 Standardbred racehorses 3 and 2 days before as well as 2 and 3 days after racing. GGT, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, CK, AST, LDH and cortisol were measured in plasma, and haematocrit, haemoglobin, number of erythrocytes, total white blood cells, granulocytes and lymphocytes were measured in EDTA blood. Parametric data was analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher test; non-parametric data with Friedman test and Wilcoxon test. Results Plasma Ca concentration was lower on day 3 after racing than on day 2 before racing (P<0.01). P concentration and GGT activity were higher at days 2 and 3 after racing compared to before racing (P?=?0.01). Erythrocytes, haematocrit and haemoglobin were higher at day 2 after racing than before and 3 days after racing (P<0.01). The other variables were not affected. Conclusions Some slight but significant changes in blood variables have to be taken in account when interpreting biochemical and haematologic variables for poor performance diagnosis in Standardbreds. It seems preferable to take blood samples on the third day after racing than on the second day.

AB  - Introduction Polo is a popular sport; teams compete in matches comprising 4?6 chukkas, each between 7?10 minutes. Players commonly change ponies between chukkas, but changing within a chukka, known as ?half-chukkering? is permitted. This is believed to ?save? the horse by preventing fatigue and facilitating recovery. This study evaluated the impact of half versus full chukka playing strategies in low goal polo; team handicap 0?4 goals. Methods Resting heart rates (HR) were established for 48 polo-ponies deemed of comparable fitness by riders, competing in low-goal tournaments; riders selected their playing strategy either full-chukka (n?=?32) or half-chukkering (n?=?16). HR was recorded at the end of play and during recovery; for the full-chukka and 2nd half-chukka period at +2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 minutes, and until ponies returned to play after the 1st half-chukka, >6 minutes. ANOVA analyses investigated HR variation during recovery between ponies playing full-chukkas and the 2nd half-chukka period, and within the two half-chukkas played. Results At the end of play, full-chukka horses? mean HR were 95?±?13.1?bpm, compared to their 2nd half-chukka counterparts at 103?±?7.7?bpm, which was not significant. Significant differences in HR did occur throughout the subsequent recovery period: at 2 minutes (P<0.003) and between 4?20 minutes (P<0.0001), with full-chukka ponies recovering faster. No differences occurred during recovery between the two half-chukka periods although mean HR differed at the end of play (1st: 100?±?7.7?bpm; 2nd: 103?±?7.8?bpm). Conclusions Playing strategies influence cardiovascular recovery; full-chukka ponies recover faster than those playing in consecutive half-chukkas. Preparation of half-chukka ponies may predispose to reduced fitness levels compared to full-chukka ponies. Implementing a full-chukka playing strategy is advocated to optimise pony welfare and performance in low-goal polo.

AB  - Introduction Swedish Standardbred trotters are usually not clipped during the cold season but routinely showered and blanketed after exercise. Yet, the effects on heat dissipation have not been thoroughly studied. Methods Six Standardbred geldings were tested during three consecutive days, acting as their own control when: 1) showered, 2) showered and blanketed, 3) neither showered nor blanketed. The exercise consisted of 20?min trot (maximum heart rate 172?bpm), preceded and followed by 5?min walk. Rectal- (RT) and skin temperature (ST), respiration rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) were recorded: before exercise in the horses? boxes, after harnessing, after 5?min walk, at stops during four sequences of low and high intensity trotting, after 5?min walk (stable aisle), after showering and blanketing and at intervals of 15?30?min during recovery in boxes until one hour after exercise. Blankets remained on horses until test completion. Results Data were analyzed with Proc Mixed Model in SAS. Ambient temperature was 7.2?±?0.2°C (relative humidity 63.5?±?1.0%) in the stable and 1.0?±?1.0°C (54.3?±?1.2%) outdoors. Showering decreased ST of the neck (mean?±?SE, 32.0?±?0.4°C) compared to when horses were not showered (35.1?±?0.4, P<0.05). Showering also decreased ST of the hind leg (31.4?±?0.5, P<0.05). RT, RR and HR did not differ between treatments (P>0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, showering is efficient for cooling down whereas blanketing compromised heat dissipation.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to validate a field standardized exercise test (SET) adapted for young endurance horses and to evaluate the effects of age/conditioning level on speed and heart rate values. Methods The study involved 31 horses of Arabian origin bred specifically for endurance and aged 4?yo (n?=?11), 5?yo (n?=?13) or 6?yo (n?=?7). The SET consisted of a warm-up, followed by 15 (4?yo), 30 (5?yo) or 45 (6?yo) minutes of canter at a comfortable steady speed, and finished with 500 meters of fast gallop. Heart rate (HR) was recorded continuously during the SET. The velocities at which HR reached 160 and 200 beats per minute (V160 and V200) were calculated by the linear regression of HR versus speed. Results All horses were able to complete the SET. Resting HR was higher in 4?y than in 5?y and 6?y (P<0.05 via Student's t test). HR and velocities during the SET did not vary significantly with age. Mean?±?SD values for 4?yo, 5?yo and 6?yo respectively are as follows: Resting HR: 47.5?±?7.2, 42.3?±?3.2, 41.3?±?5.4?bpm; HRcanter: 162.7?±?14.3, 156.9?±?17.3, 161.4?±?10.7?bpm; Vcanter: 22.6?±?0.9, 22.4?±?1.2, 23.3?±?1.6?km/h; HRsprint: 191.3?±?18.1, 181.7?±?18.5, 184.1?±?16.2?bpm; Vsprint: 30.3?±?3.0, 31.5?±?6.4, 35.3?±?6.9?km/h; V160: 25.8?±?3.5, 24.8?±?5.0, 27.1?±?5.8?km/h; V200: 36.8?±?6.1, 37.4?±?7.3, 44.3?±?10.9?km/h; Post-exercice lactatemia: 7.4?±?4.5, 13.5?±?3.6, 5.6?±?3.4?mmol/l. These values perfectly fit with those described previously for adult endurance horses. Conclusions The proposed field SET involved both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism reproducing the progress of an endurance race. Further studies are being conducted to discriminate if possible the effects of age from those of conditioning.

AB  - Introduction Exertional myopathies are a common cause of exercise intolerance in the equine athlete, and Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy (PSSM) is a widely described muscular disease. It is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal glycogen in myofibers due to a genetic defect in the skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1) enzyme. We hypothesized that energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in muscular mitochondria might be impaired in type-1 PSSM-affected horses. Methods Eight horses with a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis were tested for the GYS1 mutation. Muscle biopsies were collected and used for histological analysis and high resolution respirometry (HRR). HRR values from 3 groups of horses (5 PSSM-positive horses, 3 horses with a history of myopathy but PSSM-negative and 16 healthy controls) were compared using a linear mixed model to take into account repeated (2?3 times) measurements made for each horse. Results In 5/8 horses histology revealed an accumulation of abnormal glycogen in myofibers. These 5 horses also tested positive for the GYS1 mutation. A severe depression of maximal OXPHOS capacity was observed by HRR in 7/8 horses with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with lower values in PSSM-positive cases (4/5). Conclusions Our study shows a severely decreased OXPHOS capacity in PSSM-affected horses. PSSM is considered primarily a defect in glycogen synthesis but altered OXPHOS might play a central role in its pathogenesis.

AB  - Introduction In an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) for Icelandic horses, gaits are scored from 5?10 and there is an option for judges to add standardized comments on the gaits. The aim of this study was to test if comments given on pace were related to horses? plasma lactate concentration (Lac) post BEFT, with the hypothesis that some of the comments would be related to Lac. Methods Data was collected from 157 horses (age 4?11 years) at a BEFT in Iceland in 2011. Venous blood samples were obtained after exercise and lactate concentration determined. Judges? comments were obtained from Worldfengur. The comments that could be given were: ?good speed?, ?clear beat?, ?sure?, ?big movements?, ?good suspension?, ?long strides? (positive comments); and ?lack of speed?, ?unsure?, ?four-beat?, ?short strides?, ?changing gait? and ?jumping out of gait? (negative comments). Results were separated into two groups (within each comment); horses/pace with the comment and horses/pace without the comment. Data were analysed via ANOVA (Proc GLM, SAS) including sex, age group, comment, average speed and distance (P<0.05). Results Lac was higher when pace had comments ?good speed? and ?sure? than when no comment was given (23.6?±?1.2 vs. 17.9?±?0.5, P<0.001; and 20.2?±?0.9 vs. 18.1?±?0.6, P<0.05) and was lower when pace had comments ?lack of speed? and ?unsure? (16.8?±?1.0 vs. 19.2?±?0.6; and 16.2?±?1.0 vs. 19.3?±?0.5, P<0.05). No other significant effects on Lac were observed. Conclusions Horses with pace subjectively judged as fast and ?sure? had higher blood lactate concentration indicating that successful pace is more anaerobic than less successful pace.

AB  - Introduction Calculating the total plasma concentration of carbon dioxide (ctCO2) from the results of blood gas and pH analysis assumes that the value for pK1? is constant and approximates 6.095. The objective of this study was to verify both assumptions in equine plasma. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected pre-race from 115 trained Standardbreds into 3?mL partially evacuated plastic tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood pH (pHb) and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) were measured in one tube using a blood gas and pH analyser (Radiometer ABL-700). The second tube was anaerobically centrifuged and ctCO2 was measured (Beckman EL-ISE analyser). Plasma pK1? was calculated for each horse using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, measured values for pHb, pCO2, and plasma ctCO2, and the value for the solubility of CO2 in plasma at 37C (S?=?0.0307?{mmol/L}/mmHg) whereby: pK1??=?(pHb?+?0.01)?log10({ctCO2-S???pCO2}/{S???pCO2}), with the term (pHb?+?0.01) representing the pH in plasma. The calculated value for pK1? was standardized to pHb?=?7.40 using the Severinghaus equation such that dpK1?/dpH?=??0.044. Non-parametric statistical procedures were used to determine the median value and 95% confidence interval (CI) for pK1?. Results The median value for pK1? at pHb?=?7.40 was 6.097, and the 95% CI for pK1? was 6.063?6.123. Conclusions The 95% CI for pK1? in equine plasma from trained Standardbreds is narrow and includes the assumed fixed value of 6.095. Our findings support the use of blood gas and pH analysis to calculate plasma ctCO2 in order to detect the pre-race administration of alkalinizing agents in horses.

AB  - Introduction Differentiating left ventricular (LV) dilatation caused by aortic regurgitation (AR) from athletic eccentric LV hypertrophy can be challenging. In human medicine, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and 2D speckle tracking (2DST) are used to distinguish ?athlete's heart? from pathological conditions. Methods 40 healthy horses (group 1) were compared to 13 horses with moderate AR (group 2) and 11 horses with severe AR (group 3), all with an end diastolic LV internal diameter (LVIDd) within maximal reference limits (≤14.2?cm). Fractional shortening (FS) was measured from a short-axis M-mode at chordal level. Peak TDI velocities during systole (S), early (E) and late (A) diastole were measured in the LV free wall (LVFW) and interventricular septum (IVS). Global longitudinal strain was measured by 2DST. Groups were compared by a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Results The study included Warmbloods (n?=?52), trotters (n?=?9) and Thoroughbreds (n?=?3), used for jumping, dressage, racing and eventing. Group 2 (15?±?5 years; P<0.001) and 3 (20?±?4 years; P<0.001) were older than group 1 (8?±?4 years). LVIDd in group 3 (13.1?±?0.7 cm) was higher compared to group 1 (11.5?±?0.8?cm; P<0.001) and 2 (12.0?±?0.8?cm; P?=?0.003) but FS was not different. Peak S in IVS was higher in group 2 (6.6?±?1.5?cm/s; P?=?0.001) and 3 (9.0?±?1.7?cm/s; P<0.001) compared to group 1 (4.4?±?1.8?cm/s), indicating hyperkinetic septal motion. Peak E in LVFW was lower in group 2 (18.6?±?5.2?cm/s;P?=?0.001) and 3 (19.3?±?3.9?cm/s; P?=?0.006) compared to group 1 (24.4?±?4.6?cm/s), indicating decreased early filling velocity. Longitudinal strain was not different between groups. Conclusions TDI shows potential for differentiating AR-induced LV remodeling from athletic eccentric hypertrophy in horses.

AB  - Introduction Measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) is the gold standard for assessing aerobic capacity, but in horses requires use of stationary equipment and a high-speed treadmill. Study objectives were to evaluate a portable system designed to measure VO2 in a field setting and to describe these measurements in a cohort of untrained Thoroughbreds. Methods Ventilatory parameters and VO2 were measured in 41 untrained Thoroughbreds (16 colts, 25 fillies, 19.8?±?1.4 months) using an ergospirometry and oximetry mask with customized software validated for horses galloping on a treadmill with an open-circuit flow-through gas collection system. Horses were instrumented with a GPS-HR monitor, light-weight mask and data-capture equipment. Data was collected as horses travelled riderless up a 2% inclined woodchip track. Pre- and 5 minute post-exercise plasma lactate ([La5]), HRpeak, maximal velocity (Vmax) and exercise distance were recorded and analysed by unpaired t-test and Pearson's correlation (P ≤ 0.05). Results All horses tolerated the mask and saddle pad. Exercise distance was 1700.5?±?33.4?m, Vmax 15.0?±?1.4?m/s, HRpeak 221.2?±?9.6?bpm and [La5] 22.7?±?5.5?mmol/l. Average VO2peak, based on 6 breaths, was 117.7?±?24.1?ml/kg/min, breathing frequency 125.8?±?7.1?bpm, inspiratory volume 13.2?±?1.7?L, expiratory volume 13.4?±?1.9?L and minute ventilation 1669.3?±?193.3?L/min. VO2peak was not significantly different between colts (112.2?±?27.7?ml/kg/min) and fillies (121.4?±?21.3?ml/kg/min). There were no correlations between VO2peak and other measured parameters. There was a positive linear correlation between VO2peak and HRpeak (P?=?0.046, R2?=?0.16). Conclusions VO2peak values were similar to published reports for yearling Thoroughbreds. The high exercise intensity and linear relationship between VO2peak and HRpeak provides confidence in the system for field studies of aerobic capacity in untrained, unridden horses.

AB  - Introduction In chuckwagon racing, dubbed the ?half-mile of hell?, teams often race multiple consecutive days. Horses are in peak condition, however rare cases of sudden death attributed to cardiovascular failure occur. There are concerns regarding cumulative racing and its impact on the risk of sudden death. The objective was to determine if cumulative exercise affects integrity of the myocardium, assessed by high-sensitivity troponin-T (cTnT), and if the presence of arrhythmias during race or recovery affects plasma cTnT concentrations. Methods Heart rate and electrical activity were recorded on 148 horses (9?±?2.7 years) during racing days 1 and 2. 750 plasma samples were analysed (374 pre-exercise, 376 post-exercise) comparing cTnT before and after activity (paired t-test). Associations between consecutive racing days, age and cTnT were analysed (ANOVA, Pearson Correlation). The relationship between arrhythmias and cTnT was also examined. Results cTnT increased significantly with exercise (pre: 4.52?ng/L?±?0.17, post: 5.20?ng/L?±?0.23, P<0.001). However cTnt was not affected by cumulative exercise. A correlation between age and cTnT was found. 4235 arrhythmic events were recorded. No association existed between cTnT (post-exercise) and the presence of arrhythmias during exercise and recovery. Conclusions This is the first study examining the effect of exercise on high-sensitivity cTnT in horses and first large-scale study on chuckwagon horses. Racing increases cTnT, however values remain low, suggesting myocardial damage of little clinical significance. Chuckwagon horses have long careers therefore age and cTnT could be further examined. cTnT was not affected by the presence of arrhythmias during exercise, indicating chuckwagon racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction Heart rate (HR) and blood lactate (LAC) are biomarkers whose responses to exercise are related to physical fitness. This study evaluated the cost of transport (CT) by assessing the cardiovascular and metabolic efficiency of jumping horses using an incremental jumping test. Methods Sixteen Brazilian Sport horses of two fitness levels were used: high-level jumpers (HL, n?=?8) and low-level jumpers (LL, n?=?8). Tests were performed in a sandy jumping arena at a mean velocity of 18?km/h; the tests were distributed into three steps of 4?laps of 74?m, each with 10 obstacles. Each stage consisted of simple obstacles that were 0.40, 0.60 and 0.80?m high. The costs of transport were determined as (HRstep-HRrest/speed) and (LACstep-LACrest/speed). During intervals between each stage, blood samples were drawn to determine LAC (mmol/L). Student's t-test was used for the unpaired samples (P<0.05). Results There was no difference in the stage 0.40?m for HR. There were differences in the HL and LL groups, respectively, in the HR related to the effort in the obstacle series 0.60?m [1.7?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) and 2.0?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) (P?=?0.02)]; 0.80?m [1.5?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h) and 1.7?±?0.2?bpm/(km/h); (P?=?0.04)], and in the LAC for the 0.40?m obstacle [0.05?±?0.04?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.10?±?0.03?mmol/L/(km/h); P?=?0.04]; 0.60?m [0.07?±?0.06?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.14?±?0.03?mmol/L/(km/h); (P?=?0.006)] and 0.80?m [0.11?±?0.04?mmol/L/(km/h) and 0.19?±?0.05?mmol/L/(km/h); P?=?0.009]. Conclusions The CT differentiated horses of high and low level jumping fitness. The HR method (rather than LAC) is particularly useful because it is simple, inexpensive and accessible to trainers and veterinarians.

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a dominant, missense mutation in the equine glycogen synthase gene (GYS1) that increases the enzyme's activity. The amino acid sequence surrounding the PSSM1 mutation is highly conserved amongst species from yeast to horses suggesting that this region plays an important role, but its functional significance has yet to be determined. Methods Computer modelling can predict three dimensional (3D) protein structures using related proteins as templates. Yeast glycogen synthase (GS) has high sequence homology (73%) to the equine enzyme and since the yeast enzyme's structure has been solved, we hypothesised that in silico modelling based on the yeast protein using MODELLER and SwissPDBViewer software would predict the enzyme's structure and explain the mutant enzyme's increased activity. Results Homology-modelling revealed that, like the yeast enzyme, equine GS likely forms a tetramer surrounding a catalytic cleft and undergoes large structural rearrangements upon G6P binding to highly-conserved binding sites. The enzyme's glycogen binding sites are located on the extremities of the enzyme and are also conserved in the equine protein. The PSSM1 mutation lay close to the G6P binding site, but did not confer any clear structural rearrangement on the protein's 3D configuration. The mutation was distant from the known phosphorylation sites and the glycogen binding sites. Conclusions The close proximity of the mutation to the G6P binding site suggests that it might influence substrate interaction or allosteric regulation. Further studies evaluating G6P ligand binding and enzyme activation are warranted and might best be made following purification of the mutant and wild type proteins.

AB  - Introduction Myopathy associated with a gain-of- function mutation in the GYS1 gene is known in Quarter Horses and cold blood breeds. The mutation occurred between the collapse of the Roman Empire (500 AD) and the upsurge of Carolinian Reign (800 AD). The aim of this review is to reconstruct the development of the cold blood (brachimorph) breeds in Europe using existing literature. Methods Literature review Results Although archaeological evidence indicates the existence of a mesomorph horse (Cob) type in the early Iron Age, real cold blood breeding only started after 1750. The demand for draught power in the early Industrial Revolution resulted in a large population of cold bloods from 1850 onwards. In Roman times, the huge ugly horses from Thrace were known as ?easy keepers? and Ardennes might have been the first land races carrying the GYS1 mutation. Hunnish horses might have contributed to the prototype cold bloods as well. With mtDNA, Y-chromosome polymorphism, satellite markers and SNP genotyping some indication from where ancestors of particular breeds originate was obtained. Most phylogenetic trees place cold blood breeds, including Fell ponies, Haflinger and Friesian in a clearly different cluster than ponies, saddle horses and Thoroughbreds. Fjords and Mongolian horses are in neighbouring clusters. Since the last 200 years, genetic bottlenecks and the popular sire phenomenon could have caused high GYS1?H allele frequencies in many continental cold blood breeds. Conclusions Cold blood breeds and the GYS1 mutation likely trace back to the mesomorph tough, easily satisfied horse types from Eastern Europe and central Asia.

AB  - Introduction Turning is commonly used as a diagnostic aid in lameness examinations. Systematic movement deviations compared to locomotion in a straight line are noted across horses with variation at an individual level. This study aimed to investigate whether deviations from the expected body lean angle, predicted from the ratio of gravitational and centripetal accelerations, are consistent between trot and canter. It was hypothesized that, independent of gait, there would be agreement between the observed and predicted angle with variations on an individual horse level. Methods A GPS-aided inertial measurement unit was attached over the sacrum in twenty horses and quantified body lean angle, speed and circle radius in trot and canter on left and right rein. Predicted body lean angle was calculated from speed and circle radius and was compared to the observed body lean (?obs,pred). A generalized linear model was implemented to study the effect of horse, lungeing direction and gait. Results Mean speed and circle radius were 3.3?m/s and 4.9?m in trot and 4.5?m/s and 5.7?m in canter. On average ?obs,pred was ?1.1°in trot and ?0.8°in canter and was found to be significantly different between horses (P<0.0001) and between lungeing directions (P<0.0001) but not between gaits (P?=?0.14). Interactions between horse and direction (P<0.0001) and horse and gait (P?=?0.011) were also found to be significant. Conclusions Horses leaned marginally less into the circle than predicted. However, showing significant differences in body lean angle between horses and turn directions but not between gaits, we provide evidence for horse specific adaptations. Whether these are related to laterality or to underlying subclinical lameness needs to be further investigated. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

AB  - Introduction The diagonal limb support pattern at trot provides pitch and roll stability, controlled by regulating pitching moments about the centre of mass (COM). Correct COM location is critical in calculation of pitching moments, as COM location influences the contribution of loading in the fore and hindlimbs. This study examined the effect of COM location on pitching moments in trotting horses and explored how COM location could influence balance. Methods Kinematic (120?Hz) and GRF (4 force plates, 960?Hz) data were collected at trot from three strides of eight horses overground. The position of the COM was determined from the weighted summation of the segmental COMs from previously determined inertial data of Warmblood horses. The COM of the standing model was manipulated cranially and caudally to test the effects of pitching moments during trotting. Pitching moments were calculated for each manipulation of the model and their relationship determined using reduced major axis regression. Results Over the stride, the moments must sum to zero to prevent accumulation of rotational motion. This was found when the weight on the forelimbs in standing was 58.7%?±?3% (mean?±?95% C.I.). With this weight distribution moments were typically nose-up changing to nose-down at around 35% of stance, and then reversing again to nose-up in late stance. Conclusions Divergence of the COM from the COP creating a vertical force moment arm prior to midstance may aid in accelerating the COM about the hind foot, thereby passively assisting hindlimb propulsion. Lower forelimb weighting resulted in mean nose-up moments. Higher forelimb weighting resulted in mean nose-down moments. Both would cause an accumulation of pitching motion.

AB  - Introduction Track conditions in Thoroughbred racing significantly impact performance and injury. However, surface effects on limb biomechanics at racing speeds are poorly understood. Methods A racing shoe was modified to contain inertial transducers and a strain gauge to provide motion kinematics and a measure of hoof/surface interaction load. A two-phase non-linear surface reaction model was defined to represent the hoof deceleration phase, and the hoof penetration phase where the surface reaction force was represented by a quartic stiffness profile and a fixed damping term. Model parameters were determined using an ?output error? iteration method for 25 strides at medium gallop. Parameters were compared using a standard t-test. Results The sand track had a significantly greater (P<0.0001) maximum penetration of 61?±?10?mm (mean?±?SD), than the grass track (41?±?0.5?mm). Both stiffness parameters were significantly different between the two tracks (P<0.0001), but damping parameters did not differ significantly. Hoof impact at high speed involved decelerations of over 100 ?g? occurring within milliseconds. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a surface reaction model using data acquired from an instrumented horseshoe, distinguished between surface reaction profiles of a sand track and a grass track, as a step towards improving track rating methods. A further challenge will be to develop independent checks on instrument calibrations. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction The impact of cervical pathology on performance is of great importance to the equine industry. Accurate diagnosis of cervical disease with imaging modalities, including CT and MRI, requires thorough appreciation of normal cervical anatomy. The objectives of this study were to describe in detail the 3-dimensional anatomy of the equine cervical spine by comparing anatomical sections with corresponding MR and contrast-enhanced CT images in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and to determine the ability of MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging to visualize anatomical structures in the cervical spine. Methods Three cervical spines of young adults (3?8 years), were collected immediately after humane euthanasia. The spine was stabilized on a frame in a natural flexed position with an angle of 20-degrees. MR and contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed within 6 hours after euthanasia. Anatomical sections of 1?cm were made in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse plane and compared with corresponding CT and MR images. The intervertebral disk thickness, facet joint angle, amount of cerebrospinal fluid and amount of synovial fluid within each facet joint were quantified. Results The anatomical locations of clinically important structures including the facet joints, spinal cord, cervical nerve roots and intervertebral disks were reliably identified in the anatomical sections and their corresponding MR images. Contrast-enhanced CT images depicted all osseous borders; MR images were superior for soft tissue structures. Conclusions This study enhances the understanding of normal cervical spine anatomy and the diagnostic usefulness of cervical MRI and contrast-enhanced CT in the horse.
