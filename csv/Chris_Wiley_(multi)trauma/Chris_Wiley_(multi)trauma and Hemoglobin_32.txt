AB  - Objectives Two large multicenter randomised trials were performed in France to assess whether systematic screening with an artery uteroplacental Doppler (AUD) in low-risk pregnant women followed by the prescription of low-dose aspirin in cases with abnormal results reduced the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and of preeclampsia. Study design and population The first trial ?Seine Saint-Denis? (SSD) trial included 3317 low-risk pregnant women (multi and primigravidae) in 17 French maternity Hospitals and the second ?Erasme? trial included 1869 primigravidae in 12 centres. In the Doppler group, the AUD was performed between 20 and 24?weeks, and women with abnormal results received 100?mg of aspirin daily until the 35th week. Results In the Doppler group, 232 patients (15.7%) had an abnormal result in the SSD trial and 20% in the ERASME trial. The predictive value of the AUD was comparable to that reported in the studies of low-risk populations, but with a low sensitivity. Finally, IUGR, whether defined by the third or tenth percentile, and preeclampsia did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in both trials. Conclusions There is no proof justifying the recommendation of a systematic AUD in a low-risk population, even if abnormal results are followed by aspirin treatment and increase in prenatal surveillance. Future studies must assess predictive tests that can be performed early in pregnancy and can identify populations at very high risk of preeclampsia and IUGR. Only when all of these conditions are fulfilled can aspirin prove its efficacy.

AB  - Abstract Vaginal cavernous hemangioma is a considerably rare condition during pregnancy. There has only been one reported case to date. A multiparous, 24-year-old woman in the 32nd week of pregnancy was admitted with a mass prolapsed from the vagina, which had suddenly increased in size over the previous few days. A necrotic mass obstructing the vaginal canal and originating from the posterior wall was observed in a pelvic physical examination and carefully excised. The patient had contractions after the intervention and was administered tocolytic treatment with bed-rest and fluids. Her obstetric clinical status was stable after treatment and she gave birth without complication at 37 weeks and 5 days from the vaginal canal. The main approach to these very rare tumors of pregnancy, especially in the presence of necrosis, infection and/or obstruction, should be excision. But the potential for increased blood loss that may occur due to the hypervascular structure of the tumor should be taken into account.

AB  - Key points Mechano-gated two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels are expressed in the human bladder, with TREK-1 being the predominant functional subunit. TREK-1 channels in bladder smooth muscle are activated by membrane stretch and negative pressure applied to the patch pipette. Inhibition of TREK-1 channels in the human detrusor significantly delays relaxation of bladder smooth muscle and triggers small-amplitude spontaneous contractions in response to stretch. Application of negative pressure to cell-attached patches (?20 mmHg) causes a 19-fold increase in the open probability (NPo) of human TREK-1 channels. l-Methionine (1 mm) dramatically decreases the NPo of TREK-1 channels from 0.045 ± 0.003 to 0.008 ± 0.001 (n = 8, P ≤ 0.01). Addition of arachidonic acid (10 ?m) increases the open probability of methionine-inhibited unitary currents up to 0.43 ± 0.05 at 0 mV (n = 9, P ≤ 0.05). TREK-1 channels may serve as a promising pharmacological target for bladder dysfunction in humans. Abstract The mechanisms of mechanosensitivity underlying the response of the human bladder to stretch are poorly understood. Animal data suggest that stretch-activated two-pore-domain (K2P) K+ channels play a critical role in bladder relaxation during the filling phase. The objective of this study was to characterize the expression and function of stretch-activated K2P channels in the human bladder and to clarify their physiological role in bladder mechanosensitivity. Gene and protein analysis of the K2P channels TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK in the human bladder revealed that TREK-1 is the predominantly expressed member of the mechano-gated subfamily of K2P channels. Immunohistochemical labelling of bladder wall identified higher levels of expression of TREK-1 in detrusor smooth muscle cells in comparison to bladder mucosa. Functional characterization and biophysical properties of the predominantly expressed member of the K2P family, the TREK-1 channel, were evaluated by in vitro organ bath studies and the patch-clamp technique. Electrophysiological recordings from single smooth muscle cells confirmed direct activation of TREK-1 channels by mechanical stretch and negative pressure applied to the cell membrane. Inhibition of TREK-1 channels in the human detrusor significantly delayed relaxation of the stretched bladder smooth muscle strips and triggered small-amplitude spontaneous contractions. Application of negative pressure to cell-attached patches (?20 mmHg) caused a 19-fold increase in the open probability (NPo) of human TREK-1 channels. l-Methionine (1 mm), a specific TREK-1 inhibitor, dramatically decreased the NPo of TREK-1 channels from 0.045 ± 0.003 to 0.008 ± 0.001 (n = 8, P ≤ 0.01). Subsequent addition of arachidonic acid (10 ?m), a channel opener, increased the open probability of methionine-inhibited unitary currents up to 0.43 ± 0.05 at 0 mV (n = 9, P ≤ 0.05). The results of our study provide direct evidence that the response of the human detrusor to mechanical stretch is regulated by activation of mechano-gated TREK-1 channels. Impaired mechanosensation and mechanotransduction associated with the changes in stretch-activated K2P channels may underlie myogenic bladder dysfunction in humans.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Uterus transplantation has recently proved that infertility in women with uterine factor infertility can be cured. It is still an experimental procedure with numerous critical details remaining to be established, including tolerance to warm and cold ischemic insults. In preparation for human uterus transplantation trials, most teams use the sheep as a model system for research and team training, since the vasculature and the uterus is of similar size as in the human. We, therefore, aimed to develop an ex vivo sheep uterus reperfusion platform that mimics the reperfusion situation so that initial assessments and comparisons can be performed without the need for costly and labor-intensive in vivo transplantation experiments. Material and methods Isolated sheep uteri were perfused with the preservation solution IGL-1 and were then exposed to cold ischemia for either 4 (n = 6) or 48 hours (n = 7). Uteri were then reperfused for 48 hours under normothermic conditions with an oxygenated recirculating perfusate containing growth factors and synthetic oxygen carriers. Histological and biochemical analysis of the perfusate was conducted to assess reperfusion injury. Results Quantification of cell density indicated no significant edema in the myometrium or in the endometrium of uteri exposed to 4 hours cold ischemia and then a normothermic ex vivo reperfusion for 48 hours. Only the outer serosa layer and the inner columnar luminal epithelial cells were affected by the reperfusion. However, a much faster and severe reperfusion damage of all uterine layers were evident during the reperfusion experiment following 48 hours of cold ischemia. This was indicated by major accumulation of extracellular fluid, presence of apoptotic-labeled glandular epithelial layer and vascular endothelium. A significant accumulation of lactate was measured in the perfusate with a subsequent decrease in pH. Conclusions We developed a novel ex vivo sheep uterus model for prolonged perfusion. This model proved to be able to distinguish reperfusion injury-related differences associated to organ preservation. The experimental setup is a platform that can be used to conduct further studies on uterine ischemia- and reperfusion injury that may lead to improved human uterus transplantation protocols.

AB  - BACKGROUND Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) culls pathogenic T lymphocytes, be these the clones of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or mediators of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT-GVHD). Whether or not ECP may have an effect in the rarer instances of solid organ transplantation?associated GVHD (SOT-GVHD) is unclear. Mortality rates in SOT-GVHD rival those of transfusion-associated GVHD, with fatalities preceded by pancytopenia and peripheral blood chimerism (PBC) levels exceeding 20%. ECP has been described in two SOT-GVHD cases to date, with one surviving. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Clinicolaboratory features (including HLA relationships) in a case of multivisceral transplantation were reviewed from the time of surgery to the onset and progression of SOT-GVHD. ECP, which was introduced as a less immunosuppressive and more selective intervention, was assessed for its effect on serial PBC (as measured by short-tandem-repeat analysis) and clinical outcome. RESULTS Multivisceral SOT-GVHD manifested with erythroderma, neutropenic sepsis, and PBC increasing from 6% on Posttransplant Day (PTD) 38 to 78% by PTD 60 (at a doubling time of 6 days despite corticosteroids). ECP was administered on PTDs 62 and 67 and was associated with the first evidence of PBC decay to 67% on PTD 69. Death nevertheless ensued on the last day of salvage antithymocyte globulin (PTDs 69-73) despite further PBC reduction to 41%. CONCLUSION Further study is needed to determine if the sooner or more frequent application of ECP might attenuate the high case fatality rates of SOT-GVHD.

AB  - This review discusses the major contributors to the subtle magnetic properties of brain tissue and how they affect MRI contrast. With the increased availability of high-field scanners, the use of magnetic susceptibility contrast for the study of human brain anatomy and function has increased dramatically. This has not only led to novel applications, but has also improved our understanding of the complex relationship between MRI contrast and magnetic susceptibility. Chief contributors to the magnetic susceptibility of brain tissue have been found to include myelin as well as iron. In the brain, iron exists in various forms with diverse biological roles, many of which are now only starting to be uncovered. An interesting aspect of magnetic susceptibility contrast is its sensitivity to the microscopic distribution of iron and myelin, which provides opportunities to extract information at spatial scales well below MRI resolution. For example, in white matter, the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons can provide tissue contrast that is dependent on the axonal orientation and reflects the relative size of intra- and extra-axonal water compartments. The extraction of such ultrastructural information, together with quantitative information about iron and myelin concentrations, is an active area of research geared towards the characterization of brain structure and function, and their alteration in disease.

AB  - SUMMARY Transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) continues to be an important therapy for treatment of anemia in intensive care settings. The critically ill are a heterogeneous population affected by a variety of pathophysiological processes and are, therefore, predisposed to the ? adverse outcomes of anemia. As such, the risks imposed on this population when transfusion therapy is prescribed are of great interest. Over the past decade there has been a shift in transfusion practice with guidelines being developed that promote more conservative and safer use of blood. The Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial clearly established the safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy, thereby suggesting that physicians could easily minimize exposure to allogeneic RBCs by lowering their transfusion threshold. Further research will add to the generalizability of this study as well as explore the possible mechanism to explain why red cell transfusions did not improve outcomes in the critically ill.

AB  - Abstract The predilection site of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is in the basal ganglia, which is rich in white matter (WM) fiber bundles, such as cerebrospinal tract in the internal capsule. ICH induced damage to this area can easily lead to severe neurological dysfunction and affects the prognosis and quality of life of patients. At present, the pathophysiological mechanisms of white matter injury (WMI) after ICH have attracted researchers' attention, but studies on the repair and recovery mechanisms and therapy strategies remain rare. In this review, we mainly summarized the WM recovery and treatment strategies after ICH by updating the WMI-related content by reviewing the latest researches and proposing the bottleneck of the current research.

AB  - Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MR technique that depicts and quantifies magnetic susceptibility sources. Mapping iron, the dominant susceptibility source in the brain, has many important clinical applications. Herein, we review QSM applications in the diagnosis, medical management, and surgical treatment of disease. To assist in early disease diagnosis, QSM can identify elevated iron levels in the motor cortex of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, in the globus pallidus, putamen, and caudate of Huntington's disease patients, and in the basal ganglia of Wilson's disease patients. Additionally, QSM can distinguish between hemorrhage and calcification, which could prove useful in tumor subclassification, and can measure microbleeds in traumatic brain injury patients. In guiding medical management, QSM can be used to monitor iron chelation therapy in PD patients, to monitor smoldering inflammation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions after the blood?brain barrier (BBB) seals, to monitor active inflammation of MS lesions before the BBB seals without using gadolinium, and to monitor hematoma volume in intracerebral hemorrhage. QSM can also guide neurosurgical treatment. Neurosurgeons require accurate depiction of the subthalamic nucleus, a tiny deep gray matter nucleus, prior to inserting deep brain stimulation electrodes into the brains of PD patients. QSM is arguably the best imaging tool for depiction of the subthalamic nucleus. Finally, we discuss future directions, including bone QSM, cardiac QSM, and using QSM to map cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Key points Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a maladaptation syndrome encountered at high altitude (HA) characterised by severe hypoxaemia that carries a higher risk of stroke and migraine and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We examined if exaggerated oxidative-inflammatory-nitrosative stress (OXINOS) and corresponding decrease in vascular nitric oxide bioavailability in patients with CMS (CMS+) is associated with impaired cerebrovascular function and adverse neurological outcome. Systemic OXINOS was markedly elevated in CMS+ compared to healthy HA (CMS?) and low-altitude controls. OXINOS was associated with blunted cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, impaired cognition and, in CMS+, symptoms of depression. These findings are the first to suggest that a physiological continuum exists for hypoxaemia-induced systemic OXINOS in HA dwellers that when excessive is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and depression, helping identify those in need of more specialist neurological assessment and targeted support. Abstract Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a maladaptation syndrome encountered at high altitude (HA) characterised by severe hypoxaemia that carries a higher risk of stroke and migraine and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The present cross-sectional study examined to what extent exaggerated systemic oxidative-inflammatory-nitrosative stress (OXINOS), defined by an increase in free radical formation and corresponding decrease in vascular nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, is associated with impaired cerebrovascular function, accelerated cognitive decline and depression in CMS. Venous blood was obtained from healthy male lowlanders (80 m, n = 17), and age- and gender-matched HA dwellers born and bred in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m) with (CMS+, n = 23) and without (CMS?, n = 14) CMS. We sampled blood for oxidative (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, HPLC), nitrosative (ozone-based chemiluminescence) and inflammatory (fluorescence) biomarkers. We employed transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reactivity. We utilised psychometric tests and validated questionnaires to assess cognition and depression. Highlanders exhibited elevated systemic OXINOS (P < 0.05 vs. lowlanders) that was especially exaggerated in the more hypoxaemic CMS+ patients (P < 0.05 vs. CMS?). OXINOS was associated with blunted cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, impaired cognition and, in CMS+, symptoms of depression. Collectively, these findings are the first to suggest that a physiological continuum exists for hypoxaemia-induced OXINOS in HA dwellers that when excessive is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and depression, helping identify those in need of specialist neurological assessment and support.
