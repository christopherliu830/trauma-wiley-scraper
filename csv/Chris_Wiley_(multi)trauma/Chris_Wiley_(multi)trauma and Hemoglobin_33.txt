AB  - Abstract Epidemiological studies associate post-menopausal estrogen use with a reduction in risk of Alzheimer's disease, a reduction in risk of Parkinson's disease, and death from stroke. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogens have been well described and may contribute to these clinical effects. Estrogen-mediated neuroprotection has been described in several neuronal culture model systems with toxicities including serum-deprivation, ?-amyloid-induced toxicity, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. In animal models, estrogens have been shown to attenuate neuronal death in rodent models of cerebral ischemia, traumatic injury, and Parkinson's disease. Although estrogens are known to exert several direct effects on neurons, the cellular mechanisms behind the neuroprotective efficacy of the steroid are only beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we summarize the data supporting a neuroprotective role for estrogens in both culture and animal models and discuss neuronal effects of estrogens that may contribute to the neuroprotective effects. These effects include activation of the nuclear estrogen receptor, altered expression of bcl-2 and related proteins, activation of the mitogen activated kinase pathway, activation of cAMP signal transduction pathways, modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis, and direct antioxidant activity.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - A 40-year-old smoker complained of pain, deep and burning in character, constant, and persistent, associated with paresthesias in his feet for a period of two years. Furthermore, he developed aching non-traumatic foot ulcers. There was no history of diabetes and systemic illness. Neurological examination revealed loss of all modalities of sensation and hyperhidrosis in the limbs with a prominent distal-to-proximal gradient. The following laboratory tests were normal: blood count; test for liver, kidney, and thyroid function; cryoglobulins; anti-HCV antibodies and HIV. Neurophysiological investigation revealed an axonal neuropathy with a distal-to-proximal distribution in the limbs. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe chronic axonal neuropathy. Prominent thickening of endoneurial microvessel endothelial cells was present with narrowing of lumen. Congo Red staining was negative. He initiated treatment with alprostadil alfa-ciclodestrina and stopped smoking. The patient reported prompt improvement of neurologic symptoms as well as skin abnormalities few months after the begin of therapy. Ischemic neuropathy in which nerve damage occurs in the more distal portion of the limbs has been reported. In our patient, clinical presentation, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of a Lower Extremity Ischemic Neuropathy probably triggered by smoke.

AB  - Summary People in today's society get tattoos to decorate their bodies, to identify with particular groups or gangs, or to camouflage areas such as birthmarks or other tattoos. Tattoos may be divided into five categories: professional, amateur, cosmetic, traumatic, and medical. Dermabrasion, thermal destruction and cryotherapy are the mechanisms used to remove tattoo. Lasers remove tattoos by altering the optic properties of their pigments. Early laser tattoo removal methods included the argon laser and the carbon dioxide laser, both of which carried significant deficiencies and side effects. More recent discoveries involving the use of quality-switched lasers have allowed the production of nanosecond lasers, using high-powered pulses with very short duration, which decrease the incidence of thermal damage to surrounding skin layers. The most common complications of laser tattoo removal include textural changes in the overlying epidermis, scarring, pruritus, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, and allergic reactions.

Molecular diagnosis of this gene is a useful approach for early diagnosis and timely HSCT due to deleterious consequences.

AB  - Anticipated shortages in donated blood supply have prompted investigation of alternative approaches for in vitro production of red blood cells (RBCs), such as expansion of conditional immortalization erythroid progenitors. However, there is a bioprocessing challenge wherein factors promoting maximal cell expansion and growth-limiting inhibitory factors are yet to be investigated. The authors use an erythroblast cell line (ImEry) derived from immortalizing CD71+CD235a+ erythroblast from adult peripheral blood for optimization of expansion culture conditions. Design of experiments (DOE) is used in media formulation to explore relationships and interactive effects between factors which affect cell expansion. Our in-house optimized medium formulation produced significantly higher cell densities (3.62?±?0.055)???106?cells?mL?1, n?=?3) compared to commercial formulations (2.07?±?0.055)???106?cells?mL?1, n?=?3; at 209?h culture). Culture media costs per unit of blood is shown to have a 2.96?3.09 times cost reduction. As a proof of principle for scale up, ImEry are expanded in a half-liter stirred-bioreactor under controlled settings. Growth characteristics, metabolic, and molecular profile of the cells are evaluated. ImEry has identical O2 binding capacity to adult erythroblasts. Amino acid supplementation results in further yield improvements. The study serves as a first step for scaling up erythroblast expansion in controlled bioreactors.
