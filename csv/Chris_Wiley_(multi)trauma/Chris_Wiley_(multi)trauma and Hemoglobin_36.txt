AB  - Biomarker analysis and proteomic discovery in pediatric sickle cell disease has the potential to lead to important discoveries and improve care. The aim of this review article is to describe proteomic and biomarker articles involving neurological and developmental complications in this population. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant research publications. Articles were selected for children under the age of 21 years with the most common subtypes of sickle cell disease. Included articles focused on growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor), intra and extracellular brain proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (interleukin-1?, l-selectin, thrombospondin-1, erythrocyte, and platelet-derived microparticles). Positive findings include increases in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor and platelet-derived growth factor with elevated transcranial Dopplers velocities, increases in platelet-derived growth factor isoform AA with overt stroke, and increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein with acute brain injury. These promising potential neuro-biomarkers provide insight into pathophysiologic processes and clinical events, but their clinical utility is yet to be established. Additional proteomics research is needed, including broad-based proteomic discovery of plasma constituents and blood cell proteins, as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid components, before, during and after neurological and developmental complications.

AB  - Summary In current clinical, and specifically surgical practice, very few randomized clinical trials examining transfusion triggers are found. In pediatric surgery patients, even less information is understood about transfusion. In pediatric patients, severe anemia is seen in prematurity and in several disease processes. Against this background, this chapter provides an overview of special considerations relevant to transfusions in the pediatric population and describes the application of strategies to curtail need for transfusions in children undergoing surgery. Blood loss is the most frequent indication for transfusion and hence strategies to limit blood loss are bound to significantly impact transfusion requirements. Following the advent of blood component fractionation, the use of cellular plasma, platelets or plasma coagulation factors such as cryoprecipitate to facilitate clotting has been widely accepted. Ongoing investigations at furthering our knowledge of the hematopoietic machinery and coagulation cascades strengthen efforts aimed at solidifying the practice of transfusion management in children.

AB  - Abstract Painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) are the hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD); however, many patients experience frequent daily pain that does not follow the pattern of typical VOCs. This pain of variable severity, also referred as persistent pain in the SCD literature, contributes to significant morbidity and poor quality of life and often fails to respond adequately to standard SCD therapies. In this article, we briefly describe types of pain encountered in SCD with a special emphasis on persistent pain. We discuss altered pain processing as a potential contributing mechanism, which may lead to development and maintenance of persistent pain. We describe the advances in the non-SCD pain field that may help improve the understanding of SCD pain. We highlight the need for further investigation in this area because some of these patients with persistent pain may benefit from receiving adjuvant mechanism-based therapies used successfully in other non-SCD chronic pain conditions.

AB  - Summary Red blood cell transfusion is commonly administered in hospitalized patients. Important clinical trials have been published in recent years that provide new evidence to guide transfusion decisions. Most of the trials suggest that a restrictive transfusion strategy of 7 to 8 g/dL is as safe as a liberal transfusion strategy of 9 to 10 g/dL. Guidelines recommend use of restrictive transfusion strategy in most patients. Further research is needed to evaluate the optimal transfusion threshold in patients with acute coronary syndrome, neurological disorders, acute and chronic hematological disorders and others.

AB  - Abstract Background Approximately 10?20% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) develop stroke, but few consistent national estimates of the stroke burden for children with SCD exist. The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of diagnosed stroke among African-American pediatric discharges with and without SCD. Procedure Records for African-Americans aged 1?18 years in the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) 1997?2012 with ≥1 ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for stroke were included. Data were weighted to provide national estimates. A total of 2,994 stroke cases among African-American children were identified. Diagnoses co-existing with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were frequency ranked separately. Results From 1997 through 2012, SCD was present in 24% of stroke discharges, with 89% being ischemic stroke. For hospital discharges of African-American children, SCD is the highest co-existing risk factor for ischemic stroke (29%). Stroke in children with SCD occurred predominantly in children aged 5?9 years, older than previously reported. The trend of stroke discharges significantly decreased for children with SCD from 1997 to 2012 for children aged 10?14 years. Conclusions SCD is a leading risk factor to pediatric stroke in African-American children. Reducing the number of strokes among children with SCD would have a significant impact on the rate of strokes among African-American children. Preventative intervention may be modifying initial age of presentation of stroke in children with SCD. Pediatr Blood Cancer ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Quantum dot (QD) contrast-enhanced molecular imaging has potential for early cancer detection and image guided treatment, but there is a lack of quantitative image contrast data to determine optimum QD administered doses, affecting the feasibility, risk and cost of such procedures, especially in vivo. Vascular fluorescence contrast-enhanced imaging is performed on nude mice bearing dorsal skinfold window chambers, injected with 4 different QD solutions emitting in the visible and near infrared. Linear relationships are observed among the vascular contrast, injected contrast agent volume, and QD concentration in blood. Due primarily to differential light absorption by blood, the vasculature is optimally visualized when exciting in the 435?480 nm region in 81% of the cases (89 out of 110 regions of interest in 22 window chambers). The threshold dose, defined here as the quantity of injected nanoparticles required to yield a vascular target-to-autofluorescence ratio of 2, varies from 10.6 to 0.15 pmol g?1 depending on the QD emission wavelength. The wavelength optimization maximum and broadband gain, defined as the ratio of threshold doses estimated for optimal and suboptimal (worst wavelength or broadband) spectral illumination, has average values of 4.5 and 1.9, respectively. This study demonstrates, for the first time, optimized QD imaging in vivo. It also proposes and validates a theoretical framework for QD dose estimation and quantifies the effects of blood absorption, QD emission wavelength, and vessel diameter relative to the threshold dose.

AB  - Background. To evaluate the diagnostic methods and to elucidate the etiology of intrauterine fetal death. Material and methods. A prospective study was conducted on all intrauterine fetal deaths occurring in Stockholm County in 1998?99. During a 24-month period, 188 cases of intrauterine fetal death with gestational ages of ≥ 22?weeks were investigated in accordance with structured test protocol. All information from antenatal and delivery records as well as all test results were entered in to an Internet-based database for continuous evaluation. Results. A presumptive explanation to the stillbirth was established in 91% of the cases. The most common factors associated with intrauterine fetal death could be identified as infections (24%), placental insufficiency/intrauterine growth restriction (22%), placental abruption (19%), intercurrent maternal conditions (12%), congenital malformations (10%), and umbilical cord complications (9%). Conclusions. A relevant test protocol in cases of intrauterine fetal death reduces the number of unexplained cases to a minimum. An Internet-based register on test results of fetal deaths may enable a continuous evaluation of the diagnostic tools and etiologic factors in an ever-changing panorama. The results from the present study can serve as a base for a case-control study in Sweden.
