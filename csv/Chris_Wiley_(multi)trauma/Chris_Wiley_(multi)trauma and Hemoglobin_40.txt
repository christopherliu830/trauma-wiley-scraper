AB  - Abstract The aim of our study was to compare the perinatal and maternal outcome in hypertensive women experiencing abruptio placentae with that of normotensive women. We hypothesized that hypertensive women experiencing abruptio had a less favorable outcome than the normotensive women. Ours was a retrospective cohort study, in which the outcome of 33 hypertensive women with abruptio was compared with 138 normotensive women experiencing abruptio placentae. Our results indicate that although higher number of hypertensive women with abruptio had a past history of hypertension and were more likely to have diabetes (p = 0.05) there was no difference found in the grades of abruption or in any other antenatal complications between the 2 groups. The hypertensive women were also more likely to undergo cesarean section. We did not find any difference in the neonatal outcome. Therefore, we conclude that there is no difference in the maternal and perinatal outcome between the hypertensive and normotensive women experiencing abruptio.

AB  - Dentofacial defects can be small or very large, consisting of defects in the craniomaxillofacial region with missing soft tissue, bony and other hard tissue components. Such combined mucosal, osseous and even cartilaginous defects can be reconstructed using flaps and bone grafts, or hopefully, in the future with bone graft substitutes or even tissue engineered constructs. The healing of such wounds always relies on the vascularity of the surrounding tissues. This chapter seeks to provide a physiological basis for the mechanisms involved in the healing of such large complex defects. The reconstruction of specific defects must follow sound and logical surgical principles. The authors employ the concept of the reconstructive surgical ladder, in which techniques of step-wise increasing complexity are used with a strong preference for the simplest possible procedure at the outset. A number of techniques are presented along with the principles of tissue engineering and the basis for bone regeneration using adipose derived stem cells, growth factors and resorbable scaffolds.

AB  - Summary Oral medicine relates to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of nonsurgical and mostly nonodontogenic problems of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region, principally including oral mucosal diseases, salivary gland disorders, and orofacial pain. These problems can be subdivided into those that are local vs. those that represent oral manifestations of systemic disease and medical therapy. All oral medicine problems fall under one or more subjective complaints and/or objective signs. Patients may present with one or more of the following nine symptoms (i.e., subjective indicators): altered mucosa, pain/altered sensation, xerostomia/dry mouth, malodor, slow healing, swelling, bleeding, altered oral function (opening, eating, speaking, swallowing, etc.), or problems with teeth. This chapter serves as a problem-oriented approach to the more common oral medicine problems, and the approach is a categorization of these problems based upon presenting signs and symptoms.

AB  - Summary Anesthesia for neurosurgery presents an interesting challenge to the pediatric anesthesiologist. One has little control over the patient's primary lesion, but the selection of anesthetic technique and the recognition of perioperative events and changes may profoundly reduce or prevent significant morbidity. Current neuroanesthetic practice is based on the understanding of cerebral physiology and how it can be manipulated in the presence of intracranial pathology. The pediatric neuroanesthesiologist also must contend with the physiological differences in developing children. In addition to the common problems of administering anesthesia to the general pediatric population, special consideration must be given to the effects of anesthesia on the central nervous system of children with neurological diseases. This chapter reviews the fundamentals of the clinical management in neurosurgical patients. Discussion of specific neurosurgical conditions and their respective anesthetic management is designed to highlight the common and sometimes unique problems encountered by the pediatric neuroanesthesiologist.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR; synonymous with NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) is a universal physical technique best known for non-invasive detection and anatomical mapping of water protons (H). MR-spectroscopy (MRS) records protons from tissue chemicals other than water, intrinsic phosphorus containing metabolites, sodium, potassium, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. MRS is therefore an imaging technique with the potential to record human and animal biochemistry in vivo. As a result of wide availability of MRI equipment in research laboratories and hospitals, MRS is a serious competitor with PET to define normal body composition and its perturbation by pharmacological and pathological events. This article describes practical aspects of in vivo MRS with particular emphasis on the brain, where novel metabolites have been described. A survey of these new aspects of neurochemistry emphasize their practical utility as neuronal and axonal markers, measures of energy status, membrane constituents, and osmolytes, as well as some xenobiotics, such as alcohol. The concept of multinuclear in vivo MRS is illustrated by diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of several human brain disorders. Although these methods are currently most frequently encountered in human studies, as well as with transgenic and knockout mouse models, MRS adds a new dimension to anatomic and histopathologic descriptions.
