AB  - Abstract Background Considerable debate exists as to appropriate perioperative fluid management. Data from several studies suggest that the amount of fluid administered perioperatively influences surgical outcome. Pancreatic resection is a major procedure in which complications are common. We examined 1,030 sequential patients who had undergone pancreatic resection at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. We documented the prevalence and nature of their complications, and then correlated complications to intraoperative fluid administration. Methods We retrospectively examined 1,030 pancreatic resections performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between May 2004 and December 2009 from our pancreatic database. Intraoperative administration of colloid and crystalloid was obtained from anesthesia records, and complication data from our institutional database. Results The overall in-hospital mortality was 1.7%. Operative mortality was due predominantly to intraabdominal infection. Sixty percent of the mortality resulted from intraabdominal complications related to the procedure. We did not demonstrate a clinically significant relationship between intraoperative fluid administration and complications, although minor statistical significance was suggested. Conclusions In this retrospective review of intraoperative fluid administration we were not able to demonstrate a clinically significant association between postoperative complications and intraoperative crystalloid and colloid fluid administration. A randomized controlled trial has been initiated to address this question. J. Surg. Oncol. 2013;107:529?535. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Ilmakunnas M, Höckerstedt K, Mäkisalo H, Siitonen S, Repo H, Pesonen EJ. Hepatic IL-8 release during graft procurement is associated with impaired graft function after human liver transplantation.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 29?35. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? In experimental models, brain death induces inflammatory cascades, leading to reduced graft survival. Thus far, factors prior to graft preservation have gained less attention in clinical setting. We studied pre-preservation inflammatory response and its effects on graft function in 30 brain dead liver donors and the respective recipients. Before donor graft perfusion, portal and hepatic venous blood samples were drawn for phagocyte adhesion molecule expression and plasma cytokine determinations. Donor intensive care unit stay correlated with donor C-reactive protein (R?=?0.472, p?=?0.013) and IL-6 (R?=?0.419, p?=?0.026) levels, and donor (R?=?0.478, p?=?0.016) and recipient gamma-glutamyl transferase (R?=?0.432, p?=?0.019) levels. During graft procurement, hepatic IL-8 release was observed in 17/30 donors. Grafts with hepatic IL-8 release exhibited subsequently higher alkaline phosphatase [319 (213?405) IU/L vs. 175 (149?208) IU/L, p?=?0.006] and bilirubin [101 (44?139) ?mol/L vs. 30 (23?72) ?mol/L, p?=?0.029] levels after transplantation. Our findings support the concept that inflammatory response in the brain dead organ donor contributes to the development of graft injury in human liver transplantation.

AB  - Clinical and experimental evidence confirms that delivery of nutrients via the gastrointestinal tract reduces septic morbidity in critically injured patients. Early enteral feeding seems to maintain mucosal integrity and to support the gut as an important immunologic organ that may affect other areas of the body. There is increasing evidence to suggest that specific nutrients are especially beneficial in maintaining intestinal host-defense function in times of critical illness and injury.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses strategies for autologous transfusion, various blood-derived biologicals, non-blood-derived drugs and strategies to prevent haemorrhage and manage haemostatic disorders. The criteria for accepting donors for autologous transfusion need not be as strict as those for allogeneic transfusion. Preoperative assessment can identify anemia with correctable cause and contribute to avoidance of allogeneic transfusion. The major cause of anaemia in patients with end-stage renal disease is a lack of production of erythropoietin. The major side-effects of treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) are hypertension and thrombotic episodes, originally thought to be related primarily to excessive doses and too rapid correction of anaemia. Anaphylaxis, the major toxicity associated with vitamin K, is rare, but dramatic. Thrombin is a potent plasma-derived enzyme that is formed from prothrombin as a result of activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways.

AB  - SUMMARY As a resource, allogeneic blood has never been more in demand than it is today. Escalating elective surgery, an aging population, periodic shortages arising from a fall in supply, old and emerging threat of transfusion-transmissible infections and spiraling costs because of various safety introductions have all conspired to ensure that allogeneic blood remains very much a vital but limited asset to the National Health Service. However, there are increasing demands for alternatives/complementary strategies to allogeneic blood transfusion. Autologous transfusion, predeposit autologous donation, acute normovolemic hemodilution and perioperative cell salvage is reliable, cost-effective, safe, does not involve type and screen, not associated with isoimmunization to foreign proteins, is indicated in patients with rare blood groups or complex red cell antibodies, comes handy for some religious sect like the Jehovah's Witnesses as well as being suitable in a significant number of patients undergoing elective surgeries. Autologous transfusion improves postoperative microcirculation, tissue perfusion and reduces the risk of thromboembolism. Benchmarking transfusion activity, ensuring that it is clinically indicated and justified, will help eliminate inappropriate use of blood products and help conserve our allogeneic blood stock. Erythropoietin (EPO) has drastically and significantly altered red cell transfusion practices. There might be many patients groups who would benefit from the use of EPO analogues and thus help conserve the allogeneic blood stock for patients in whom EPO is contraindicated. There is need to formulate policies on ways to seriously and innovatively attract and retain new donors. The National Blood Service and indeed the Department for Health can do well by promoting the use of autologous blood and other alternatives therapies to complement the UK allogeneic blood transfusion program in a bid to solving the periodic and envisage future shortages in allogeneic blood particularly with an aging UK population and increasing concerns about safety arising from old and emerging transfusion-transmissible infections. This will maximize the use of the limited allogeneic blood resource particularly for patients in whom autologous blood transfusion is contraindicated.
