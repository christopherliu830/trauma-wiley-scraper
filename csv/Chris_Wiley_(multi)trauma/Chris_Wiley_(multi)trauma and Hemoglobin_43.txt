AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Summary Pediatric intensive care units are quintessentially multidisciplinary units that care for patients of other physicians and must integrate all stakeholders, including the families and child, into the care delivery process. This chapter will review the major functions of the pediatric intensive care unit, and then discuss major organ system dysfunction and common diseases in critically ill children. This includes the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, renal, and gastroenterological systems. Infection, sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response syndromes will also be discussed.

AB  - Summary As perioperative transfusions account for greater than half of the more than 20 million units of blood and blood products that are administered each year in the United States, strategies to limit the use of allogeneic blood products will need to be focused on the perioperative period. Additionally, given the acuity of illness of surgical patients and the impact of a many surgical procedure on homeostasis, avoidance of perioperative transfusions may greatly alter patient outcomes including the incidence of nosocomial infections, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, length or stay and even mortality. Of the surgical procedures recognized as being associated with significant blood loss, cardiothoracic, hepatic and major orthopedic procedures especially those involving the hip, pelvis and spine lead the list with estimated losses that may exceed one-half to an entire blood volume. Given these issues, there remains a significant need to avoid or limit the use of allogeneic blood products especially during the perioperative period and in critically ill patients. The following chapter reviews several of the potential options for limiting allogeneic blood product use during the perioperative period. Techniques to be reviewed include: (1) general considerations such as the optimization of preoperative coagulation function, correction of preoperative anemia, and intraoperative anesthetic technique including fluid therapy, proper patient positioning, and maintenance of normothermia; (2) autologous transfusion therapy including preoperative donation or intraoperative collection using acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) with or without the use of erythropoietin as well as intraoperative and postoperative blood salvage; (3) pharmacologic manipulation of the coagulation cascade with anti-fibrinolytic agents, desmopressin (DDAVP), recombinant coagulation factors (VII and XIII) or novel agents undergoing phase II and III trials; and (4) controlled hypotension. In many instances, the performance of major surgical procedures without the use of allogeneic blood products can only be accomplished by combining several of these techniques.

AB  - The safety and liver utilization with prerecovery liver biopsy (PLB) in extended criteria liver donors are unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 1323 brain death donors (PLB?=?496) from 3 organ procurement organizations (OPOs). Outcomes were complications, preempted liver recovery (PLR), and liver transplantation (LT). Additional analyses included liver-only and propensity score?matched multiorgan donor subgroups. PLB donors were older (57 versus 53 years; P?<?0.001). Hepatitis C antibody positivity (14.3% versus 9.6%, P?=?0.01) and liver-only donors (42.6% versus 17.5%; P?<?0.001) were more prevalent. The PLB cohort had fewer complications (31.9% versus 42.3%; P?<?0.001). In the PLB cohort, PLR was significantly higher (odds ratio [OR], 3.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.42-4.92) and LT lower (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.91). In liver-only and propensity score?matched multiorgan donor subgroups, PLR was significantly higher (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.94 and OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.37-3.82, respectively) without a decrease in LT (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.43-1.18 and OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.63-1.33, respectively) in PLB subgroups. In conclusion, in extended criteria liver donors, PLB is safe and decreases futile liver recovery without decreasing LT. Increased use of PLB, especially in liver-only donors, is likely to save costs to OPOs and transplant centers and improve efficiencies in organ allocation.

AB  - Abstract Background Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) survivors experience significant neurological disability, some of which is under-recognized by neurovascular clinical teams. We set out to objectively determine the occurrence of hearing impairment after SAH, characterize its peripheral and/or central origin, and investigate likely pathological correlates. Methods In a case-control study (n = 41), participants were asked about new onset hearing difficulty 3 months post-SAH, compared with pre-SAH. Formal audiological assessment included otoscopy, pure tone audiometry, a questionnaire identifying symptoms of peripheral hearing loss and/or auditory processing disorder, and a test of speech understanding in noise. A separate cohort (n = 21) underwent quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the auditory cortex 6 months after SAH, for correlation with hearing difficulty. Results Twenty three percent of SAH patients reported hearing difficulty that was new in onset post-SAH. SAH patients had poorer pure tone thresholds compared to controls. The proportion of patients with peripheral hearing loss as defined by the World Health Organization and British Audiological Society was however not increased, compared to controls. All SAH patients experienced symptoms of auditory processing disorder post-SAH, with speech-in-noise test scores significantly worse versus controls. Iron deposition in the auditory cortex was higher in patients reporting hearing difficulty versus those who did not. Conclusion This study firmly establishes hearing impairment as a frequent clinical feature after SAH. It primarily consists of an auditory processing disorder, mechanistically linked to iron deposition in the auditory cortex. Neurovascular teams should inquire about hearing, and refer SAH patients for audiological assessment and management.

AB  - Abstract Research on non-invasive neuromonitoring specific to PALF is limited. This systematic review identifies and synthesis the existing literature on non-invasive approaches to monitoring for neurological sequelae in patients with PALF. A series of literature searches were performed to identify all publications pertaining to five different non-invasive neuromonitoring modalities, in line with PRISMA guidelines. Each modality was selected on the basis of its potential for direct or indirect measurement of cerebral perfusion; studies on electroencephalographic monitoring were therefore not sought. Data were recorded on study design, patient population, comparator groups, and outcomes. A preponderance of observational studies was observed, most with a small sample size. Few incorporated direct comparisons of different modalities; in particular, comparison to invasive intracranial pressure monitoring was largely lacking. The integration of current evidence is considered in the context of the clinically significant distinctions between pediatric and adult ALF, as well as the implications for planning of future investigations to best support the evidence-based clinical care of these patients.
