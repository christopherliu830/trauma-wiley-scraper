AB  - Abstract Background: Epistaxis is the most common manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting approximately 90% of patients at some point during their lifetime. Bleeding is chronic and varies from mild, self-limited episodes to severe, transfusion-dependent or life-threatening epistaxis. Treatment options vary from conservative, nonsurgical management to more aggressive surgical approaches. A number of treatment options have been introduced in recent years. There is little consensus in the literature regarding treatment algorithms. The objective of this investigation was to provide a contemporary review of HHT-related epistaxis, including pathophysiology, disease manifestations, and state-of-the-art treatment modalities. Methods: A systematic review of the literature for HHT-related epistaxis was performed using the search terms ?hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? and ?epistaxis.? Additional literature search regarding current recommendations for HHT evaluation and recent developments in genetic mechanisms, pathophysiology, and treatment of HHT was also performed. Results: A total of 308 articles were identified and reviewed for appropriateness of inclusion whereas 64 articles met inclusion criteria. Treatment options range from topical and hormonal therapy to more aggressive surgical modalities. Most treatment descriptions are case series, with few randomized controlled trials. A number of new and novel therapies have been introduced in recent years. Conclusion: HHT is a heterogeneous disease requiring multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment. Therapeutic options for HHT-related epistaxis vary from conservative, nonsurgical measures to more aggressive surgical treatments. A graduated treatment plan is recommended. Patients present with a wide degree in variation of severity of epistaxis, and treatment is best tailored to the individual patient. ?2012 ARSAAOA, LLC.

AB  - Since Haissaguerre and his colleagues demonstrated the importance of the pulmonary veins in the generation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 1998, a variety of different ablative interventions have been performed to eliminate AF. Various complications related to catheterization, ablation itself including pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial effusion, stroke, and atrioesophageal fistula have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome characterized by enhanced activation of coagulation with some intravascular fibrin formation and deposition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient whose condition was complicated by DIC after segmental ostial isolation of pulmonary veins for persistent AF. The patient has completely recovered from the DIC by hemodialysis, administration of blood constituents for 15 days.

AB  - Abstract Objective To examine the association between perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric surgical patients. Methods Retrospective cohort study using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Pediatric, a validated registry of 118 United States children's hospitals. Patients under 19 years of age undergoing a surgical procedure between 2012 and 2017 were included, with the main exposure being RBC transfusion in the perioperative period (48 hours prior to operation to 72 hours after operation). The primary 30-day outcome of interest was a postoperative VTE requiring therapy. Risk-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated using multiple logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were performed across multiple surgical specialties. Sensitivity analyses were performed after (a) imputation for missing variables and (b) propensity score matching. Results During the study years, 482 867 pediatric patients (56.7% male; median age, 6 years [interquartile range, 1?12 years]) underwent an operation. Of these, 30 879 (6.4%) received at least one perioperative RBC transfusion. Postoperative VTE requiring therapy occurred in 618 patients (0.13%). After adjustment for multiple risk factors, perioperative RBC transfusion was associated with an increased risk of VTE (aOR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9?3.0). The increased VTE risk persisted after imputation of missing demographic and clinical data as well as after 1:1 propensity score matching (29 811 matched pairs, aOR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7?2.8). Conclusions Perioperative RBC transfusion is associated with an increased, albeit still very low, risk of postoperative VTE in pediatric patients. Patients receiving blood in the perioperative period may benefit from additional monitoring or VTE prophylaxis.

AB  - Abstract Research on non-invasive neuromonitoring specific to PALF is limited. This systematic review identifies and synthesis the existing literature on non-invasive approaches to monitoring for neurological sequelae in patients with PALF. A series of literature searches were performed to identify all publications pertaining to five different non-invasive neuromonitoring modalities, in line with PRISMA guidelines. Each modality was selected on the basis of its potential for direct or indirect measurement of cerebral perfusion; studies on electroencephalographic monitoring were therefore not sought. Data were recorded on study design, patient population, comparator groups, and outcomes. A preponderance of observational studies was observed, most with a small sample size. Few incorporated direct comparisons of different modalities; in particular, comparison to invasive intracranial pressure monitoring was largely lacking. The integration of current evidence is considered in the context of the clinically significant distinctions between pediatric and adult ALF, as well as the implications for planning of future investigations to best support the evidence-based clinical care of these patients.

AB  - Summary Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5% of visits to the emergency department. Although most patients presenting with acute abdominal pain have minor problems, about 18?25% of patients have a serious enough condition to warrant hospital admission for investigation and treatment, and about 10% of patients need emergency or urgent surgery. It usually results from gastrointestinal disorders, but other causes, which include a spectrum of medical and surgical conditions, must not be forgotten. Most commonly, acute abdominal pain is due to luminal obstruction, inflammation, perforation, volvulus or torsion, and intestinal ischemia. The two immediate goals in the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain are to decide if the patient needs admission to hospital and to ascertain whether urgent or emergency surgery is needed. A number of tests and investigations are available to guide the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, but only an astute clinician can obtain the information that is needed from a patient, choose the best investigations, and plan appropriate treatment. The desire to obtain an accurate preoperative diagnosis should not be allowed to delay therapeutic intervention in the critically ill or unstable patient.

AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise throughout the world by patients looking for ?safer? alternatives. However, data on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to CAM are lacking. In a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we retrospectively studied CAM-related health-seeking behavior and attempted to identify those who developed possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF. In this study, we examine the clinical, biochemical, and liver histopathologic characteristics of possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF, describe implicated CAM agents, and discuss predictors of patient outcomes. Out of 1,666 patients with cirrhosis, 68% used CAM at some point. A total of 35.7% (n = 30/84) patients presented with CAM-related DILI leading to ACLF in the whole CAM-DILI-related decompensation cohort. The most common CAM was unlabeled polyherbal Ayurvedic formulations. Of possible patients with ACLF, 63% self-medicated with CAM based on social media sharing. Mean age ± SD was 51.9 ± 9.9 years, 83% were male patients, median follow-up duration was 173 (range, 14-584) days, median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 13 (range, 10-14), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium score was 30.1 ± 4.8, median chronic liver failure-organ failure (CLIF-C-OF) score was 11 (range, 8-14), and median CLIF-C-ACLF score was 98 (range, 87-127). Portal-based neutrophilic predominant mixed inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, autoimmune-like features, and severe cholestasis were seen on liver biopsy. Overall, 53% of patients died (median survival 194 days). Baseline overt hepatic encephalopathy and CLIF-C-OF score, total bilirubin, hyponatremia and leukocytosis, and grade of ACLF predicted 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month mortality, respectively. Conclusion: Possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF has a high mortality. Strict monitoring and identification of CAM use among people with cirrhosis and an integrative public health educational practice can help ameliorate this modifiable risk factor that potentiates heavy liver disease burden and resource use.

AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy for hundreds of thousands of people who have severe impairment of gastrointestinal function. Trace elements are a small but very important part of PN that can be overlooked during busy practice. Serious complications can result from trace element deficiencies and toxicities, and this is especially problematic during times of product shortages. Practical information on parenteral trace element use can be gleaned from case reports, some retrospective studies, and very few randomized controlled trials. A general knowledge of trace element metabolism and excretion, deficiency and toxicity symptoms, products, optimal dosages, and strategies for supplementation, restriction, and monitoring will equip practitioners to provide optimal care for their patients who depend on PN.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Approximately one in four patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given anticoagulation and compression therapy develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Accelerated removal of thrombus by thrombolytic agents may increase patency and prevent PTS. Objectives: To assess short-term efficacy of additional catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) compared with standard treatment alone. Patients and methods: Open, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Patients (18?75?years) with iliofemoral DVT and symptoms <?21?days were randomized to receive additional CDT or standard treatment alone. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was investigated using duplex ultrasound and air-plethysmography assessed by an investigator blinded to previous treatment. Results: One hundred and three patients (64?men, mean age 52?years) were allocated additional CDT (n?=?50) or standard treatment alone (n?=?53). After CDT, grade III (complete) lysis was achieved in 24 and grade II (50%?90%) lysis in 20?patients. One patient suffered major bleeding and two had clinically relevant bleeding related to the CDT procedure. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was found in 32 (64.0%) in the CDT group vs. 19 (35.8%) controls, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction (RR) of 28.2% (95% CI: 9.7%?46.7%; P?=?0.004). Venous obstruction was found in 10 (20.0%) in the CDT group vs. 26 (49.1%) controls; absolute RR 29.1% (95% CI: 20.0%?38.0%; P?=?0.004). Femoral venous insufficiency did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: After 6?months, additional CDT increased iliofemoral patency from 36% to 64%. The ongoing long-term follow-up of this study will document whether patency is related to improved functional outcome.

AB  - Summary The preoperative period is a critical step in the care of children and adults with congenital heart disease. This chapter reviews the essential goals of the preoperative visit in preparing the child and family for the upcoming intervention, obtaining appropriate consent, and understanding the child's cardiac condition and other medical issues. This chapter will discuss the role of history and physical examination, various investigations including laboratory tests and imaging studies, and evaluation of compensatory status. We discuss the options for premedication, fasting guidelines, and infective endocarditis prophylaxis. We also describe a method for anesthetic risk stratification in children with congenital heart disease presenting for cardiac as well as non-cardiac interventions.
