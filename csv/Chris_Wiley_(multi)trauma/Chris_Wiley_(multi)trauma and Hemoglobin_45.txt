AB  - Summary The preoperative period is a critical step in the care of children and adults with congenital heart disease. This chapter reviews the essential goals of the preoperative visit in preparing the child and family for the upcoming intervention, obtaining appropriate consent, and understanding the child's cardiac condition and other medical issues. This chapter will discuss the role of history and physical examination, various investigations including laboratory tests and imaging studies, and evaluation of compensatory status. We discuss the options for premedication, fasting guidelines, and infective endocarditis prophylaxis. We also describe a method for anesthetic risk stratification in children with congenital heart disease presenting for cardiac as well as non-cardiac interventions.

AB  - SUMMARY Decisions concerning the use of allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in the treatment of anemia and hemorrhage require a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of both the condition and its treatment. Although we have developed a much clearer appreciation for the infectious and immunomodulatory risks of RBC transfusion over the past two decades, the risks of anemia in many clinical settings and the benefits of RBC transfusion are still inadequately characterized. Only one large randomized controlled trial has examined red cell administration in the perioperative and in the critical care setting, and high-quality clinical evidence is not yet available for many decisions related to red cell transfusions. Several studies and initiatives to evaluate alternatives to RBC transfusions and to improve current understanding of transfusion practices are underway. It is anticipated that risks and benefits of red cells and alternatives will be elucidated in the coming years.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the preoperative evaluation of potential transfusion needs, indications for and goals and risks of perioperative blood product transfusion, interpretation of coagulation tests, and special perioperative transfusion situations. Perioperative anemia imparts significant added risk for surgical patients. To address the problems associated with anemia, RBC transfusions are frequently administered perioperatively. RBC transfusions are widely utilized in the perioperative setting. The primary goals of perioperative blood product transfusion are to maintain tissue oxygenation and ensure hemostasis. Although improved oxygen carrying capacity is certainly achieved with RBC transfusion, the association between RBC transfusion and improved tissue oxygenation remains much more controversial. Serious complications of central venous catheter (CVC) placement are rare and include pneumothorax, air embolus, and hemothorax. The increasing use of interventional radiology and cardiology has created a new cohort of patients at risk for arterial bleeding following angiography.

AB  - Abstract Almost every living thing requires iron (including aerobic, and facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria) because iron plays key roles in a broad range of physiologically essential molecular processes ranging from catalysis, oxygen transport, and oxidative phosphorylation to structuring proteins. The useful redox properties of iron enable its utility in these molecular functions, but its scarcity in the environment in bioavailable forms, coupled with the double-edged nature of its redox properties (which can lead to the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species), require complicated acquisition, transport, and storage mechanisms, both by environmental microbes and by higher animals. These iron acquisition mechanisms come into direct conflict when microbes compete with each other for this scarce resource in the environment and when pathogenic bacteria infect animal hosts. A very simple and potently effective strategy employed by many animals to ward off bacterial and fungal infections, at least in the early stages while pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses are developing, is to further constrict the already tightly controlled endogenous iron budget, starving invading microbial pathogens of needed iron. The complicated system of endogenous iron transport permits these changes in response to infection. However, in a countering response, successful pathogens have developed a variety of strategies to evade this defense, the simplest and most dramatic of which is perhaps exemplified by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, which has evolved away from the need for any iron whatsoever. Bacteria and protists have also developed sophisticated and complicated mechanisms to access heme-associated iron directly. However, other strategies developed by microbes to compete with each other for iron in the environment, mediated by small-molecule iron chelators called siderophores, are, in turn, useful to access the otherwise restricted pool of iron in transit in the body, carried as complexes with specific iron-binding proteins. To counter siderophore-mediated iron pilfering, animals have developed a panel of siderophore-specific binding proteins (siderocalins) to steal the iron (and siderophore) back. To subvert this counterstrategy, successful pathogenic bacteria modify their siderophores into stealthy forms that cannot bind to host siderocalins. As with any arms race (e.g., the process of evolution), the cycle of response/counterresponse is likely to continue ad infinitum.

AB  - Abstract Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) aims to recover changes in tissue optical parameters relating to tissue hemodynamics, to infer functional information in biological tissue. A widely-used application of fNIRS relies on continuous wave (CW) methodology that utilizes multiple distance measurements on human head for study of brain health. The typical method used is spatially resolved spectroscopy (SRS), which is shown to recover tissue oxygenation index (TOI) based on gradient of light intensity measured between two detectors. However, this methodology does not account for tissue scattering which is often assumed. A new parameter recovery algorithm is developed, which directly recovers both the scattering parameter and scaled chromophore concentrations and hence TOI from the measured gradient of light-attenuation at multiple wavelengths. It is shown through simulations that in comparison to conventional SRS which estimates cerebral TOI values with an error of ±12.3%, the proposed method provides more accurate estimate of TOI exhibiting an error of ±5.7% without any prior assumptions of tissue scatter, and can be easily implemented within CW fNIRS systems. Using an arm-cuff experiment, the obtained TOI using the proposed method is shown to provide a higher and more realistic value as compared to utilizing any prior assumptions of tissue scatter.
