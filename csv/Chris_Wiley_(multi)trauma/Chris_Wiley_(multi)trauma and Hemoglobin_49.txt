AB  - Abstract: A unique hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (IVOX) has been developed, which is inserted into the vena caval blood stream to transfer O2/CO2 to/from circulating blood in an intact subject without involving the natural lungs. Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated that the device can transfer significant quantities of O2 and CO2 for up to 3 weeks without significant harmful sequelae or complications. Clinical trials are in progress under FDA supervision, in which IVOX has been utilized to date in 56 patients with ARDS. Preliminary findings indicate that risks and hazards from IVOX are nil, and evidence of benefit to the patient has been demonstrated in 86% of the patients. At this time, clinical utilization of IVOX is in the experimental, data collecting mode to determine its proper role or niche as a method for temporary augmentation of blood gas transfer in patients with advanced acute respiratory failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND Recent recommendations indicate that one red blood cell (RBC) unit should be transfused at a time, with reassessment after each transfusion, which may be extrapolated from literature supporting restrictive transfusion triggers rather than specific evidence. Therefore, two systematic reviews were performed to identify the following: 1) RBC transfusion guidelines and review articles to determine if single- or multiple-unit transfusion strategies are recommended and 2) studies comparing strategies for evidence of benefit. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Trip Database were searched (inception to June 2017). For the first review, the proportion of articles with single/multiple-unit recommendations was assessed and stratified by article type. For the second review, the primary outcome was RBC use. Secondary outcomes included proportion of transfusion episodes using a single-unit strategy, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS The first review identified 145 articles for analysis, with 51 transfusion guidelines. Only 14 guidelines (27%) made a recommendation, with most (93%) recommending single-unit transfusions. The second review identified seven cohort studies comparing preimplementation and postimplementation of a policy encouraging single-unit transfusion strategies. Meta-analysis could not be performed for outcomes given inconsistencies in reporting. RBC use decreased by approximately 10 to 41% across studies. CONCLUSION Transfusion guidelines lack recommendations to transfuse to a single-unit strategy. Mostly retrospective cohort studies (six of seven) are inconsistent in outcome reporting but suggest improved RBC use. Further high-quality studies could identify the benefits of a single-unit transfusion strategy, determine the applicability to different clinical settings, and inform future practice guidelines.

AB  - Abstract Solitary myeloma can present as either extramedullary plasmacytoma or solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB). More than half of reported cases of SPB are localized to the spine. The rest include appendage long bones of the skeleton, pelvis, and skull. The first case of SPB (to the authors' knowledge) is reported involving the talus bone of the foot. Although approximately 50% of SPB patients progress to multiple myeloma in the first 3 years after diagnosis, aggressive local therapy is indicated because the median survival of patients with SPB is better than that for multiple myeloma.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Primary graft failure (PGF) is an important contributor to early mortality, accounting for 41% of deaths within the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HT). Donor hypernatremia has been associated with PGF development. However, controversial data exist regarding the impact of sodium deregulation in patient survival after HT. This study aimed to assess the influence of donor hypernatremia on PGF development and to determine the serum sodium level threshold to assist in decision-making for organ procurement. Methods The medical record from 200 HT patients and organ donors were retrospectively assessed and categorized by PGF occurrence. Donor sodium levels were compared and cut-off points obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to assess the effects of factors and covariates that influence PGF development. Results Sodium levels of donors were significantly higher in recipients who developed PGF than those who did not develop PGF (162 vs. 153 mmol/L, P = .001). The sodium cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was 159 mmol/L. The group who received organs from donors with a serum sodium concentration ≥159 mmol/L had a higher incidence of PGF (63.3% vs 32.4%, P < .001). Furthermore, donor sodium levels ≥159 mmol/L increased the likelihood of recipients developing PGF by 3.4 times. It is also observed that the incidence of donor smoking addiction was significantly higher in the PGF group (28.6% vs. 11.5%, P = .004) and donor smoking addiction increased the risk of developing PGF by 2.8 times. Conclusion Smoking addiction and the application of suboptimal organs from donors with hypernatremia contribute to primary graft failure in heart transplantation.

AB  - Background: In critically ill patients who were surface cooled to 332C, we have observed that dopamine sometimes causes a substantial decrease in blood pressure. The present study was designed to compare the effects of dopamine in normothermia to those seen after surface cooling to 32C. Methods: Seven pigs with a mean body weight of 21 kg were anesthetized with ketamine and muscle relaxation was induced with pancuronium. They were mechanically ventilated and given dopamine infusions (5 and 12 ?g · kg-1 min-1) in normothermia and after surface cooling by cold water immersion to a central blood temperature of 320C (range 31.6?32.6C). Results: In normothermia, dopamine at a dose of 5 ?g · kg-1 min-1 increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 16% (P < 0.01) and cardiac output (CO) by 9% (P=0.051); at 12 ?g kg-1 min-1 dopamine increased MAP by 26% (P < 0.01) and CO by 18% (P < 0.01). In hypothermia, MAP and CO did not change at an administration rate of 5 ?g kg-l · min-1; at 12 ?g · kg-1 min-1 CO was unchanged but MAP was significantly reduced by 15% (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Dopamine increased CO and MAP in normothermia but not at 32C, where there was even a significant reduction of MAP in this porcine model.

AB  - Abstract Objective. We hypothesised that patients with massive postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), defined as blood loss >1,500 ml, may benefit from the use of activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa). Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Department of Obstetrics  25?75th percentile: ?25.0, ?8.0, signed rank p<0.0001), and lower prothrombin times (median: ?8.8; 25?75th percentile: ?24.2, ?4.8), after administration of drug. There was no significant difference in the rate of hysterectomy between the 2 groups (11/18 (61%) versus 6/16 (38%)). No adverse event attributable to rFVIIa was observed in the study. Conclusion. Activated recombinant factor VII can be a life-saving drug in patients with massive PPH.
