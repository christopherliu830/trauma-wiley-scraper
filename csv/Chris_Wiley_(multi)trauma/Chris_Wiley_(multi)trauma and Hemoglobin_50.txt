AB  - Abstract The fat embolism syndrome is an important complication of patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies because of severe morbidity and mortality. Our recent experience with three cases that survived with intensive supportive care and prompt use of transfusion stimulates this review. A high index of suspicion, prompt use of diagnostic tools, and aggressive clinical management are the keys to a successful outcome. Am. J. Hematol. 79:61?67, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: In critically ill patients who were surface cooled to 332C, we have observed that dopamine sometimes causes a substantial decrease in blood pressure. The present study was designed to compare the effects of dopamine in normothermia to those seen after surface cooling to 32C. Methods: Seven pigs with a mean body weight of 21 kg were anesthetized with ketamine and muscle relaxation was induced with pancuronium. They were mechanically ventilated and given dopamine infusions (5 and 12 ?g · kg-1 min-1) in normothermia and after surface cooling by cold water immersion to a central blood temperature of 320C (range 31.6?32.6C). Results: In normothermia, dopamine at a dose of 5 ?g · kg-1 min-1 increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 16% (P < 0.01) and cardiac output (CO) by 9% (P=0.051); at 12 ?g kg-1 min-1 dopamine increased MAP by 26% (P < 0.01) and CO by 18% (P < 0.01). In hypothermia, MAP and CO did not change at an administration rate of 5 ?g kg-l · min-1; at 12 ?g · kg-1 min-1 CO was unchanged but MAP was significantly reduced by 15% (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Dopamine increased CO and MAP in normothermia but not at 32C, where there was even a significant reduction of MAP in this porcine model.

AB  - BACKGROUND Preoperative anemia is an important modifiable risk factor for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in a variety of surgical populations. The primary objective of this study was to examine the association between preoperative anemia and i) transfusion of RBCs within 72 hours of surgery and ii) postoperative clinical outcomes in children undergoing spine arthrodesis surgery. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We assembled a retrospective cohort of children included in the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program Pediatric database who underwent spine arthrodesis surgery from 2012 to 2016. Anemia was defined using age- and sex-specific hematocrit thresholds. Data collected included demographic and surgical characteristics, RBC transfusion within 72 hours, and 30-day postoperative outcomes (postoperative mechanical ventilation, infection, readmission, hospital length of stay, mortality). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of RBC transfusion and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS We included 9,095 patients in the analysis. Preoperative anemia was present in 14% (n = 1,233) of the population and 67% (n = 6,135) of patients were transfused. Our multivariable logistic regression showed anemia, surgical time > 350 minutes, > 7 vertebral levels fused, neuromuscular disease, and cerebral palsy were all independent predictors of RBC transfusion. Preoperative anemia was also associated with prolonged hospital LOS (adjusted OR: 1.31, 95%CI: 1.11?1.54, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS In this study of 9,095 children undergoing spine surgery, preoperative anemia was associated with an increased risk of RBC transfusion and prolonged LOS. Further studies are needed to determine if treatment of preoperative anemia can effectively reduce intraoperative RBC transfusion.

AB  - Abstract In a 28-year period, 39 (7%) patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (median age 66?years, 64% male) underwent a splenectomy at our institution. Primary indications for splenectomy were refractory thrombocytopenia (36%), progressive spleen related symptoms (33%), emergent splenectomy for splenic rupture (21%), refractory anemia (8%), and prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant (3%). Eleven (28%) patients had anemia at the time of splenectomy, of which 3 (27%) were autoimmune. The median time to splenectomy from CMML diagnosis was 6 months (0-40); perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 43% and 13%, while the median postsplenectomy survival was 25?months (11-38). Durable remission in spleen related symptoms, thrombocytopenia, complications from splenic rupture, and anemia were achieved in 85%, 50%, 62%, and 21% of patients, respectively. Perioperative morbidity (n?=?30) included infections/sepsis in 6 (20%), intraabdominal bleeding in 4 (13%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 3 (10%), and acute lung injury in 2 (7%) patients. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (1-25), with 5 deaths occurring secondary to respiratory failure (n?=?2), multiorgan dysfunction (n?=?2) and hemorrhagic shock (n?=?1). There was no difference in overall survival between CMML patients that underwent splenectomy, in comparison to those that did not. Unlike in myelofibrosis, portal hypertension was not an indication for splenectomy and no patients developed post-splenectomy thrombocytosis. In conclusion, apart from being a lifesaving emergent modality in the event of splenic rupture, splenectomy has an important palliative role in patients with CMML, with significant and durable improvements in spleen related symptoms and refractory cytopenias.

AB  - Summary The most challenging responsibility for a dentist is to provide care for medically complex outpatients. A thorough history is necessary to establish the existence and nature of any medical problems to adequately assess risk, anticipate complications, and decrease the likelihood of medical emergencies while providing appropriate dental treatment. This chapter is a review (in alphabetical order) of medical problems that are of potential concern to dentists, with emphasis on the essential elements in the medical history, principles of medical care, and oral health care management considerations.
