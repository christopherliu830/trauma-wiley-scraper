AB  - Summary Abnormal teeth in young animals may occur for many reasons ? some are genetic but others are acquired. This chapter discusses primary hereditary disorders, spontaneous anomalies of unknown cause, and dental alterations due to extrinsic factors. In addition to clinical information regarding the appearance and condition of the teeth and dental radiographic findings, a thorough evaluation of the history is often required to establish the cause of odontogenic anomalies. The chapter also covers several of the more common equine dental diseases and a few dental pathologies unique to equids. Pulpitis is one of the pathologic processes for which a pathologist may be called upon to examine a tooth histologically. Chronic degenerative changes may occur in injured teeth in the absence of pulpitis or pulp necrosis. Typical inflammatory responses, such as edema and active congestion, may increase pressure within the pulp chamber and thereby exacerbate pulpal injury through ischemia.

AB  - The single vehicle rollover accident is a highly complex crash mode and there is growing concerns about its incidents and consequences in central Australia. The aim of this paper is to assess: 1 The incidence and injury patterns of rollover accidents 2 Pre rollover characteristics on rollover propensity 3 The injury severity and outcome of rollover accidents The absence of speed limit, unfenced roads, vast distances traveled, unsealed roads and high use of alcohol makes the spectrum of MVA? s in NT unique. In this two year period of study from Jan 2004 ? Dec 2005, there were 470 motor vehicle accidents of which 126 were single vehicle rollover accidents. 132 patients were admitted; 73 NT residents of which 45 were of aboriginal origin and 14 were international tourists. There were 37 deaths in Central Australian roads and 20 were due to single vehicle rollover accidents. None of the deaths occurred at the Alice Springs hospital . Most rollover accidents occur at a speed above 100?km/h. 24 patients had an ISS?>?15 and 35% of all injuries were to head, neck and shoulder. Rollovers occurred when the vehicle left the road way and encountered a tripping mechanism such as soft dirt or loose gravel. Those who were belted fared better than those unbelted occupants. Completely ejected occupants were all unbelted. Mean time to hospital from time of accident was 8Hrs. Primary prevention strategies need to involve remote communities, tourists traveling in central Australia and address alcohol and restraint use.

AB  - The clinical trigger to consider the presence of a coagulopathy is the onset of non-surgically controllable bleeding. While earlier consensus documents considered this event predictable by modelling blood loss, and factor level decline, we now recognize confounding variables such as shock, hypothermia, metabolic disturbances and fibrinolysis confuse the picture to such an extent traditional treatment algorithms are irrelevant. The monitoring of coagulopathy by traditional coagulation screens also lacks validation, and is usually so delayed in response time to become irrelevant to appropriate management. Attaining euvolaemia is possible with large volume dedicated infusion systems but in a patient with massive mediator release and comorbidities may not achieve adequate tissue oxygen delivery. Evidence based transfusion triggers are still lacking. Management of coagulopathy is by component replacement early. Delays occur because of slow coagulation test turnaround times, and the place of newer point of care monitors and thrombelastography needs evaluation. Delay in delivery of blood components due to processing time may worsen the outcome. Factor VIIa probably has a unique place in the management of coagulopathy in these patients, but studies are needed to define dosage and time of dose (2). The management of acidosis and hyperlactaemia are fundamentally improved by better perfusion, but short term correction may be indicated to reinforce coagulation factor function.

AB  - Objective? Playground and sporting accidents account for a large percentage of paediatric injuries, yet they are largely preventable. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors and mechanisms associated with upper and lower limb fractures in children. Method? 145 children admitted to a regional Australian hospital (Coffs Harbour Base Hospital) totalling 207 upper and lower limb fractures over an 12 month period between January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2004 were identified from the hospital medical records database. Retrospective analysis was performed on demographic data, fracture type and mechanisms causing the fracture. Results? Males accounted for 69.7% of all childhood limb fractures. 77.7% of all fractures were upper limb, while 22.3% were lower limb. The leading causes of lower limb fractures were football injuries, push bike accidents, and aquatic accidents, accounting for 51.8% of all lower limb fractures. Monkey bars, swings, trees, skateboard and scooter accidents were associated with a relatively high prevalence of upper limb injuries when compared to other injury mechanisms. Football, push bike and skateboard accidents alone accounted for 40.6% of fractures in our male patients. This figure was only 4.5% in our female patients, and in general, the causes of fractures in females are more evenly distributed. Conclusion? Limb fractures in children have a diverse range of causes, but specific fractures occur more frequently in particular sexes and with certain activities. There is a role for further injury prevention targeting specific high risk groups and activities.

AB  - Abstract Deficiency of vitamin B12 is a well known cause of megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia. Splenomegaly and leukoerythroblastosis are much less well known manifestations of B12 deficiency. We report a B12 deficient female with severe pancytopenia including normocytic anemia who also had enlarged spleen and circulating nucleated red blood cells as well as circulating immature myeloid cells. Although these findings are reported in the earlier literature, more modern reviews of the subject often fail to mention this association. We review the literature on these unusual manifestations of B12 deficiency and remind clinicians that splenomegaly and erythroblastosis can serve as diagnostic clues in cases of severe megaloblastic anemia secondary to B12 deficiency.

AB  - ?Hurricane Katrina ? Unorganized, unprepared and internationally embarrassed? Despite well defined, pre-exisiting organizational plans and national response strategies, Hurricane Katrina exposed major weaknesses in the ability of a region or nation to respond to a tragedy of significant magnitude. Significant lessons were learned from the event. Must have in place: ?? A national and regional disaster response plan ?? A ?Chain of Command / Responsibility? Doctrine ?? A national and regional disaster response system ?? National, regional and local ?Incident Command? structures ?? Emergency supply stockpiles ?? Pre-established communication frequencies Major considerations: ?? Make this a military function ? make all civilian agencies report to them ?? Military has the comm, logistics, command structure, personnel and the training to take on this mission. ?? Train for an event at regional and national levels ?? Cross train all responders ?? Eliminate the red tape at the front end of the event ?? Mobilize and ?do it?

AB  - Summary Ferrets are commonly used as an animal model for influenza virus research, as well as other disease conditions, such as Helicobacter-induced gastropathy. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a distinct idiopathic inflammatory condition of young adult ferrets. Affected animals may present with vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, and a marked eosinophilia may be noted during routine hematologic evaluation. Hematologic changes may include nonregenerative anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnoses for hypergammaglobulinemia and/or abdominal masses include Aleutian disease, lymphosarcoma, chronic infection (e.g., proliferative colitis, helicobacteriosis), idiopathic splenomegaly, multiple myeloma, other neoplasms, and inflammatory bowel disease. Hepatic coccidiosis and toxoplasmosis are seen sporadically in ferrets. Similarly, systemic viral disease caused by infection with canine distemper virus, influenza virus, Aleutian disease (a parvovirus infection), and coronavirus may induce foci of hepatic necrosis and inflammation. Nonspecific lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis may be seen with moderate regularity in surgical biopsies or tissue sections from adult ferrets as an extension of gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions.
