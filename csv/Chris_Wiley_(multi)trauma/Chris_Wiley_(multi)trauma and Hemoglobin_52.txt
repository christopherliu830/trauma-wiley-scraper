AB  - Abstract Mycobacterium marinum is a photochromogenic mycobacterium that is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. In the general population, exposure to aquaria is the most common cause of M. marinum infection. Known as ?swimmer's granuloma? or ?fish tank granuloma,? M. marinum is an occupational hazard for aquarium cleaners and fishermen. There are several reports in the literature of M. marinum infection in immunocompromised hosts, including those with solid organ transplants, but none in patients who have received stem cell transplants (SCTs). To our knowledge, this is a first report of disseminated M. marinum infection in an SCT recipient who continued to develop new skin lesions even after months of targeted therapy. The implications are that elderly patients who receive T-cell-depleted SCTs may be at prolonged risk for pathogens dependent on cellular immunity, and the presentation of illness with such pathogens may be more severe and widely disseminated than might otherwise be expected.

AB  - Redox-active iron, catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species, has been implicated in experimental renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, in clinical transplantation, it is unknown whether redox-active iron is involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic injury of non-heart-beating (NHB) donor kidneys. We measured redox-active iron concentrations in perfusate samples of 231 deceased donor kidneys that were preserved by machine pulsatile perfusion at our institution between May 1998 and November 2002 using the bleomycin detectable iron assay. During machine pulsatile perfusion, redox-active iron was released into the preservation solution. Ischemically injured NHB donor kidneys had significantly higher perfusate redox-active iron concentrations than heart-beating (HB) donor kidneys that were not subjected to warm ischemia (3.9 ± 1.1 vs. 2.8 ± 1.0 ?mol/L, p = 0.001). Moreover, redox-active iron concentration was an independent predictor of post-transplant graft viability (odds ratio 1.68, p = 0.01) and added predictive value to currently available donor and graft characteristics. This was particularly evident in uncontrolled NHB donor kidneys for which there is the greatest uncertainty about transplant outcomes. Therefore, perfusate redox-active iron concentration shows promise as a novel viability marker of NHB donor kidneys.

AB  - Summary Occupational health and safety in veterinary hospitals is a topic not always routinely considered but one that is of utmost importance. This chapter first gives an overview of common hazards and how to prevent them. Regular training, revision of safety procedures, plain old hand washing and common sense will help keep the workplace productive and healthy. The veterinary technician plays a very important role in the administration of medications. It is imperative that the veterinary technician has a full understanding of and the ability to relay information on; the indications for use, pharmacokinetics, contraindications, precautions, safety issues, adverse effects, drug interactions, and monitoring parameters of the medications they encounter in practice. Recognizing signs of pain and advocating pain management is a paramount element of patient care. It is well recognized that patients, both veterinary and human, suffer from longer hospital stays, greater complications, and increased mortality when pain is not controlled.

AB  - Summary When considering rabbit disease, it is important to know the age of the animal and the typical life cycle, be it commercial or pet. Healthy rabbits are fastidious in their habits and groom their pelage frequently, thus a poor quality, staring hair coat is a sign of poor health. Interestingly, rabbits with orodental disease have a 63 times greater risk of subsequently developing dermatologic disease. Skin biopsies, skin scrapings, microbiologic culture and sensitivity, and circulating steroid hormone and thyroxin levels may be evaluated to differentiate noninfectious from infectious causes of hair loss. Neurologic or apparent neurologic presenting signs are common in pet rabbits. As with musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to differentiate primary neurologic disease from other disorders that may produce neurologic signs. A thorough post-mortem examination of all systems is necessary to definitively characterize the cause of clinical signs suggestive of musculoskeletal disease.

AB  - Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by deterioration in kidney function resulting in multisystem abnormalities. Much of the morbidity and mortality associated with AKI result from a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This study described herein is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter US study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) treatment on AKI requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the ICU. The study enrolled 35 subjects. The mean age was 56.3?±?15. With regard to race, 71.4% of the subjects were Caucasian, 22.9% were Black, and 5.7% were Hispanic. Average SOFA score was 11.3?±?3.6. Death from any cause at Day 60 was 31.4%. Renal recovery, defined as dialysis independence, was observed in all of the surviving subjects at Day 60. The results of this pilot study indicate the potential for a substantial improvement in patient outcomes over standard of care therapy, which is associated with a greater than 50% 60-day mortality in the literature. The SCD warrants further study in scientifically sound, pivotal trial to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
