AB  - Summary When considering rabbit disease, it is important to know the age of the animal and the typical life cycle, be it commercial or pet. Healthy rabbits are fastidious in their habits and groom their pelage frequently, thus a poor quality, staring hair coat is a sign of poor health. Interestingly, rabbits with orodental disease have a 63 times greater risk of subsequently developing dermatologic disease. Skin biopsies, skin scrapings, microbiologic culture and sensitivity, and circulating steroid hormone and thyroxin levels may be evaluated to differentiate noninfectious from infectious causes of hair loss. Neurologic or apparent neurologic presenting signs are common in pet rabbits. As with musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to differentiate primary neurologic disease from other disorders that may produce neurologic signs. A thorough post-mortem examination of all systems is necessary to definitively characterize the cause of clinical signs suggestive of musculoskeletal disease.

AB  - Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by deterioration in kidney function resulting in multisystem abnormalities. Much of the morbidity and mortality associated with AKI result from a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This study described herein is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter US study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) treatment on AKI requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the ICU. The study enrolled 35 subjects. The mean age was 56.3?±?15. With regard to race, 71.4% of the subjects were Caucasian, 22.9% were Black, and 5.7% were Hispanic. Average SOFA score was 11.3?±?3.6. Death from any cause at Day 60 was 31.4%. Renal recovery, defined as dialysis independence, was observed in all of the surviving subjects at Day 60. The results of this pilot study indicate the potential for a substantial improvement in patient outcomes over standard of care therapy, which is associated with a greater than 50% 60-day mortality in the literature. The SCD warrants further study in scientifically sound, pivotal trial to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

AB  - Functional MR imaging (fMRI) based upon the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) effect is currently an important new tool for understanding basic brain function and specifically allowing the correlation of physiological activity with anatomical location without the use of ionizing radiation. The clinical role of fMRI is still being defined and is the subject of much research activity. In this report we present the underlying physical, technical and mathematical principals of BOLD fMRI along with descriptions of typical applications. Our purpose in this report is to provide, in addition to basic principles, an insight into the aspects of BOLD imaging, which may be used by the medical physicist to assist in the implement of fMRI procedures in either a hospital or research environment.

AB  - Abstract Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare disorder with cardinal features including hospitalization for vaso-occlusive pain episodes, acute pulmonary injury, and increased infection rates. For physician-trainees, learning optimal SCD management is challenging because of limited exposure to life threatening complications requiring timely interventions. Procedure To create, demonstrate reliability, and validate simulation-based, acute care SCD scenarios for physician-trainees, seven scenarios were derived from SCD patient cases. For each scenario, participants had 5 minutes to complete diagnostic and treatment interventions. Participants were divided into two groups based on clinical experience: interns or residents/fellows. Two raters scored performances using diagnostic and therapeutic checklists?indicating whether specific actions were performed and a global, 1 (poor) to 9 (excellent), rating. Scenario scores were calculated by averaging rater scores on each metric. Reliability was defined through uniformity in rater scoring and consistency of participant performance over scenarios. Validity was demonstrated by the performance gradient where the more experienced trainees outperform those early in training. Results Twenty-eight pediatric residents and hematology fellows took part in the study. Reliability for assessment scores overall was moderate. Performance on all but one scenario was moderately predictive of overall performance. Senior resident/fellows performed significantly better than interns. Positive associations existed between overall performance scores (P?<?0.01) and months of postgraduate training (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Mannequin-based simulation is a novel method for teaching pediatric residents SCD-specific acute care skills. The assessment provided reliable and valid measures of trainees' performance. Further studies are needed to determine simulation's utility in education and evaluation. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013;60:1492?1498. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
