AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Summary Deafness and peripheral neuropathy are relatively rare complications of carbon monoxide intoxication. A case of carbon monoxide intoxication is presented with bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, weakness and sensory impairment in the left hand, and weakness and atrophy of the left quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles. Audiograms showed hearing loss of the perceptive type followed by partial improvement. Electromyograms revealed a neurogenic pattern and motor nerve conduction velocity was decreased in both legs. The etiology of the deafness and peripheral neuropathy in this case is not clear but is suspected to be due to combination of toxicity, hypoxia and compression.

AB  - Abstract The study of wildlife health greatly contributes to understanding population dynamics and detecting conservation threats. The determination of the different fractions of plasma proteins (proteinogram) is an important laboratory tool to study wildlife health. The aim of this study was to characterize protein electrophoresis in wild Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) from north-western Patagonia and to evaluate differences according to age and sex classes. Once reference values of wild, apparently healthy individuals, were established, we compared these values to those of individuals received at the Buenos Aires Zoo in Argentina for rehabilitation due to various health problems. Reference proteinograms from wild Andean condors differed only in the α 1 and ? 2-fractions between sex categories. Males showed higher concentrations of these protein fractions than females. We found clear differences between wild birds and rehabilitating individuals. Total proteins, globulins, α 1-globulins, total α-globulins, ? 2-globulins, total ?-globulins, and ?-globulins were significantly higher in rehabilitating than in wild individuals, whereas albumin, α 2, and ?1-globulins were similar between these groups. The albumin/globulin ratio, as a general indicator of health, was significantly lower in rehabilitating than in wild individuals. The results indicate the effects on different protein fractions of pathologic processes occurring in individuals undergoing rehabilitation. Our results provide useful insights, contributing to improving diagnoses and prognoses in this species. This information may also be useful to assess the health status of Andean condors in studies of wild populations and for comparisons with other bird species.

AB  - Summary Acute liver failure (ALF) is a medical emergency. Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), an artificial liver support system, can partly compensate for the detoxifying function of the liver by removing toxins from blood. To analyze the efficacy of MARS treatment, the outcomes of 113 ALF patients, treated with MARS between 2001 and 2007, were compared with a historical control group of 46 ALF patients treated without MARS between 1995 and 2001. Overall survival of transplanted patients was 94% in the MARS group and 77% in the control group (P?=?0.06). Without transplantation, survival was 66% and 40% (P?=?0.03), respectively. However, the etiological distribution of ALF differed significantly between the groups. In ALF patients with unknown etiology, groups were comparable at baseline; 91% and 69% of transplanted patients survived the MARS and control groups and the native liver recovered in 20% and 8% of the patients, respectively. Of the originally nonencephalopathic patients of unknown etiology, 36% underwent liver transplantation in the MARS group compared to 100% in the control group. Interpretation of the results was difficult in toxic etiology patients on account of differing baseline statuses. MARS treatment might partly explain the trend toward increased survival of ALF patients with unknown etiology.
