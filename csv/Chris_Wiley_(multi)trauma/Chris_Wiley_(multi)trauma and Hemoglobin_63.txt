AB  - Many synthetic polymeric membranes have been widely used for blood purification therapies. Among them polyester polymer alloy (PEPA) membrane shows unique blood compatibility and filtration characteristics. Objective:? To evaluate blood compatibility and filtration characteristics of 3 different PEPA membranes, including FLX (PEPA only), FDX (PEPA with polyvinylpyrrolidone, (PVP) as a hydrophilic agent), and FDY (PEPA with PVP) that has larger pore diameter. Methods:? Ultrafilters with 3 PEPA membranes (FLX, FDX, FDY, Nikkiso, Tokyo) were compared with those with polysulfone (PS; NK-PS, Nikkiso, Tokyo) for blood compatibility in vivo. Also, ultrafilters with PEPA, PS, and cellulose triacetate (CTA; FB-110GA, Nipro, Osaka) membranes were also investigated for filtration characteristics of albumin in aqueous in vitro. Results:? FDY, the latest version of the three PEPA, showed excellent small changes in C5a concentration during the treatment right after switching from PS membrane, leaving no significant changes in other biocompatible indices. First 60?min of the time course of s.c. for albumin were shown below taken under aqueous low albumin concentration, i.e., 2.42???10?3?kg/dm3. The time-dependent patterns were totally different from each other in 5 filters. Generally speaking, PS takes a peak value 20?40?min after starting the experiment, depending on the flow conditions. Since PEPA is a hydrophobic material, it showed high s.c. for albumin in FLX (PEPA with no PVP) and never reached plateau. With a hydrophilic agent (PVP), the s.c. greatly reduced in FDX and showed little time-dependent change. By enlarging the pore diameter in FDY, the s.c. increased in accordance with the enlargement. Conclusion:? Newly developed PEPA with PVP has excellent blood compatibility and has unique separation characteristics for albumin.

AB  - A decrease in hepatitis C viral load in HD patients along HD sessions has been described. It has also been proposed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation by HD could have some protective effect in hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease outcome. Aims:? (i) Measurement of HCV viral load variation and quantitation of HGF stimulation in CKD patients (HCV+ and HCV?) on HD, along the HD session. (ii) Study whether albumin HD (MARS) decreases HCV viral load and stimulates HGF, compared to HD sessions. Methods:? We performed two MARS and two HD sessions in vitro by using an extracorporeal circuit with blood bag contaminated with HCV serum with a known HCV viral load. (We used only a single blood bag for each testing.) In vivo we performed three MARS sessions. The total number of treatments was 6 in 2 patients (3 treatments each) and one HD session in 2 HCV+ patients and 5 HCV? patients (included in HD program in our center), taking samples at the start of the following HD session, to compare the results with those obtained in vitro. We took samples at the beginning, middle, and at the end of MARS sessions in vivo and in vitro and starting (15?min) and at the end and before starting the following HD session in vivo. (The interval between 2 HD sessions in HCV+ patients was 2 days.) We determined HCV viral load using Amplicor (Roche) and HGF using ELISA (R 15?min, 1537; final, 1981 HD in vitro: start, 476; 15?min, 677; final, 1236 HD in vivo: start, 2808.57; ?15?min, >8000; final, ??2605.28; ?start the following session, 2299.5 MARS in vivo: HGF starting (first session, 4633; second session, ??4390; third session, 4775); at 4?h (first session, 5443; second session, 4167; third session, 5178); final (first session, 4477; second session, 6167; third session, 5078). Conclusions:? MARS and HD sessions decreased HCV viral load and stimulated HGF both in vitro and in vivo. It is necessary to confirm these results because it could offer protective effect for HCV chronic liver disease outcome. HD seems to be the best option for patients with HCV hepatopathy. On the other hand, patients with liver disease who need to be treated with MARS could obtain not only a good clearance of toxin binding to albumin, but also the positive effects described.

AB  - Healthy nutritional status is crucial for obtaining favorable hemodialysis (HD) and transplantation results in chronic renal failure (CRF), because there is a high incidence of malnutrition in these patients. In addition, there is a remarkable loss of amino acids (AAs) during HD. Purpose:? This study examined changes in the serum AA profiles of pre- and post-HD in order to plan a strategy for providing nutritional support to patients on HD. Method:? Twenty-nine stable male patients on HD were enrolled in this study. The criteria for patient selection were urine output less than 200?mL/day, 3 times HD a week, and HD treatment for more than 12 months. Results:? Total plasma AA concentrations of pre- and post-HD were 2948.4?±?543.1 and 2279.2?±?400.8?mol/L, the difference being highly significant (p?<?0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in the level of essential AAs (EAAs, 774.4?±?163.8 vs. 643.4?±?142.5??mol/L, p?<?0.0005) and non-EAAs (2019.0?±?411.7 vs. 1539.6?±?278.3 ?mol/L, p?<?0.0001) after HD. The ratio of the EAAs to the non-EAAs increased after HD (0.39?±?0.07 vs. 0.42?±?0.07??mol/L). The level of branched chain AAs (BCAAs) of pre- and post-HD was 323.3?±?73.7 vs. 286.7?±?71.2??mol/L and that of aromatic AAs (AAAs) was 180.9?±?56.2 vs. 137.5?±?42.6??mol/L (p?<?0.0005), and the BCCA to AAA ratio increased after HD (1.8?±?0.41 vs. 2.2?±?0.57??mol/L, p?=?0.01). Among the abnormal AAs which appear in CRF, the concentrations of ?-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, 1-methyl histidine, phophoserine, and taurine decreased significantly after HD. Conclusion:? Patients revealed a large loss of AAs including abnormal-appearing AAs during HD. The ratios of EAA to non-EAA and BCAA to AAA increase significantly, which indicates the beneficial effect of HD on the metabolic recovery of the AA profile. But replacing AAs, especially EAAs with high BCAAs, is essential for maintaining nutritional status to compensate the significant loss of AAs during HD.

AB  - Serum level of nitrite plus nitrate (NO2 plus NO3), endothelin-1 (Et-1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been estimated in 20 patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment in a trial to explain the hypotension occurring in some of these patients. According to the incidence of hypotension, patients were divided into GI (n?=?10) hypotension prone patients and GII (n?=?10) hypotension resistant patients (normotensive). Clinical examination with measurement of systolic and mean arterial blood pressure was performed in all cases before and after hemodialysis (HD) settings. After HD, GI showed significant increase in the serum levels of (NO2 plus NO3), IL-1, and TNF-α, whereas a significant decrease in serum Et-1 level was noticed. GII showed no significant change in serum level of the 4 parameters mentioned above. In hypotensive patients, there was a significant positive correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and the duration of dialysis, and a significant negative correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and post dialysis systolic blood pressure, also between IL-1 and Et-1. From the previous results, it could be concluded that the vascular endothelial factors studied (NO and Et-1) together with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α contribute to the development of HD-induced hypotension in ESRF subjects which is evidenced by: (1) the coupling of decrease of blood pressure and increase in NO2 plus NO3 level after HD in group I; (2) Et-1, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor, showed a significant decrease postdialysis; and (3) levels of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) (which are potent NO inducers) were found to be significantly increased postdialysis in group I.

AB  - Kinetics of urea extraction during a single dialysis session in children are unknown, because analysis of solutes in dialysate is difficult due to their extreme dilution. >Objective:? A novel urea monitor of the Gambro Company might be of help in studying urea kinetics also in children. Methods:? We studied 107 urea kinetics in 5 adolescents aged 13?19 years, weighing 26?58?kg, and looked for influences of membrane size, blood flow, and duration of one dialysis session. Urea measurement applies to the change of electric dialysate conductivity due to ionization because of urea splitting by urease. Bicarbonate dialysis regimen was 4?5?h each, 3 times a week, using polysulfone high-flux dialyzers (Fresenius F60 or F80, depending on body size). Results:? Average 4-h urea Kt/V values for F60 (n?=?85) were 1.69±0.53 and for F80 (n?=?21) 1.63±0.25, extracted urea mass was 16.0±5.4?g and 32.5±5.4?g, respectively (p?<?0.05); Kt/V urea results for blood flows of 180?220?mL/min were 1.36±0.52 and for <180?mL/min 1.10±0.43; extracted urea mass was 17.3±8.0 and 11.7±4.9?g, respectively (p?<?0.05). Total average urea extraction ratio after 2?h of dialysis (n?=?107) was 64.8±5.6%. Extraction ratio during the 4th h of dialysis was only 15.3±4.1% and during the 5th h not more than 9.0±3.6% of total urea extraction. Conclusion:? Kinetics of urea extraction helps understanding dialysis processes in children. Adapting the size of the dialyzer according to body size raises urea extraction and maintains urea clearance Kt/V at the desired quality level. An inadequate blood flow lowers both urea extraction and urea clearance Kt/V. Prolonging dialysis beyond 4?h is, at least in concern of urea kinetic modelling, a rather ineffective means. We speculate that children with blood flow problems should be dialysed more often.

AB  - Heparin is almost universally used as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis. Rare but serious side effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anaphylaxis, and these may lead to significant mortality and morbidity if left unrecognized. We are reporting a patient who developed HIT followed by an anaphylactoid reaction. This 8-year-old girl with Joubert's syndrome developed end-stage renal disease secondary to nephronophthisis. She had a Permacath double-lumen hemodialysis catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein and was started on hemodialysis using an Asahi B10 65 Dialyzer on 1/28/03. The platelet count at that time was 246???103/mL. Beef lung heparin was used for anticoagulation. She was admitted for living related donor renal transplant on 2/10/03 but was found to be thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 49???103/mL. The transplant was postponed, a sepsis work-up was performed, and she was started on antibiotics pending culture results. Hemodialysis was continued with heparin anticoagulation, and despite an improvement in the platelet count she had an acute anaphylactoid reaction 2 days later. The reaction occurred 20?min after starting her hemodialysis treatment and presented as acute onset of bronchospasm, agitation, and chest discomfort. She improved with nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous epinephrine. A review of her records revealed that she had received 6 hemodialysis treatments. The platelet count on 2/3/03, after 3 hemodialysis treatments, had been 242???103/mL and on 2/8/03 after 5 treatments the platelet count was 72???103/mL. HIT with anaphylaxis was suspected. Heparin was discontinued and the platelet count had returned to normal within 2 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive heparin-associated antibody test. While HIT is recognized as a complication in 1?5% of patients treated with heparin and has been well described in the literature, we could only find 2 reported cases of heparin-induced anaphylaxis and in both cases there was accompanying thrombocytopenia. This patient further illustrates a possible linkage between these two phenomena. HIT is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialysis and continued exposure to heparin may induce anaphylaxis.

AB  - Quality control of dialysis treatment has received wide attention since inadequate dialysis dose was an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Each 0.1 decrease in Kt/V less than 1.2 is estimated to increase the relative risk of death by 5?7%. A higher Kt/V can be achieved by increasing treatment time, using a larger dialyzer or increasing blood or dialysate flow rates. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to know, using online conductivity monitor (OCM) routinely, whether a certain subgroup of patients is being treated inadequately. 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFI and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Inadequate dialysis dose was considered at OCM Kt/V less than 1.2. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Watson volume (Wv) to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The OCM Kt/V weekly was inversely related to Wv (r?=??0.833, p?<?0.001). 20.8% of our patients are at risk of inadequate dialysis dose, and it reflects our current practice of dialysis prescription. All of them are anuric young men with a Wv?>?40?L. Specific efforts are required to deliver an adequate dialysis dose in this kind of patients. This can be achieved by altering dialysis frequency, increasing membrane surface, and/or increasing dialysis flow. OCM Kt/V device permits a daily dialysis dose delivery and, consequently, an individualized prescription. Prospective studies are required to establish whether adequate dialysis dose in patients with Wv?>?40?L may further improve their survival.

AB  - Abstract With the increased number of diabetics worldwide and the increased incidence of morbid obesity in more prosperous cultures, there has become an increased awareness of Charcot arthropathy of the foot and ankle. Outcome studies would suggest that patients with deformity associated with Charcot Foot arthropathy have impaired health related quality of life. This awareness has led reconstructive-minded foot and ankle surgeons to develop surgical strategies to treat these acquired deformities. This article outlines the current clinical approach to this disabling medical condition. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) frequently occurs in hemodialysis (HD) patients. But, clinical characteristics of UGIB in HD patients are not well reported yet. Objective:? This study was designed to compare the clinical characteristics of UGIB between HD patients and normal population with intact renal function. Methods:? This study enrolled 24 HD patients with UGIB. Age- and sex-matched 26 patients with UGIB and normal renal function were selected as control group during the same period. Of the cases with UGIB, esophageal variceal bleedings due to liver cirrhosis were excluded in this study. We investigated the results of treatment and UGIB-associated mortality for 3 months after the event and then compared previous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Sx), endoscopic findings, treatment results, and mortality between HD patients and control. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. HD patients (n?=?24) Control (n?=?26) p value Age (years) 60±11 61±11 0.702 Sex [male/female (%)] 62.5/37.5 53.8/46.2 0.536 Previous GI Sx ??[asymptomatic/??symptomatic (%)] 33.3/66.7 65.3/34.7 0.024 Endoscopic diagnosis ??[vascular ectasia/others (%)] 45.8/54.2 15.3/84.7 0.020 Primary treatment ??[endoscopic/medical (%)] 70.8/29.2 61.5/38.5 0.488 Results of treatment ?Success/rebleeding (%) 75.0/25.0 92.4/7.6 0.095 ?Patient survival/UGIB- ??related death (%) 83.3/16.7 100/0 0.046 Conclusion:? Previous gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent in HD patients than normal population with intact renal function. In contrast, HD patients had higher incidence of vascular ectasia and mortality than normal population with intact renal function.

AB  - Survival has been defined as an index of adequacy of dialysis. These hard data are the basis for comparing results obtained by different schedules or policies. The aim of the study was to assess mortality rate recorded within a system of tailored dialysis (1?6 dialysis per week in out-of-hospital settings: home hemodialysis, self- and limited care dialysis). Data recorded in a single center (1998?2003) were compared with data gathered in the Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation in the whole Region (1998?2000). Methods:? Out-of-hospital dialysis unit is active since 1971, in which a new program integrating self- and limited care and home dialysis started since 1998. Patients:? Incident dialysis patients starting renal replacement therapy within the program and all further patients starting dialysis in the Region in the same period were compared in an historical prospective cohort study. Results:? 55 patients in the Unit and further 1443 patients in the whole Region started RRT since 1998. Main features of 55 patients were 32 males 23 females; median age 51 years, range 20?76; 72.7% displaying at least 1 comorbid factor. Throughout the period gross mortality rate was 4/125 patient-years in the Center. Kaplan?Meier curves showed a 1-year survival of 100% vs. 91%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region, and a 2-year survival of 95.5% vs. 76.6%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region (p?=?0.001). The main demographic features were remarkably different in both settings (for the whole Region median age 66 years, range 2.2?101, at least 1 comorbidity in 56.9% of patients). In an attempt to correct for the different baseline characteristics, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The whole model resulted in statistically significant value (p?=?0.000) and an increasing mortality risk resulted for age at starting dialysis, diabetes, and collagenopathy. In conclusion, tailored, high-efficiency dialysis policy may allow superior survival results. A longer follow up is needed to confirm our approach; in larger cohorts, the finding of a low mortality rate in a relatively young population with high comorbidity may underline the need to review our current concepts on dialysis adequacy.
