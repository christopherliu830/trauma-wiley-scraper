AB  - Summary Fetal therapy is an exciting and growing field of medicine. Advances in prenatal imaging and continued innovations in surgical and anesthetic techniques have resulted in a wide range of fetal interventions including minimally invasive, open mid-gestation, and ex-utero intrapartum treatment procedures. The potential for maternal morbidity is significant and must be carefully weighed against claimed benefits to the fetus. Appropriate patient selection is critical, and a multidisciplinary team-based approach is strongly recommended. The anesthetic management should focus on maintaining uteroplacental circulation, achieving profound uterine relaxation, optimizing surgical conditions, monitoring fetal hemodynamics, and minimizing maternal and fetal risk.

All rights reserved Abstract: Superficial fungal infections are fairly prevalent in transplant recipients and the incidence increases with more intense graft-conserving immunosuppressive therapy. Majocchi's granuloma is a deep folliculitis caused by dermatophytes that involves deeper layers of the dermis. Only a few case reports of the condition have been documented in transplant recipients. After an extensive review of the medical literature, 21 cases were retrieved and are summarized here, together with a new case that occurred in a recent heart transplant recipient from our institution. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Majocchi's granuloma in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, with special focus on potential risk factors, offending pathogens, clinical presentation, therapeutic approaches, and outcome. General observations are presented emphasizing the relevance of close clinical and dermatologic follow-up in high-risk SOT patients with specific comments regarding treatment regimens and outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background The role of structured exercise in improving cardiometabolic profile and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (2DM) has been widely demonstrated. Little is known about the effects of an aquatic-based exercise program in patients with 2DM. Objective To evaluate the effects of a supervised aquatic-based exercise program on cardiometabolic profile, quality of life, and physical activity levels in patients with 2DM. Design and Setting Observational study, community pre-post aquatic-based exercise program, primary care intervention. Patients Eighteen men diagnosed with 2DM (52.2 ± 9.3 years). Methods and Main Outcome Measurements: Cardiometabolic profile, quality of life, and physical activity levels were assessed before and after 12 weeks of an aquatic-based exercise program. Results The results show a significant improvement of cardiometabolic assessments (maximum oxygen consumption: 24.1 versus 21.1 mL/kg/min, P < .05; blood pressure: 125.4/77 versus 130.7/82.5 mm Hg, P < .05; fasting blood glucose: 119.6 versus 132.5 mg/dL, P < .05; body mass index: 29.9 versus 31.1 kg/m², P < .005; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 95.2 versus 104.9 mg/dL, P < .05; and diastolic function: E/E? 9.1 versus 10.1, P < .005) and an increase in quality of life and physical activity levels (Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary: 72.3 versus 67, P < .05; Problems Area About Diabetes: 20.1 versus 33.2, P < .005) and energy expenditure in general physical activity (physical activity: 3888.7 versus 1239.5 kcal/wk, P < .05). Conclusions These findings demonstrate that an aquatic-based exercise program produces benefits for the cardiovascular system and metabolic profile and appears to be safe and effective in improving quality of life and increasing physical activity levels in patients with 2DM.

AB  - Abstract: Hepatitis C infection is common in patients receiving life-long blood transfusion therapy. Interferon-α induces long-term viral clearance in 25-30% of patients suffering from Cooley's anemia. Ribavirin, an orally active guanoside analogue together with interferon-α produces a sustained response in up to 40% of patients with cirrhosis, who had previously failed single agent treatment. Growth retardation in iron-overloaded patients is the result of growth hormone deficiency in up to 30% of patients. Height gain can be sucessfully achieved in these patients with growth hormone treatment. Pregnancy in women with Cooley's anemia is now a reality, and over 100 pregnancies have been documented. Conception may be spontaneous or the result of ovulation induction. Cardiomyopathy and diabetes require careful assessment in these patients before a decision is made to treat with gonadotrophins to induce ovulation.

AB  - Abstract The scientific knowledge base that supports clinical decisions about perioperative fluid management continues to evolve. However, despite these advancements in the understanding of the physiology of fluid replacement, the definition of ??optimal?? perioperative fluid management remains a matter of clinical judgment. With an appreciation of the many factors, both sensible and insensible, that contribute to changes in blood and extracellular fluid volume during surgery, clinicians have tried to create reproducible and generally applicable formulas for replacement of fluid during surgery. These formulas have been challenged recently by the introduction of new tools for monitoring cardiopulmonary function, by the implementation of monitor-guided protocols for fluid management, and, more recently, by clinical data suggesting that fluid restriction may improve surgical outcomes in some clinical settings. The relative ease of pre-identified fluid replacement protocols is being slowly replaced by data-guided interventions that take into account a variety of factors. Clinicians are therefore required to tailor their fluid replacement strategies based on preoperative patient characteristics, the type of surgery and even the type of anesthetic that is utilized. Some of the benefits of this new approach range from relatively ??minor?? outcomes such as diminished nausea after surgery to preventing postoperative complications such as wound breakdown and cardiopulmonary failure.
