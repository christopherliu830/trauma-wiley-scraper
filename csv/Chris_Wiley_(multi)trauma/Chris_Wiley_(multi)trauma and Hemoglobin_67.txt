AB  - Abstract Vulnerability and resilience are intertwined yet unraveling constructs in the allostatic load literature centered on stress-disease pathways. In examining this paradigm shift, this chapter focuses on allostatic load indices of multisystemic physiological dysregulations among marginalized populations. Social inequalities reviewed include early adversity, socioeconomic health gradients, race/ethnicity and discrimination, Brazil's shifting economy, the struggles of North American and Australian Indigenous peoples, and finally sex/gender diversity and sexual orientation as key determinants of allostatic load. We then present innovative biochemical, neurological, and cognitive approaches for future empirical consideration, with conclusions centered on clinical and social policy implications. In espousing a developmental psychopathology approach that emphasizes causal processes, developmental mechanisms, and diverse conceptualizations of health, we highlight allostatic load studies that focus on resilient pathways and how these trajectories can be promoted to protect populations otherwise considered vulnerable.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in pregnancy is most often encountered secondary to underlying obstetrical, surgical, or medical complications. The process of DIC is initiated through the activation of tissue factor (TF), which is found in subendothelial cells, amniotic fluid, and placenta. DIC is seen in severe forms of preeclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic complication in obstetrics and is associated with significant maternal mortality. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare disease associated with massive obstetric hemorrhage. It is characterized by accumulation of microvesicular fatty infiltration in the maternal hepatocytes, leading to liver failure. The diagnosis of DIC is clinical, based upon underlying etiology, blood loss, and the general condition of the patient. The basic principles of managing obstetrical DIC are multidisciplinary approach, treatment of obstetric causes, blood and blood products, and supportive care.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: The purpose of this article is to discuss the various factors related to poor outcome in free flap reconstructions of the head and neck (H&N). Free tissue transfer has become the standard reconstruction technique for complex H&N defects. With the evolution of free flap use in H&N surgery, numerous factors have been proposed that adversely affect flap outcome, many with the support of only anecdotal experience. We seek to critically review the literature to assess what evidence exists for the relation of various intraoperative factors to free flap complications. Study Design: Literature review. Methods: A review of the contemporary literature (1995 to present) on free flap reconstruction of the H&N was undertaken. A PubMed search using the terms head and neck, reconstruction, free flap, microvascular, failure, complications, fluids, intraoperative, hypertension, hypotension, nitrous oxide, temperature, and morbidity in various combinations was completed. Appropriate articles were selected and analyzed. Results: Studies report various factors thought to influence flap outcomes, often with divergent conclusions. Nonetheless, the body of evidence implicates several intraoperative factors to contribute to free flap complications including: >7 L intraoperative fluid administration, significant medical comorbidity, and prolonged operative time. There is no evidence supporting hypotension, pressors, colloids, and nitrous use in free flap failure. Conclusions: Although various dogmas related to the intraoperative care of free flap patients exist, including avoidance of hypotension and pressor use, there is no available clinical evidence to support these practices. Although free flap failure is uncommon, a better understanding of its causes is necessary to avoid this disastrous complication. Laryngoscope, 2010

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Multivisceral resection (MVR) is potentially curative for selected gastric cancer patients, supposedly at the cost of increased complications. However, current data comparing MVR to standard gastrectomy (SG) is lacking. Objectives Compare complications and survival after MVR and SG. Methods In a retrospective cohort of 1015 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, 58 underwent MVR and 466 SG. Groups were compared concerning their characteristics, complications, and survival. Results One hundred seventy-six patients had postoperative complications. Major complications were more frequent after MVR (P?=?.002). Surgical mortality was 8.6% and 4.9% for MVR and SG (P?=?.221). Older age, higher morbidities, and MVR were independent risk factors for major complications. The odds ratio for major complications was 5.89 for MVR with one or two organs and 38.01 for MVR with three or more organs. The pancreas was the most commonly removed organ and pT4b disease were confirmed in 34 (58.6%) of the MVR cases. Disease-free survival (DFS) was lower in MVR patients (51% vs 77.8%; P?<?.001), being worse according to the number of organs resected. In pN+ patients, DFS was worse after MVR. DFS was equivalent to pT4b and non-pT4b in the MVR group. Conclusions Increased morbidity and lower survival are expected for gastric cancer patients undergoing MVR.
