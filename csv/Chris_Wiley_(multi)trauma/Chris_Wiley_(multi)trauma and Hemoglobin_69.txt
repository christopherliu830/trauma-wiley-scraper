AB  - Abstract Severe thrombocytopenia poses a high risk for bleeding thus representing a relative contraindication for anticoagulation and therefore extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We herein report on a series of immunocompromised patients with severe thrombocytopenia undergoing long-term ECMO without systemic anticoagulation. We retrospectively identified seven adult patients with anticoagulation withdrawal for ≥3 days (range 5?317) during venovenous ECMO therapy due to thrombocytopenia < 50 G/L treated in a university-affiliated hospital from January 2013 to April 2017. All ECMO systems used were heparin coated. Overall, 530 ECMO days were observed, 404 (76%) of them without systemic anticoagulation. Platelet count during ECMO treatment was 24 G/L (median, range 1-138), ECMO duration was 35 days (5-317), and ECMO was run without any anticoagulation for 20 days (5-317). Altogether, five clotting events were seen leading to oxygenator exchanges. Bleeding was common including one fatal intracerebral hemorrhage. Altogether, 29 platelet concentrates per patient (7-207) were administered, which correspond to 0.8 per day (0.6-1.3). One patient survived ICU and hospital. In patients with thrombocytopenia, ECMO can be run without anticoagulation even for considerably long periods of time. Bleeding remains common, while clotting events seem to be rare. However, prognosis of this patient population undergoing ECMO support seems grim.

AB  - A technique for placement of a long-term arterial catheter that the author developed was used in 20 canine patients. The catheter was used for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. The technique involved the following steps post-sedation and placement of a local anesthetic: 1 Clipping and prepping of the medial aspect of the distal tibia and proximal metatarsal region; 2 Incision over the medial tibial malleolus just caudal to the cranial tibial muscle-tendon; 3 Blunt dissection of the space just caudal to the cranial tibialis tendon; 4 Isolation of the cranial tibial artery and loop placement proximally and distally; 5 Placement of a 3 Fr. polyurethane 4?8?cm catheter using a Seldinger wire technique; 6 Placement of a suture in the periosteium of the distal tibia and anchoring of the catheter with this suture; 7 Closure of the skin incision with sutures or staples; 8 Bandage application to hold the catheter in place. The entire surgical procedure was done using sterile technique. The catheter was able to be kept in place and working for up to 9 days (averaged 4 days). This compared favorably retrospectively over dorsalis pedis catheters that lasted only a maximum of 4 days. (average 1.5 days). Because of the size of the catheter (3 Fr.) it provided improved waveforms over that observed with the dorsalis pedis catheter (22?g) and its occlusion rate was very low (2 in 20). The cranial tibial artery catheter was found to be particularly effective because the catheter was able to be inserted several cm up the artery and the catheter was able to be anchored well. No major complications were observed with this technique. Because of its effectiveness it is recommended to be used routinely over femoral artery and dorsal pedis artery catheters.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication in the cat, carrying a mortality rate as high as 26% during initial hospitalization. In humans, the presenting laboratory values can be correlated with the length of hospitalization and survival. To our knowledge, no studies of this kind can be found in the veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of therapy and clinical outcome of cats with DKA based on laboratory values, and whether or not administration of sodium HCO3 had an impact on survival. Only completed medical records of cats treated at the Animal Emergency Center for DKA from January 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. All patients received a standardized protocol for treatment of DKA. Data collected included presenting blood glucose level, presenting venous blood gas values, whether or not bicarbonate therapy was administered, length of hospitalization, and survival. Median duration of hospitalization of survivors was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and comparisons between groups performed using the log-rank test. Differences in laboratory values between survivors and non-survivors were compared using a one-sided unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test. Twenty medical records fit the study criteria. There were 12 male and 8 female cats, of which 14 were released to owner care and 6 died in the hospital (5 euthanized). Median duration of hospitalization among survivors was 4.5 days. There was a trend toward increased hospital stay in cats presenting with a blood glucose >269?mg/dL (3 days versus 5 days; p=0.0685). There was a trend for nonsurvivors to have pCO2 <21.5?mmHg (p=0.063), and K+<3.65?mmol/L (p=0.063). Eight cats presented with HCO3 <10?mmol/L. Of these, 2 were administered sodium HCO3. In conclusion, there was no statistically significant correlation between presenting laboratory values and outcome of cats with DKA. Those presenting with a pCO2<21.5?mmol/L or K+<3.65 mEq/L may have a greater chance for morbidity. There does not appear to be an association between sodium HCO3 administration and outcome in these cats. Additional case evaluations would provide greater power in confirming the validity of these preliminary results.

AB  - Although myocardial injury can be a significant component of multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in association with septicemia in critically ill human patients, it is as yet an undefined clinical entity in equine septicemia. With septicemia as the leading cause of death in neonatal foals, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of MODS will be important in further improving survival rates. We designed a prospective study to establish normal ranges for cardiac troponin I (cTnI), T (cTnT) and CKMB mass in healthy 24?48 hour old foals, as well as septicemic neonatal foals seen over a 2-year period in a teaching hospital. We also performed a comparison of these biomarkers in surviving and non-surviving septicemic foals. Sepsis was judged on the basis of the presence of any of the 3 following criteria: blood culture positive at admission, admission sepsis score ≥11, or 3 or more sites of infection during hospitalization in foals ≤14 days of age. cTnI was measured by the ACCESS? (Beckman Coulter), cTnT was measured using the Elecsys 2010? Immunoassay (Roche), and CKMB mass measurements were performed using the Elecsys 2010?. Each parameter was described using range and 95th and 50th percentile. Comparisons were made for each parameter between normal and septic foals as well as surviving and non-surviving septic foals using the non-parametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Significance was set at p<0.05. There were 52 control foals and 38 septic foals of which 22 survived. Significant differences were documented for CKMB between septicemic and normal foals, but not for cTnT or cTnI. However, CKMB and cTnT were significantly lower in surviving versus non-surviving septicemic foals. The 50th and 95th percentiles alongside the ranges for the normal foal population were 0.14, 0.49, (0.01?0.51)??g/L for cTnI, 0.009, 0.03, (0.009?0.04)??g/L for cTnT and 2.3, 7.4, (0.4?9.3)??g/L for CKMB. Our findings suggest that myocardial injury is a component of MODS during septicemia in foals, and that quantitatively significant increases in CKMB and cTnT are seen in non-surviving septicemic foals versus survivors.

AB  - While potent analgesic agents, opioids reduce intestinal transport in the intestine, thereby increasing transit times and the potential for impaction colic. Methylnaltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, does not reverse the analgesic effects of morphine, and directly stimulates isolated smooth muscle strips in humans. Objective: To determine if N-methynaltrexone has an effect on contractile activity of the equine jejunum and pelvic flexure. Study Design: In vitro investigation using isolated circular smooth muscle strips. Animals: 8 adult horses (n=200 muscle strips). Methods: Increasing concentrations of N-methylnaltrexone were added to tissue baths in the range of 1?10?9?M to 1?10?5?M, and contractile responses were recorded for 3 minutes. Data was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA with statistical significance as P<0.05. Results: The administration of N-methylnaltrexone significantly increased the contractile frequency and amplitude at all concentrations relative to baseline (P <0.0001) for the jejunum. The response was greatest at 1?10?7?M (P=0.0005) with a mean difference from baseline of 0.341?mg/cm2. The highest concentration evaluated (1?10?5?M) had a mean contractile strength of 0.206?mg/cm2 which was significantly greater than baseline activity (P=0.04). A significant increase in contractile activity for the colon was detected at 3?10?6?M (P=0.027) and 1?10?5?M (P=0.002). Clinical Relevance: Potentially, this agent could be used in conjunction with morphine to provide more potent and effective analgesia without compromising intestinal function.

AB  - Abstract Objective To improve the techniques required to perform a stapedotomy without prosthesis (stapedioplasty). Study Design New infrared lasers were evaluated for potential use in otological surgery in guinea pigs. A prospective human trial of 34 primary stapes operations using the Argon ion laser was performed, with 11 stapedioplasties and 23 conventional stapedotomies as controls. Methods Laser?tissue interactions were evaluated for temporal bone and live guinea pig tissues, measuring crater histology and labyrinthine temperature elevations. Patients undergoing stapedioplasty had Argon ion laser cuts with endoscopic assistance made in the anterior crus and footplate to mobilize the posterior segment of the stapes while the anterior portion remained fixed. Results Diode laser (808-nm) vaporization craters and temperature elevations in the vestibule were suitable for clinical use. Overall, stapedioplasty patients' hearing was improved with air-bone gap closure to a mean of 8.3 dB (SD ± 9.8 dB). Conclusions Patients with anterior footplate otosclerosis are candidates for stapedioplasty preserving the annular ring and stapes tendon and eliminating prosthesis complications. High-resolution small endoscopes, coupled with Argon ion or diode lasers promise to improve stapes visualization, enhancing the ability to perform minimally invasive surgery on the stapes footplate.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Clostridium tetani infection is uncommon in dogs and cats. Up to this point in time just single case reports have been published in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of 13 dogs and one cat affected with Clostridium tetani. The medical records of the last ten year were reviewed. Dogs and cats that were identified as being infected with Clostridium tetani on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and/or bacterial culture from infected wounds were eligible for study inclusion. Thirteen dogs and one cat met the criteria for study inclusion. Six different breeds and mix-breed dogs were affected, German Shepherd dogs (n=4, 29%) and Labrador retriever (n=3, 21%) were the most frequently affected breeds. Observed clinical complications were ventricular aspiration pneumonia (n=7), laryngeal spasm (n=6), hypersalivation (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=3), and third degree AV block (n=1). Median days from onset of clinical signs until first signs of improvement were 10 days (range: 9?12 days). Median hospitalisation time was 18 days (range: 14?22 days). Six animals showed full recovery and 8 animals died or were euthanized. Death was associated with acute onset of ventricular tachycardia in 2 dogs, 1 dog died with non-responsive third degree AV-block, 3 dogs died after developing aspiration pneumonia, and 1 dog died of unknown causes.

AB  - The Rescue Glide Sked provides a practical means of moving a recumbent, non-ambulatory or injured horse from the site of an accident. Horses with serious injuries, displaying severe malnutrition or neurological symptoms, can be easily moved out of a stall or even down a trail to a horse ambulance for transport to a veterinary facility. It is a specialty cut piece of 8?? 4? recycled polypropylene with tie-down straps and steel attachment points for winch loading into an equine ambulance. A horse must be fully sedated during transport on the rescue glide to prevent further injury to itself or rescuers. Moving a recumbent horse is very difficult due to the weight of the animal, often causing damage to the head and eyes, and with many safety concerns for the rescuers (struggling, kicking). It may take 8 to 10 people to move a horse just a few feet, especially uphill or on high friction surfaces. Benefits of the Rescue Glide include that the plastic reduces the friction of the weight of the animal on the ground surface, so fewer people are needed to move the animal. The tough resilient plastic is flexible so it goes easily over obstacles such as logs, roots, or through ditches. It folds up around the animal's body to get through a standard stall door or tight spaces as might be encountered on a trail. The Glide may be attached to a winch, ropes pulled by human rescuers, or even vehicle (ATV, car, etc.) The practical use of the Rescue Glide has been demonstrated in numerous situations including severe limb injuries, neurological compromise, geriatric, recumbent/unable to rise, severe neglect/malnutrition, and recovery/removal of dead large animals. The equipment has been used at race tracks and riding competition events for transport of animals into ambulances, as well as by veterinary rescue response teams in trail riding accidents, pasture accidents, and severe trailer injuries. The Rescue Glide, in conjunction with an equine ambulance trailer, provides a safe and suitable means of transport of large animals to veterinary facilities and should be a part of the equine practitioner's emergency equipment.

AB  - The primary classes of drugs used for pain control in horses include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), the alpha-2 agonists, and the opiates, but each of these drug classes has significant adverse effects. Ketamine hydrochloride is a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the spinal cord and has been used in both dogs and humans to provide analgesia. The purpose of this study was to identify a safe administration rate for a continuous infusion of ketamine to awake horses and describe the clinical effects of this infusion. Six horses were administered a continuous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a low dose (0.4?mg/kg/hr) and high dose (0.8?mg/kg/hr). Each infusion took place over 6 hours and the horses were monitored during infusion as well as for the 6 hours post-infusion. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, activity level, and analgesic thresholds. Both the low dose and high dose rates were tolerated well by all horses with no signs of excitation or discomfort. Post-infusion heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased as compared to pre-infusion values (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) A significant increase in analgesic threshold was not identified. Subanesthetic infusions of ketamine to awake horses appear to be well tolerated and cause only mild changes in clinical parameters. Further research is needed to evaluate the analgesic potential of these infusions.
