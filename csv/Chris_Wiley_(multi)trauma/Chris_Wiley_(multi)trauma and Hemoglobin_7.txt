AB  - Abstract Sternal sepsis following median sternotomy is an infrequent yet devastating complication of cardiac surgery, leading to prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital expense, and a high associated morbidity and mortality. The development of sternotomy infection is multi-factorial. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies have pointed to a multitude of clinical and perioperative variables as being causative, with as many other studies presenting evidence to the contrary. This has led to confusion about which clinical variables should be modified so as to minimize the individual patient's risk for developing this severe complication. Other less obvious factors also come into play. Malnutrition, whether overt or subclinical, is not uncommon in cardiac patients. Immune competency is affected by operative trauma, as well as a variety of perioperative factors including underlying nutritional status, transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and anesthesia. This creates a complex milieu for the development of postoperative infection. In this review, the multiple risk factors of median sternotomy infection are studied and treatment options briefly discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the impact of acepromazine on the cardiovascular responses to three treatments for hypotension in dogs during deep isoflurane anesthesia. Study design? Prospective blinded randomized cross-over experimental design. Animals? Six adult (2.5?±?0.5?year old) healthy mixed breed dogs (24.2?±?7.6?kg). Methods? Anesthesia was induced with propofol (4?6?mg?kg?1, IV) and maintained with isoflurane. Each dog received six treatments separated by at least 5?days. Once instrumented, dogs randomly received acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) (Ace) or saline (equal volume) (Sal) IV and end-tidal isoflurane (E?Iso) was adjusted to achieve hypotension, defined as a mean blood pressure between 45 and 50?mmHg. Dogs randomly received dextran (D) (7?mL?kg?1) or lactated Ringer?s (LR) (20?mL?kg?1) over 14?minutes, or ephedrine (Eph) (0.1?mg?kg?1 followed by 10??g?kg?1?minute?1) throughout the study. Measurements were taken at baseline, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40?minutes. Data were analyzed with a Latin Square in two factors (Ace/Sal and treatment) for repeated measures, with further comparisons if appropriate (p?<?0.05). Results? E?Iso producing hypotension was significantly less following Ace (2.07?±?0.23%) than Sal (2.43?±?0.23%). No improvement in cardiac output (CO) was observed with D or LR. LR initially intensified hypotension with a significant reduction in SVR, while D caused a minor improvement in ABP. Eph produced a significant increase in ABP, CO, hemoglobin, oxygen content and delivery. Pre-treatment with Ace minimized ABP improvements with all treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1 IV) enhanced the hypotensive effect of isoflurane, although it maintained CO. Administration of LR significantly worsens ABP initially by further vasodilation. D caused minimal improvement in ABP. At the infusion studied, Eph effectively countered the cardiovascular depression produced by deep isoflurane anesthesia, but extremes in ABP associated with initial vasoconstriction prevent our recommendation at this dose.

AB  - Abstract Microcirculatory dysfunction is a critical element of the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock. In this Bench-to-Bedside review, we present: 1) the central role of the microcirculation in the pathophysiology of sepsis; 2) new translational research techniques of in vivo video microscopy for assessment of microcirculatory flow in human subjects; 3) clinical investigations that reported associations between microcirculatory dysfunction and outcome in septic patients; 4) the potential role of novel agents to ?rescue? the microcirculation in sepsis; 5) current challenges facing this emerging field of clinical investigation; and 6) a framework for the design of future clinical trials aimed to determine the impact of novel agents on microcirculatory flow and organ failure in patients with sepsis. We specifically focus this review on the central role and vital importance of the nitric oxide (NO) molecule in maintaining microcirculatory homeostasis and patency, especially when the microcirculation sustains an insult (as with sepsis). We also present the scientific rationale for clinical trials of exogenous NO administration to treat microcirculatory dysfunction and augment microcirculatory blood flow in early sepsis therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Photodynamic therapy (PDT) requires oxygen to cause cellular and vascular tumor damage. Tissue oxygen concentration, in turn, is influenced by blood flow and blood oxygenation. Real-time clinical measurement of these hemo-dynamic quantities, however, is rare. This paper reports the development and application of a probe, combining diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) for measurement of tumor blood oxygenation and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for measurement of tumor blood flow. The instrument was adapted for clinical use during interstitial prostate PDT. Three patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer received 2 mg/ kg motexafin lutetium (MLu) 3 h before illumination and a total light dose of 100 J/cm2 at 150 mW/cm. Prostrate blood oxygen saturation (StO2) decreased only slightly (?3%) after treatment. On the other hand, prostate blood flow and total hemoglobin concentration over the course of PDT decreased by 50% and 15%, respectively, suggesting MLu-mediated PDT has an anti-vascular effect. While it is certainly impossible to draw definite conclusions from measurements of only three patients, the observed differences in tumor blood flow and blood oxygenation responses during PDT can, in principle, be used to choose among tissue oxygen consumption models and therefore emphasize the potential clinical value for simultaneous monitoring of both parameters.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol and other substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are complex diseases that are postulated to have a polygenic inheritance and are often comorbid with other disorders. The comorbidities may arise partially through genetic pleiotropy. Identification of specific gene variants accounting for large parts of the variance in these disorders has yet to be accomplished. We describe a flexible strategy that takes a variant-trait association database and determines if a subset of disease/straits are potentially pleiotropic with the disorder under study. We demonstrate its usage in a study of use disorders in two independent cohorts: alcohol, stimulants, cannabis (CUD), and multi-substance use disorders (MSUD) in American Indians (AI) and AUD and CUD in Mexican Americans (MA). Using a machine learning method with variants in GWAS catalog, we identified 229 to 246 pleiotropic variants for AI and 153 to 160 for MA for each SUD. Inflammation was the most enriched for MSUD and AUD in AIs. Neurological disorder was the most significantly enriched for CUD in both cohorts, and for AUD and stimulants in AIs. Of the select pleiotropic genes shared among substances-cohorts, multiple biological pathways implicated in SUD and other psychiatric disorders were enriched, including neurotrophic factors, immune responses, extracellular matrix, and circadian regulation. Shared pleiotropic genes were significantly up-regulated in brain regions playing important roles in SUD, down-regulated in esophagus mucosa, and differentially regulated in adrenal gland. This study fills a gap for pleiotropy detection in understudied admixed populations and identifies pleiotropic variants that may be potential targets of interest for SUD.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim was to study risk-factors for vascular thrombosis and incidence of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in splenectomized children with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) at a single center. Procedure Pre- and post-splenectomy hemoglobin and platelet counts were recorded. Post-splenectomy lipid-profile, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and anti-coagulant-protein levels were compared to established controls. Echo-Doppler was performed for PAH. Results Twenty-six children with HS had undergone splenectomy; the mean age at surgery was 7.9?±?3.7 years. Nineteen of the 26 were prospectively investigated at a median duration of 4.5 years (range: 4 months to 19 years) following splenectomy. Thrombocytosis was observed in 19 (73%), whereas no patient had erythrocytosis at the last follow-up visit. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were not deranged (P?≥?0.3). Mean CRP levels (males: 2.8?±?0.5; females: 2.1?±?0.5?mg/L) were significantly higher than described for normal children (P?<?0.001). Six (23%) patients had a positive D-dimer assay. Protein S, anti-thrombin-III and fibrinogen were in range. A single patient had a borderline low protein C activity. Lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibody assays were negative. The mean tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) was 1.8?±?0.55?meter per second (range: 0?2.4). None had a TRJV ≥2.5?meter per second to suggest PAH. Conclusions There was no evidence of PAH, dyslipidemia, elevation of fibrinogen or a reduction in anti-coagulant proteins, at a median follow-up duration of 4.5 years following splenectomy in children with HS. However, elevated CRP level (42%), persistent thrombocytosis (73%) and elevated D-dimer levels (23%) were observed. These have been recognized as risk factors for cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:29?33. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

Economic Aspects Blood is a multifunctional transport medium of vital importance for the body of higher organisms. Its composition is very complex and includes various cell systems with peculiar functions, proteins, electrolytes, metabolites, and highly sophisticated mediator systems. Both cells and plasma, which can be separated by centrifugation, can be used as and further processed into medicines. Serum is the fluid remaining after coagulation of the blood. In this review, blood cell systems and plasma proteins are referred to and medicinal aspects including blood and plasma collection and processing are described. The medicines derived from blood and plasma, as well as basic research and clinical trials should keep an important place because of the medicine as a whole benefits extremely from transfusions and, in particular, hemophiliacs gain an enormous improvement of life quality and life expectancy.

AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - Background? The epidemiology of post-injury multiple organ failure (MOF) is reported to go through changes during the last 15 years. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of post-injury MOF in Australia. Methods? A 12-month prospective epidemiological study was performed in a Major Trauma Service. Demographics, injury severity (ISS), physiological, MOF status and outcome data was prospectively collected on all trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission; ISS?>?15; age?>?18, AIS head <3 and survival >48?hrs). MOF was defined by the Denver MOF score. Data are presented as % or Mean+/?SEM. Univariate statistical comparison was performed (Student t- and X-square tests), p?<?0.05 was considered significant. Results? Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria (Age 39+/?5, ISS 27+/?3, Male 60%), three patients (12%) developed MOF. The maximum MOF score was 5.7 +/?1, with duration of 2.3+/?0.7 days. Two patients had respiratory and cardiac failure, while one patient had failure of respiratory, cardiac, hepatic and renal systems. All MOF patients survived. MOF patients tend to have longer ICU stays (18+/?5.5 vs 7+/?0.8 p?=?0.17), were older (54+/?17 vs 38+/?5 p?=?0.4). None of the previously described independent predictors (ISS, base deficit, lactate, transfusions) were different when the MOF patients were compared with the non-MOF patients. Conclusion? MOF is not as significant a cause of late trauma death as previously reported internationally. Our preliminary data challenges the timeliness of the 10-year-old independent predictors of post-injury MOF. The epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the independent predictors of post-injury MOF requires reassessment for the Australian context.

AB  - Abstract Saturation transfer in cross-linked copolymer gels and excised intact and perforating trauma-induced cataract mouse lenses (4- or 8-week-old) were studied using intermolecular cross-relaxation rates (1/TIS(H2O); 1/TIS), monitored with f2-irradiation at ?8.79, ?4.00, and 7.13?ppm (?H2/2π???69?Hz). [1] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs dry weight [W (%)] profiles for hydrophilic copolymer gels were far steeper than those for hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the participation of an amount of bound water and a number of copolymer hydroxyl groups in the saturation transfer process. In contrast, the 1/TIS(?8.79?ppm) vs W (%) profiles exhibited little difference between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the major participation of molecular rigidity, i.e. W (%) in the saturation transfer process. [2] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) values for cataractous mouse lenses were larger than those for intact lenses, indicating the formation of large, immobile lens protein associates or aggregates containing a sufficient amount of bound water for the saturation transfer. [3] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs W (%) profiles for the hydrophilic copolymer gels exhibited similar characteristics to the intact and cataractous mouse lenses with regard to the saturation transfer process.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivatives have been used widely in the regeneration and repair of tissue, but a standard definition and preparation method for PRP are lacking. We developed a standardized method using platelet indices as quality-control indicators for PRP preparation. Twenty-one elderly patients (9 males, 12 females) with complex wounds were treated with standardized platelet-rich plasma (S-PRP). The platelet count in PRP after the second centrifugation was 1,069?1,436???109/L. We adjusted the platelet concentration in PRP after a second centrifugation to 1,000???109/L according to a formula using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The standardized preparation method that we developed gave S-PRP with a relatively uniform platelet concentration. The wounds of 21 patients showed accelerated healing after S-PRP treatment, and there were no obvious side effects during treatment. These data suggest that our preparation method of S-PRP, using platelet indices as quality-control indicators with platelet count of 1,000???109/L could be used for the treatment of complex wounds in the elderly. The preparation method of S-PRP proposed in the present study may be a simple and effective method of PRP quality control.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the transfusion, hemostasis, and coagulation. In patients receiving massive transfusion, studies show a survival advantage in patients who received a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cell (PRBC) during initial resuscitation. Studies originating from the military and civilian experience found that the optimal ratio of FFP:PRBC transfusion may be as high as 1:1. A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 FFP:platelet:PRBC versus a 1:1:2 ratio demonstrated improved hemostasis and fewer deaths from hemorrhage by 24 hours in the 1:1:1 group. There was no increase in respiratory complications in the 1:1:1 group, despite prior retrospective associations between increased FFP transfusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread microvascular thrombosis with activation of the coagulation system and impaired protein synthesis, leading to exhaustion of clotting factors and platelets.

AB  - Abstract Blood transfusion systems have contributed considerably to human health and welfare. Nevertheless, numerous problems remain, such as infection of hepatitis virus and HIV, blood type mismatching, immunological response, short shelf life, and costs. Blood substitutes have been under development for decades to overcome those problems. Some substitutes for plasma components are already established, such as plasma expanders, electrolytes, and recombinant coagulant factors. Herein, we specifically address the research and development of substitutes for the function of red blood cells (artificial oxygen carriers, or oxygen infusions) such as chemically modified Hbs, encapsulated Hbs, synthetic heme derivatives, and perfluorochemicals. Unexpected side effects hindered further development of the early artificial oxygen carriers and indicated the physiological significance of the structure of red blood cells. Well-designed and selected artificial oxygen carriers that meet requisite criteria will be eventually realized. They will provide remarkable innovation in conventional medical treatments.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review clinically relevant features of systemic oxygen delivery and consumption and the technique and use of venous oxygenation monitoring in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources Veterinary and human peer-reviewed medical literature including scientific reviews, clinical and laboratory research articles, and authors? clinical research experience. Summary Measurement of venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (venous oxygenation) provides insight into the balance between oxygen supply and tissue demand. In people, measurement of venous oxygen saturation can reveal decompensation that is missed by physical examination and other routinely monitored parameters. Therefore, measurement of mixed or central venous oxygenation measurement may help guide therapy and predict outcome of critically ill patients. In dogs, low central venous oxygen saturation has been associated with impaired cardiopulmonary function and poor outcome in several small studies of experimental shock or severe clinical illness, suggesting that monitoring this variable may assist the treatment of severe illness in this species as well. Conclusion Venous oxygenation reflects systemic oxygenation status and can be used to guide treatment and estimate prognosis in critically ill patients. Measurement of venous oxygenation in veterinary patients is feasible and is a potentially valuable tool in the management of patients with severe disease. This review is intended to increase the understanding and awareness of the potential role of venous oxygen measurement in veterinary patients.

AB  - ?? Emergent definitive care of orthopaedic injuries in critical patients may not be the best strategy. ?? Critically injured patients not in the operating room for life-saving procedures should be physiologically stable prior to major surgical procedures. ?? Patients with closed head injuries must maintain optimal parameters for best recovery. ?? Damage control orthopaedic surgery (DCO) is the most controversial and least understood concept in modern trauma surgery. ?? A damage control approach to fracture care in the multiple trauma patient has merit. ?? Literature (mostly retrospective and single center) is weak and can be interpreted as desired. ?? Early major fracture care may be beneficial 1 Need to define early 2 Need to define fracture fixation ?? Surgery is performed to improve the physiology of the patient. ?? External fixation and delayed definitive fixation for patients in the operating room. ?? Bedside application of external fixation or traction until the patient is physiologically stable for definitive care in patients not in need of life-saving surgery. ?? Develop a ?Risk Adjusted? orthopaedic surgery strategy for each patient.
