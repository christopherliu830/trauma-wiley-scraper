AB  - Abstract Background The metabolism of the essential trace element copper remains incompletely understood and, until recently, nearly ignored in acute medicine. Menkes disease was for long the only known copper deficiency condition, but several case reports and investigations conducted over the last 2 decades have shown that deficiency is more frequent than previously suspected, with devastating individual consequences and potential public health consequences. The copper needs in healthy individuals are 0.9 mg/d, which translates to 0.3 mg/d intravenously in parenteral nutrition; the present review aims at gathering actual knowledge. Method and results A review of literature was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane systematic reviews to identify the most recent information about copper deficiency and generate a narrative review. Copper deficiency has hereditary and acquired origins, the latter being the most frequent. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific but affect all organs and systems, particularly the hematologic (anemia) and the neurologic (myeloneuropathy) systems. Deficiency also affects the cardiovascular, cutaneous, and immune systems. Severe copper deficiency due to reduced absorption after bariatric bypass surgery has become frequent. Conclusion Deficiency is more frequent than previously recognized, probably because of changing nutrition patterns but also because of some treatments that have become very common such as bypass bariatric surgery and, in acute medicine, prolonged continuous renal replacement therapy. The patients may present with severe hematologic and neurologic complications that go untreated because copper deficiency was not considered in the differential diagnosis: These complications often need active intravenous repletion with doses 4?8 times the usual nutrition recommendations.

AB  - Our laboratory developed a customized solution containing various free-radical scavengers, energy sources, and vasodilators in an attempt to attenuate intestinal injury following an ischemic insult. This solution has been evaluated with beneficial effects following low flow ischemia and reperfusion using in vitro and in vivo models using intra-arterial and intraluminal administration. In both investigations, the solution minimized morphologic injury and decreased transmucosal leakage of albumin. Objective: To determine if the systemic administration of the solution (GI Boost) had any clinical effect on normal horses, and to summarize the outcome of horses undergoing colic surgery that received the solution intravenously and intraluminally. Animals: 5 healthy adult horses and at the time of submission the outcomes of 10 horses undergoing abdominal surgery for colic. Methods: 2 L of GI Boost was administered at concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 75% intravenously (IV) to 5 normal horses. Parameters evaluated included CBC, chemistry panel, blood pressure, and physical examination. In 10 clinical cases, GI Boost was administered IV (intra-op and post-op) and intraluminally via the enterotomy. Results: The administration of GI Boost did not produce any clinical or hematologic abnormalities in normal cases. None of the clinical cases developed any complications associated with the use of the solution. The majority of horses were discharged from the hospital and 1 died following large colon rupture. Clinical Relevance: The administration of GI Boost may have a beneficial effect in horses presented for colic. Additional cases continue to be acquired to determine if this solution has a beneficial effect relative to traditional methods of treatment.

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate whether ECG changes induced by hyperkalemia correspond with previously described changes. Design: Prospective Animals: Eighteen dogs and 22 cats with serum potassium levels >5.5?mEq/L as the result of various disease processes. Procedure: Once hyperkalemia was documented, the following data were collected: ECG (n=40), total magnesium (mg/dl) (n=18), total calcium (mg/dl) (n=31), and venous blood gas (n=20). Animals were divided into 5 groups based on expected ECG's changes associated with hyperkalemia (mEq/L): Group 1- 5.5?6.5; Group 2- 6.6?7.0; Group 3- 7.1?8.5; Group 4- 8.6?10.0; Group 5- >10.0. ECG's were interpreted to determine if the rate, rhythm and changes in the P-QRS-T complex were similar to those previously reported. Results: Twelve ECGs demonstrated changes previously described, while 28 did not: Group 1 (n=7)- 1/7; Group 2 (n=2)- 0/2; Group 3 (n=14)- 4/14; Group 4 (n=6)- 3/6; Group 5 (n=11)- 4/11. Many ECG abnormalities not previously described were also identified such as atrioventricular dissociation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Blood gas analysis revealed acidemia (19/20) with severe acidemia (pH<7.2) in the majority (16/19). Hypocalcemia was documented (5/13) and most of these patents (4/5) were in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia was documented in the majority of patients (10/18), though not in one particular group. Clinical Implications: It is difficult to establish typical ECG changes in patients with hyperkalemia, which represents a departure from the historical description. Hypocalcemia may be involved with ECG changes and arrhythmias in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia causes electrocardiographic abnormalities similar to those described with hyperkalemia and therefore does not explain the results of this study. There likely are complex interactions with electrolytes and acid base abnormalities that affect ECG formation.

AB  - Objective: To determine the amount of time required to reach the highest concentrations of oxygen at the patient's face and to determine what these highest concentrations of oxygen were with various non-invasive methods of providing supplemental oxygen using a commercial oxygen content analyzer. Procedure: Three healthy cats and 3 healthy dogs were each individually given supplemental oxygen by 6 different means, each done at 2 rates (5?L and 15?L per minute). The methods tested were: 1) Plastic sheet over conventional cage door (PSCD); 2) Blow-by where the tubing delivering the oxygen was held 8?cm from the face (BB); 3) Large plastic bag covering the patient (BAG); 4) Anesthesia induction chamber (AIC); 5) Synder oxygen cage (SOC); and 6) Crowe Oxygen E-Collar (COC). Prior to the testing, the commercial oxygen content analyzer (Mini-Ox) was calibrated. Results: Significant repeatable differences were consistently observed between the 6 methods of oxygen delivery. Results of both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rates consistently indicated that the highest oxygen concentrations were achieved with the anesthesia induction chamber and large plastic bag with oxygen concentrations reaching approximately 95% and 90%, respectively between 5 to 15?min. The BAG method had the advantage of allowing additional room for patient manipulation and the ability to place intravenous catheters while continuing to give supplemental oxygen. The plastic sheet covering a conventional cage door provided oxygen concentrations of 50% and 60% at 15 and 45?min, respectively. The Crowe Oxygen E-Collar achieved oxygen concentrations of 70% in 1.5?min. Blow-by was found to be the simplest method. It increased FiO2 to 40% within 2?min. The Synder oxygen cage was able to achieve 45% oxygen concentration within 30?min with an oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min. It was able to achieve 60% at 45?min (similar to the plastic bag on the cage). Conclusion: The order of effectiveness of providing non-invasive oxygen supplementation, from the highest to the lowest concentrations, was AIC, BAG, COC, PSCD, SOC, and BB. The fastest to the slowest increases in oxygen concentrations followed the same order at both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rate and they were BB, COC, AIC, BAG, PSCD, and SOC. SOC was the most inefficient means of providing oxygen while AIC, BAG and COC were the most efficient.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish reference values of respiratory mechanics and diffusion capacity in awake llamas for the interpretation and diagnosis of respiratory disease in critically ill camelids. The following procedures were performed in 10 healthy adult llamas (2?9 years; 100?204?kg): Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography and Pneumotachography (RIP) for the assessment of thoraco-abdominal synchrony and airflow obstruction (Hoffman, J Appl Physiol 2001;91: 2767?75), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and functional residual capacity (FRC) via helium dilution, esophageal balloon-pneumotachography to determine pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn), as well as Monofrequency Forced Oscillatory Mechanics (FOM) (Young, J Appl Physiol 1994;76:2467?72) to establish respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at the oscillatory frequencies of 1,2,3,5 and 7?Hz. RIP was further performed in 3 camelid patients to determine the cause of respiratory failure. The results of conventional lung mechanics, FOM (1?Hz), DLCO and FRC in healthy llamas are listed in the table below. Rrs at 1?Hz (closest to breathing frequency) was positively correlated with RL (P=.05). The calculated mean resonant frequency was 3.37 (+/?0.68) Hz. RIP results showed a peak difference between plethysmographic flow (V'sum) and nasal flow (V'n) of 2.61 (+/?1.02) during expiration (PEsf), and 2.48 (+/?1.04) during inspiration (PIsf). The area difference between V'sum and V'n was 0.05 (+/?0.14) and 0.05 (+/?.04) during the first 25% of expiration (SFEx) and inspiration (SFIx), respectively. Noninvasive evaluation of respiratory mechanics in clinical patients was essential to establish severity, type and progression of respiratory disease, especially in camelids presenting for upper airway obstruction, pulmonary disease or thoraco-abdominal asynchrony.

AB  - It has been recognized that a percentage of clone calves suffer from persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN). It has been proposed by some investigators that an imbalance between vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin (ET-1) and vasodilators (such as NO) are involved in the genesis of the problem. Additionally, some clone calves and human infants are refractory to more traditional therapy or require prolonged treatment for PPHN and these patients appear to have increased smooth muscle in their pulmonary small resistance vessels suggesting chronicity. ET-1 is a known mitogen of vascular smooth muscle. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate ET-1 concentrations in the blood of clone, the blood of their surrogate dams and in fetal fluids to investigate the utility of using these fluids for prepartum evaluation of the clone. Blood was collected from calves and their surrogates at the time of delivery into heparin tubes; the plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen until assayed. Fetal fluid samples were also obtained and frozen. Endothelin-1 concentration was determined using a commercially available RIA. Oxygen-dependent calves were those calves requiring, at a minimum, intranasal oxygen insufflation at rates of 5 or more L/min to maintain SPO2 values of >90%. Samples were obtained from a total of 40 calves; 13 calves were considered to be oxygen dependent and 27 calves were deemed non-oxygen dependent. Plasma ET-1 concentrations tended to be larger in oxygen-dependent calves (2-sample T test; p=0.16). Fetal fluid ET-1 concentration was significantly larger in the oxygen-dependent group (2-sample T test; p=0.0003). No difference between groups was detected in ET-1 measured in the blood of the surrogates; however, maternal blood ET-1 concentration was weakly but significantly correlated with fetal fluid ET-1 concentration overall (Correlation=0.456; p=0.007) and the correlation was stronger within the oxygen dependent group (Correlation 0.780; p=0.002). These data suggest that ET-1 may play a role in pulmonary function abnormalities in clone calves in the immediate post-partum period.

AB  - Abstract Objective To improve the techniques required to perform a stapedotomy without prosthesis (stapedioplasty). Study Design New infrared lasers were evaluated for potential use in otological surgery in guinea pigs. A prospective human trial of 34 primary stapes operations using the Argon ion laser was performed, with 11 stapedioplasties and 23 conventional stapedotomies as controls. Methods Laser?tissue interactions were evaluated for temporal bone and live guinea pig tissues, measuring crater histology and labyrinthine temperature elevations. Patients undergoing stapedioplasty had Argon ion laser cuts with endoscopic assistance made in the anterior crus and footplate to mobilize the posterior segment of the stapes while the anterior portion remained fixed. Results Diode laser (808-nm) vaporization craters and temperature elevations in the vestibule were suitable for clinical use. Overall, stapedioplasty patients' hearing was improved with air-bone gap closure to a mean of 8.3 dB (SD ± 9.8 dB). Conclusions Patients with anterior footplate otosclerosis are candidates for stapedioplasty preserving the annular ring and stapes tendon and eliminating prosthesis complications. High-resolution small endoscopes, coupled with Argon ion or diode lasers promise to improve stapes visualization, enhancing the ability to perform minimally invasive surgery on the stapes footplate.

AB  - Objective: To establish normal parameters of thromboelastography (TEG) in healthy adult cats. Background: Thromboelastography (TEG) is an in vitro test of coagulation that has been shown to be useful in humans, dogs and select species to identify and quantify alterations of hemostasis (e.g., hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states). It has also been demonstrated to be useful in monitoring effects of anticoagulant therapies. This test has not been evaluated in cats. Methods: Blood was collected from 25 clinically normal cats by venipuncture using a 21 gauge?3 1/2 inch butterfly catheter and syringe for medial saphenous or jugular venipuncture. A single 1.8?mL sample in 3.8% Sodium Citrate (9:1) was collected from each cat. Recalcified whole blood was analyzed 30?minutes following collection with the TEG? 5000 analyzer (Haemoscope, Niles, IL). Analysis temperature was 37.6°C. TEG parameters recorded included: R-value (represents initial fibrin formation), K (time from R to standard fixed measure of clot firmness which represents contributions of platelets and fibrinogen), maximum amplitude (MA; represents absolute clot strength), and alpha angle (α; the slope of TEG tracing which represents rate of clot formation). The coagulation index (CI) was derived from the formula generated for humans to provide an overall assessment of whether the sample was hyper- or hypocoagulable. Results: Values for the 25 normal cat samples are reported as mean ±2 standard deviations. R=2.97; 1.23?4.72; K=1.54, 0.38?2.71; α=70.70, 57.76?83.65; MA=58.50, 45.26?71.74 and CI=2.27, 0.07?4.46. Compared to historical information obtained on normal dogs, cats have significantly shorter R and K and larger α, MA and CI. Conclusions: TEG does have reproducible performance when used to evaluate coagulation status in normal cats. Compared to dogs, normal cats favor a hypercoagulable state. Species-specific normal values are necessary for interpretation of TEG results. This test bears potential value for use in future experimental and clinical work to investigate hemostasis in cats receiving anticoagulant therapies or in cats suffering from diseases such as cardiomyopathy which are thought to be associated with altered coagulation status.

AB  - Pulse contour analysis is a relatively new method of continuously monitoring cardiac output. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the human algorithm for calculation of continuous cardiac output from the pulse waveform, for use in anaesthetised horses. Cardiac output was measured in 27 anaesthetised clinical cases comparing lithium dilution (LiDCO) with a preceding, calibrated cardiac output measured from the pulse waveform (PulseCO) using a commercial system (LiDCOplus, LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge, UK). These comparisons were repeated every 20?30?min. Positive inotropes or vasopressors were administered when clinically indicated. Cardiac output values obtained ranged from 15.2?52.2?L/min, with cardiac indices from 30.7?114.9?ml/kg/min. Eighty-nine comparisons were obtained. The mean bias was 0.24?ml/kg/min +/?6.48?ml/kg/min. The limits of agreement were ?12.72?13.2?ml/kg/min. The 95% confidence interval for the upper limit of agreement was 12.07?14.33?ml/kg/min and for the lower limit of agreement was ?11.59?13.85?ml/kg/min. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.89 and produced an equation of PulseCO (mls kg?1 minute?1)=0.9226LiDCO (mls kg?1minute?1) +5.354. This method of pulse contour analysis is a relatively non-invasive and reliable way of monitoring continuous cardiac output in the horse under anaesthesia. The ability to easily continuously monitor cardiac output may improve morbidity and mortality in the anaesthetised horse.

AB  - A 15-point neurological score for foals was developed, and tested on foals (<8 days old) presenting to the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center (n=75) and the Royal Veterinary College (n=11). The score consists of 2 scales, which are added together to provide the total score. The points and descriptors for the first scale are as follows: Bright, alert, nursing, follows mare (0); Depressed, nursing, follows mare (1); Depressed, nursing, wanders away from mare (2); Depressed, standing, not nursing, will not follow mare (3); Recumbent, able to maintain sternal recumbency part of the time, strong suckle reflex (4); Recumbent, unable to maintain sternal recumbency, suckle reflex (5); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, responds to finger in ear (6); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, legs extended most of the time and muscles tense (7); Comatose, muscles relaxed, no response to finger in ear (8). Foals with a physical cause of recumbency (e.g., flexural deformity) are scored on this scale as if they were standing. The second scale is as follows: No seizure activity (0); Single seizure of less than 10 seconds (3); Single seizure of more than 10 seconds or two seizures of less then 10 seconds (4); Multiple seizures (5); Status epilepticus (7). All scores were assigned at admission by a single investigator. The median admission neurological scores for hospital survivors and non-survivors, and for blood culture positive and negative foals were compared with the Mann Whitney U-test. The correlation of admission neurological scores and arterial lactate concentrations (measured on a NOVA Stat profile M or CCX analyzer) and mean arterial pressure (measured indirectly with a tail cuff) was tested with Spearman's rho coefficient. Analysis of these data was performed using SPSS version 12. Results for all tests were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. The median neurological score on admission of all 86 foals was 4, and the range was from 0 to 12. The median score of survivors (2) was less than that of non-survivors (5) (p<0.001; n=86). There was no significant difference in median score between blood culture positive (4) and negative (3) foals (p=0.109; n=84). The neurological score was moderately correlated with admission lactate concentration (correlation coefficient 0.528, p<0.001, n=68), but only weakly correlated with mean arterial pressure (correlation coefficient ?0.285, p=0.011, n=78). This neurological score is statistically associated with clinically important parameters (hospital survival, blood lactate concentration), and warrants further study, including investigation of inter-observer variation in scoring.

AB  - Introduction: Mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs. When it results in congestive heart failure (CHF), MVD becomes an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Markers for determining the severity of cardiac injury and the heart's response to therapy might provide valuable information regarding the overall prognosis early in the course of CHF. This information might also provide a means for identifying those dogs with MVD that are at risk for CHF and those that might benefit from specific therapeutic interventions. In this study, we propose to investigate markers of cardiac myocyte injury in dogs that present in advanced (or Class IV) CHF due to MVD. Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and cardiac troponin T (CTnT) are markers specific for cardiac myocyte damage, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP and pro-BNP), for myocyte stretch. These markers have shown predictive value in human and veterinary medicine, however further investigation is required. It is our hypothesis that one or more of these markers will be elevated at presentation compared to established laboratory normal values. Methods: Fifteen dogs that presented with Class IV CHF due to MVD based on physical examination findings, thoracic radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound had a blood sample drawn to measure serum levels of CTnT, CTnI and BNP, and pro-BNP at a commercial laboratory using immunoassays. Results: Our results show that 1 of 15 dogs had an elevated CTnT, 6 had an elevated CTnI, 0 had an elevated pro-BNP, and 3 had and elevated BNP level above laboratory normal values. Conclusions: There was no consistent elevation of CTnI, CTnT, BNP or pro-BNP in dogs with class IV CHF due to MR at time of presentation. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate these makers in dogs with CHF due to MR at varying intervals after admission to determine their potential benefits as markers of cardiac injury and response to therapy.

AB  - Summary This chapter proposes a number of exercise-generated mechanisms to influence the iron status of an athlete including hemolysis, hematuria, sweating, gastrointestinal bleeding, and injuries. The need to supplement athletes with iron was first suggested by the evidence of changes in blood cell counts and iron-associated parameters during periods of intense training or, even more accentuated, at the start of the training. This condition is known as ?sports anemia? and is common in endurance athletes. The hematological changes that occur during intense training are paralleled by the fall in ferritin concentration, mirroring a depletion of the body iron stores, even though ferritin levels also depend upon a number of other factors such as liver disease, alcohol consumption, infections, cardiovascular disease, and aging. Other parameters that can be used to monitor the iron status include sTfR, red blood cells (RBC) protoporphyrin, and stainable bone marrow iron (hemosiderin).

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Clostridium tetani infection is uncommon in dogs and cats. Up to this point in time just single case reports have been published in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of 13 dogs and one cat affected with Clostridium tetani. The medical records of the last ten year were reviewed. Dogs and cats that were identified as being infected with Clostridium tetani on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and/or bacterial culture from infected wounds were eligible for study inclusion. Thirteen dogs and one cat met the criteria for study inclusion. Six different breeds and mix-breed dogs were affected, German Shepherd dogs (n=4, 29%) and Labrador retriever (n=3, 21%) were the most frequently affected breeds. Observed clinical complications were ventricular aspiration pneumonia (n=7), laryngeal spasm (n=6), hypersalivation (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=3), and third degree AV block (n=1). Median days from onset of clinical signs until first signs of improvement were 10 days (range: 9?12 days). Median hospitalisation time was 18 days (range: 14?22 days). Six animals showed full recovery and 8 animals died or were euthanized. Death was associated with acute onset of ventricular tachycardia in 2 dogs, 1 dog died with non-responsive third degree AV-block, 3 dogs died after developing aspiration pneumonia, and 1 dog died of unknown causes.

AB  - The Rescue Glide Sked provides a practical means of moving a recumbent, non-ambulatory or injured horse from the site of an accident. Horses with serious injuries, displaying severe malnutrition or neurological symptoms, can be easily moved out of a stall or even down a trail to a horse ambulance for transport to a veterinary facility. It is a specialty cut piece of 8?? 4? recycled polypropylene with tie-down straps and steel attachment points for winch loading into an equine ambulance. A horse must be fully sedated during transport on the rescue glide to prevent further injury to itself or rescuers. Moving a recumbent horse is very difficult due to the weight of the animal, often causing damage to the head and eyes, and with many safety concerns for the rescuers (struggling, kicking). It may take 8 to 10 people to move a horse just a few feet, especially uphill or on high friction surfaces. Benefits of the Rescue Glide include that the plastic reduces the friction of the weight of the animal on the ground surface, so fewer people are needed to move the animal. The tough resilient plastic is flexible so it goes easily over obstacles such as logs, roots, or through ditches. It folds up around the animal's body to get through a standard stall door or tight spaces as might be encountered on a trail. The Glide may be attached to a winch, ropes pulled by human rescuers, or even vehicle (ATV, car, etc.) The practical use of the Rescue Glide has been demonstrated in numerous situations including severe limb injuries, neurological compromise, geriatric, recumbent/unable to rise, severe neglect/malnutrition, and recovery/removal of dead large animals. The equipment has been used at race tracks and riding competition events for transport of animals into ambulances, as well as by veterinary rescue response teams in trail riding accidents, pasture accidents, and severe trailer injuries. The Rescue Glide, in conjunction with an equine ambulance trailer, provides a safe and suitable means of transport of large animals to veterinary facilities and should be a part of the equine practitioner's emergency equipment.

AB  - The primary classes of drugs used for pain control in horses include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), the alpha-2 agonists, and the opiates, but each of these drug classes has significant adverse effects. Ketamine hydrochloride is a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the spinal cord and has been used in both dogs and humans to provide analgesia. The purpose of this study was to identify a safe administration rate for a continuous infusion of ketamine to awake horses and describe the clinical effects of this infusion. Six horses were administered a continuous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a low dose (0.4?mg/kg/hr) and high dose (0.8?mg/kg/hr). Each infusion took place over 6 hours and the horses were monitored during infusion as well as for the 6 hours post-infusion. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, activity level, and analgesic thresholds. Both the low dose and high dose rates were tolerated well by all horses with no signs of excitation or discomfort. Post-infusion heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased as compared to pre-infusion values (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) A significant increase in analgesic threshold was not identified. Subanesthetic infusions of ketamine to awake horses appear to be well tolerated and cause only mild changes in clinical parameters. Further research is needed to evaluate the analgesic potential of these infusions.
