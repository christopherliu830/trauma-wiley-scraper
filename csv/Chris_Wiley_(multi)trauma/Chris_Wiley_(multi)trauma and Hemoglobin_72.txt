AB  - Abstract Objectives: The goal of this study was to compare the antegrade-approach and bilateral-approach strategies for chronic total occlusion (CTO). Background: The retrograde approach has been reported for difficult CTO lesions. Methods: This study assessed 96 consecutive patients with 119 CTO lesions. The lesions were treated with either an antegrade approach (A group) or a combined bilateral antegrade and retrograde approach (B group). The specific intervention techniques, in-hospital success rate, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were compared. Results: Lesions with well-developed septal collaterals with nontortuous microchannels were preferentially chosen for the B group versus A group (P < 0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Compared with the A group, there were more CTO lesions located in the right coronary artery in the B group (P < 0.001). In the B group, the CTO lesions had a longer length and needed stiffer wires for crossing than in the A group (P = 0.001 and 0.046, respectively). The technical success rate was 94% and 86% for the A group and the B group, respectively (P = 0.127). In-hospital complications were not different between the two groups. The B group needed a higher radiation exposure dose and a greater exposure time than the A group (P < 0.001). In the B group, use of the retrograde method significantly increased the final success rate. Conclusions: These results suggest that all CTO lesions should first be managed with an antegrade approach. When there is difficulty crossing the lesion, switching to a bilateral approach is an option for lesions with well-developed collaterals. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Clinical investigation of late onset Alzheimer's disease requires establishment of simple clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria as neuropathological confirmation is not possible in the ordinary victim. Explicit criteria for the selection of mildly impaired victims in a 4-month trial of treatment and the need for new, more careful methods of dementia typing are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis is increasingly applied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). However, there are a few long-term survival data of the inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) over 10 years. Aim.? To determine the long-term mechanical reliability of AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis in patients with ED. Methods.? A total of 438 consecutive patients with ED received implantation of an AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis at our institution from January 1991 to April 2009. In 397 patients (90.7%), the medical records were available and current status of penile prosthesis could be obtained by a direct telephone interview. The overall and mechanical survival rates of penile prosthesis were evaluated using Kaplan?Meier method. Main Outcome Measures.? Assessing the mechanical and overall survival rates of the AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis using Kaplan?Meier analysis, and looking for clinical factors related to survival of the CX/CXM using log-rank test. Results.? Mean age of 397 patients was 63.1 years (range, 24-93) and follow-up duration was 113 months (range 1-219). Eighty-two patients (20.6%) experienced mechanical failure at a median follow-up of 82 months. Mechanical survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 97.6%, 93.2% and 78.2% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. 12 patients (3.0%) experienced nonmechanical failure including infections, tissue erosion resulting in cylinder protrusion at the meatus and chronic discomfort. Overall survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 95.0%, 91.0% and 75.5% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. Patients with neurogenic cause for ED showed lower median overall survival of penile prosthesis compared with patients with non-neurogenic cause. Patient age, obesity, and diabetes mellitus had no association with overall survival of penile prosthesis after implantation. Conclusions.? The AMS 700CX/CXM could be accepted and applied in more patients as a reliable treatment alternative of ED. Kim DS, Yang KM, Chung HJ, Choi HM, Choi YD, and Choi HK. AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis has high mechanical reliability at long-term follow-up. J Sex Med 2010;7:2602?2607.

AB  - Summary Two subspecies of bison, namely plains bison and wood bison, can be found in North America. Response to anesthesia is similar in both subspecies and the discussion applies equally to both. There are wild populations of the European bison in Poland, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and the western Caucasus. This chapter focuses on North American bison, but it should also be applicable to European bison. The two most common sites for vascular access are the jugular vein and the coccygeal vein. Bison may require immobilization for a variety of reasons. Remote delivery of immobilizing agents necessitates the use of potent agents that can be delivered in relatively small volumes. Medetomidine-Ketamine combination has been used for immobilization of captive European bison. Xylazine-Hydromorphone-Telazol addresses some of the adverse effects of xylazine-telazol alone. The addition of hydromorphone to this combination decreases the telazol and xylazine requirements.

AB  - Objective:? To determine point and annual prevalence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Setting:? Reported prevalence of RAS in textbooks and much of the literature varies according to study location, patient selection and whether point prevalence (presence of lesions at examination) or period prevalence (history of lesions during a specified period) is reported. Many studies are based on non-probability samples and this may contribute to significant variation in reported prevalence and factors presumed to be associated with RAS. Methods:? We analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988?1994, a large United States probability sample, for RAS and covariates suggested in the literature using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results:? Oral mucosal examinations were performed on 17?235 adults 17?years and older. Of these, 146 (0.89%) had at least one clinically apparent aphthous lesion. For annual (reported) prevalence, Whites (20.87%) and Mexican-Americans (12.88%) had several fold higher prevalence of RAS than Blacks (4.96%). Adults younger than 40?years of age had almost twice the prevalence (22.54%) of those older than 40?years (13.42%). Conclusion:? Annual prevalence was significantly higher in whites and Mexican-Americans (compared with blacks), individuals 17?39?years of age, cigarette non-smokers, and those with recurrent herpes labialis history; while it was lower in males. Point prevalence was significantly higher in whites, Mexican-American, individuals 17?39?years of age, cigarette non-smokers, and males.
