AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review potential platelet storage options, guidelines for administration of platelets, and adverse events associated with platelet transfusions. Data Sources ? Data sources included original research publications and scientific reviews. Human Data Synthesis ? Transfusion of platelet concentrates (PCs) plays a key role in the management of patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Currently PCs are stored at 22°C under continuous gentle agitation for up to 5 days. Chilling of platelets is associated with rapid clearance of transfused platelets, and galactosylation of platelets has proven unsuccessful in prolonging platelet survival. Although approved by the American Association of Blood Banks, cryopreservation of human platelets in 6% DMSO largely remains a research technique. Pre-storage leukoreduction of PCs has reduced but not eliminated acute inflammatory transfusion reactions, with platelet inflammatory mediators contributing to such reactions. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Canine plateletpheresis allows collection of a concentrate with a high platelet yield, typically 3?4.5 ? 1011 versus <1 ? 1011 for whole blood-derived platelets, improving the ability to provide sufficient platelets to meet the recipient's transfusion needs. Cryopreservation of canine platelets in 6% DMSO offers immediate availability of platelets, with an acceptable posttransfusion in vivo platelet recovery and half-life of 50% and 2 days, respectively. While data on administration of rehydrated lyophilized platelets in bleeding animal models are encouraging, due to a short lifespan (min) posttransfusion, their use will be limited to control of active bleeding, without a sustained increase in platelet count. Conclusions ? Fresh PC remains the product of choice for control of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia. While cryopreservation and lyophilization of canine platelets offer the benefits of immediate availability and long-term storage, the compromise is decreased in vivo recovery and survival of platelets and some degree of impaired function, though such products could still be life saving.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the normal sequence of events in marrow function, the roles played by circulating cells in homeostasis, and on the adverse effects caused by exposure to various drugs and other chemicals leading to commonly observed hemopathies. The hair follicle's proliferative activity is matched only by the bone marrow and some parts of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast to the skin, the respiratory tract has no barrier, other than the bronchial mucous layer, against the entry of foreign substances into the body. The chapter also focuses on the parts of the endocrine system relating to thyroid and sex hormones in humans and laboratory animals that are of interest to toxicology. Clinical experience with immunosuppressive drugs indicates that the immune system usually has a high capacity to regenerate after exposure has ended.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of performing fetal brain magnetic resonance venography using susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). Materials and Methods After obtaining informed consent, pregnant women in the second and third trimester were imaged using a modified SWI sequence. Fetal SWI acquisition was repeated when fetal or maternal motion was encountered. The median and maximum number of times an SWI sequence was repeated was four and six respectively. All SWI image data were systematically evaluated by a pediatric neuroradiologist for image quality using an ordinal scoring scheme: 1. diagnostic; 2. diagnostic with artifacts; and 3. nondiagnostic. The best score in an individual fetus was used for further statistical analysis. Visibility of venous vasculature was also scored using a dichotomous variable. A subset of SWI data was re-evaluated by the first and independently by a second pediatric neuroradiologist. Kappa coefficients were computed to assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. Results SWI image data from a total of 22 fetuses were analyzed. Median gestational age and interquartile range of the fetuses imaged were 32 (29.9?34.9) weeks. In 68.2% of the cases (n?=?15), there was no artifact; 22.7% (n?=?5) had minor artifacts and 9.1% (n?=?2) of the data was of nondiagnostic quality. Cerebral venous vasculature was visible in 86.4% (n?=?19) of the cases. Substantial agreement (Kappa?=?0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.44?1.00)) was observed for intra-rater reliability and moderate agreement (Kappa?=?0.48; 95% confidence interval 0.19?0.77) was observed for inter-rater reliability. Conclusion It is feasible to perform fetal brain venography in humans using SWI. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;40:949?957. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Testicular vein thrombosis (TVT) etiology, recurrence, and survival were compared with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in order to determine whether treatment guidelines for DVT could be applied to TVT. Patients and Methods An inception cohort of patients with confirmed TVT (January 1995-October 2015) was compared to a control group of patients with lower extremity DVT matched by age, gender, and diagnosis date. Results Thirty-nine men with TVT were identified; 15 (38%) with isolated TVT. Left testicular vein was affected in 77% patients; there were no cases of bilateral TVT. Cancer was over twofold more common in TVT patients (59% vs 28%, P = .01). Most cancers (78%) involved organs in proximity to the testicular vein. Although TVT patients were less frequently treated with anticoagulants (49% vs 97%, P = .0001), recurrence rates were similar to DVT group (TVT 4.2 vs DVT 1.1 per 100 patient-years, P = .11). Despite higher cancer prevalence, survival rates were similar between groups (31% vs 28%; P = .34). Major bleeding events were rare (one patient per group). Conclusions Identifying TVT should prompt a search for a regional malignancy. Despite the high cancer prevalence and low utilization of anticoagulants, recurrent venous thrombosis and mortality rates are similar to DVT patients.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.
