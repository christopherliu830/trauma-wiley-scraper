AB  - 1 Ajay Gupta, and 2 Mohamad Mikati ( 1 Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon ) There is a unique, apparently heterogeneous, group of epilepsy syndromes in children that is characterized by sleep activation of the epileptiform abnormalities with nearly continuous sharp waves seen on the scalp EEG during sleep. These include commonly recognized childhood conditions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES), and benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC). Most of these children have a period of normal development and healthy childhood. Besides presenting with seizures that are often not too difficult to treat, these children have other major cognitive, behavioral and academic difficulties that are disproportionate to the burden of epilepsy and medications used to treat them. It is commonly believed that abnormal electrical activity in sleep per se leads to cognitive, behavioral, and academic difficulties in these children. However, the pathophysiological understanding of this phenomenon of sleep activation and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Moreover, there are also controversies regarding terminology, classification, and management of these disorders. Some experts believe that these conditions are distinct disease entities while others hypothesize that they may represent a spectrum of one condition. Similar sleep activation of epileptic discharges has also been reported in some other children with neuroimaging abnormalities in the deep gray nuclei. Some experts believe that the treatment with antiepileptic medications in these children should be titrated to the EEG response in sleep and not to the clinical response of seizures. It is unclear as to how often a sleep EEG should be done, and to what extent aggressive medical treatment and antiepileptic polytherapy be pursued. Use of steroids, recent success with high dose nightly benzodiazepine therapy, and surgical procedure like multiple subpial transactions in the insular regions continue to be controversial due to risk of serious side effects and modest benefits in reported anecdotal case reports and series. The focus of this symposium is to revisit these syndromes to: a) define the clinical spectrum of these conditions; b) formulate the best practices for management in the light of controversies in medical and surgical options; and c) discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders and probe future strategies for better treatment. Margret Shouse will show similarities between kindled epileptic kittens and sleep activation of EEG in children with these conditions. She will review the potential mechanisms and generators of EEG activity during sleep, discuss how the cognitive and behavioral sequelae may occur regardless of severe seizure burden. Edouard Hirsch will discuss the available clinical evidence to suggest that these ?disorders may be a clinical spectrum of one condition? and not distinct disease entities. He will also discuss diagnostic criteria and role of neuroimaging. Jim Rivello will review the available evidence, and emphasize the best clinical practices for management in these children. First, he will discuss the goals of treatment i.e. seizure control, behavior improvement, cognition monitoring, and sleep EEG improvement. Second, he will formulate a treatment and follow-up plan with indications for various medical (anti epileptic agents, steroids, nightly benzodiazepenes etc.) and surgical (multiple subpial transactions) options. Each speaker will also formulate an important research question for the future that will improve our understanding of these conditions for devising better treatment methods. Live interaction with the diverse group of audience will also provide a forum to discuss where and how we should move forward with a collaborative effort for advancing our knowledge and treatment of these conditions.

AB  - Abstract In this Editor's Review, articles published in 2018 are organized by category and summarized. We provide a brief reflection of the research and progress in artificial organs intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of these technologies and methods. Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration from all over the world. Peer-reviewed special issues this year included contributions from the 13th International Conference on Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support Systems and Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Perfusion edited by Dr. Akif Undar, and the 25th Congress of the International Society for Mechanical Circulatory Support edited by Dr. Marvin Slepian. Additionally, many editorials highlighted the worldwide survival differences in hemodialysis and perspectives on mechanical circulatory support and stem cell therapies for cardiac support. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our Publisher, John Wiley & Sons for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to reporting further advances in the coming years.

AB  - While neurovascular diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the leading causes of disability in the world, the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained remarkably limited. There is a dire need to develop new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic options. The study of proteomics is particularly enticing for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, which most likely involve multiple gene interactions resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Currently, rapidly progressing neuroproteomic techniques have been employed in clinical and translational research to help identify biologically relevant pathways, to understand cerebrovascular pathophysiology, and to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Future integration of proteomic with genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies will add new perspectives to better understand the complexities of neurovascular injury. Here, we review cerebrovascular proteomics research in both preclinical (animal, cell culture) and clinical (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialyates, tissue) studies. We will also discuss the rewards, challenges, and future directions for the application of proteomics technology to the study of various disease phenotypes. To capture the dynamic range of cerebrovascular injury and repair with a translational targeted and discovery approach, we emphasize the importance of complementing innovative proteomic technology with existing molecular biology models in preclinical studies, and the need to advance pharmacoproteomics to directly probe clinical physiology and gauge therapeutic efficacy at the bedside.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.
