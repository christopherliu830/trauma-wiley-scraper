AB  - SUMMARY In the current era of evidence-based medical practice, clinicians should ensure they have a good understanding of the potential benefits of and indications for potentially dangerous homologous blood component therapy. More attention is now being given to assessing the appropriateness of homologous transfusion therapy, with efforts to establish better evidence of improvements in patient outcomes. Such an approach allows for a more logical and realistic analysis of the risk/benefit equation in clinical management. In this summary of our current knowledge of the potential hazards of homologous blood transfusion, transfusion-transmitted infections are not addressed in detail, as most of the major problems relating to HIV and viral hepatitis have been solved and good reviews are available in the literature. In this review of the potential hazards of homologous blood transfusion, the focus is on many of the other areas of concern regarding the risk/benefit equation for homologous transfusion. Transfusion-related immunosuppression, the clinical significance of storage lesions, the potential adverse effects of leukocytes, error minimization, transfusion-related lung injury and less well-known immunological incompatibilities are addressed.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Given the anecdotal reports and case series suggesting that drug-eluting coronary stents [DES] may be still vulnerable to coronary thrombosis after six months, we sought to assess this risk in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery six months after stenting. Methods and Results: Linking the Rabin Medical Centre interventional cardiology database with its non-cardiac surgical database, we identified 78 patients who underwent DES placement and subsequently [after six months] had noncardiac surgery [15-vascular, 37- abdominal and genitourinary and 26-others, excluding ophthalmic surgery]. Outcome measures included 30-day rate of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI), DES-related thrombosis, and cardiac mortality. Major adverse cardiac events [death and non-fatal MI] occurred in 6 (7.7%) patients including 2 cardiac deaths (2.6%), 4 (5.1%) non-fatal myocardial infarctions (MIs). Two patients (2.6%) sustained stent thrombosis [one patient had ?definite? and one ?probable? stent thrombosis]. All MIs [including stent thrombosis] occurred in the vascular and abdominal surgery group. Two of the MIs events occurred while the patients were on dual antiplatelet agents. In conclusions: Perioperative cardiac events during non cardiac surgery after six months of DES deployment still occur. These cardiac complications [not entirely prevented by continued dual antiplatelet agents] remain a matter of diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and concern. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to use the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium to evaluate oxidative stress as a primary mechanism in the pathogenesis of degenerative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease. Materials and Methods: Forty-nine Sprague-Dawley adult female rats were used to generate the standard rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium. This was accomplished by daily air injections (20 cc) subdermally through the dorsal skin. Hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron (components of the Fenton reaction which generate free radicals) were introduced into the pouches of the 4-, 7-, and 14-day groups to generate oxidative stress. Control rats were injected with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.4. Either N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a powerful free radical scavenger, or ibuprofen were simultaneously injected with the Fenton reagents into the pouches of the 14-day treatment groups to modulate free radical-mediated protein damage to the synovium. Animals were euthanized at appropriate experimental intervals and biopsies obtained from specimens to analyze: (1) proteins' amino acid modification (carbonyl group formation), (2) protein hydrophobicity, (3) detection of low molecular weight protein degradation products, and (4) histological and gross anatomical observations. Results: Free radicals introduced into the rat air pouch interacted with synovial tissues causing oxidation and breakdown of proteins. Clinical evidence of adhesion formation consistent with features found in osteoarthritis of the TMJ developed. The groups subjected to oxidative stress experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and low molecular weight protein fragments. These groups also showed significant (p < 0.05) hydrophobicity changes consistent with free radical attack. Control synovial tissues were statistically undamaged. The 14-day NAC and ibuprofen treatment groups experienced statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in total carbonyl formation, carbonyls/protein, and hydrophobicity. Histological and gross observations in free radical damaged synovium exhibited features consistent with known arthoscopic and arthrocentesis findings in diseased TMJs. Conclusions: This study suggests that the rat air pouch model of facsimile synovium develops clinical evidence of adhesions and biochemical signs of protein modification when subjected to free radical attack. NAC and ibuprofen prevented carbonyl formation as well as hydrophobicity changes indicative of oxidative stress damage in facsimile synovium. These findings are consistent with features of degenerative human TMJ disease. Future direction may be taken from this study to postulate new analysis techniques and treatment modalities for patients with degenerative TMJ disease.

AB  - Abstract The clinical complications of Extracorporal Circulation (ECC) have been linked to disturbances in the microcirculation. In previous experiments we found in vivo an increased Leukocyte/Endothelial (L/E) cell interaction following ECC. As a therapeutical approach to prevent these deleterious effects a new agent, incorporating Hirudin and Prostacyclin, to coate the tubing system was used. Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used on the dorsal skinfold chamber preparation in syrian golden hamsters. ECC was introduced via a micro-rollerpump (1 ml/min) and a 60 cm silicon tube (1 mm inner diameter) shunted between the carotid artery and the jugular vein. Experiments were performed in chronically instrumented, awake animals (age: 10?14 weeks, weight: 65?75 g). Control tubes were uncoated, for the experiment a PEG-Hirudin-Iloprost? coating was used. Isovolemic ECC for 20 min resulted in an increase in rolling (BL: 9 % ± 2; after 4 h: 36 %* ± 5; mean ± SD, *p < 0.05) and adherent leukocytes (BL: 24 ± 26; after 4 h: 260* ± 51; mean ± SD; p < 0.05) in postcapillary venules. The use of the coated tube system resulted in a less pronounced induction of leukocyte/endothelial cell interaction (Roller: BL: 9 % ± 3; 4 h: 24 %* ± 12; mean ± SD, *p < 0.05. Sticker: BL: 28 ± 25; 4 h: 139 ± 111; mean ± SD; p < 0.05). Microhemodynamic parameters and functional capillary density were not significantly affected. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were stable. L/E interaction in the microcirculation has been established as an indicator of the systemic activation induced by blood contact to synthetic surfaces during ECC. Coating the extracorporal circuit reduced the increase in L/E interaction probably as a result of an attenuated activation of the coagulation-fibrinolytic system including a reduced platelet activation.

AB  - Abstract Background Jinlida granules are a commonly prescribed oral medication in China used in combination with antidiabetic drugs to lower blood glucose. The aim of this study was to systematically identify and pool the findings of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of Jinlida granules as add-on therapy for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods The China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wang Fang, PubMed, China biology medicine (CBM), and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) databases were searched for papers regarding the effects of Jinlida granules in T2D published before 1 July 2018. A pooled analysis of extracted data was performed using random-effects models. Results In all, data were retrieved for 15 studies including 1810 individuals. Decreases in HbA1c were greater in groups receiving Jinlida granules as add-on therapy compared with control groups (n?=?1820; mean difference???0.66; 95% confidence interval???0.72, ?0.60; P?<?0.00001; I2?=?38%). In addition, Jinlida granules reduced body mass index and had beneficial effects on homeostatic model assessment of ?-cell function and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. No obvious adverse events were reported. Conclusions Findings from this meta-analysis demonstrate additional benefits of Jinlida granules as an add-on therapy for T2D and that Jinlida granules are generally safe. Treatment with Jinlida granules provided clinically and statistically significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour post-load glucose, and HbA1c levels in patients with T2D. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and study limitations.

AB  - Summary The pathologic changes of preeclampsia can affect every organ system and consequently may significantly compromise both mother and fetus. Many of these end-organ and cellular changes affect decisions the anesthesia and delivery team make, from timing and route of delivery to type of anesthesia and postpartum care. This chapter reviews the evidence that should guide the care of a mother affected by severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, including the diagnosis of preeclampsia, management of acute hypertension, effect of regional and general anesthesia on both mother and fetus and the impact of common medical complications of preeclampsia, focusing on how they change anesthetic management and care.

AB  - ABSTRACT The elevation of tissue pO2 induced by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a physiological stimulus that elicits a variety of cellular responses. These effects are largely mediated by, or in response to, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). The major consequences of elevated RONS include increased oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant capacity, and modulation of redox-sensitive cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, these phenomena underlie both the therapeutic and potentially toxic effects of HBO. Emerging evidence indicates that supporting mitochondrial health is a potential method of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of, and preventing oxygen toxicity during, HBO. This review will focus on the cellular consequences of HBO, and explore how these processes mediate a delicate balance of cellular protection versus damage. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract A fistula between the pulmonary artery (PA) and the left atrium (LA) is a rare congenital heart disease that usually presents with cyanosis, clubbing, and dyspnea, as well as the signs and symptoms of a right-to-left shunt. Herein, we report a 16-year-old girl with a fistula between the right PA and the LA. This type of fistula could lead to systemic desaturation. This patient also had an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and has been followed up without treatment. The clinical manifestations and treatment of fistulas located between the PA and LA are also reviewed in this report.
