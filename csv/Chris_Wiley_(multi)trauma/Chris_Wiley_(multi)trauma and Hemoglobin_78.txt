Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.

AB  - Abstract:? This article reviews third-generation blood pumps, focusing on the magnetic-levitation (maglev) system. The maglev system can be categorized into three types: (i) external motor-driven system, (ii) direct-drive motor-driven system, and (iii) self-bearing or bearingless motor system. In the external motor-driven system, Terumo (Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A.) DuraHeart is an example where the impeller is levitated in the axial or z-direction. The disadvantage of this system is the mechanical wear in the mechanical bearings of the external motor. In the second system, the impeller is made into the rotor of the motor, and the magnetic flux, through the external stator, rotates the impeller, while the impeller levitation is maintained through another electromagnetic system. The Berlin Heart (Berlin, Germany) INCOR is the best example of this principle where one-axis control combination with hydrodynamic force achieves high performance. In the third system, the stator core is shared by the levitation and drive coil to make it as if the bearing does not exist. Levitronix CentriMag (Zürich, Switzerland), which appeared recently, employs this concept to achieve stable and safe operation of the extracorporeal system that can last for a duration of 14?days. Experimental systems including HeartMate III (Thoratec, Woburn, MA, U.S.A.), HeartQuest (WorldHeart, Ottawa, ON, Canada), MagneVAD (Gold Medical Technologies, Valhalla, NY, U.S.A.), MiTiHeart (MiTi Heart, Albany, NY, U.S.A.), Ibaraki University?s Heart (Hitachi, Japan) and Tokyo Medical and Dental University/Tokyo Institute of Technology?s disposable and implantable maglev blood pumps are also reviewed. In reference to second-generation blood pumps, such as the Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, New York, NY, U.S.A.), which is showing remarkable achievement, a question is raised whether a complicated system such as the maglev system is really needed. We should pay careful attention to future clinical outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials of the second-generation devices before making any further remarks. What is best for patients is the best for everyone. We should not waste any efforts unless they are actually needed to improve the quality of life of heart-failure patients.

Bertram 1 , Gary Mathern 2 , Helen Cross 3 and Maria Thom 4 ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom and 4 Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom ) Summary: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been synonymous with hippocampal sclerosis, such that the consensus is that the removal of the latter cures the former. There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.
