AB  - John W. Swann 1 ( 1 Pediatrics/Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Summary: Epilepsy research scientists and clinicians are collaborating in translating scientific discoveries into new therapies for the intractable epilepsies. Discoveries of clinical researchers are guiding the development of relevant animal models. Studies in these models are leading to the identification of what appear to be key molecular steps in the genesis of epilepsy. These molecular mechanisms provide new targets for the development of rationale therapies, which can be tested in these same models. As an example of the progress being made, this program will review the most recent studies of the consequences of prolonged febrile seizures in children. Potential targets for new therapies that have been discovered in models of febrile seizures, head injury, neonatal seizures and kindling will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract: Soft-tissue masses are rarely associated with Histoplasma capsulatum infection. We describe a heart transplant patient who presented with a large right-sided chest wall mass as a manifestation of disseminated histoplasmosis. A successful clinical outcome was achieved upon recognition of the fungal pathogen.

AB  - BACKGROUND Clinical trials have shown that longer red blood cell (RBC) storage duration does not worsen outcomes; however, these studies included few RBCs near the end of the 42-day storage limit. We tested the hypothesis that these ?oldest? RBCs are associated with adverse outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In a retrospective study, 28,247 transfused patients given 129,483 RBC units were assessed. Morbidity, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) were compared in patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored not more than 21 days versus patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 28 days or more and patients transfused exclusively with RBCs stored 35 days or more. RESULTS After risk adjustment, ≥35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.32; p = 0.002), but ≥28-day RBCs were not (adjOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97-1.15; p = 0.2). Neither ≥35-day nor ≥28-day RBCs were associated with increased mortality. In critically ill patients, ≥35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08-1.44; p = 0.002) and mortality (adjOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08-1.74; p = 0.009), but ≥28-day RBCs were associated with neither. In older patients, ≥35-day RBCs were associated with increased morbidity (adjOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42; p = 0.01), but not mortality (adjOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.96-1.71; p = 0.1), and ≥28-day RBCs were associated with neither. LOS was increased for both ≥28- and ≥35-day RBCs for all patients and the critically ill and older subgroups. CONCLUSIONS RBCs transfused in the last 7 days of their 42-day storage limit may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in high-risk patients.

AB  - Abstract Dendrimers have emerged as a powerful class of nanomaterials in the nanomedicine field due to their unique structural features: globular, well-defined, highly branched and controllable structure, nanosize-scale, low polydispersity, and the presence of several terminal groups that can be functionalized with different ligands simulating the multivalency present in different biological systems. Although in its infancy, the application of dendrimers as therapeutics or theranostic tools in central nervous system (CNS) disorders is already significant and has opened promising avenues in the treatment of many conditions where the inherent ?smartness? of the dendritic structures is being explored to effectively target the CNS. Here we present an overview of the past and future challenges of the use of dendrimers to respond to one of the ultimate challenges in the (nano)medicine field: to attain CNS repair and regeneration.
