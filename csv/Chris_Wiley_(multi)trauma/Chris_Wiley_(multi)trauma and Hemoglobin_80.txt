AB  - Abstract One of the most overlooked of all serious complications of diabetes is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. There is now clear evidence that suggests activation of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic patients and that these correlate with abnormalities in sympathovagal balance. Dysfunction of the autonomic system predicts cardiovascular risk and sudden death in patients with type 2 diabetes. It also occurs in prediabetes, providing opportunities for early intervention. Simple tests that can be carried out at the bedside with real-time output of information ? within the scope of the practicing physician ? facilitate diagnosis and allow the application of sound strategies for management. The window of opportunity for aggressive control of all the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular events or sudden death with intensification of therapy is with short duration diabetes, the absence of cardiovascular disease and a history of severe hypoglycemic events. To this list we can now add autonomic dysfunction and neuropathy, which have become the most powerful predictors of risk for mortality. It seems prudent that practitioners should be encouraged to become familiar with this information and apply risk stratification in clinical practice. Several agents have become available for the correction of functional defects in the autonomic nervous system, and restoration of autonomic balance is now possible.

AB  - Summary Stroke is the leading cause of disability and fifth major cause of mortality in US. Not all strokes result in observable clinical symptoms. The prevalence of silent strokes in the Framingham offspring study was about 10%. These ?silent? strokes, or perhaps less ?eloquent? strokes, are part of the white matter disorders related to cerebrovascular disease. The risk of stroke increases with age, doubling for each successive decade after 55 years of age. The goals of general emergency management in acute stroke are to stabilize the patient, facilitate cerebral perfusion, and prevent medical complications such as aspiration. A brain imaging study is performed in all patients with suspected stroke. Computer tomography (CT) is widely available, less expensive, and easy to perform, taking only a couple of minutes to scan the brain. The acute neurological complications of ischemic stroke include malignant brain edema, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke, and seizures.

AB  - Abstract Despite very significant technical and software improvements in flow cytometry (FCM) since the 1980's, the demand for a cytometric technology combining both quantitative cell analysis and morphological documentation in Cytomics became evident. Improvements in microtechnology and computing permit nowadays similar quantitative and stoichiometric single cell-based high-throughput analyses by microscopic instruments, like Slide-Based Cytometry (SBC). SBC and related techniques offer unique tools to perform complex immunophenotyping, thereby enabling diagnostic procedures during early disease stages. Multicolor or polychromatic analysis of cells by SBC is of special importance not only as a cytomics technology platform but also because of low quantities of required reagents and biological material. The exact knowledge of the location of each cell on the slide permits repetitive restaining and reanalysis of specimens. Various separate measurements of the same specimen can be ultimately fused to one database increasing the information obtained per cell. Relocation and optical evaluation of cells as typical SBC feature, can be of integral importance for cytometric analysis, since artifacts can be excluded and morphology of measured cells can be documented. Progress in cell analytic: In the SBC, new horizons can be opened by the new techniques of structural and functional analysis with the high resolution from intracellular and membrane (confocal microscopy, nanoscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and tissue level (tissomics), to organ and organism level (in vivo cytometry, optical whole body imaging). Predictive medicine aims at the detection of changes in patient's state prior to the manifestation of the disease or the complication. Such instances concern immune consequences of surgeries or noninfectious posttraumatic shock in intensive care patients or the pretherapeutic identification of high risk patients in cancer cytostatic therapy. Preventive anti-infectious or anti-shock therapy as well as curative chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation may provide better survival chances for patient at concomitant cost containment. Predictive medicine-guided optimization of therapy could lead to individualized medicine that gives significant therapeutic effect and may lower or abrogate potential therapeutic side effects. The 10th Leipziger Workshop combined with the 3rd International Workshop on SBC aimed to offer new methods in Image- and Slide-Based Cytometry for solutions in clinical research. It moved towards practical applications in the clinics and the clinical laboratory. This development will be continued in 2006 at the upcoming Leipziger Workshop and the International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry. ? 2005 International Society for Analytical Cytology
