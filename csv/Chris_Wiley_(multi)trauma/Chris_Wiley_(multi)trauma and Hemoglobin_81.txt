AB  - Abstract Poly([R]-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a natural biodegradable polyester, has attracted much attention as a new biomaterial because of its sustainability and good biocompatibility. In this study, it is discovered that PHB can be conveniently functionalized to obtain a number of platform chain architectures that may provide a wide range of functional copolymers. In a transesterification reaction, linear (di-hydroxylated) and star shaped (tri- and tetra-hydroxylated) PHB oligomers are synthesized, followed by copolymerization with 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate and quaternization with benzyl bromide to afford antimicrobial properties. The antimicrobial activities of the quaternary salts against clinically relevant pathogens on the interactions with outer and cytoplasmic membranes, lethal mechanisms, multipassage resistance, and synergy effect with antibiotics are investigated. Cationic PHB copolymers show effectiveness as antimicrobial agents, with minimum inhibitory concentration values 0.24?0.65 µm (or µmol dm?3) (or 32?128 µg mL?1) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Modifying the copolymer architectures into star shapes results in enhanced effectiveness to disrupt the membrane integrity. Synergistic effects are attained for all the quaternized PHB derivatives when they are used together with tobramycin. Multipassage resistance does not occur in both the linear and star derivatives against Gram-negative bacteria after 20 passages.

AB  - Summary Stroke is the leading cause of disability and fifth major cause of mortality in US. Not all strokes result in observable clinical symptoms. The prevalence of silent strokes in the Framingham offspring study was about 10%. These ?silent? strokes, or perhaps less ?eloquent? strokes, are part of the white matter disorders related to cerebrovascular disease. The risk of stroke increases with age, doubling for each successive decade after 55 years of age. The goals of general emergency management in acute stroke are to stabilize the patient, facilitate cerebral perfusion, and prevent medical complications such as aspiration. A brain imaging study is performed in all patients with suspected stroke. Computer tomography (CT) is widely available, less expensive, and easy to perform, taking only a couple of minutes to scan the brain. The acute neurological complications of ischemic stroke include malignant brain edema, hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke, and seizures.

AB  - I present a brief introduction to epigenetics, focused primarily on methylation of the genome and various regulatory RNAs, modifications of associated histones, and their importance in enabling us to adapt to real and changing environmental, developmental, and social circumstances. Following this is a more extensive overview of how it impacts our inheritance, our entire life (which changes as we age), and how we interact with others. Throughout, I emphasize the critical influence that stress, of many varieties exerts, via epigenetic means, on much of how we live and survive, mostly in the brain. I end with a short section on multigenerational transmission, drugs, and the importance of both social life and early life experiences in the development of adult diseases. There will be nothing about cancer. Although epigenetics is critical in that field, it is a whole different cobweb of complications (some involving stress).

AB  - Abstract We report an extremely rare manifestation of immunoglobulin G4-related disease, presented with hydrocele testis. A planned hydrocelectomy was converted to a high orchiectomy because of bloody fluid, suggestive of paratesticular malignancy. The histopathology showed vaginalitis, which was finally diagnosed as immunoglobulin G4-related disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of immunoglobulin G4-related disease representing hydrocele testis.

AB  - Abstract The level of plasma copper (Cu-PI) and zinc (Zn-Pl) and the level of erythrocyte iron (Fe-RBC), copper (Cu-RBC), and zinc (Zn-RBC) were determined in the blood of 70 normal donors and 138 patients with various solid tumors by diagnostic x-ray spectrometry (DXS), a technique based on x-ray fluorescence spectrometry analysis. There were no significant changes in the mean values of Zn-Pl, Fe-RBC, and Cu-RBC in the patients when compared with those of normal donors. The mean level of Cu-PI in the normal donors was 1.34 ± 0.37 ?g/ml; it was significantly increased in the patients, ranging between 1.47 ± 0.34 ?g/ml for patients without evidence of active cancer (NED) and 1.91 ± 0.76 ?g/ml for patients with hepatic metastases. The most significant change observed was an increase in the Zn-RBC found in the patients with clinical evidence of metastatic spread. Whereas the Zn-RBC level in the normal donors was 9.85 ± 1.47 ?g/g wet weight, and not significantly elevated in the NED patients, it was elevated to values of 11.37 ± 1.55 ?g/g (P < 0.004) for patients with soft tissue and hepatic metastases and was 12.34 ± 1.65 ?g/g (P < 0.001) for patients with bone metastases. The data suggest a clear correlation between Zn-RBC and metastatic spread in nonlymphomatous human cancer.
