AB  - Abstract Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug often used to treat multiple myeloma, can cause hypo- or hyperthyroidism. We present a patient being treated with lenalidomide for 2 years who developed severe hypothyroidism that was complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. Thyroid function tests should be serially monitored in patients taking lenalidomide.

AB  - Summary This paper describes the initial clinical experience of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) at the Fondazione Ca? Granda in Milan between January 2011 and May 2013. EVLP was considered if donor PaO2/FiO2 was below 300 mmHg or if lung function was doubtful. Donors with massive lung contusion, aspiration, purulent secretions, pneumonia, or sepsis were excluded. EVLP was run with a low-flow, open atrium and low hematocrit technique. Thirty-five lung transplants from brain death donors were performed, seven of which after EVLP. EVLP donors were older (54 ± 9 years vs. 40 ± 15 years, EVLP versus Standard, P < 0.05), had lower PaO2/FiO2 (264 ± 78 mmHg vs. 453 ± 119 mmHg, P < 0.05), and more chest X-ray abnormalities (P < 0.05). EVLP recipients were more often admitted to intensive care unit as urgent cases (57% vs. 18%, P = 0.05); lung allocation score at transplantation was higher (79 [40?84] vs. 39 [36?46], P < 0.05). After transplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD72 grade 3, 32% vs. 28%, EVLP versus Standard, P = 1), mortality at 30 days (0% vs. 0%, P = 1), and overall survival (71% vs. 86%, EVLP versus Standard P = 0.27) were not different between groups. EVLP enabled a 20% increase in available donor organs and resulted in successful transplants with lungs that would have otherwise been rejected (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01967953).

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews therapeutic phlebotomy and specialized apheresis procedures that target, for processing, specific fractions of the plasma or cellular compartment of the blood. Therapeutic red cell exchange can be performed manually or with programmable automated blood-processing (apheresis) instruments. Clinical studies related to transfusion management of sickle cell disease (SCD) focuses on simple transfusion or manual exchange transfusion. In clinical practice, therapeutic phlebotomy is an evidence-based intervention for disorders such as polycythemia vera and hemochromatosis. The chapter provides diagnostic elements of hereditary hemochromatosis. Thrombocytosis with thromboembolic complications is a feature common to chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP or photopheresis) describes a procedure in which circulating mononuclear cells are collected by centrifugal apheresis. Immunoadsorption systems employ the principle of affinity chromatography and make use of immobilized sorbents or ligands that have enhanced or specific binding affinity for a specific antigen, antibody, immune complex, or other substance in the patient's circulation.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to describe a single-center experience with neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal life support (ECLS) and compare patient-related outcomes with those of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry. A retrospective review of subject characteristics, outcomes, and complications of patients who received the ECLS at Penn State Health Children?s Hospital (PSHCH) from 2000 to 2016 was performed. Fisher?s exact test was used to compare the PSHCH outcomes and complications to the ELSO Registry report. Data from 118 patients were included. Survival to discontinuation of the ECLS was 70.3% and 65.2% to discharge/transfer. Following circuitry equipment changes, the survival to discharge/transfer improved for both neonatal (<29 days) and pediatric (29 days to <18 years) patients. The most common complications associated with ECLS were clinical seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and culture-proven infection. ECLS for pulmonary support appeared to be associated with a higher risk of circuit thrombus and cannula problems. When compared to the ELSO Registry, low volume ECLS centers, like our institution, can have outcomes that are no different or statistically better as noted with neonatal and pediatric cardiac patients. Pediatric patients requiring pulmonary support appeared to experience more mechanical complications during ECLS suggesting the need for ongoing technological improvement.

AB  - Abstract: Major clinically relevant findings have been extracted and summarized from the database developed from the international multicenter clinical trials of the intravascular oxygenator (IVOX) as a means for augmenting the deficient blood gas transfer of patients in advanced acute respiratory failure (ARF). Between February 1990 and May 1993, a total of 164 IVOX devices were utilized in 160 clinical trial patients who were hypoxemic and/or hypercarbic while receiving closed system positive pressure mechanical ventilator support at or exceeding generally accepted minimum safe levels of intensity. The average rates of oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer into and out of circulating venous blood by means of the IVOX device varied from 40?70 ml/min. Evidence of patient benefit during IVOX utilization includes improvement in blood gas partial pressures associated with decreased intensity of mechanical ventilation, improved hemodynamics in patients with mechanical ventilator depressed cardiovascular function, and decreased indices of lung dysfunction. Clinically recognized IVOX?related complications or adverse events were reported in 24. 5% of the clinical trials patients. At necropsy examination of 68 clinical trials patients who died during or after I VOX utilization, forensic pathologists reported 4 cases in which IVOX utilization could have been a primary or contributing cause of death. Significant IVOX device mechanical and/or performance malfunction problems were recognized in 29 (17. 7%) of the IVOX devices utilized in clinical trials. IVOX clinical trials data collected and analyzed to date indicate IVOX utilization has a favorable risk/benefit ratio in patients in severe, acute, potentially reversible ARF.
