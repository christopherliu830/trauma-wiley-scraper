PY  - 1999
AB  - Hepatic failure is a common feature of critical care. Most hepatic dysfunction in the ICU responds to medical management and metabolic support. The role of extracorporeal organ support in hepatic failure is not as well defined as it is in renal failure and pulmonary failure. Nevertheless, artificial organ support has been successful in the treatment of advanced liver failure. Hybrid bioartificial liver substitutes show great promise, especially as a bridge to liver transplant.

AB  - Abstract There are several determinants governing arterial and mixed venous blood PO2 and PCO2. Ventilation-perfusion imbalance, increased intrapulmonary shunt, and diffusion limitation to oxygen encompass the pulmonary factors. Alternatively, inspired oxygen concentration, overall ventilation, cardiac output, and oxygen consumption (uptake) are contemplated as the four most influential nonpulmonary determinants. All three pulmonary factors plus oxygen uptake cannot be directly modulated, but all the other remaining nonpulmonary determinants are. Inspired oxygen concentration, the amount and pattern of total ventilation, and cardiac output may be, at least in part, relatively well clinically controlled. Arterial PO2 (PaO2) may fall if inspired PO2, overall ventilation, and/or cardiac output decrease, and/or oxygen consumption increases, even though the pulmonary factors remain unchanged. Conversely, if inspired oxygen fraction, ventilation, and/or cardiac output increase, and/or oxygen consumption decreases, PaO2 may improve regardless of the changes operated at the level of the pulmonary determinants. Several pathophysiologic features deserve to be underlined. First, the importance of understanding the role played by mixed venous PO2 as a vital nonpulmonary determinant governing PaO2. Second, the response to 100% oxygen breathing repeatedly exhibits a consistent amount of agreement in the main findings. Third, there is always an interactive interplay between pulmonary and nonpulmonary determinants of PaO2 and arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) in any respiratory disease state following the use of pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic approaches. All in all both PaO2 and PaCO2 become the end-point outcomes of the complex interaction of pulmonary and nonpulmonary factors modulating pulmonary gas exchange. This needs to be unraveled to improve the understanding and management of most acute and chronic respiratory disease states. ? 2014 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 4:1455-1494, 2014.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains syndromes produced by the transfusion of incompatible blood. It considers haemolytic reactions due to causes other than incompatibility. By convention, red cell destruction is classified as either intravascular, characterized by rupture of red cells within the bloodstream and liberation of haemoglobin (Hb) into the plasma, or as extravascular, characterized by phagocytosis of red cells by macrophages of the mono-nuclear phagocyte system (MPS), with subsequent liberation of bilirubin into the plasma. Intravascular destruction may be produced by antibodies such as anti - A and anti - B that are readily lytic in vitro , although not all of the red cells are lysed in the plasma; some are sensitized and removed from the circulation by erythrophagocytosis, mainly in the liver. To ensure that haemolysis has not occurred ex vivo , the supernatant plasma of the unit or units of transfused blood should be inspected for free haemoglobin (Hb).

AB  - Abstract Since many years some effects of non surgical laser and light on biological tissue have been demonstrated, in vitro and in vivo. This review is based on the results obtained by me and my colleagues/follower in Italy. Aim of our study is to verify the anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects of non surgical laser and light therapy on patients with chronic diseases not good treatable with traditional therapies, as diabetes, and central nervous system injuries. In addition, many clinical data have emerged from double-blind trials on laser treatment of rheumatic diseases and in sports medicine. So, we would like to do a review on the state of the art of non surgical laser treatment in medicine, included aesthetic laser and light therapy field. We discuss the indications and limitations of aesthetic laser medicine, as concluded from the data analysis of the published literature and from over thirty years of personal experiences.
