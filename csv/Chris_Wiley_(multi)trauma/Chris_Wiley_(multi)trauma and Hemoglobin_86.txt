AB  - Abstract Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a simple and novel cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) technique, nasopharyngeal oxygen with intermittent nose-close and abdomen-compression (NPO2-NC-AC) in an animal model. Design: Prospective piglet study. Setting: In an animal physiology laboratory of a medical university. Piglets: Six healthy piglets <14 days old. Interventions: Spontaneous breathing of the anesthetized piglets (n?=?6) was medically ceased until severe bradycardia (<20?beat/min). NPO2-NC-AC CPR trial was then initiated by delivering NPO2 at 1.0?1.5?L/kg/min and intermittently performing the NC-AC maneuver: (1) NC for inspiration, occluded nostrils for 1?sec; and (2) AC for expiration, released nostrils, and compressed the abdomen for 1?sec. NC-AC was repeated at a rate of 30/min for 5?min. This CPR trial was repeated three times in each piglet. Cardiopulmonary variables were monitored, recorded, and compared. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 18 CPR trials were performed. All of these acute life-threatening asphyxia events rapidly improved within 1?min of CPR. Cardiopulmonary variables recovered to the baseline levels and oxygenation continually increased. The intratracheal pressure (Ptr) values of positive end expiratory pressure and peak inspiratory pressure values were 4.3?±?0.8?cmH2O and 26.2?±?4.1?cmH2O, respectively. Chest wall movement was observed when the Ptr reached 17.5?±?3.1?cmH2O. All six piglets fully recovered after 63.8?±?7.2?min of experiment without additional support. Conclusions: NPO2-NC-AC is a simple and effective CPR technique for severe acute cardiopulmonary asphyxia in piglets. It may be clinically applicable for supportive or rescue use.

AB  - Abstract Background Identification of peri-operative variables predicting postoperative morbidity may improve postoperative patients' care. We aimed to identify patients' characteristics and operative factors predictive of early (≤30-day) and late (≤6-month) morbidity in cervical cancer patients undergoing surgery plus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Methods We studied 45 propensity-matched patient pairs (90 patients) undergoing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) plus EBRT vs. abdominal radical hysterectomy (RAH) plus EBRT. Basic descriptive, multivariable and artificial neuronal network analyses (ANN) were used to design predicting models influencing outcomes. Results Baseline characteristics of the study populations were similar. Patients undergoing LRH experienced lower blood loss (200 (range, 10?700) vs. 400 (range, 100?2000) ml; P?<?0.001), shorter length of hospital stay (4 (range, 1?10) vs. 8 (range, 5?52) days; P?<?0.001) and similar operative time (235 (±67.3) vs. 258 (±70.2) min; P?=?0.14) than patients undergoing RAH. We observed that, at multivariate analysis, open approach correlated with overall (OR: 1.2; 95%CI: 1.03?1.46), early (OR: 1.14; 95%CI:0.99?1.3) and late (OR: 1.13; 95%CI: 1.001?1.28) postoperative complications. Conclusions Open approach is the main predictor for developing morbidity among cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Laparoscopic surgery enhances peri-operative surgical results and minimizes the occurrence of late complications. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014 110:893?898. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Since many years some effects of non surgical laser and light on biological tissue have been demonstrated, in vitro and in vivo. This review is based on the results obtained by me and my colleagues/follower in Italy. Aim of our study is to verify the anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects of non surgical laser and light therapy on patients with chronic diseases not good treatable with traditional therapies, as diabetes, and central nervous system injuries. In addition, many clinical data have emerged from double-blind trials on laser treatment of rheumatic diseases and in sports medicine. So, we would like to do a review on the state of the art of non surgical laser treatment in medicine, included aesthetic laser and light therapy field. We discuss the indications and limitations of aesthetic laser medicine, as concluded from the data analysis of the published literature and from over thirty years of personal experiences.

AB  - Abstract This chapter focuses on anemias resulting from bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes and on anemias caused by heritable defects in the glycolytic pathway and in the pentose phosphate pathways. The two broad categories of BMF syndromes are those that are acquired and those that are inherited. Advances in different areas of biology have already had impacts on the diagnosis and treatment of BMF and hemolytic anemias. Increasing knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms of how gene transcription is regulated and relevant mechanistic studies focused on genes associated with heritable BMF and hemolytic anemias promise to lead to new therapies. The chapter deals with those enzymopathies affecting red cell metabolism for which the molecular basis has been elucidated. It provides a brief overview of enzymopathies and provides information on deficiencies of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase - representative of disorders of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and nucleotide metabolism, respectively.
