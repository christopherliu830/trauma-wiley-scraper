AB  - Cerebrovascular imaging is of great interest in the understanding of neurological disease. MRI is a non-invasive technology that can visualize and provide information on: (i) the structure of major blood vessels; (ii) the blood flow velocity in these vessels; and (iii) the microcirculation, including the assessment of brain perfusion. Although other medical imaging modalities can also interrogate the cerebrovascular system, MR provides a comprehensive assessment, as it can acquire many different structural and functional image contrasts whilst maintaining a high level of patient comfort and acceptance. The extent of examination is limited only by the practicalities of patient tolerance or clinical scheduling limitations. Currently, MRI methods can provide a range of metrics related to the cerebral vasculature, including: (i) major vessel anatomy via time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced imaging; (ii) blood flow velocity via phase contrast imaging; (iii) major vessel anatomy and tissue perfusion via arterial spin labeling and dynamic bolus passage approaches; and (iv) venography via susceptibility-based imaging. When designing an MRI protocol for patients with suspected cerebral vascular abnormalities, it is appropriate to have a complete understanding of when to use each of the available techniques in the ?MR angiography toolkit?. In this review article, we: (i) overview the relevant anatomy, common pathologies and alternative imaging modalities; (ii) describe the physical principles and implementations of the above listed methods; (iii) provide guidance on the selection of acquisition parameters; and (iv) describe the existing and potential applications of MRI to the cerebral vasculature and diseases. The focus of this review is on obtaining an understanding through the application of advanced MRI methodology of both normal and abnormal blood flow in the cerebrovascular arteries, capillaries and veins.

AB  - Abstract This chapter focuses on anemias resulting from bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes and on anemias caused by heritable defects in the glycolytic pathway and in the pentose phosphate pathways. The two broad categories of BMF syndromes are those that are acquired and those that are inherited. Advances in different areas of biology have already had impacts on the diagnosis and treatment of BMF and hemolytic anemias. Increasing knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms of how gene transcription is regulated and relevant mechanistic studies focused on genes associated with heritable BMF and hemolytic anemias promise to lead to new therapies. The chapter deals with those enzymopathies affecting red cell metabolism for which the molecular basis has been elucidated. It provides a brief overview of enzymopathies and provides information on deficiencies of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase - representative of disorders of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and nucleotide metabolism, respectively.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.

AB  - Abstract Hemopoiesis-stimulating activity of various recombinant human colony-stimulating factors (rhCSFs) has been studied in four different preclinical animal models. The CSFs used were erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CSF, granulocyte (G) CSF, interleukin (IL) 3, IL-1?, and mast cell growth factor (MGF) or stem cell factor (SCF). Emphasis was placed on effects induced by combination treatment with varied pairs of the factors. Dogs and primates were chosen because of evidence of efficacy from earlier studies with the single recombinant human factors alone. The animal models chosen were: 1) isovolemic hemodilution to a hematocrit of 10% (or 20%) of dogs, splenectomized at least three months before start of the study. Additionally, the animals had been primed with Epo (or Epo plus IL-3) on three days daily or five days every other day before hemodilution. 2) Total body irradiation (TBI) of dogs (2.4 Gy) followed by daily treatment with IL-1? (d1-7) plus Epo administered daily over three weeks. 3) TBI of rhesus monkeys (4.5 Gy) and daily treatment with IL-3 and GM-CSF over three weeks. 4) Treatment of healthy normal cynomolgus monkeys with various factor combinations over about two or three weeks. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Priming with Epo before blood loss (withdrawal) allows a strikingly enhanced recovery of hematocrit and other hematological parameters. Further evaluation of the role of concomitantly applied CSFs (e.g., IL-3, GM-CSF or G-CSF) on the restoration of immune functions would be desirable. 2) Single CSFs and preferentially factor combinations are valuable agents to reduce irradiation injury and to enhance recovery from bone marrow hypoplasia. 3) Treatment of healthy animals with selected CSF combinations results in a stronger hemopoietic stimulation than with single factors alone. Some particular combinations even stimulate platelet production, e.g., IL-3/GM-CSF, GM-CSF/Epo or G-CSF/IL-3. The results obtained indicate that stimulatory responses of hemopoiesis in normal animals cannot always be compared with the effects seen in compromised animals. It is assumed that the preclinical data obtained in compromised animals may perhaps more realistically reflect what is eventually to be expected in future clinical studies.

AB  - Hypoxia is a critical hallmark of glioma, and significantly compromises treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, techniques for monitoring glioma pO2 to facilitate translational research are lacking. Furthermore, poor prognosis of patients with malignant glioma, in particular glioblastoma multiforme, warrant effective strategies that can inhibit hypoxia and improve treatment outcome. EPR oximetry using implantable resonators was implemented for monitoring pO2 in normal cerebral tissue and U251 glioma in mice. Breathing carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2) was tested for hyperoxia in the normal brain and glioma xenografts. A new strategy to inhibit glioma growth by rationally combining gemcitabine and MK-8776, a cell cycle checkpoint inhibitor, was also investigated. The mean pO2 of left and right hemisphere were ?56?69 mmHg in the normal cerebral tissue of mice. The mean baseline pO2 of U251 glioma on the first and fifth day of measurement was 21.9 ± 3.7 and 14.1 ± 2.4 mmHg, respectively. The mean brain pO2 including glioma increased by at least 100% on carbogen inhalation, although the response varied between the animals over days. Treatment with gemcitabine + MK-8776 significantly increased pO2 and inhibited glioma growth assessed by MRI. In conclusion, EPR oximetry with implantable resonators can be used to monitor the efficacy of carbogen inhalation and chemotherapy on orthotopic glioma in mice. The increase in glioma pO2 of mice breathing carbogen can be used to improve treatment outcome. The treatment with gemcitabine + MK-8776 is a promising strategy that warrants further investigation.
