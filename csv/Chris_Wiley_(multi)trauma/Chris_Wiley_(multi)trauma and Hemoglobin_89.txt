AB  - Cutaneous small blue cell tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms whose differential includes primary adnexal, neuroendocrine and lymphoproliferative tumors, as well as metastatic lesions. Another entity to be considered in the differential is Ewing?s sarcoma (ES)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). We present a 19-year-old female who developed a solitary, subcutaneous mass on her back. Histology revealed a poorly differentiated, cellular, nodular neoplasm of small, blue cells containing round to ovoid, vesicular nuclei with indistinct nucleoli and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive for antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Cam 5.2 and CD99. Overall, the lesion resembled an malignant spiradenoma (spiradenocarcinoma). CD99 reactivity prompted analysis with dual-color interphase FISH for translocations involving (22q12), which was positive, a sensitive marker for ES/PNET. Our case demonstrates that a diagnosis of ES/PNET should be considered in the differential of primary cutaneous blue cell tumors. These lesions are difficult to distinguish from other cutaneous small blue cell tumors due to their rarity and because the diagnosis is often not considered at this site.

AB  - We present the case of a 27 year-old female with a linear array of brown keratotic papules with a raised nodule within, located in the right mid upper inner thigh. A biopsy of the nodule showed a superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent excision of the entire lesion showed an epidermal nevus without residual carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas developing within an epidermal nevus constitute an unusual association, mostly occurring in long standing lesions of elderly patients. Other epithelial neoplasms described arising within epidermal nevi include basal cell carcinomas, malignant eccrine tumors and keratoacanthomas. Although our patient did not have an identifiable epidermal nevus syndrome, the presence of a squamous cell carcinoma within an epidermal nevus in a young person suggests increased susceptibility to tumor development. Moreover, chromosomal aberrations have been described in epidermal nevi, including chromosomal breakage and variegated translocation mosaicism. We suggest that the presence of an epidermal nevus should alert the clinician for the potential development of a malignant neoplasm within it, including squamous cell carcinoma, even in the absence of an identifiable hamartoma-neoplasm syndrome.

AB  - Although some classic differences exist histologically between malignant and benign CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, the distinction can only be made by correlation with the patient?s clinical course. There has been limited investigation into the genetic abnormalities seen in this class of disorders. Cutaneous ALCL has been shown to exhibit increased expression of JunB, but differences in expression of JunB between c-ALCL and benign CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders have yet to be evaluated. A study to determine the prevalence of JunB coexpression in CD30-positive cells of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and benign CD30-positive disorders of the skin was undertaken. The two c-ALCL cases had an average of 98.3%(+/? 0.7%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB and the seven benign CD30-positive disorders exhibited an average of 88.9%(+/? 7.4%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB. There was a trend towards lower JunB and CD30 coexpression with benign CD30 lesions compared to cutaneous ALCL, but with our limited sample size, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Further investigation is needed to more fully evaluate the sensitivity of the expression of JunB and other proteins as markers for clinical behavior in CD-30 positive lymphoproliferative disorders.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was admitted to the hospital for change in mental status. She had a splenectomy five years prior to admission. The white blood cell count was 154,000 cells/microliter with 95% lymphocytes and 4% neutrophils. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis and Candida krusei. She developed a wrist lesion at the site of a previous arterial line. The lesion had a striking resemblance to a bulls-eye, with three distinct concentric zones. A bedside touch preparation rapidly processed with Periodic Acid Schiff staining demonstrated a single intact aseptate broad hypha. Punch biopsy specimens demonstrated broad, aseptate hyphae throughout the dermis and subcutis invading both blood vessels and interstitum. A skin biopsy specimen sent for fungal culture grew Rhizopus arrhizus. Cutaneous zygomycosis is a rare, devastating disease that can occur in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. This case illustrates a distinct morphology, which we have coined the ?bulls-eye infarct of cutaneous zygomycosis?. Recognition of this unique appearance allows a rapid bedside diagnosis of this life threatening infection. To our knowledge, this morphology has been reported only twice in the medical literature.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of anaplastic large cell lymphoma can be remarkably deceptive. A 41-year-old female presented with fever, productive cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. She had been camping in the Southwest, and had visited some bat caves. At the same time, her son developed a similar illness. The patient?s white cell count was 23,000, and radiology demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Extensive workup for bacterial and fungal organisms were noncontributory, however, a viral exposure could not be excluded. The patient subsequently developed an umbilicated vesicular rash on her torso. Initial skin biopsies showed a perivascular mixed infiltrate, with no evidence of microorganisms. After clinical progression, a subsequent skin biopsy demonstrated a perivascular infiltrate of large mononuclear cells, with vesicular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, immunophenotypically characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. With elucidation of the process, lymphomatous involvement of the blood, pleural fluid, CSF, and nodal tissue was identified. Despite chemotherapy, the patient passed away. Exposure to an infectious agent may have unmasked the patient?s lymphoma.

AB  - Abstract Erythromelalgia is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by erythema, increased temperature, and severe burning pain that can be aggravated by warmth or relieved by cold. Erythromelalgia occurs either as a primary, idiopathic form, or secondary to a number of diseases and conditions. Although fairly well studied in adults, the characteristics, pathogenesis, and natural history are poorly characterized in the pediatric age group. Different therapeutic options have been tried, but no optimal treatment has been suggested for erythromelalgia. We report a rare case of linear erythromelalgia in a 12-year-old girl involving her central body from the peripheral extremities, which seemed to be secondary due to vasculitis. Clinical progress waxed and waned on maintenance aspirin and propranolol.

AB  - Fibrous papule (FP), synonymous with angiofibroma, is a common lesion that is often biopsied to exclude carcinoma. Clinically, FPs are small, dome-shaped, solitary, flesh colored papules arising on the nose and face of adults. Histologically, FPs are characterized by a dome-shape, fibrotic collagenized stroma, sparse inflammatory cell infiltrate, and variably increased and dilated vascular spaces. The vast majority of FPs are readily diagnosable based on these clinical and histologic criteria. Rare histopathologic variants have been reported. Recognition of these variants may avoid misdiagnosis of this common benign lesion. We illustrate four rare variants of FP that can cause diagnostic uncertainty including: hypercellular, clear cell, pigmented, and pleomorphic variants. Cellular FP has a dense infiltrate of round fibroblasts that have a nevoid appearance. Clear cell FP has a proliferation of round clear cells, some with slightly foamy cytoplasm, resembling histiocytes or clear epithelial cells. Pleomorphic FP demonstrates bizarre, stellate fibroblasts like those seen in pleomorphic fibroma. Pigmented FP has prominent melanocytic hyperplasia and dermal melanophages that can be confused with a melanocytic lesion. It is important to recognize these unusual variants of FP in order to accurately diagnose this common benign lesion and avoid over treatment or rebiopsy.

AB  - Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis is characterized by recurrent crops of tender edematous nodules on the lower legs. lobular panniculitis with granulomatous inflammation, vasculitis, focal necrosis and septal fibrosis is present. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA has been detected in some lesions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ten cases of erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis were found. H & E stained slides were reviewed. PCR assays for M tuberculosis and mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) was carried out. PCR did not reveal mycobacterial DNA, with positive controls indicating the reliability of the assays. Among the MOTT, cutaneous infections are most commonly caused by M. marinum. Subcutaneous tuberculoid granulomas may be seen with M. kansaii, M. marinum, M. scrofulaceum, and M. avium complex. M. gordonae and M. malmoense rarely cause cutaneous infections. M. szulgai, M. simiae, M. gastri and M. asiaticum are probably not cutaneous pathogens. MOTT DNA was not found? in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis. Erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis has diverse etiologies with varying pathogeneses leading to similar histologic changes. The cases analyzed may have not have had an infectious etiology. However, in erythema induratum/nodular vasculitis, performance of? PCR for MOTT as well as Mycobacteria tuberculosis complex may still be beneficial, particularly in cases from immunocompromised hosts.

AB  - Background: MAPK, AKT, and c-Kit are major signaling molecules. This study evaluates the expression of the activated forms of these molecules in melanocytic lesions. Design: Tissue microarrays were constructed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 14 benign nevi (BN), 16 dysplastic nevi (DN), 18 malignant melanomas (MM), and 25 metastatic malignant melanomas (MMM). Two control cases (nevus and melanoma) were included in all three microarray blocks. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-MAPK, p-AKT and p-c-kit was performed using standard technique. Both the intensity and the number of labeled cells were recorded in a semiquantitative fashion. Results were analyzed using Chi-square test, with p Results: c-kit expression was highest in BN compared to DN, MM and MMM that showed similar expression. Among MMM, the visceral metastases had the strongest c-kit expression. p-AKT showed decreased expression with progression of the melanocytic lesions. The differences for p-c-kit and p-AKT were highly significant (0.04 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in expression of p-MAPK. Conclusion: Since the observed changes apply to the activated forms of AKT and c-kit these molecules are likely involved in melanoma progression. These findings may help determine the applicability of targeted therapies such as gleevec.

AB  - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited disorder characterised by progressive calcification of elastic fibers in the skin, eyes and cardiovascular system. Skin lesions show distinctive thickened, fragmented elastic fibers in the reticular dermis. PXE-like fibers have not been described in patients without PXE. We describe 12 patients without known PXE who demonstrated the incidental finding of small numbers of PXE-like fibers in association with the following conditions: lipodermatosclerosis, granulomatous dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, morphea profunda, erythema nodosum, septal panniculitis, basal cell carcinoma and fibrosing dermatitis NOS. The biopsies were almost exclusively from the lower extremities of elderly women (mean age 73.8). The affected gene in PXE has been recently described as ABCC6 which codes for a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. The c.3421C>T mutation has been associated with a high risk of coronary artery disease. We describe a novel assay for this genotype employing real-time PCR of paraffin embedded skin biopsies. Four patients with PXE-like fibers were tested in this fashion and did not carry this mutation. Our series demonstrates that light microscopic findings associated with PXE are not specific, as PXE-like fibers can be observed in patients without clinical or genetic evidence of the disease.

AB  - Intravascular Lymphoma is a rare extranodal large cell lymphoma characterised by a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells in small vessel lumina typically involving the skin and central nervous system. The malignant cells are most commonly of B cell origin, although rare T cell variants have been described. We report a rare case of intravascular lymphoma with an NK cell phenotype. The patient is a 65 year-old man with a 5 year history of hypogammaglobulinemia and a six month history of tinea corporis involving the legs. Following topical antifungal treatment.asymptomatic erythematous plaques were noted on the lower extremities. A skin biopsy revealed intravascular thrombi with atypical malignant lymphoid cells which were immunoreactive for: CD3, CD2, LCA, CD56, perforin, granzyme B, and TIA-1. There is one description of an NK-like intravascular lymphoma in the literature and one of the authors (G.P.) has recently described two patients with intravascular lymphoma of definitive NK cell type (submitted for publication). Intravascular lymphoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Recognition of this newly described variant will help to elucidate our understanding of its pathogenesis and natural history.

AB  - Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is an exceedingly rare malignant neoplasm of the apocrine glands. There are only about half a dozen cases reported in the literature with one case being an in situ lesion. A 32-year-old Nigerian female presented with a 1-cm, hyperpigmented, slow-growing verrucous nodule located on her mid-posterior neck. The lesion had been present since birth. Histopathological examination revealed bilocular cystic cavities with papillary projections lined by double layers of epithelium. The luminal layer was composed of columnar cells with decapitation-type secretion. The fibrovascular stroma within the papillary projections contains numerous plasma cells with some lymphoid cells. The cystic cavities showed close apposition to the epidermis of the skin with focal, keratinizing squamous epithelium lining that was contiguous to the infundibular epithelium in foci. Necrosis en masse was present within the tumor. There were focal areas of solid aggregates of tumor cells with crowded, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei. Many mitoses, some of them atypical, were identified. The tumor was confined within the cystic cavities with no dermal invasion. A diagnosis of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum in situ was made.

AB  - Diagnostic concordance of intraepithelial malignancy is generally only fair. Because the diagnosis of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma is not uniform and because such terms are not consonant with the nomenclature of other human epithelial malignancies, nomenclature revisions have been attempted. One hundred dermatopathologists were solicited to review 15 tissue sections representing a spectrum of varying thickness epidermal malignancy and to choose either actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma as the diagnosis. Among the 77 participating dermatopathologists intraclass correlation was high for what was perceived as actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma and their differentiation. Development of a two-tiered diagnostic system that retains our present diagnostic capabilities, but better fits the pathobiology of superficial epidermal malignancy is suggested.

AB  - Protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) are proteins that may play importants roles in survival, proliferation and progression to metastasis in several tumors, including melanoma. There is little information on the expression pattern of the phosphorylated (i.e. activated) forms of such kinases in melanoma and their impact on overall survival (OS). We sought to determine the expression, by immunohistochemistry, of phosphorylated MAP kinase (pMAPK), Akt (pAkt) and C-kit (pCkit) in primary and metastatic melanoma, and their correlation with OS. Fifteen patients with Stage III and Stage IV (metastatic melanoma) disease were randomly selected from the UT MD Anderson database. Expression was rated by two investigators on intensity (negative, weak, moderate, and strong) and proportion of reactive tumor cells (0?=?<5%, 1?=?5?25%, 2?=?>25?75%, 3?=?>75%). Eleven of the 15 tumors (primary and/or metatasis) exhibited pMAPK expression (73%). Corresponding percentages were 100% for pAKT and <50%(7/15) for pCkit. OS ranged from less than one year to 9 years. However, there was no correlation between OS and expression of any of these markers.

AB  - A 57-year-old Hispanic man with a personal and family history of bullae and photosensitivity, presented with a fungating, ulcerated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) on his left hand. Physical exam showed conjunctival injection, urethral stricture, symblepharon, loss of teeth, short stature, nail dystrophy and extensive poikiloderma. Excision and lymph node dissection showed moderate to poorly differentiated deeply invasive SCC, necessitating an amputation. Two of three axillary lymph nodes were positive. A random biopsy of the trunk showed epidermal atrophy, telangiectasia and pigment laden macrophages consistent with poikiloderma. Electron microscopy (EM) illustrated extensive reduplication of the basement membrane with loops, curls and free extensions of the basal lamina in the superficial dermis, reduced numbers of hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils, and a basement membrane focally devoid of basal cells. On the basis of the clinical features and the characteristic basement zone changes, a diagnosis of Kindler Syndrome (KS) was rendered. KS is a rare autosomal recessive photosensitivity disorder which contains features of both congenital poikiloderma and dystrophic epidermolytic bullosa, and has unique EM features. Despite the photosensitivity, few cases of malignancy in KS have been reported.

AB  - A 32-year-old African American male presented with a five year history of multiple verrucous plaques in a Blaschkoid arrangement on the left leg. Biopsies demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma in-situ. The patient?s medical history did not reveal any heritable or exposure related risk factors. The patient was treated with radiotherapy. Four years later, he presented with a subcutaneous nodule within a prior site of radiation. MRI showed a 2.0???1.2?cm enhancing nodule in the subcutis. On biopsy, an ill-defined spindle cell proliferation was present in the dermis and subcutis. Marked nuclear pleomorphism and numerous multinucleated cells embedded in a myxoid stroma were noted. Spindle cells stained for CD68. Cytokeratin and S-100 were negative. A diagnosis of Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma was rendered. Surgical excision was undertaken. A dominant lesion of MFH was identified, as well as multiple, clinically undetectable foci of early sarcoma. This is an unusual case of multifocal post-radiation sarcoma in an African American patient with squamous cell carcinoma in-situ. While sarcoma is a known risk factor following radiotherapy, the course of this patient would suggest caution in applying radiation in similar clinical settings, as well as long-term clinical follow-up for early detection and treatment of post-radiation sarcoma.
