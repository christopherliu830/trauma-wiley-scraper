AB  - A 7-month-old male infant presented with a 2?month history of a solitary, well circumscribed, 1.2?cm right parietal scalp lesion. An MRI excluded intracranial extension of the lesion. Grossly the excised lesion was tan-grey, soft to rubbery with focal areas of hemorrhage. On histology, the lesion demonstrated elongated strands of haphazardly arranged fibrous tissue and meningothelial elements with clusters of plump, cuboidal epitheloid cells extending along connective tissue planes in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The meningothelial elements were intimately admixed with mature adipose tissue and proliferation of small to medium sized vessels. The overlying epidermis was unremarkable. No mitotic figures or areas of necrosis were identified. The meningothelial cells were positive for Vimentin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen. S-100 protein was negative and CD-34 was positive only in the endothelial cells. The gross, histologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with ectopic meningothelial hamartoma of the scalp. The meningothelial elements characteristic of this entity are believed to arise from displaced, ectopic meningothelial rests in the scalp and are thus regarded as simply representing a proliferation of the hamartomatous process.

AB  - We present the findings of a rare and very aggressive primary skin tumor, composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumor (CERT) with features of rhabdomyosarcoma. Clinical history: A 53-year-old woman presented with a 2.5?cm ulcerated nodule on her right medial calf. On exam, she also exhibited inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pathology: Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node and punch biopsy of the skin nodule disclosed an epithelioid cell morphology with rhabdoid cells, solid growth, and a high mitotic rate (>70 figures/10 HPF). Upon wide excision of the tumor, electron microscopy (EM) and special stains were performed. Since the differential diagnosis was broad, a large number of stains were performed: tumor was positive for vimentin, desmin, muscle specific actin, WT-1, CD56, and CD10, and negative for S-100, melan A, cytokeratins, EMA, CD34, fast myosin, myoglobin, myogenin, myoD1, smooth muscle actin, and NSE. EM revealed rhabdoid cells with perinuclear globules of intermediate filaments corresponding to the positive desmin stain. Summary: The patient was treated with chemotherapy without regression of presumed lung metastases. The CERT is a rare, aggressive tumor that extraordinarily presents as a primary skin tumor. The differential is broad and nomenclature confusing. Extensive ancillary pathology studies are required for appropriate diagnosis.

AB  - Title:?Will skin pathologists ever be replaced by noninvasive diagnostic tools (computers)? Intro: There are now many new non-invasive tools being developed to diagnose skin cancer, specifically melanocytic neoplasms. Whether these tools will ever be able to diagnose as well as a pathologist remains to be seen. In this paper, we will review most of the newly developed tools and discuss their specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. Method: We reviewed the literature on currently available noninvasive diagnostic tools to find the published sensitivity and specificity rates of these tools. Tools without published information on their diagnostic accuracy were not included. We tabulated the accuracy data on the remaining tools and evaluated their relative diagnostic accuracy. Results: Melafind was found to have a specificity of 68?85% and a sensitivity of 95%?100%. Siascope was found to have a specificity of 82.7% and a sensitivity of 80.1%. Solarscan was found to have a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 100%. Comments: Non-invasive tools may be helpful in managing melanocytic neoplasms in patients with numerous lesions or with lesions in a cosmetically important site i.e. face. At present these tools cannot replace the value of a biopsy, microscopically reviewed by a pathologist.

AB  - Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis with cutaneous, skeletal, ocular, neurological, and dental abnormalities. It has been mapped to chromosome Xq28 encoding the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO). NEMO regulates many genes, such as those that prevent apoptosis. IP is usually lethal in males. However, patients with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) are able to survive due to one normal X chromosome. We report a case of a male who presented after birth with multiple vesicles in a linear distribution on the calf progressing to persistent hyperpigmentation. At one month of age a punch biopsy showed verrucous hyperplasia with mild hypergranulosis, necrotic dyskeratinocytes and a lichenoid infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, eosinophils and melanophages. A diagnosis of IP was rendered. No additional physical findings were noted. The patient was evaluated for Klinefelter syndrome. While his karyotype was 46, XY by conventional cytogenetics, a dual color interphase FISH detected 92.5% 46, XY and 6.5% 47, XXY. Our patient?s unique genetic array allowed a mechanism to escape and otherwise fatal disorder. This case illustrates the potential utility of using FISH analysis to detect Klinefelter syndrome in a male patient with IP and normal conventional chromosomal analysis.

AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma of the vulva (MMV) accounts for 2% of all melanomas in women with 5-year survival rate of 47%. Lymph node involvement predicts survival in these patients. Ki-67 expression has been correlated with lymph node status in cutaneous melanomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Ki-67 correlates with lymph node metastasis in MMV. Methods: Histomorphology and clinical information of 25?MMV were reviewed. The database was divided in MMV with metastasis (M+) and without lymph node metastasis (M-). A MMV subset was stained for Ki-67 and scored as a percentage (7 patients M+ and 9 patients M-). Results: The age range was 36?88 years-old (mean 63 years-old). The tumor thickness mean was 3.14?mm. The mean Ki-67 expression was 23% for M- and 42.5% for M+(p?=?0.07). Correlation of tumor thickness and Ki-67 expression also has a p value of 0.07. Logistic regression analysis was obtained.Conclusions: This study shows that Ki-67 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis in MMV. However, when Ki-67 expression is compared to a classic prognostic indicator such as tumor thickness, it appears to have little or no additional predictive value. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

AB  - It is a little known fact that the organisms causing Zygomycosis are often better visualized with routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) staining than Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Experienced dermatopathologists, when evaluating histologic samples suspected of harboring deep fungal infection often rely more heavily on PAS staining to detect fungi. The diagnosis of Zygomycosis may be delayed or missed entirely if sufficient attention is not devoted to the H and E stained specimen. A review of multiple dermatopathology textbooks shows there is no universal agreement on the usefulness of routine H and E staining versus use of special stains for the detection of Zygomycosis. Grocott?s Methanamine Silver (GMS) staining can give false negative results if background staining of reticulum fibers is enhanced. This can occur because of overexposure in silver solution, excessive heat during processing, or use of incorrectly titrated solutions. Three consecutive culture proven cases of cutaneous Zygomycosis infection were evaluated. In each case, organisms were clearly visualized on routine H and E sections while PAS staining was variable. Examples of false negative GMS staining are also shown. Recognition of these staining properties can help dermatopathologists better detect the agents of Zygomycosis.

AB  - 76-year-old man presented with a hen?s egg-sized elevated nodule in his left sole in 4/04. He had been hospitalized because of icterus since 3/04. Although cancer of the pancreatic head had been strongly suspected on the imaging, he had refused surgical operation. No metastasis of the cancer had been found on the imaging. A dermatologist who biopsied the nodule in his left plantar recognized the swelling of inguinal lymph nodes on the same side. Histologically medium sized oval cells formed solid nests in the dermis, rendering them lobulated appearance. Some of the nests showed myxoid change in the stroma where tumor cells often showed cord-like arrangement. The border with surrounding tissue was relatively clear. The cells had round, and often eccentrically located nuclei with one or two small nucleoli and moderate to scarce amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitosis was readily identifiable; >50/10HPF. Necrosis was not found. Immunohistochemically tumor cells were reactive for AE1/AE3, vimentin and S-100 protein and negative for ??SMA, CK14, EMA, HMB 45 and Melan A. MIB-1 labeling index was over 50%. The lesion was diagnosed as malignant myoepithelioma. The positivity for S-100 protein seen in this case necessitated us to differentiate it from melanoma.

AB  - We report unique histologic findings in scalp biopsies from two family members with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome. Rapp-Hodgkin and the related AEC syndrome show a primary scarring alopecia and pili torti. The syndromes, which are related to ectodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome, have been credited to mutations in the TP63 gene. Most notable on biopsy is a primary scarring alopecia and abnormal hair shaft shape. Calcification in the outer root sheath epithelium, the basement membrane of the lower segment and within naked hair shafts is present. Neutrophils and bacterial rods and cocci are adjacent to the hair shaft in the superior segment, associated with dilated follicular ostia. Perifollicular fibrosis is associated with a variety of inflammatory cell types, mostly lymphocytic. One sample shows interfollicular irregular psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, compact orthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, and intraepidermal neutrophils. Follicular architecture is abnormal with abrupt and linear loss of nucleated matrical cells (B fringe of Adamson). The line of Ayber measures 0.30?mm on average. Hair shafts measure up to 0.16?mm, with variable abnormal cross sectional shape, usually square. Outer root sheath epithelium is disorganized with slight cellular pleomorphism, and the cuticle of the inner and outer root sheath is irregular in thickness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DiGeorge Syndrome is a congenital anomaly with a constellation of findings including thymic hypoplasia. Approximately 1 in 250 patients has complete DiGeorge syndrome with athymia. Many athymic patients develop severe eczema/erythroderma associated with oligoclonal circulating T cells. DESIGN: Nine biopsies from eight athymic patients with severe rash and circulating oligoclonal T cells were studied. Immunohistochemistry with CD3, CD4, CD8 and TIA-1 was performed. RESULTS: The stratum corneum showed parakeratosis (78%), most commonly confluent. Neutrophilic abscesses were commonly identified (44%). The epidermis exhibited exocytosis (100%), spongiosis (89%), dyskeratosis (89%), acanthosis (56%), and satellitosis (44%). Dermal changes included perivascular (56%), perifollicular (33%), and perieccrine (11%) lymphocytic infiltrates. Eosinophils were identified (78%); most commonly in both the dermis and epidermis. The majority of lymphocytes were CD3 positive with a slight CD4 over CD8 predominance in the dermis and epidermis. 67% of cases contained TIA-1 positive cells. CONCLUSION: Skin lesions from patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome who develop a rash that clinically resembles severe eczema/erythroderma display a constellation of histologic findings. The presence of dyskeratinocytes, satellitosis, and parakeratotic scale with neutrophils distinguishes these lesions from eczema and other spongiotic disorders. The pathophysiologic role of the inflammatory cells in this entity requires additional study.

AB  - Telomerase plays a role in the immortalization of cells and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results on whether human telomerase RNA (hTER) expression differs in nevi, atypical nevi and melanomas using PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) or in situ hybridization assays. The aim of this study was to evaluate human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) staining in melanocytic lesions on paraffin-embedded tissues. Paraffin-embedded sections from 6 acquired nevi, 4 dysplastic nevi, 5 Spitz nevi, 6 primary invasive melanomas, and 3 metastatic melanomas, were studied for staining intensity (0?3+) and % of labeled cells with anti-hTERT. HTERT staining was observed in most cells (>75%) in all lesions, and was of greater intensity in the nucleus, especially the nucleolus, compared to the cytoplasm. Spitz nevi tended to have weaker hTERT staining (mean?=?1.2) compared to acquired nevi (mean?=?2.0), dysplastic nevi (mean?=?2.5), primary melanoma (mean?=?2.17), or metastatic melanoma (mean?=?3). Although telomerase activity was weaker in Spitz nevi, there was overlap with other nevi and primary invasive melanomas in our small series. Thus, hTERT expression does not appear to be a reliable adjunct to the histological diagnosis of primary melanocytic lesions.

AB  - Hypoxia is a critical hallmark of glioma, and significantly compromises treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, techniques for monitoring glioma pO2 to facilitate translational research are lacking. Furthermore, poor prognosis of patients with malignant glioma, in particular glioblastoma multiforme, warrant effective strategies that can inhibit hypoxia and improve treatment outcome. EPR oximetry using implantable resonators was implemented for monitoring pO2 in normal cerebral tissue and U251 glioma in mice. Breathing carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2) was tested for hyperoxia in the normal brain and glioma xenografts. A new strategy to inhibit glioma growth by rationally combining gemcitabine and MK-8776, a cell cycle checkpoint inhibitor, was also investigated. The mean pO2 of left and right hemisphere were ?56?69 mmHg in the normal cerebral tissue of mice. The mean baseline pO2 of U251 glioma on the first and fifth day of measurement was 21.9 ± 3.7 and 14.1 ± 2.4 mmHg, respectively. The mean brain pO2 including glioma increased by at least 100% on carbogen inhalation, although the response varied between the animals over days. Treatment with gemcitabine + MK-8776 significantly increased pO2 and inhibited glioma growth assessed by MRI. In conclusion, EPR oximetry with implantable resonators can be used to monitor the efficacy of carbogen inhalation and chemotherapy on orthotopic glioma in mice. The increase in glioma pO2 of mice breathing carbogen can be used to improve treatment outcome. The treatment with gemcitabine + MK-8776 is a promising strategy that warrants further investigation.

AB  - ABSTRACT ?MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH) usually is triggered during or after administration of commonly used general anesthetics, and it can result in death if left untreated. ?THE ONLY DEFINITIVE diagnostic test for MH is the caffeine halothane contracture test. A new molecular genetic diagnostic blood test may offer a less-invasive alternative for some patients. ?HYPERTHERMIA, the cardinal sign of MH, is a relatively late symptom. Other clinical signs include tachyarrhythmias, tachypnea, and acidosis. ?PERIOPERATIVE NURSES should perform MH risk assessments during routine preoperative interviews to identify patients at risk for MH crisis. Perioperative nurses must respond rapidly and ensure the cooperation of the OR team when dealing with MH. AORN J 83 (January 2006) 151?164.

AB  - The number of new drugs for treating neurotrauma is rapidly expanding. Emerging theories regarding the mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury provide the scientific basis for evaluating these new agents. Some of the most promising mechanisms for intervention are ionotropic channel antagonism, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and neurotrophic factor augmentation. Many of these new agents are undergoing clinical trials to establish their roles in therapy.
