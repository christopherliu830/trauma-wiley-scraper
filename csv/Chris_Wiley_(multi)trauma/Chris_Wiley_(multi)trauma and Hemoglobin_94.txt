AB  - The clinical manifestations of anaplastic large cell lymphoma can be remarkably deceptive. A 41-year-old female presented with fever, productive cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. She had been camping in the Southwest, and had visited some bat caves. At the same time, her son developed a similar illness. The patient?s white cell count was 23,000, and radiology demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Extensive workup for bacterial and fungal organisms were noncontributory, however, a viral exposure could not be excluded. The patient subsequently developed an umbilicated vesicular rash on her torso. Initial skin biopsies showed a perivascular mixed infiltrate, with no evidence of microorganisms. After clinical progression, a subsequent skin biopsy demonstrated a perivascular infiltrate of large mononuclear cells, with vesicular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, immunophenotypically characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. With elucidation of the process, lymphomatous involvement of the blood, pleural fluid, CSF, and nodal tissue was identified. Despite chemotherapy, the patient passed away. Exposure to an infectious agent may have unmasked the patient?s lymphoma.

AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.

AB  - We present a 69-year-old woman with a sebaceous carcinoma of the left upper eyelid, which originated from the Meibomian gland of the tarsal plate. The intraepidermal extension involved not only the conjunctival epithelium but also the overlying skin with subsequent extension into the dermis. The discussion will include diagnostic, both clinical and microscopic, considerations along with comparison to mammary Paget?s disease. Just as mammary Paget?s disease, which originates from the glands in the dermis eventuating in the seeding of the overlying epidermis, so too does sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Accordingly, just as mammary Paget?s disease is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition, so too is sebaceous carcinoma.

AB  - We present here a case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with neuroendocrine features that has transformed into a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with various morphologic features of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). A 54-year-old white female was treated for a BCC of the right thigh. Pathologic examination revealed an otherwise classical BCC that demonstrated granular positivity for chromogranin. Six years later the patient developed a right inguinal lymphadenopathy diagnosed as metastatic BCC with squamous changes. The metastatic BCC showed partial peripheral palisading and a trabecular pattern. Two years later the patient underwent a right nephrectomy due to obstruction of the right ureter by metastatic BCC. After another four years the patient came back with extensive involvement of the appendiceal wall and right ovary by a diffusely infiltrating metastatic basaloid and trabecular carcinoma. This time the tumor had many histologic features of MCC and showed strong positivity for chromogranin and also for CK20 and NSE. Electron microscopy revealed neurosecretory granules. This case is an example of a chromogranin positive basal cell carcinoma of the skin, which transformed during multiple recurrences into a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with features of Merkel cell tumor, demonstrating the potential for cross differentiation among skin tumors.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - A 77-year-old white female presented with a two to three year history of an asymptomatic skin-colored papule on the right upper arm. Examination revealed a 7?mm???7?mm soft papule, supplanted by a smaller soft papule. Clinical differential diagnosis included an adnexal tumor, neurofibroma, and dermal nevus. Histological examination revealed a sparse proliferation of spindle and stellate-shaped cells within the dermis, including many large cells with bizarre shaped nuclei. Focal multinucleated giant cells were present as well. The background stroma was both collagenous and myxoid, the later being highlighted by diffuse colloidal iron staining. The spindle and stellate-shaped cells demonstrated CD34 and vimentin positivity. Factor XIIIa was focally positive. Actin and S-100 staining were negative. These changes were thought to be consistent with a myxoid pleomorphic fibroma. This is a rare tumor, with only a few reported cases of myxoid variants in the literature to date. The staining pattern of this tumor, along with others in the reported literature, suggest a mesenchymal, fibroblastic origin.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.

AB  - Epithelial cysts are commonly encountered in clinical practice, most usually as epidermoid (infundibular) cysts, and trichilemmal (pilar) cysts. A multitude of other cystic structures can arise from the pilosebaceous unit, including dermoid cyst, pilonidal cyst, eruptive vellus hair cyst, steatocystoma, pilomatricoma, as well as eccrine and apocrine hydrocystoma. Epidermoid cysts are thought to derive from the follicular infundibulum, and express keratin 10 but not keratin 17, whereas trichilemmal cysts are believed to derive from the follicular isthmus, and express both keratins 10 and 17. Proliferating follicular cysts generally exhibit trichilemmal keratinization. In addition to the various aforementioned cysts, hybrid cysts have been reported. The majority of hybrid cysts described have been epidermoid-trichilemmal, in which the upper portion of the cyst shows epidermoid keratinization with a sharp transition inferiorly to trichilemmal keratinization. However other hybrid variants have been reported, including epidermoid-pilomatricoma, epidermoid-apocrine hydrocystoma, trichilemmal-pilomatricoma, eruptive vellus hair cyst-steatocystoma, and eruptive vellus hair cyst-trichilemmal cysts. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a proliferating hybrid cyst containing both epidermoid and trichilemmal components, which presented on the scrotum of a 44-year-old man.

AB  - Mycosis fungoides with central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a rare event. Most cases evolve from progressive tumor stage skin disease or CD30 large cell transformation. Cases with CD 30 transformation can show CNS involvement without advanced skin disease. We report a 63 year-old woman with 6 year history of mycosis fungoides with patch and plaque stage disease who developed a single 2.5?cm tumor on the left chest without lymphadenopathy. Histology revealed a dense infiltrate of small atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei. Immunohistochemistry showed CD 4+, CD 43+ and CD 30- staining. Within 2 weeks she developed ataxia and right-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontal and brainstem masses. Stereotactic biopsy showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with large convoluted nuclei. The immunohistochemistry showed a population of CD 4+, CD 43+, Alk-1- cells with CD 30+ transformation. Gene rearrangement studies for the gamma T cell receptor on the skin patch and tumor as well as brain tumor failed to reveal a monoclonal population in any of the specimens. No other areas of involvement were found on complete staging. This case is an example of tumor stage MF with CD 30 transformation and CNS involvement.

AB  - Spitzoid melanoma in children is a rare tumor that can mimic Spitz nevus both clinically and histologically. Recently, dysregulation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling pathway was reported in 89% of sporadic melanomas due to activating mutations in the BRAF or NRAS gene. BRAF mutations are found in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi, whereas none are present in Spitz nevi. NRAS mutations occur in 5?37% of melanomas and 9?56% of common melanocytic nevi. The mutational status of NRAS in Spitz nevi is unknown. This is the first study analyzing the mutational profile of BRAF and NRAS in Spitzoid melanomas occurring in prepubertal children (10 years of age or younger). Primary tumor cells were isolated via laser capture microdissection from 10 typical Spitz nevi and 10 metastatic Spitzoid melanomas. Exons 11 and 15 of BRAF and exons 2 and 3 of NRAS were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Common activating mutations were not identified in BRAF or NRAS. Absence of the V599E hot-spot mutation in BRAF was further confirmed by allele-specific PCR. We conclude that Spitzoid melanomas in children share clinical, histological and genetic similarities to Spitz nevi, and are genetically distinct from other melanoma subtypes.

AB  - The recognized breadth of dysplastic nevi has quickly shrunk. We now present very small dysplastic nevi below any described breadth. A cluster of mostly punched-out nevi derived from a single clinician who recognizes as ?atypical? even very small lesions was also assigned histologic dysplasia on architectural and cytologic basis. From 536 junctional nevi with dysplasia ranging from mild to moderate, 136 (25.3%) were 1?mm. in vitro or less while 371 (69.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Among 155 compound nevi with the same range of dysplasia, 19 (12.2%) were 1?mm or less and 95 (61.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Moderate or, less so, severe atypia was even seen in more than half of either 18 junctional and 18 compound nevi of dysplastic type between 2.1 and 3?mm. While the above threshold for dysplasia may not be similar to the one than many dermatopathologists could use, it is still evident that sliding down our higher-grade nevi to meet milder degrees of perceived atypia in a more conservative diagnostic scale, the breadth of these nevi still remains minuscule in general. In sum, we adhere to the idea that dysplastic nevi are not only common but can be extremely small: ?bonsai nevi.?

AB  - Pilomatricoma is a distinctive tumor characterized by a dual population of proliferating germinative cells and shadow cells and is beleived to derive from the hair matrix. Rarely, benign and malignant adnexal tumors can show pilomaticoma-like or hair matrix differentiation. We present a 69-year-old man with a ruptured cystic nodule of the left cheek. Histology revealed a dermal tumor composed of nests of basaloid cells which manifested peripheral palisading and abortive hair papilla formation with a modified stroma and pilomatricoma-like areas. This lesion shares features of a trichogenic adnexal neoplasm with those of a tumor having hair matrical differentiation, and has been rarely reported under the designation ?follicular? basal cell carcinoma (BCC). This case illustrates an example of this unusual occurrence of hair matrix differentiation in a benign basaloid adnexal neoplasm as characterized by the presence of basaloid and shadow cells; the absence of individual cell necrosis and mitotic activity prompts us to doubt that it represents a form of nodular BCC, but rather it more likely reflects a hamartoma of the follicular anlage.

AB  - Histological differentiation between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms such as trichoepithelioma and trichoblastoma can be difficult on small biopsies. Therefore, several attempts have been made to identify immunohistochemical differences between these entities. Recent studies showed androgen receptor expression in a number of mature epithelial structures in the skin and in epithelial neoplasms including basal cell carcinoma. In contrast, androgen receptor expression was absent in mature hair follicles or the few trichogenic neoplasms studied to date. These findings suggested that androgen receptor expression might be a useful adjunct in the histological differential diagnosis between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of androgen receptor expression in 32 basal cell carcinomas and 10 benign trichoblastic tumors (6 trichoepitheliomas and 4 trichoblastomas). In our study, expression of androgen receptor was detected in 78% of basal cell carcinomas. None of the trichoblastic tumors showed any androgen receptor immunoreactivity. These results confirm the lack of androgen receptor expression in benign trichoblastic neoplasms and indicate that finding of androgen receptor expression points to basal cell carcinoma as the most likely diagnosis.

AB  - A 47-year-old sculptor presented with an ulcer on her neck. She is non-diabetic and had been on potassium iodide for hyperthyroidism. She developed a pruritic rash (?drug eruption), and her neck had been scratched repeatedly with papier-mache (PM)-covered fingers while she worked on PM sculptures for 3 consecutive months. Debrided material from neck ulcer revealed innumerable pieces of refractile PM in various shapes in the background of necrotic tissue and fibrinoid exudate, on polaroscopic examination of H&E sections. Stains for micro-organisms (for fungi, acid-fast bacilli, and actinomycosis) were negative. In an attempt to remove residual embedded PM, wide excision of the site and full-thickness skin graft was done. After initial successful take and healing, the area redeveloped an ulcer. Additional debridement and biopsy from the graft site showed PM clustered around the blood vessels in the reticular dermis. PM is a product of paper pulp commonly used in arts and crafts. Rare cases of lead exposure in PM workers have been reported in the literature, however, no cutaneous problems caused by PM have been reported to date.

AB  - Infantile digital fibromatosis (IDF), also called Reye tumor or inclusion body fibromatosis, is a benign proliferation of myofibroblasts, with characteristic perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The inclusions stain pink with hematoxylin-eosin, red with Masson?s trichrome, and purple with phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin. This intradermal neoplasm is formed by interlacing bundles of collagen and spindle cells. Positive immunohistochemical staining with vimentin, cytokeratin, desmin, and actin indicate myofibroblastic cell origin. Clinically, patients present at birth or infancy with asymptomatic smooth, flesh colored nodules, typically on lateral or dorsal digits. IDF is a benign neoplasm that may spontaneously regress and treatment is observation. Lesions recur in 60% of excisions; surgery is only recommended in cases of functional impairment or aggressive growth. We report three cases of IDF. The patients, ranging 8 months to 8 years old, presented with pink to flesh colored nodules on the feet and fingers. A spectrum of histological features was observed. All cases revealed dermal proliferation of spindle cells with blunt nuclei and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions. Pattern of spindle cells ranged from loose haphazard arrangement to well-organized interlacing bundles. The quantity of eosinophilic inclusions varied. For diagnostic and treatment purposes, all three patients underwent excision, with subsequent recurrence in two cases.

AB  - We report a 48-year-old male who presented with ulcerated plaques and nodules of the lower extremities. Skin biopsies revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate involving the dermis and the subcutis in a lobular and septal pattern. No overt cytological atypia was present. Notably, several features resembling lupus erythematosus were present, including vacuolar interface change and abundant dermal mucin deposition. The patient developed pulmonary nodules, and a lung biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial lymphoid infiltrate without overt atypia. The cutaneous and pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates showed similar immunohistochemical profiles: CD3+CD4?CD8+/?CD56+. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor gamma gene with similar migration patterns were identified from both locations. The patient developed fatal hemophagocytic syndrome, involving liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This case is amongst rare reports of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma (SPTCL) with systemic involvement.
