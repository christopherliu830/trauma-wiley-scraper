AB  - A 33-year-old Caucasian female presented with a ten-year history of flushing and facial swelling partially responsive to anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial therapies. Progressive edema of the right upper eyelid was recently treated by blepharoplasty. The blepharoplasty specimen had a dense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and diffuse non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes. The granulomas appeared both peri-and intralymphatic with prominent molding. Special stains and polarization studies were negative. To confirm the intralymphatic location of these granulomas we performed immunohistochemical staining with Factor VIII and D2?40. D2?40 is a new monoclonal antibody that reacts with an O-linked sialoglycoprotein found on lymphatic endothelium, fetal testis, and on the surface of testicular germ cell tumors. In recent studies, clone D2?40 has shown staining in lymphatic channel endothelium but not in adjacent capillary. Factor VIII antibody highlighted both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium, while D2?40 stained only the lymphatic endothelium and confirmed the intra-lymphatic location of granulomas. The patient was diagnosed with granulomatous lymphangiitis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal type (orofacial granulomatosis). Granulomatous lymphangiitis is characteristic but not completely diagnostic of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. We present the complex differential diagnosis of intralymphatic granulomas and the use of a new monoclonal antibody helpful in verifying their location.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman developed back pain associated with a sacral mass seven years prior to presentation. Biopsy of the sacral mass showed chordoma. The patient underwent two surgical resections because of recurrent disease. She presented after developing a firm, non-tender skin nodule on the left back. Biopsy of the lesion showed a dermal neoplasm composed of nests of cells in a mucinous stroma. There was moderate cytologic atypia of the cells, and occasional mitotic figures were seen. Physaliphorous cells were present. The immunostains S-100, cytokeratin, and EMA were all positive. A diagnosis of metastatic chordoma to the skin or chordoma cutis was made. The patient died 15 months later from complications of metastatic disease. Chordomas are rare, representing only 1?4% of malignant bone tumors, which most often occur in the sacral area. Metastasis to the skin is unusual. In one study, 207 cases of chordoma were evaluated, and only 19 had skin involvement. Chordoma cutis has been described as nodules which are firm, blue domed, cystic-appearing, erythematous, translucent, flesh-colored, and reddish brown. Cutaneous metastasis of chordoma has been reported to the nose, chest, back, thigh, shoulders, left arm, face, neck, and scalp.

AB  - Background: Dermatomyositis, a connective tissue disease syndrome where antibodies to the endothelium of the microvasculature of the skin, muscle and lung are implicated in lesional propagation, is characterized by photodistributed erythema, heliotrope rash, Gottron?s papules, muscle weakness and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Endotheliotropic viruses and underlying neoplasia are among the inciting triggers. Uncommonly drugs, namely the lipid lowering agents, have been implicated in dermatomyositis. Case Report: The patient, a 57-year-old male, developed a photodistributed rash and muscle weakness following treatment with the antifungal medication Lamisil. A skin biopsy was performed, showing an atrophying interface dermatitis with pandermal mucinosis and striking vasculopathic changes including endothelial cell necrosis with denudement and basement membrane zone reduplication. Direct immunofluorescent testing showed prominent staining of C5b-9 along the dermal- epidermal junction and within the vasculature. Conclusion: We have shown a temporal association between use of Lamisil and the development of dermatomyositis. Terbinafine, the active agent in Lamisil, promotes apoptosis of human endothelial cells in culture. Enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis results in the displacement of various cellular antigens creating a state of neo-antigenicity; its attendant sequelae has held to be one of antiendothelial cell antibody formation, a defining pathogenetic event in the evolution of dermatomyositis.

AB  - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an unusual peripheral lymphoma most typically presenting with a cytotoxic (CD8-positive, TIA-1-positive) immunophenotype. SPTCLs may have an indolent or highly aggressive clinical course. Histologically, SPTCL may be notoriously difficult to diagnosis. Cases of SPTCL with a deceptively benign appearance similar to that of subcutaneous lupus erythematosus have been described. SPTCL associated with a concomitant systemic leukemia/lymphoma has not been documented in the literature. We report a case of SPTCL arising in a 65-year-old female with a well-established history of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL). She presented with two months of recurrent fever and painless erythematous nodules on bilateral lower extremities that were clinically felt to be erythema nodosum. Initial biopsies demonstrated a polymorphous lobular infiltrate with neutrophils, karyorrhexis and lipomembranous change. An excisional biopsy demonstrated an atypical lymphoid population that expressed CD8 and TIA1. PCR analysis confirmed T-cell receptor gene arrangement. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy with resolution of her symptoms and complete remission. This is the first well documented case of SPTCL occurring in a patient with long standing B-CLL, and highlights the difficulty of establishing an unequivocal diagnosis of SPTCL.

AB  - A 64-year-old white male presented with a three-month history of multiple crusted erythematous nodules on the lower legs. The patient was immunosuppressed on prednisone and tacrolimus secondary to liver transplant. Biopsy revealed a fibrinopurulent crust overlying an interstitial, non-follicular oriented, neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis. PAS and GMS positive septate hyphae were present within the stratum corneum while yeast-like forms with pseudohyphal projections, suggestive of Blastomyces dermatitidis, were found within the dermis. There was no evidence of follicular rupture or granulomatous inflammation. Subsequent culture grew Trichophyton rubrum confirming the diagnosis of deep dermatophytosis. This case illustrates several histologic differences in deep dermatophyte infection in the immunocompromised host from invasive dermatophyte infection, Majocchi?s granuloma, occurring in the immunocompetent patient. In the immunocompromised patient there is typically the following: no evidence of fungal invasion via a ruptured hair follicle, suppurative inflammation as opposed to granulomatous inflammation, and atypical fungal forms consisting of swollen hyphae and round, yeast-like, arthroconidia, as opposed to the slender hyphae seen in Majocchi?s granuloma. In addition, because of the clinical appearance of the lesions, immunocompromised state of the patients, and atypical fungal forms seen on biopsy, an initial diagnosis of systemic mycosis is often incorrectly made.

AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - A comprehensive collection of high quality histologic slides is essential for education of pathology and dermatology trainees in dermatopathology. However, maintenance of the quality of the teaching slide collection is constantly challenged by slide loss, breakage, and stain fading. Recut replacement slides are not always easily attainable. When they are, the most important diagnostic features may not be as well represented in recuts. The ScanScope (Aperio Technologies) virtual microscopy instrument and software have been used to create a dermatopathology image database. Histologic sections on glass microscope slides are scanned at X20 to obtain a high-resolution digital image of the entire section (virtual slides). This magnification is optimal for demonstrating most cutaneous pathologic processes, where low or intermediate power pattern recognition is of primary diagnostic importance. Images can be viewed with the ImageScope virtual slide viewing software. The software is intuitive to use and closely mimics viewing of a slide at the microscope. Virtual slide image quality is equivalent to that seen at the microscope. Unique teaching slides can be reproduced in unlimited quantities and slides are never lost, broken, or misfiled. Internet, intranet, or DVD access permits continuous availability of a teaching slide collection to trainees.

AB  - Balloon cell melanoma (BCM) is a rare histological variant of amelanotic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell lesion includes BCM, renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma as well as a number of histiocytic and infectious processes. We report a case of BCM in a 33 year-old Indonesian man who presented with a non-tender, freely movable, non-pigmented left thigh nodule, which had been present for a year. On microscopic examination tumor consisted of a nodular infiltrate present within the dermis with superficial invasion of subcutaneous fat. Tumor cells formed nested aggregates were relatively bland in appearance and had abundant, clear cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Rare mitotic figures were present within the deep portion of the neoplasm. No definitive nests were seen at the dermal epidermal junction or within the epidermis. Histochemical stains AFB, PAS/D, and GMS were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies were positive with antibodies to vimentin, S100, HMB45, CD68, and negative with cytokeratin, Factor XIIIA, and lysozyme. The diagnosis of BCMM was favored based on histological features, and immunoperoxidase staining pattern. We believe this case can provide additional information to help establish diagnostic criteria of this rare variant of melanoma.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman presented with multiple subungal lesions for the past forty years. These were associated with increasing pain with growth, relieved only by destruction. They were treated as subungal warts by electrocautery and surgical excision. A biopsy of one lesion was interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma with subsequent partial amputation of the affected digit. She continued to develop painful subungal growths involving all her fingers, requiring repeated surgeries. On physical examination, subungal tumors associated with hyperkeratosis and erythema of the nail bed were found on the right thumb and ring finger. Subungal hyperkeratosis involved all other fingers. On histological examination, there was marked dyskeratosis with features of subungal keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma. This patient has a history of incontinentia pigmenti (IP) since childhood and she has three daughters with IP. We report a case of painful subungal dyskeratotic tumors in IP, considered as keratoacanthomas by some, as they grow rapidly and may demonstrate spontaneous resolution, albeit rarely. The distinguishing features of subungal tumor in IP are its occurrence in young women with multiple lesions and signs of IP, and its tendency to erupt persistently over a course of several years.

AB  - A fourteen-year-old female presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Biopsies of the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, characterized by para-cortical fibrinous necrosis with karyorrhectic debris and histiocytic palisading, and paucity of the polymorphic neutrophils. She also developed concurrent skin lesions with scattered small non-itching vesicles and blisters over her back and lower legs. A punch biopsy revealed vacuolar interface changes, sub-epidermal blister formation, mild superficial perivascular infiltration, and follicle necrosis. Karyorrhectic debris and CD68-positive cells are noted around the follicle. A direct immunofluorescent study was negative for complement or immunoglobulin depositions. The patient was diagnosed as Kikuchi-Fujimoto?s disease, or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, a benign self-limited lymph node disorder most commonly occurred in young females. Patients with Kikuchi?s disease are typically presented with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying fever. Multiple lymph node involvement, splenomegaly and/or cutaneous lesions are rare occurrences. The present patient experienced a severe inflammatory response syndrome manifested by respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She recovered completely after two weeks of intensive medical treatment. She has had no respiratory symptoms, residual lymphadenopathies or documented skin lesions in her follow-up three months after discharge.

AB  - 1 Anu Muraja-Murro, 1 Ari Pääkkönen, 2 Leena Jutila, 2 Reetta Kälviäinen, 3 Arto Immonen, 1 Sara Määttä, and 1 Esa Mervaala ( 1 Clinical Neurophysiology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; 2 Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: Mismatch-negativity (MMN) is an auditory event-related potential (ERP) produced by a deviant stimuli that occurs infrequenty among standard stimuli. MMN is thought to reflect the activation of an automatic change-detector system that compares new auditory input with a short-term memory trace generated by the previous auditory stimuli. MMN in human has been demonstrated from several cortical sites, but not to our knowledge from hippocampus or amygdala. This is surprising, given that these limbic structures are so essential for learning and memory functions. We could obtain MMN from these temporomesial structures using intracranial electrodes in adult patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Methods: 4 adults with intractable temporal lobe seizures (age 32?48 years) had each 2?4 stereotactically implanted 6-contact depth-electrodes at amygdalo-hippocampal complex. The electrodes were implanted via lateral approach and their exact anatomical localizations were confirmed by MRI and CT in situ. After the post hoc anatomical localization of the depth-electrodes, the presence of MMN could be studied from 6 hippocampi and 5 amygdalas (i.e., the electrode tips were exactly within amygdalo-hippocampal complex). The most mesial depth-electrode contacts were chosen for the MMN analysis with the MMN latency range of 120?250 ms, as well as with the P300 range of 250?500 ms. We analyzed possible statistically significant differences between the ERPs to deviant and standard tones. Results: A definite MMN within 120?250 ms latency range could be recorded from 4/6 hippocampi and 3/5 amygdalas. MMN was also detected within 250?500 ms latency range in 3/6 hippocampi and 2/5 amygdalas, respectively. In only one patient the hippocampal MMN resembled typical scalp-recorded MMN. In all, the MMN decreased from the deepest contacts towards the cortex, suggesting a local maximum of MMN at the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Conclusions: Our data implicates that a local and early (120?500 ms post-stimuli) automatic electrophysiological change-detector system exists within the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. This data is the first to demonstrate that also these temporomesial structures are activated and involved in mismatch detection, and is in line with recent sensory mismatch fMRI studies. Other sensory stimuli might also produce MMN in the same structures, possibly thus revealing a common function for hippocampus and amygdala in early sensory stimulus detection. 1 Tobias Loddenkemper, 2 Gabriel Moeddel, 1 Elia M. Pestana, 1 Deepak K. Lachhwani, 1 Ajay Gupta, 1 Prakash Kotagal, and 1 Elaine Wyllie ( 1 Department of Epilepsy and Sleep Disorder, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Universitaetsklinikum Muenster, Muenster, Westfalen, Germany ) Rationale: The intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) is part of the presurgical workup of patients scheduled for epilepsy surgery to determine language and memory lateralization. Most information on results and complications are derived from adults. Little is known about children undergoing IAT. Difficulties arise from anxiety, need for barbiturate dosage adjustment, and impaired baseline memory in children with mental retardation [4]. The goal of this study was 1) to describe language lateralization in children with epilepsy and 2) to outline complications during IAT. Methods: 126 consecutive pediatric IAT performed at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation during a seven year period were reviewed. Results: 44 patients were age 5?12 years, 82 were age 13?18. 102 were right-handed. Amobarbital (n = 96, average dose: 100 +- 25 mg) or Methohexital (n = 30, average dose 5 +- 1 mg) was injected into the left (n = 18), right (n = 13), or both (n = 95) ICA. Language was localized in 95 patients (75.4%): 75 [78.9%] were left, 6 [6.3%] were right, 14 [14.7%] bilateral language dominant. Neurological complications included prolonged lethargy impairing language and memory evaluation in 4 patients. Four children had a seizure after injection. Additionally, valid data could not be obtained due to fear or agitation in three children age 5?9 years. No lasting neurological deficits were seen. General complications included shortness of breath after contrast injection in one boy. One girl presented with fever of 38.5 C the night after the procedure complaining of groin pain. No other major complications were seen. Conclusions: This is one of the largest pediatric IAT series studied so far. The data on language lateralization agree with those previously reported [1, 2, 3]. The IAT in children is an invasive test with a potential for complications, as in adults, occuring in 10 out of 126 patients [7.9%]. Our series highlights the need for refinement and further development of novel methods to establish language lateralization in children during the evaluation for epilepsy surgery.

Isojärvi ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ; and 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ) Rationale: To prospectively evaluate changes in interictal heart rate (HR) variability in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after 4 years follow-up. Methods: A 24-hour ECG recording was obtained at baseline and four years after first recording in 18 patients with refractory TLE, 18 patients with well controlled TLE, and once in 36 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Time and frequency domain measures, along with fractal and complexity measures of HR variability, were analysed from the ECG recordings. Results: At baseline most of the measures showed decreased HR variability in the TLE patients compared to control subjects. After four years follow-up, most of the HR variability measures were further decreased in patients with TLE, and the RR interval (p = 0.015), the Poincaré component SD2 (p < 0.002), and ApEn (p = 0.000) value decreases from the baseline were statistically significant. Conclusions: TLE was associated with reduced HR variability at the baseline of the study. Further decrease in HR variability in patients with TLE was observed after four-year follow-up 1 Manjari Tripathi, 1 Shalini Mukherjee, 1 K.K. Deepak, and 1 Padma Vasantha ( 1 Department of Neurology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; and Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India ) Rationale: Changes in cardiovascular tone is noted in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy patients. The dysfunction of sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity is a potential cause of sudden unexpected death in epileptic patients. The present study was aimed at finding out the effect of epilepsy surgery on autonomic functions in intractable epileptic patients. Methods: 27 patients of mean age 27.3 +/?10.8 who were intractable for over two years or more and selected for surgery. They underwent a battery of tests that assessed their autonomic reactivity. Baseline autonomic activity (tone) was also measured by Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The patients underwent the same tests again 3 months later. Results: The indices of Deep Breathing test (DBT)- before and after surgery, i.e. E:I ratio (1.27 +/?0.13 vs. 1.4 +/? 0.1) and delta changes in heart rate (20.5 +/? 8.75 vs. 23.0 +/? 1.3) show an increase, though not significant, in parasympathetic reactivity after surgery. No changes were observed in the Valsalva Maneuver or in the 30:15 ratio in the Head Up Tilt test (HUT). The rise in Diastolic BP in Hand Grip Test (28.0 +/? 7.0 vs. 16.0 +/? 10.4) was significantly less after surgery. The reactivity tests show that there may be a trend towards increase in parasympathetic and decrease in sympathetic reactivity after surgery. Among the parameters in the HRV which denote the autonomic tone, most of the time domain measures between pre and post surgery patients, i.e. SENN (1.4 +/? 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/? 1.2), SDSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), RMSSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), NN50 (0.55 +/? 3.3 vs. 5 +/? 26.1), pNN50 (0.4 +/? 0.1 vs. 0.51 +/? 0.2) showed an increase in values post surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone. In the frequency domain measures, LF (nu) and% LF denote the sympathetic tone; LF (nu) ((45.5 +/? 19.6 vs. 34 +/? 14.6) showed a significant decrease after surgery and%LF (20.8 +/? 13.1 vs. 22.2 +/? 8.8) was also reduced, thereby showing a decrease in sympathetic tone. HF (nu) and% HF denote parasympathetic tone and HF (nu) showed an increase (48.6 +/? 21.5 vs. 57.2 +/? 22.8), while%HF (36.5 +/? 21.8 vs. 43.2 +/? 16.9) showed a significant increase after surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone after surgery. The LF/HF ratios, which show the sympathovagal balance, also showed a significant decrease (1.1 +/? 1.1 vs. 0.63 +/? 0.4) after surgery. Two patients who had abnormal tone before surgery showed normalization after surgery. Conclusions: The present study shows that the autonomic functions are modulated after surgery; exhibiting a decrease in sympathetic reactivity and increase in parasympathetic reactivity. An increase in parasympathetic tone and a significant decrease in sympathetic tone is also noted after surgery.

AB  - Mammary-like glands are a poorly recognized structure of the normal vulvar skin. Adenocarcinomas occur rarely in these glands and represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity that must be distinguished from metastatic tumors. We present a case of a 51-year-old patient with a long-standing nodule on her right labium majus. Excision with subsequent Mohs micrographic surgery revealed an infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the mammary-like glands involving the dermis and subcutis. We review all cases thus far reported (including the case presented herein) and identify important clinical and morphologic features of this tumor. A significant histopathological and immunohistochemical overlap between this neoplasm, sweat gland carcinomas, and invasive extramammary Paget?s disease was recognized; suggesting the existence of a morphologic spectrum between these entities. Criteria for establishing the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of mammary-like glands are reviewed, including the importance of identifying transition zones between normal mammary-like glands and malignant glands. We believe that this tumor is best categorized as a locally aggressive neoplasm with a low metastatic potential and death from disease is uncommon. The successful treatment of this case by Mohs micrographic surgery suggests that an alternate management approach may be adopted for these tumors, particularly in elderly patients.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a rare, recently described fibrotic skin condition that primarily affects patients with a history of renal disease.We report 2 cases of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy and review clinical and histopathologic features with differential diagnosis and more.Case #1 was a 64-year-old black male with chronic renal insufficiency which progressed to end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. After two days, he developed blisters on both his hands. By a month, his blister lesions resolved leaving scaly skin with some skin thickening and tightening in the hands and forearms. Over the course of one month, skin over above-mentioned areas began to harden and stiffen. His fingers began to coalesce and contract resulting in fixation of hand grip. He also developed flexing contracts at the elbows bilaterally. Skin biopsy revealed the diagnosis of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with giant cells reaction. Case #2 was a 44-year-old black male with a hx of nephropathy. He eventually developed end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. One month after, he was found to have thickened, sclerotic appearing skin involving the upper back, hands, and forearms with flexing contracts of the all the small joints. Histopathology was most consistent with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy.

AB  - We describe here the case of a female patient with an otherwise classic invasive melanoma of the upper extremity, demonstrating the typical immunohistochemical profile, who presented three years later with massive ipsilateral axillary node metastases. The metastatic tumor had morphologic features similar to the primary melanoma, however at immunohistochemical level the tumor cells not only gained expression of pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) but also lost expression of all standard melanoma markers (S100, Melan-A, HMB-45, MIT-1, and tyrosinase) thus mimicking a poorly differentiated mammary carcinoma. Additional stains reveal expression of Vimentin, NSE, c-kit, CD10 and negativity for CK7, CK20, BR2, ER/PR, mucin, and LCA. To rule out a breast carcinoma, real-time RT-PCR was performed on a lymph node using six breast cancer-associated genes (>99% sensitivity), which was also negative. Clinical work-up of the patient failed to reveal abnormal masses in the breast or elsewhere. The clinical history, histological appearance, immunohistochemical profile (including negative CK7 and positive NSE, c-kit and CD10) as well as a negative RT-PCR renders almost null the possibility of a breast carcinoma and supports a diagnostic of melanoma in this case. Cases like ours may be easily misclassified unless a concerted approach is used to reach the correct diagnosis.

AB  - We present a 58-year-old Caucasian man who spawns sebaceous neoplasms with a widely varying histopathologic pattern, the true nature of which were difficult to determine in some of the cases. In a 10-year period, the patient developed over 20 lesions that varied in size, shape, and location. The patient denied a family history of either similar cutaneous lesions or internal malignancies that would fulfill the criteria of Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). Vigilant screening failed to reveal visceral carcinomas. The histopathologic findings of the neoplasms as well as the results of tests for microsatellite instability(MSI) in various tumors and the immunohistochemical staining for the mismatch repair genes (MMR) MSH2 and MLH1 will be discussed. Our patient has been maintained on low-dose isotretinoin since 1995.

AB  - A 53 year old woman with CML in the chronic phase received therapy with Imatinib on two separate occasions. Both occasions were followed by the development of an abrupt onset of skin lesions characterized by painful and tender erythematous plaques and nodules on the upper extremities that subsequently resolved with hyperpigmentation. The patient was also found to have pleural and pericardial effusions. She had a WBC count of 57,250 cells per mm3, a platelet count of 740,000 per mm3 and a single temperature spike of 100.4 °F. Over the course of a week the WBC count dropped to 51,520 cells per mm3 but the percent of mature neutrophils rose to 55%. Imatinib was discontinued and steroid therapy led to resolution of the skin lesions with residual pigmentation. A skin biopsy was obtained that showed neutrophilic dermatosis with epidermal sparing consistent with Sweet's syndrome but with atypical features such as extension into deep dermis and subcutaneous fat. Lab work up including blood cultures and bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures of the skin as well as special stains of the skin biopsy specimen failed to reveal any microbiological etiology.

AB  - Skin biopsies of 8 patients diagnosed with herpetic folliculitis by light microscopy were retrieved from the files of the UCSF Dermatopathology Service. Clinical and microscopical features were reviewed and tabulated, and PCR analysis was employed to seek DNA sequences specific for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The study group included 4 women and 4 men, ages 15 to 54. Five patients (62%) were immunosuppressed, with underlying conditions including HIV infection, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus erythematosus with polyarteritis nodosa. Microscopically, herpetic cytopathic changes involved the isthmus in 7/8 cases (87%), and involved the sebaceous apparatus in 4/8 cases (50%). Herpetic viropathic changes were not found within eccrine epithelium. A moderate to dense perifollicular infiltrate, comprised mostly of lymphocytes, was evident in 7/8 cases (87%). After PCR expansion of genetic material extracted from the original paraffin blocks, VZV-specific DNA sequences were detected in 8/8 cases. We conclude that herpetic folliculitis is a consequence of VZV infection. Because follicular herpetic infection is often accompanied by a dense perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate, the microscopical presentation can simulate inflammatory skin diseases such as lupus erythematosus. Level sections may be required for a specific diagnosis to be made.
