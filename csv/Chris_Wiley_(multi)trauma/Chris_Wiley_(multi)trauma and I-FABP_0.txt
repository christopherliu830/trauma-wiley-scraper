AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Purpose:?? ACPO often occurs in patients with serious comorbidities and can result in high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the current practice of treatment of pseudo obstruction in the era of neostigmine in a single metropolitan hospital. Method:?? A retrospective review of prospective hospital databases was undertaken to identify patients with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction and gather demographic information. Further information was retrieved from patient files. Results:?? 133 patients were identified with radiological evidence of pseudo-obstruction from June 1996 to December 2008. The median age was 68.5 (range 17?95). There were 80 (60%) males. Overall median length of stay was 37?days with a mortality rate of 9%. For conservative treatment or neostigmine (CN), endoscopic decompression (E), surgery (S) groups, the mortality rates were 9.5%, 8.6% and 6.2% respectively, p = 0.36. There were 94 patients in the CN group, 16 (12%) required surgery (S) and 23 (17%) had endoscopy (E), p = 0.36. The median time to diagnosis from admission was 10?days (CN), 0?days (E) and 7?days (S); p = 0.13. The most frequent mode of diagnosis was gastrograffin enema for CN (43), AXR for E (9) and CT abdomen for S (7). It was noted that 44 (33%) patients had unrelated surgery within the last 30?days prior to the current admission. Surgery for complications was required including 7 colectomies (44%) and 5 caecostomies (31%). Conclusion:?? Surgery remains crucial as a treatment modality for pseudo-obstruction in the era of neostigmine. The majority of operations performed at our institution for pseudo-obstruction were colectomies, which reflects a high rate of complications in our cohort of patients.

AB  - Background:?? The aim is to compare the outcomes of surgical management of large bowel emergencies. The traditional treatment of Hartmann's resection was compared to the new modalities of Colonic stenting for malignant obstruction and laparoscopic washout for perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. Methods:?? This paper is a retrospective review of 112 consecutive large bowel emergencies presenting to The Tweed Hospital and John Flynn Private Hospital warranting surgical intervention during the 8?year period 2000?2008. Patients with obstruction from cancer and perforation from diverticulitis were included. Patients with volvulus, pseudo-obstruction, bleeding, stercoral ulceration and prolapse were excluded. Patients with non urgent colonic stenting were also excluded. Results:?? The patient groups were comparable for age, ASA and pathology after exclusions. 57 patients underwent a Hartmann's (obstruction 23, perforation 34) vs. 55 patients undergoing stent for obstruction 21, or washout for perforation 34. Significant differences were observed in the mortality rates, Hartmann's 11/57 (19%) vs. stent and washout 2/55 (37%). Also length of stay: Hartmann's 15?days vs. stent and washout 6?days. Hartmann's was required to salvage 2 failed stents and 6 failed washouts. In 16 of 26 washouts and 11 of 17 stents patients underwent delayed elective resection. Conclusion:?? Patient selection, technical expertise and long learning curve were all aspects that influenced the early results of stenting and washout. Hartmann's is no longer the preferred treatment option for left sided colonic emergencies.

AB  - Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal ?-amyloid deposition (A?+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than A? deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A? to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A? pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A? deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by ?classic? AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract Almost every living thing requires iron (including aerobic, and facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria) because iron plays key roles in a broad range of physiologically essential molecular processes ranging from catalysis, oxygen transport, and oxidative phosphorylation to structuring proteins. The useful redox properties of iron enable its utility in these molecular functions, but its scarcity in the environment in bioavailable forms, coupled with the double-edged nature of its redox properties (which can lead to the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species), require complicated acquisition, transport, and storage mechanisms, both by environmental microbes and by higher animals. These iron acquisition mechanisms come into direct conflict when microbes compete with each other for this scarce resource in the environment and when pathogenic bacteria infect animal hosts. A very simple and potently effective strategy employed by many animals to ward off bacterial and fungal infections, at least in the early stages while pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses are developing, is to further constrict the already tightly controlled endogenous iron budget, starving invading microbial pathogens of needed iron. The complicated system of endogenous iron transport permits these changes in response to infection. However, in a countering response, successful pathogens have developed a variety of strategies to evade this defense, the simplest and most dramatic of which is perhaps exemplified by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, which has evolved away from the need for any iron whatsoever. Bacteria and protists have also developed sophisticated and complicated mechanisms to access heme-associated iron directly. However, other strategies developed by microbes to compete with each other for iron in the environment, mediated by small-molecule iron chelators called siderophores, are, in turn, useful to access the otherwise restricted pool of iron in transit in the body, carried as complexes with specific iron-binding proteins. To counter siderophore-mediated iron pilfering, animals have developed a panel of siderophore-specific binding proteins (siderocalins) to steal the iron (and siderophore) back. To subvert this counterstrategy, successful pathogenic bacteria modify their siderophores into stealthy forms that cannot bind to host siderocalins. As with any arms race (e.g., the process of evolution), the cycle of response/counterresponse is likely to continue ad infinitum.

AB  - Summary The paramount aim of predictive toxicology in drug discovery and development is to assess the safety of drugs for use in humans. This chapter presents drug induced kidney injury as an example to illustrate the value and limitations of novel biomarkers by providing an overview of their (patho) physiological role and mechanistic link to toxicity, performance in experimental toxicity studies, approval by regulatory bodies, and application to preclinical decision making. Traditional markers of renal function such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are inherently insensitive as they indicate kidney injury only when large amounts of the renal epithelium have been lost. The most widely studied urinary kidney biomarker is kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM-1) encoded by the gene Havr1 (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1). Advances in science and technology (e.g., microRNAs, next-generation sequencing) may also offer unique opportunities for the discovery of predictive biomarkers.

AB  - Summary Background The prevalence of exercise-induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms has been reported up to 70%. The pathophysiology largely remains unknown. Aim To review the physiological and pathophysiological changes of the GI-tract during physical exercise and the management of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods Search of the literature published in the English and Dutch languages using the Pubmed database to review the literature that focused on the relation between splanchnic blood flow (SBF), development of ischaemia, postischaemic endotoxinemia and motility. Results During physical exercise, the increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) redistributes blood flow from the splanchnic organs to the working muscles. With prolonged duration and/or intensity, the SBF may be decreased by 80% or more. Most studies point in the direction of increased SNS-activity as central driving force for reduction in SBF. A severely reduced SBF may frequently cause GI ischaemia. GI-ischaemia combined with reduced vagal activity probably triggers changes in GI-motility and GI absorption derangements. GI-symptoms during physical exercise may be prevented by lowering the exercise intensity, preventing dehydration and avoiding the ingestion of hypertonic fluids. Conclusions Literature on the pathophysiology of exercise-induced GI-symptoms is scarce. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity and decreased splanchnic blood flow during physical exercise seems to be the key factor in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced GI-symptoms, and this should be the target for symptom reduction.

AB  - Summary Peri-operative acute kidney injury is common, accounting for 30?40% of all in-hospital cases of acute kidney injury. It is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality even with what was hitherto regarded as relatively trivial increases in serum creatinine, and carries over a 12-fold relative risk of death following major abdominal surgery. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, liver disease and particularly pre-existing chronic kidney disease, as well as the type and urgency of surgery, are major risk factors for the development of postoperative acute kidney injury. As yet, there are no specific treatment options for the injured kidney, although there are several modifiable risk factors of which the anaesthetist should be aware. As well as the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and appropriate volume balance, optimal anaesthetic management should aim to reduce the risk of postoperative renal complications. This may include careful ventilatory management and blood pressure control, as well as appropriate analgesic strategies. The choice of anaesthetic agent may also influence renal outcomes. Rather than concentrate on the classical management of acute kidney injury, this review focuses on the potential development of acute kidney injury peri-operatively, and the means by which this may be ameliorated.

AB  - Redox-active iron, catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species, has been implicated in experimental renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, in clinical transplantation, it is unknown whether redox-active iron is involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic injury of non-heart-beating (NHB) donor kidneys. We measured redox-active iron concentrations in perfusate samples of 231 deceased donor kidneys that were preserved by machine pulsatile perfusion at our institution between May 1998 and November 2002 using the bleomycin detectable iron assay. During machine pulsatile perfusion, redox-active iron was released into the preservation solution. Ischemically injured NHB donor kidneys had significantly higher perfusate redox-active iron concentrations than heart-beating (HB) donor kidneys that were not subjected to warm ischemia (3.9 ± 1.1 vs. 2.8 ± 1.0 ?mol/L, p = 0.001). Moreover, redox-active iron concentration was an independent predictor of post-transplant graft viability (odds ratio 1.68, p = 0.01) and added predictive value to currently available donor and graft characteristics. This was particularly evident in uncontrolled NHB donor kidneys for which there is the greatest uncertainty about transplant outcomes. Therefore, perfusate redox-active iron concentration shows promise as a novel viability marker of NHB donor kidneys.
