AB  - Abstract Natural and synthetic materials have been developed to provide a three-dimensional (3-D) scaffold that mimics the extracellular matrix properties for tissue regeneration and reconstruction. On account of the excellent biological and mechanical properties, diverse decellularized tissue materials have been developed as natural scaffolds. Among them, decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has generated great interest in recent years due to the extensiveness of the source and the eximious potential to enhance the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues. In this review, we compared the different physical, chemical, and biological treatment in recorded decellularization methods, and illustrated the similarities and differences in the characteristics of various aspects of DATs prepared by different methods, including macroscopic (macro) and microcosmic (micro) structure, cellular contents removal, DNA quantification, collagen, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) or growth factors retention, and mechanical properties. We also summarized the DAT application in the studies of tissue regeneration, wound healing, drug screening, and other diseases. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose:?? A sentinel case of missed rectal malignancy resulting in a poor outcome for a patient prompted a search for a process that ensures adequate follow up of all significant histopathology results. This paper aims to quantify the problem of inadequate histopathology follow up and develop an electronic tool and review process to ensure the patient's results are acted upon appropriately. Methodology:?? A Histopathology audit was undertaken at the Geelong Hospital between 2002 and 2006. Patients where inadequate follow up had occurred were identified. The situation for these patients was rectified and the risk quantified. An integrated electronic tool was then developed including a minimum data set. A review process was then tested to ensure adequacy of future follow up. Results:?? 6.3% (120/1912) of histopathology results in a 5?year period had been inadequately followed up. No further adverse outcomes were identified but each case was a potential time bomb for the patients who were not scheduled for clinical review (3.8%) or a recommended procedure (2.5%). A process of follow up has now been implemented and a minimum data set, procedure and electronic audit tool developed to assist with this process. Conclusion:?? Failure of adequate follow up of histopathology is a potential pitfall in any large health system. One such failure led to a disastrous outcome and a comprehensive audit suggested 6.3% of patients in the last 5?years were also at risk. We have established a review process we believe is reliable and developed an electronic tool to facilitate this process.

AB  - Objective:?? To determine whether serum antioxidant capacity measured by the electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) could resolve differences in severity of the inflammatory disease acute pancreatitis. Methods:?? Experimental animal study using male Wistar rats. Group 1 (baseline), immediate euthanasia with no surgical interventions; Group 2 (sham), identical surgical procedures to the pancreatitis groups but no intraductal infusion; Groups 3?5, acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 3%, 4% or 5% sodium taurocholate respectively. Terminal blood and pancreatic tissue samples for CV, biochemistry and histology were collected at 12?h (Groups 2?5). Results:?? There was a significant positive correlation of the first serum cyclic voltametric peak current maxima (CVi1) with pancreatic histological severity (Spearman r = 0.51, p = 0.007) as well as with a number of other markers of systemic disease severity, notably bicarbonate (r =?0.57, p = 0.002), base excess (r =?0.65, p < 0.001) urea (r =?0.68, p < 0.001) and calcium (r =?0.60, p = 0.008). CVi1 was superior at indicating the severity of the disease state compared to a standard method of total antioxidant capacity measurement. Conclusions:?? CV was found to be a simple, technique that could differentiate between the physiological and histological severities of acute pancreatitis. Further clinical studies are now justified to determine if point-of-care CV offers prognostic and treatment-monitoring advantages for severe acute inflammatory illnesses within the critical care setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? Inguinal hernia repair is a common operation with much focus in recent times on improving morbidity. The use of mesh repair has greatly decreased reoccurrence rates and focus turns towards improving postoperative groin pain. This review examines the use of UHS in inguinal hernia repair and relation with postoperative groin pain. Methods:?? A retrospective audit of consecutive cases over one year (telephone and mailed questionnaires) was conducted. The recently validated IPQ (inguinal pain score) was used. A review of files and operative reports was also undertaken. Cases undergoing bilateral repair, or other operations simultaneously were excluded. Results:?? 59 patients (61%) participated in the audit, with a mean follow up of 11?months (range 5?16). 4 minor wound complications occurred. Higher pain scores appeared to correlate preoperatively with age and workers compensation status. Postoperative pain scores and limitation to functional status were low, and trended towards lower values in the UHS (ultrapro hernia system) repair group compared to the group who underwent repair with PHS (preceding week pain scores respectively ?UHS repair, mean 1.22, (95%CI 1.07?1.38); PHS 1.76, (95%CI 1.11?2.43)). The average time until pain disappeared in the groin was within one month (IPQ score of 1.27). For those patients still experiencing any pain, (14 of 59; 23.7%) it occurred on average, once per week for minutes to hours and was at a level that could be ignored. Conclusion:?? Inguinal hernia repair with UHS appears to be a safe procedure with minimal complications and a favourable postoperative chronic pain profile.

AB  - Introduction:?? The goal of an acute general surgical unit (AGSU) is to improve the management of all emergency surgical admissions including those with acute gall bladder disease. In May 2008, John Hunter Hospital Newcastle implemented an AGSU. Changes to service provision included an in-house consultant (7?am to 7?pm) dedicated to acute surgery with access to an afternoon operating list most weekdays. This study compares the management of acute gall bladder disease before and after implementation of the AGSU in the setting of an unchanged policy of operative management during the index admission (where appropriate) for acute gall bladder disease. Method:?? An analysis was performed of all patients admitted via the emergency department with biliary colic or cholecystitis. Demographic, clinical management data and complications were compared for the 6?months of June to November (inclusive) 2007 (pre-AGSU) and 2008 (AGSU). Results:?? In 6?months of 2007, 45 patients were admitted with acute gall bladder disease of which 35 (78%) underwent operative management. By comparison in the same 6?months of 2008, there were 70 admissions, with operative management in 61 (87%). In 2008 average length of stay was 4.24?days (5.07?days in 2007); average time from admission to surgery 34.8?hrs (54.5?hours in 2007, p < 0.05) and, 70.5% of operations occurred between 8?am and 5?pm on a weekday (60% in 2007). Conclusion:?? The provision of an acute gall bladder service is improved within a dedicated acute general surgical unit. This translates to benefits to patients, staff and healthcare economics.

AB  - The SAT SET course is an innovative course designed by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in response to a need to meet the challenges posed by the new SET training program. The course aims to teach current Fellows of the College a number of skills and evaluation methods required of surgical supervisors in assessment and performance management. Specifically, the course demonstrates effective use of the Mini-CEX and DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) for initial and mid-term assessment of trainees; discusses the College's training policies and relevant legal issues such as the appeals process, as well as explaining expectations of their roles as supervisors and trainers. The course is a forerunner in Australia in active teaching of modern competency-based assessment tools implemented across a number of disciplines and workplace environments. From its commencement in May 2007 until September 2008, 555 Fellows have participated in SAT SET courses convened in Australia and New Zealand (229 in 2007, 326 in 2008). In addition, 185 SET Supervisor Fellows have attended the course, approximately 40% of all Surgical Supervisors in Australasia. Our survey aims to test the outcomes of the SAT SET course by the cumulative feedback from Supervisors who have attended the course and follow-up. Future iterations to improve the course, such as video demonstration of mid-term assessment, co-badging of SAT SET courses with hospitals and expansion of resources for facilitators will also be discussed.

AB  - Background:?? The main aims of intestinal failure (IF) surgery are to reduce the severity of IF in patients by repairing fistulae and restoring continuity in those with short gut, and to restore body image. We report on the surgical management of IF patients at a major tertiary referral institution, in order to evaluate current management practises and outcomes. Methods:?? Retrospective review of outcomes between July 2005 and December 2007. Results:?? 60 patients (36 male; median age 47?yrs) underwent 78 operations. On presentation 42 (70%) required parenteral nutrition (PN) and 34 (57%) had stomas. IF was secondary to short gut in 19 (30%) or enterocutaneous fistulae in 42 (70%). Median number of procedures before referral was 4 (1?14). Median time from last operation to our intervention was 365?days (25?3534). Median length of stay postoperatively was 16?days, and at a median follow-up of 268?days, 54 (90%) had been discharged from surgical care. 7 (12%) required ICU care postoperatively but 30?day/inpatient mortality rates were 0%. Re-fistulation occurred in 5 patients. 23 (56%) became independent of PN. Residual small bowel length was the only significant contributing factor identified (p = 0.007). Conclusion:?? Surgical management of IF is safe when performed in a dedicated unit and when time is allowed for patient optimisation.

AB  - Peptic ulcers (PU) are the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They result in significant costs both to the patient and the health care system. Despite a decrease in the prevalence of H. pylori infection, the incidence of bleeding PU has not reduced. Resuscitation of the patient with a bleeding PU remains the foundation of management. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has evolved from initially a diagnostic tool to now also being a therapeutic modality. The endoscopic stigmata of a visible vessel or active bleeding have been validated as indicators of a high risk of adverse outcomes. Multiple endoscopic techniques have been developed to treat bleeding PU with these stigmata. The most effective and commonly used are thermal contact therapy (heater probe or bipolar electrocoagulation) and endoscopic clipping. They are each used either as monotherapies or combined with adrenaline injection. These techniques have been shown to reduce the rates of rebleeding, surgery and mortality. Early studies showed no benefit from the use of H2-receptor antagonists in patients with bleeding PU. In contrast, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) given after endoscopic haemostatic therapy as a bolus and then a subsequent 72?hr infusion, have been shown to significantly reduce the rates of rebleeding,, surgery and mortality compared to placebo. In summary, endoscopic techniques combined with pharmacological treatment with PPIs significantly improve outcomes in patients with bleeding PU with high risk endoscopic stigmata. These methods are widely available and are essential in the optimal modern management of bleeding PU.
