AB  - Background:?? Previous studies have shown that nutritional status affects recovery after elective surgery. The impact of nutritional status in the acute surgical setting has not been well defined. Methods:?? Over a 4?week period consecutive patients admitted for >24?hours under the general surgical service at a tertiary hospital were screened on admission using the subjective global assessment (SGA) nutritional assessment tool. Results:?? Of 332 eligible patients, 310 were screened. Diagnoses at discharge were: Colorectal pathology (28%), Infective (23%), Hepatopancreaticobiliary (15%), upper gastrointestinal (9%), Vascular (5%), trauma (5%), other (15%). 5% had a malignancy diagnosed during their admission. Mean age was 52?years (95% CI 18?84), mean BMI was 28.6?kg/m2 (95% CI 19.2?41.7), and 170 (55%) were female. 48% were deemed well nourished (SGA-A), 40% had moderate/suspected malnutrition (SGA-B) and 12% were severely malnourished (SGA-C). Median (range) hospital stay was 3 (1?20), 5 (1?30) and 7 (2?38)?days (p < 0.001 Kruskal Wallis) for SGA category A to C respectively. Cox regression revealed that SGA was an independent predictor of day stay after taking age, malignancy, sex, albumin, lymphocyte and diagnosis into consideration. Conclusion:?? Nutritional status in the acute surgical setting, as measured by a simple clinical tool predicts duration of hospital stay. Admission nutrition screening may be considered in order to determine nutritional requirements of acute surgical patients.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery Programs (EPR) have been shown to reduce mortality, morbidity and length of stay. Can similar results be produced in tertiary centres with the presence of complex colorectal cases? Method:?? 102 patients were prospectively analysed with a power calculation of 34 being established prior to commencement of the study. The average age was 66.6 (male: female ratio of 1:1). Data collection included demographics, operative procedure, pain scores, POSSUM scores, American Society of Anaesthiology (ASA) scores, and discharge times. All complications were documented. Results:?? 83 cases were open procedures and 19 laparoscopically, (3 were converted intra-operatively). The majority were anterior resection (47, [46.1%]) and right hemicolectomies (32, [31.3%]). The average overall discharge time was 11.75?days compared to 15.11 (p < 0.001) prior to commencement of the study in 2005. Anterior resections and subtotal colectomies (14.3 and 13.7?days respectively) had significantly longer lengths of stay compared to right hemicolectomies (10.7?days) [p < 0.001]. 56% patients were ASA grade 3 & 4 (50% and 6% respectively). A clear correlation with increasing ASA and discharge time was demonstrated (ANOVA p = 0.0004) with significant exponential rise with ASA greater than 2. POSSUM scoring demonstrated a positive correlation with prolonged hospital stay with increasing scores having worse discharge time. Conclusion:?? In the presence of complex major surgery and tertiary centre referrals an ERP is feasible producing an average saving of 3.36?days. The benefit is however less with increasing ASA and POSSUM Scores. It however still produced an average economic bed stay saving cost of $3700 per patient stay.

AB  - Background:?? Colonoscopy is the gold standard for investigating pathology of the large bowel. Numerous factors influence the efficacy of bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel preparation can lead to missed pathology. Timing of preparation, timing of procedure and patient bowel habit may have an influence on the quality of the preparation. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of cleansing of sodium picosulphate with different administration schedules and to evaluate whether patient's prior bowel patterns influenced quality of cleansing. Methods:?? 325 patients were interviewed prior to colonoscopy to evaluate prior bowel habit and timing of preparation administration. The quality of preparation was then assessed during colonoscopy. Further patient factors evaluated included patient tolerance, compliance and adverse reactions to preparation. Procedural factors evaluated included quality of cleansing and circular muscle hypertrophy. Procedure total time, caecal intubation time and withdrawal times were also recorded. A 5-point scale was used to assess quality of cleansing. Results:?? The quality of cleansing for individual bowel segments was worse for afternoon procedures (p < 0.05 for all segments), and for patients with prior constipation (p < 0.05 for transverse and descending segments). No correlation was found between the quality indicators (total duration, caecal intubation time, withdrawal times), colon length, circular muscle hypertrophy or presence of diverticula for cleansing quality. Conclusion:?? The quality of cleansing is significantly improved when bowel preparation is taken the day prior to colonoscopy. In addition patients with prior constipation demonstrated poorer cleansing.

AB  - Purpose:?? Burnout is the state of prolonged physical, emotional, and psychological exhaustion characteristic of individuals working in human service occupations. This study examines the prevalence of burnout among Younger Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), and its relationship to demographic variables. Methodology:?? In March 2008, a survey was sent via email to 1,287 Younger Fellows. This included demographic questions, a measure of burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and an estimate of social desirability (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale ? Form C). Results:?? The sample comprised 278 participants ? an overall response rate of 21.6%. Females exhibited higher levels of personal burnout and work-related burnout, but no significant difference in patient-related burnout. Younger Fellows in hospitals with less than 50 beds reported significantly higher patient-related burnout levels. An equal work division between public and private practice resulted in higher work-related burnout than concentration of work in one sector. Younger Fellows working more than 60?hours per week reported significantly higher personal burnout than those who worked less than this. There was no significant correlation between age, country of practice, surgical specialty and any of the burnout subscales. Conclusion:?? Female surgeons, surgeons that work in smaller hospitals, those that work more than 60?hours per week, and those with practice division between the private and public sectors, are at a particularly high risk of burnout. Further enquiry into potentially remediable causes for the increased burnout in these groups is indicated.

AB  - Purpose:?? Early identification of the disease severity in acute pancreatitis and focused management based on Ranson's criteria has shown to improved patients? outcomes in many trials. We introduced Ranson's criteria at Ipswich Hospital in 2007 and compared the patients? outcome using historical controls. Methodology:?? A retrospective chart analysis was undertaken on patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis at Ipswich Hospital between 2006 and 2007. Ranson's criteria and treatment protocols were introduced in January 2007 and data was collected prospectively. Data was assessed for the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, transfers to tertiary centres, morbidity and mortality. Results:?? 33 patients were admitted with acute pancreatitis in 2006 compared to 76 patients in 2007. Ranson's criteria were not formally assessed in any patient prior to 2007. However, 88% of patients had Ranson's criteria scored with strict adherence to the treatment protocol since 2007. 13 patients were scored as severe (greater than 3) in 2007 compared to none in 2006. 6% of patients developed pneumonia compared to 14% in 2007. Length of stay was 5.5?days in 2007 versus 4.87?days in 2006. Five ICU admissions and 4 transfers to tertiary centres occurred in 2007 compared to one transfer with no ICU admissions in 2006. There was no mortality in 2006 compared to 2% in 2007. Conclusion:?? Use of Ranson's criteria enables us to tailor our treatment of acute pancreatitis. It is a clinically useful tool and strict adherence leads to quick severity stratification, improved management and better use of health care resources.

AB  - Purpose:?? Providing enteral supplements containing ?immunonutrition? has been proposed to decrease postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay for elective surgical patients. This meta-analysis was undertaken to elucidate the potential benefit of providing immune-enhanced nutrition in surgical patients. Methodology:?? A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing the use of perioperative immunonutrition with standard nutrition provision in elective adult surgical patients between 1990 and 2008. The variables analysed included mortality, total complications, infective complications, anastomotic leak and length of hospital stay. Results:?? 21 distinct studies were identified that met inclusion criteria involving 2135 patients (immunonutrition n = 1100; standard nutrition n = 935). The provision of immunonutrition was shown to be associated with significant reductions in the incidence of total postoperative complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69, p < 0.0001), postoperative infective complications (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37, 0.60, p < 0.0001), anastomotic breakdown (OR 0.43, 95% 0.25, 0.75, p = 0.003), and the duration of hospital stay (WMD ?2.95, 95% CI ?4.01, ?1.88, p < 0.0001) when compared to standard nutritional provision. No differences were seen between interventions with relation to mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41, 1.97. p = 0.8). Conclusion:?? Provision of immunonutrition in preference to standard nutrition was associated with clinically significant decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in the development of postoperative complications including those of infective origin and anastomotic breakdown but has no impact on mortality.

AB  - Background:?? Presacral lesions often present late because of non-specific presenting symptoms and imaging findings that are difficult to interpret. We present the clinical scenario and review of the literature. Methods:?? A plexiform neurofibroma presenting as a presacral mass is described, with the difficulties in diagnosis and investigation explored. Results:?? CT and MRI are useful imaging modalities in the diagnosis of an undifferentiated presacral mass and certainly contribute to eliminating some differential diagnoses and exploring characteristics of the lesion, but ultimately the need for a histological diagnosis and surgical excision is highlighted. Conclusion:?? Presacral masses are difficult to diagnose, assess and treat. Adequate imaging and histological confirmation are essential in their treatment.

AB  - Introduction:?? Lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (LGIH) is a major health burden. Although for the majority no intervention is required, where conservative management fails, radiological intervention is required to either localise or embolise the bleeding vessels. In recent years CT angiography (CTA) has increasingly been used for localisation. This study assesses the utilisation of this investigation in patients with acute LGIH. Methods:?? A review of all patients admitted to the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle with acute LGIH was performed and patients undergoing CTA selected. The utility and safety of CTA was assessed as well as a comparison made between positive and negative tests. Results:?? Between January 2005 and August 2008 there were 334 emergency admissions with LGIH of which 79 patients underwent CTA. In 30 (38%) patients, CTA localised an active bleeding site. Of the remaining 49 CTA, other pathology was identified in 8 (10%). Overall mortality was 5% and intervention rate was 9% (4 segmental colectomy and 3 selective angiography). There was no difference in rate of intervention or mortality between the CTA positive and negative groups. Transfusion requirement (4.28 vs. 2.34 units, p < 0.05) and haemodynamic instability at the time of CTA were higher in the positive CTA group. Conclusion:?? LGIH will resolve without intervention in the majority. CTA is safe and a positive test is not indicative of a higher intervention rate but provides a management strategy. We suggest it be performed on patients receiving more than 2 units of packed cells or those with haemodynamic instability.

AB  - Introduction:?? Surgical teaching for clinical medical students is often undertaken across multiple clinical campuses. There are concerns heterogeneity of clinical experience may result in heterogeneity of learning outcome achievements. To avoid this, we have utilised standardised learning materials and tutorials across four hospital campuses. Methods:?? Using a feedback questionnaire, clinical experience from assigned hospitals was collected, including a question on influence of clinical experience on future career choice. This was analysed for inter-hospital differences. Clinical experience was also assessed by analysis of individual student portfolios. Students were administered a centralised standardised formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) during rotations. We analysed OSCE results from 2005 to 2008 for internal reliability and correlation with final written examination grades on a hospital-by-hospital basis. Results:?? Analysis of student feedback results and portfolios identified inter-hospital differences in clinical experience. Students indicated that clinical experiences had influence on decision to pursue future surgical careers. The OSCE had a good level of internal reliability (Cronbach's-alpha 0.62?0.75). No significant inter-hospital difference in OSCE results was found using one-way analysis of variance. OSCE results had strong correlations with final examination grades. Conclusions:?? Heterogeneity of clinical experience across different teaching settings does not translate into heterogeneity in achievement of learning outcomes when teaching materials are standardised. Consistent with previous published data, undergraduate clinical experience may influence future career choices.

AB  - Purpose:?? Stoma formation is a standard procedure in gastrointestinal surgery; however, the incidence seems to remain high. Here, we performed a prospective study on 137 patients with ileostomy or colostomy in order to identify potential risk factors. Methodology:?? 137 patients received stomas and were prospectively followed up four times after surgery. Early and late stoma complications, potential risk factors, and QOL were recorded using a modified SF-36 form. Results were subjected to statistical analysis and discussed with the view onto the current literature. Results:?? 72 patients received a colostomy and 65 patients an ileostomy. There was a complication rate of 55.5% (n = 76). 53 patients had early, 44 patients had late, and some had both early and late complications. Early complications occurred less than two months after surgery and included necrosis (16.1%), abscess (13.9%), and dehiscence (10.9%). Late complications included parastomal hernia (11.7%), chronic peristomal skin alteration (8.8%), stenosis (6.6%), prolaps (3.6%), and retraction 0.7%). 15 patients with late stoma complications needed surgery. High body mass index, emergency procedure, and omitted preoperative stoma marking were associated with significant higher risks for developing stoma complications. The availability of a stoma nurse greatly influenced outcome and QOL. Conclusion:?? Stoma complications are not rare and the surgeon should pay special attention to details of the technique. QOL of stoma patients is greatly influenced by specially trained stoma nurses. The identified risk factors have to be considered in order to reduce the incidence of stoma complications in the future.

AB  - Purpose:?? A sentinel case of missed rectal malignancy resulting in a poor outcome for a patient prompted a search for a process that ensures adequate follow up of all significant histopathology results. This paper aims to quantify the problem of inadequate histopathology follow up and develop an electronic tool and review process to ensure the patient's results are acted upon appropriately. Methodology:?? A Histopathology audit was undertaken at the Geelong Hospital between 2002 and 2006. Patients where inadequate follow up had occurred were identified. The situation for these patients was rectified and the risk quantified. An integrated electronic tool was then developed including a minimum data set. A review process was then tested to ensure adequacy of future follow up. Results:?? 6.3% (120/1912) of histopathology results in a 5?year period had been inadequately followed up. No further adverse outcomes were identified but each case was a potential time bomb for the patients who were not scheduled for clinical review (3.8%) or a recommended procedure (2.5%). A process of follow up has now been implemented and a minimum data set, procedure and electronic audit tool developed to assist with this process. Conclusion:?? Failure of adequate follow up of histopathology is a potential pitfall in any large health system. One such failure led to a disastrous outcome and a comprehensive audit suggested 6.3% of patients in the last 5?years were also at risk. We have established a review process we believe is reliable and developed an electronic tool to facilitate this process.

AB  - Objective:?? To determine whether serum antioxidant capacity measured by the electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) could resolve differences in severity of the inflammatory disease acute pancreatitis. Methods:?? Experimental animal study using male Wistar rats. Group 1 (baseline), immediate euthanasia with no surgical interventions; Group 2 (sham), identical surgical procedures to the pancreatitis groups but no intraductal infusion; Groups 3?5, acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 3%, 4% or 5% sodium taurocholate respectively. Terminal blood and pancreatic tissue samples for CV, biochemistry and histology were collected at 12?h (Groups 2?5). Results:?? There was a significant positive correlation of the first serum cyclic voltametric peak current maxima (CVi1) with pancreatic histological severity (Spearman r = 0.51, p = 0.007) as well as with a number of other markers of systemic disease severity, notably bicarbonate (r =?0.57, p = 0.002), base excess (r =?0.65, p < 0.001) urea (r =?0.68, p < 0.001) and calcium (r =?0.60, p = 0.008). CVi1 was superior at indicating the severity of the disease state compared to a standard method of total antioxidant capacity measurement. Conclusions:?? CV was found to be a simple, technique that could differentiate between the physiological and histological severities of acute pancreatitis. Further clinical studies are now justified to determine if point-of-care CV offers prognostic and treatment-monitoring advantages for severe acute inflammatory illnesses within the critical care setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? Inguinal hernia repair is a common operation with much focus in recent times on improving morbidity. The use of mesh repair has greatly decreased reoccurrence rates and focus turns towards improving postoperative groin pain. This review examines the use of UHS in inguinal hernia repair and relation with postoperative groin pain. Methods:?? A retrospective audit of consecutive cases over one year (telephone and mailed questionnaires) was conducted. The recently validated IPQ (inguinal pain score) was used. A review of files and operative reports was also undertaken. Cases undergoing bilateral repair, or other operations simultaneously were excluded. Results:?? 59 patients (61%) participated in the audit, with a mean follow up of 11?months (range 5?16). 4 minor wound complications occurred. Higher pain scores appeared to correlate preoperatively with age and workers compensation status. Postoperative pain scores and limitation to functional status were low, and trended towards lower values in the UHS (ultrapro hernia system) repair group compared to the group who underwent repair with PHS (preceding week pain scores respectively ?UHS repair, mean 1.22, (95%CI 1.07?1.38); PHS 1.76, (95%CI 1.11?2.43)). The average time until pain disappeared in the groin was within one month (IPQ score of 1.27). For those patients still experiencing any pain, (14 of 59; 23.7%) it occurred on average, once per week for minutes to hours and was at a level that could be ignored. Conclusion:?? Inguinal hernia repair with UHS appears to be a safe procedure with minimal complications and a favourable postoperative chronic pain profile.

AB  - Introduction:?? The goal of an acute general surgical unit (AGSU) is to improve the management of all emergency surgical admissions including those with acute gall bladder disease. In May 2008, John Hunter Hospital Newcastle implemented an AGSU. Changes to service provision included an in-house consultant (7?am to 7?pm) dedicated to acute surgery with access to an afternoon operating list most weekdays. This study compares the management of acute gall bladder disease before and after implementation of the AGSU in the setting of an unchanged policy of operative management during the index admission (where appropriate) for acute gall bladder disease. Method:?? An analysis was performed of all patients admitted via the emergency department with biliary colic or cholecystitis. Demographic, clinical management data and complications were compared for the 6?months of June to November (inclusive) 2007 (pre-AGSU) and 2008 (AGSU). Results:?? In 6?months of 2007, 45 patients were admitted with acute gall bladder disease of which 35 (78%) underwent operative management. By comparison in the same 6?months of 2008, there were 70 admissions, with operative management in 61 (87%). In 2008 average length of stay was 4.24?days (5.07?days in 2007); average time from admission to surgery 34.8?hrs (54.5?hours in 2007, p < 0.05) and, 70.5% of operations occurred between 8?am and 5?pm on a weekday (60% in 2007). Conclusion:?? The provision of an acute gall bladder service is improved within a dedicated acute general surgical unit. This translates to benefits to patients, staff and healthcare economics.

AB  - The SAT SET course is an innovative course designed by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in response to a need to meet the challenges posed by the new SET training program. The course aims to teach current Fellows of the College a number of skills and evaluation methods required of surgical supervisors in assessment and performance management. Specifically, the course demonstrates effective use of the Mini-CEX and DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) for initial and mid-term assessment of trainees; discusses the College's training policies and relevant legal issues such as the appeals process, as well as explaining expectations of their roles as supervisors and trainers. The course is a forerunner in Australia in active teaching of modern competency-based assessment tools implemented across a number of disciplines and workplace environments. From its commencement in May 2007 until September 2008, 555 Fellows have participated in SAT SET courses convened in Australia and New Zealand (229 in 2007, 326 in 2008). In addition, 185 SET Supervisor Fellows have attended the course, approximately 40% of all Surgical Supervisors in Australasia. Our survey aims to test the outcomes of the SAT SET course by the cumulative feedback from Supervisors who have attended the course and follow-up. Future iterations to improve the course, such as video demonstration of mid-term assessment, co-badging of SAT SET courses with hospitals and expansion of resources for facilitators will also be discussed.

AB  - Background:?? The main aims of intestinal failure (IF) surgery are to reduce the severity of IF in patients by repairing fistulae and restoring continuity in those with short gut, and to restore body image. We report on the surgical management of IF patients at a major tertiary referral institution, in order to evaluate current management practises and outcomes. Methods:?? Retrospective review of outcomes between July 2005 and December 2007. Results:?? 60 patients (36 male; median age 47?yrs) underwent 78 operations. On presentation 42 (70%) required parenteral nutrition (PN) and 34 (57%) had stomas. IF was secondary to short gut in 19 (30%) or enterocutaneous fistulae in 42 (70%). Median number of procedures before referral was 4 (1?14). Median time from last operation to our intervention was 365?days (25?3534). Median length of stay postoperatively was 16?days, and at a median follow-up of 268?days, 54 (90%) had been discharged from surgical care. 7 (12%) required ICU care postoperatively but 30?day/inpatient mortality rates were 0%. Re-fistulation occurred in 5 patients. 23 (56%) became independent of PN. Residual small bowel length was the only significant contributing factor identified (p = 0.007). Conclusion:?? Surgical management of IF is safe when performed in a dedicated unit and when time is allowed for patient optimisation.

AB  - Herniae have been documented since ancient times, but the era of modern hernia treatment is accepted as starting with the surgery of Bassini. Suture repairs of various types then dominated the treatment of hernia until the era of mesh repair championed by Stoppa and Lichtenstein. Surgeons feel that mesh repairs have revolutionized hernia surgery. Have the mesh repairs really made such a difference? There is evidence that all is not as it seems! Published recurrence figures don't seem to withstand close scrutiny. One of the trendy terms in herniology is the ?myo-pectineal orifice?, while many hernia specialists pay lip service to this concept, very few available hernia operations address this problem. The latest area of interest in the world of hernia surgery is the area of post-hernia groin pain, either neuralgic or non-neuralgic. There are studies showing an incidence of chronic groin pain following anterior repairs of 30% or more, and yet these operations are the most common hernia operations in the world! Keith in 1924 first postulated the concept of herniosis and was criticized. However there is a large volume of convincing evidence that herniae are manifestations of a metabolic disorder. They are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm and possibly with such diverse conditions as diverticular disease, cholelithiasis, and perhaps haemorrhoidal disease. Are we there yet? The answer is certainly no. However research into the metabolic problem of hernia development means that we are surely closer than we have ever been before.

AB  - Background:?? The rate of adverse events occurring in Australian hospitals is reported to be up to 12?17%. Adverse events need to be identified, reported and responded to if the system of health care is to be improved. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and nature of adverse events (unintentional harm arising as a result of healthcare) in general surgery in the Geelong Hospital. Method:?? A review was conducted of adverse events in the hospital incident reporting system (Riskman) and general surgical audits between 2004 and 2008. Adverse events were categorised according to severity (1?4) and the hospital response to these events noted. Results:?? There were 888 adverse events arising in 12801 general surgical admissions (6.93%). Their severity assessment codes (SAC) were: catastrophic (0.15%),; major (0.40%),; moderate (2.22%),; and minor (4.30). Some of the complications reported in surgical audits were also adverse events, the major ones being mortality (0.74%), unplanned reoperation (1.27%) and unplanned readmission (1.46%). Identification and tracking of these enabled implementation of system changes. These included a colorectal outcome reporting, PreVENT program (for DVT prophylaxis), review of colonoscopy initiatives, bedside tracheostomy care, and an electronic system to respond to pathology results (TR3). Conclusion:?? The adverse event rates occurring in general surgery at the Geelong Hospital were lower than those previously reported in the literature and may reflect a general improvement in the quality of care during the last decade if these rates are applicable to other hospitals. The hospital response to adverse events has resulted in significant sustainable system changes.

AB  - Introduction:?? The aim of the study was to evaluate whether C reactive protein level (CRP) on admission could aid the diagnostic accuracy of Alvarado score in acute appendicitis. Patients and methods : 233 patients (males 115, females 118, median age 28?years, range 15?87?years) who underwent appendicectomy were evaluated. Methods:?? Patients were categorized in to 3 groups retrospectively based on the Alvarado score. Group I: score 7?10 (n = 154), Group II: score 4?6 (n = 66), Group III: score < 3 (n = 13). Negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of CRP which was performed at the time of admission was calculated. Results:?? Overall, 169 of 233 (72.5%) had histopathological confirmation of acute appendicitis. In Group I it was 134 patients (87%), Group II: 35 patients (53%) and none of patients in Group III. NPV and PPV for Group I was 29.6% and 85.5%, Group II was 65% and 80% respectively. Conclusion:?? The CRP level improves the predictive value of diagnosing acute appendicitis in the equivocal group of Alvarado 4?6. Patients in this group with a normal CRP should be further investigated before proceeding to appendicectomy.

AB  - Aim: 1 Determine the sensitivity and specificity of Webster wound dehiscence (WD) risk scoring system when applied to a population beyond purely a veterans population as in Webster study. 2 Identify additional risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD that was not considered in the Webster study. Method:?? Bi-centre, retrospective case ? control analysis of preoperative and postoperative risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD over seven years (Jan 2000?Dec 2006). 103 patients with abdominal WD were compared to a randomly selected control group of 103 patients with midline laparotomies who were matched to year of operation. Patients were stratified according to the Webster WD risk scoring system and sensitivity and specificity analysis performed. Chi-square analysis was performed on risk factors that were not included in Webster WD Risk scoring model. Results:?? The overall WD rate is 2.8%. (103/3585 patients). Analysis of risk factors that were not considered by the Webster model within the WD group shows peritoneal sepsis (p = 0.04), prolonged ileus (p = 0.006) and current smoking status (p = 0.01) are significant factors associated with patients scoring highly for developing abdominal WD. Conclusions about the sensitivity and specificity of Webster WD risk scoring model can be drawn once control group data are collated. Conclusion:?? Webster WD risk scoring system appears to be a valid tool in identifying patients at high risk for WD. Peritoneal sepsis, prolonged ileus and smoking are associated with high risk of developing abdominal WD.
