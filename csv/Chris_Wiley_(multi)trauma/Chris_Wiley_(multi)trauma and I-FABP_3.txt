AB  - Aim: 1 Determine the sensitivity and specificity of Webster wound dehiscence (WD) risk scoring system when applied to a population beyond purely a veterans population as in Webster study. 2 Identify additional risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD that was not considered in the Webster study. Method:?? Bi-centre, retrospective case ? control analysis of preoperative and postoperative risk factors associated with abdominal laparotomy WD over seven years (Jan 2000?Dec 2006). 103 patients with abdominal WD were compared to a randomly selected control group of 103 patients with midline laparotomies who were matched to year of operation. Patients were stratified according to the Webster WD risk scoring system and sensitivity and specificity analysis performed. Chi-square analysis was performed on risk factors that were not included in Webster WD Risk scoring model. Results:?? The overall WD rate is 2.8%. (103/3585 patients). Analysis of risk factors that were not considered by the Webster model within the WD group shows peritoneal sepsis (p = 0.04), prolonged ileus (p = 0.006) and current smoking status (p = 0.01) are significant factors associated with patients scoring highly for developing abdominal WD. Conclusions about the sensitivity and specificity of Webster WD risk scoring model can be drawn once control group data are collated. Conclusion:?? Webster WD risk scoring system appears to be a valid tool in identifying patients at high risk for WD. Peritoneal sepsis, prolonged ileus and smoking are associated with high risk of developing abdominal WD.

AB  - Purpose:?? Patients with Gallstone Pancreatitis (GP) have a high risk of choledocholithiasis. MRCP has been recommended by some as the investigation of choice to diagnose choledocholithiasis. This study examines the diagnostic value of selective MRCP in GP. Methodology:?? Retrospective audit of all presentations of GP between Jan 2001?December 2007 at Middlemore Hospital. Demographic data, clinical presentation, biochemical, radiological findings and outcomes were reviewed. Data were analysed using univariate analysis and chi-squared test. Results:?? There were 339 cases of gallstone pancreatitis with 243 females and a mean age of 52?years. Overall, 95 cases of choledocholithiasis- as confirmed by ERCP/ Intra-Operative Cholangiogram (IOC) ? were diagnosed. The indications for MRCP in this study were heterogeneous. 117 patients underwent MRCP within a median of 4?days of admission with 15 (13.7%) showing choledocholithiasis. There was no significant difference in time to MRCP between positive and negative groups. ERCP/IOC confirmed 13/15 stones within a median of 2.5?days. MRCPs, however, missed 8 cases of choledocholithiasis subsequently demonstrated on ERCP/IOC where clinical suspicion remained after a negative MRCP. MRCP sensitivity was 62.0, specificity 97.9. The Positive Likelihood Ratio was 6.5, Negative Likelihood Ratio was 0.1. PPV was 86.7, NPV was 92.0. 222 patients followed different clinical pathways with 82 Common Bile Duct (CBD) stones diagnosed by ERCP/IOC. Conclusion:?? Choledocholithiasis is common in GP. Selective MRCP is highly specific in GP but may not be sensitive enough to exclude choledocholithiasis in this context.

AB  - Purpose:?? To determine the outcome of patients who had ultrasound detected, but no evidence of clinical correlation. Methodology:?? In a single surgeon practice, all the patients referred by General Practitioners between Aug 2007 to June 2008 with an ultrasound suggesting inguinal hernia, but with no clinical correlation were included. All of them were managed non-surgically. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess the outcome in 16 out the 19 patients eligible for the study. Median follow-up was eight months. Results:?? Pain in the inguinal region was the predominant symptom at presentation. Seven patients had become pain free within two weeks of the initial consultation. The remaining 9 patients had residual pain; 5 patients noticed improvement, 1 patient felt no change and 2 patients had other diagnosis made for their symptoms. No patient chose to see another specialist or had an operation for the management of the initial presentation. Conclusion:?? Fourteen out of sixteen (87.5%) patients who had an ultrasound demonstrating the presence of an inguinal hernia, with no clinical correlation, had improvement or resolution of their pain. This study demonstrates the importance of non surgical management in patients with groin pain and ultrasound detected inguinal hernia but with no clinical correlation.

AB  - Introduction:?? Although modern surgery is often complex, adherence to simple but critical safety steps have been shown to markedly improve patient outcomes. Aim:?? To review and compare surgical practice at a tertiary surgical centre to recommendations from the WHO Safe Surgery Saves Lives Committee. Methodology:?? Retrospective analysis of all prospectively recorded surgical adverse events over an 18?month period (1st Jan 2007?30th June 2008). These events were compared to the WHO recommendations. Results:?? The tertiary centre practiced all but 3 of the WHO recommendations and 166 surgical adverse events and 23 process failures/near misses were identified. Rate of adverse events was better than the average reported in industrialised nations. Leading adverse events were infection and bleeding/haematoma. Seventeen percent of adverse events identified could have been modified had a ?sign-out? process been followed. Conclusion:?? Implementation of WHO recommendations has the potential to reduce surgical adverse events.

AB  - Purpose:?? To investigate intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, in both rat intestinal ischaemia reperfusion injury, and in human necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Methodology:?? Plasma was collected from anaesthetized rats that underwent intestinal ischaemia reperfusion (IIR) injury and from control rats undergoing sham laparotomy. In a separate study, plasma and urine was collected from infants with NEC, and from control infants with non-abdominal diagnoses. iFABP was measured in urine and plasma using a commercially available ELISA. SMA was detected in plasma using a western blot technique. Results are median [IQR] and compared by Mann-Whitney test unless otherwise stated. Results:?? Animal model: Plasma iFABP was significantly higher in the IRI group compared with control group (IRI 32.4 [29.2] ng/ml vs. control 3.8 [3.3] ng/ml; p < 0.01). SMA became detectable in IRI plasma during reperfusion (p < 0.01 compared with pre-ischaemia, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test), but never in the control group. Human NEC Study:?? Urinary iFABP was significantly higher in the NEC group (2.1 [3.9] pg/nmol) compared to controls (1.1 [0.7] pg/nmol, p, < 0.05). Furthermore plasma and urinary iFABP correlated with extent of intestinal damage at laparotomy, and decreased with NEC resolution. SMA was detectable in the plasma of infants with multifocal or panintestinal NEC, but in neither focal nor non-operative disease. Conclusion:?? FABP and SMA are markers of mucosal and transmural intestinal damage, respectively, and may offer clinically relevant information in the diagnosis and management of severe intestinal disease.

AB  - Introduction:?? The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for patients presenting with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) suggest patients should undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal tract examination in addition to coeliac serology. Studies suggest that in approximately 20% of patients no diagnosis is made. In these patients subsequent management and risk of underlying malignancy remains unclear. In our unit all patients initially negative following investigation undergo an abdominal CT scan. Aim To determine 1) cancer detection and overall disease detection rates for patients referred with IDA on the cancer pathway 2) Subsequent outcomes of patients with no diagnosis made after initial investigations. Methods:?? Patients referred between Jan 2002 ? Jan 2005 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to 1) diagnosis following initial investigations 2) addition diagnosis following abdominal CT 3) Eventual outcome 3?years following presentations. Results:?? 111 patients were reviewed. Following initial investigation 12 colorectal and 2 gastric cancers were identified. 63% of patients had a diagnosis following initial investigations. Three patients were diagnosed with underlying malignancy following abdominal CT. 38 patients had no diagnosis, non reattended over a 3?year period with significant pathology. Conclusion:?? BSG guideline investigations with addition abdominal CT is sufficient to detect disease in patients with IDA.

AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy has become the procedure of choice for acute appendicitis at our hospital. It provides ideal training in a variety of laparoscopic techniques. It is both safe for patients and good for the community by improving the skills of surgical trainees. Methods:?? We reviewed the prospective audit of one junior registrar's first 150 consecutive cases of laparoscopic appendicectomy, after supervision for the first five cases. Results:?? 150 patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy over a period of 27?months. Ages ranged from 14 to 72 with a mean of 28. A standard 3 port technique was used, utilizing mostly suture loops, or occasionally linear staplers to tackle the appendix base. Of 124 patients with confirmed appendicitis, 44 (35%) had perforated, possibly reflecting delay in access to operating theatre in a busy public hospital. Despite this, only two post operative abscesses occurred, and both resolved after percutaneous drains. Hospital stay ranged from 2?7?days (Mean 2, Median 3.5?days). Senior surgical assistance was required in only two patients, once for laparoscopic repair of a serosal tear, and once for conversion for an inflammatory mass subsequently shown to be a carcinoma. Analysis of the cohort in three groups of fifty: early, mid, and late in the series demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both operative time and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion:?? Laparoscopic appendicectomy is the ideal training operation. After some initial supervision the trainees can perform surgery unsupervised and gain experience in a wide variety of surgical techniques. Clinical acumen and operative times improve with experience.

AB  - Purpose:?? Mechanical Bowel Preparation (MBP) is often used by surgeons for patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colectomy (LC) due to the concern that small lesions normally palpable at open surgery may not be seen at the time of laparoscopic surgery. This study sought to determine whether preoperative marking of the colonic primary at the time of colonoscopy with Spot? could overcome this concern. Methodology:?? All patients suitable for a LC had Spot? marking performed at their colonoscopy. One millilitre of Spot? marking was injected submucosally in 3 positions around the circumference of the lumen at least 5?cm distal to the lesion. The first 100 LC performed by the surgeon for lesions were audited for the purpose of this study, and MBP was not used while all patients received preoperative immunonutrition. Results:?? Overall mortality was 0%. The anastomotic leak rate was 2% (1 reoperation, 1 low output fistula). Conversion rate was 23%. Spot? marking was successfully identified at laparoscopy in all 100 cases. No cases were converted as a result of failure to identify the marking, however 1 case required an extension in the final incision due to the fact the Spot? marking had been placed proximal to the lesion. Anastomoses were performed ?across? the Spot? marking on 3 occasions with no untoward effect. Conclusion:?? Spot? marking is a safe and effective way to mark lesions in the colon in order to facilitate LC without the need for MBP.

AB  - There is increasing use of CT in intestinal obstruction to delineate those patients requiring expeditious surgical intervention from those in whom conservative management is appropriate. We sought to assess the accuracy of CT in predicting those patients for whom conservative management would suffice. A mixed prospective-retrospective series had 75 patients with a clinical diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a CT performed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were excluded if there was an immediate indication for surgery eg peritoneal irritation or shock. A positive diagnosis was defined as suitability for conservative management based on CT absence of an obstructing lesion and/or progression of contrast. A negative diagnosis was defined as a high-grade obstruction, signs of strangulation or a lesion requiring operation eg volvulus or tumour. Sixty-two cases (82.7%) had a history of abdominal surgery. Forty-one (54.7%) underwent operative intervention during their index admission. Diagnostic accuracy measures for CT in predicting successful conservative management were: sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 77.5%, positive predictive value 78% and negative predictive value 91.2%. In those with prior abdominal surgery, these results were 96.7%, 71.9%, 76.3% and 95.8% respectively. CT is highly effective in detecting bowel obstruction cases that do not require operation and also in predicting those cases that actually do. These measures are slightly improved when selecting patients with previous abdominal surgery. CT scanning may therefore be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm for acute bowel obstruction. Future studies may benefit from more standardised assessment criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.
