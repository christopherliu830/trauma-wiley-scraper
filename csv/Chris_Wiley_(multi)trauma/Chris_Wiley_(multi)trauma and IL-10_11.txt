AB  - Summary In mice, monocytes that exhibit a pro-inflammatory profile enter muscle tissue after muscle injury and are crucial for clearance of necrotic tissue and stimulation of muscle progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. The aim of this study was to test if pro-inflammatory capacity of classically activated (M1) monocytes relates to muscle mass and strength in humans. This study included 191 male and 195 female subjects (mean age 64.2 years (SD 6.4) and 61.9 ± 6.4, respectively) of the Leiden Longevity Study. Pro-inflammatory capacity of M1 monocytes was assessed by ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR-2/1 agonist tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteine (Pam3Cys-SK4), both M1 phenotype activators. Cytokines that stimulate M1 monocyte response (IFN-? and GM-CSF) as well as cytokines that are secreted by M1 monocytes (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-1?) were measured. Analyses were adjusted for age, height, and body fat mass. Upon stimulation with LPS, the cytokine production capacity of INF-?, GM-CSF, and TNF-α was significantly positively associated with lean body mass, appendicular lean mass and handgrip strength in men, but not in women. Upon stimulation with Pam3Cys-SK4, IL-6; TNF-α; and Il-1? were significantly positively associated with lean body mass and appendicular lean in women, but not in men. Taken together, this study shows that higher pro-inflammatory capacity of M1 monocytes upon stimulation is associated with muscle characteristics and sex dependent.

AB  - SUMMARY Allogeneic blood transfusions expose a patient to many soluble and cell-bound antigens, expressed on viable and decaying cells. In particular, contaminant leukocytes are presumed to play an important role interacting with the recipient's immune system. This immune response to transfusions is influenced by the condition of the patient, and a patient in steady state will respond differently to a patient in hemorrhagic shock, under anesthesia or after surgical tissue injury. Blood transfusions affect both the innate immediate defense immune system and the adaptive immune response, the latter often resulting in antibodies and (less well characterized) cellular immunity. Removal of allogeneic leukocytes by filtration of red cells and platelet products significantly reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and the formation of leukocyte antibodies, causing refractoriness to platelet transfusions. However, an effect of leukocyte-containing transfusions on cellular immune functions relevant to transplant tolerance, cancer surveillance, viral replication or susceptibility to nosocomial infections is less obvious. Randomized studies showed a significant effect of removal of allogeneic leukocytes in blood transfused to cardiac surgery patients, reducing postoperative mortality. As for the other reported clinical effects of (passenger) leukocytes in blood transfusions, there is not yet sufficient evidence.

AB  - Abstract Objective Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to bacterial infections, which are associated with organ failure and a high mortality rate. Reliable biomarkers are needed to identify patients who require intensified treatment. Our objective was to study the regulation and prognostic relevance of elevated concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Design, setting and participants We examined the associations between serum and ascitic fluid (AF) suPAR and liver function, bacterial infection, and short-term mortality in 162 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis undergoing diagnostic paracentesis in a tertiary health care centre in Germany. Main outcome measure Twenty-eight-day mortality. Results Circulating suPAR levels were increased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and correlated with the severity of liver dysfunction and systemic inflammation but were not indicative of bacterial infection. Circulating suPAR levels >14.4 ng mL?1 predicted 28-day mortality, even after adjustment for liver function and confounders [HR = 3.05 (1.35?6.90); P = 0.0076] equal to the MELD score (AUC = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.61?0.81; P < 0.001). Cut-off levels derived from cohorts without liver disease were not applicable due to the low specificity. AF suPAR levels were elevated during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but not during episodes in which bacteria or bacterial DNA was translocated into the ascites. AF suPAR levels correlated poorly with systemic suPAR but were associated with a more severe course of SBP and a worse outcome. In vitro experiments revealed that monocytes, and to a lesser extent neutrophils, secrete suPAR after Toll-like-receptor ligation, which led to rapid urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cleavage followed by increased synthesis. Conclusion Blood and ascitic suPAR levels provide distinct, but relevant prognostic information on the severity of complications in patients with end-stage liver disease.

AB  - The pharmacological activities of tetrahydropyridine (THP) derivatives are dependent on the substituent ring moiety. In this study, we investigate the anti-inflammatory activities of 12 newly synthesized substituted N-[3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)methyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydrobenzamide/benzene sulfonamides (9a?l) in murine BV-2 microglial cells. All compounds were initially screened for attenuation of nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1?µg/mL)-activated microglial cells. The data show that only SO2-substituted THPs were effective at sub-lethal concentrations (IC50 values of 12.92?µM (9i), 14.64?µM (9j), 19.63?µM (9k)) relative to L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine positive control (IC50?=?3.1?µM). The most potent SO2-substituted compound (9i) also blocked the LPS-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and attenuated the release of several cytokines including IL-1α, IL-10, and IL-6. These findings establish the moderate immuno-modulating effects of SO2-substituted THP derivatives.

AB  - Summary Critically ill patients display a state of immunosuppression that has been attributed in part to decreased plasma arginine concentrations. However, we and other authors have failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of L-arginine supplementation. We hypothesize that, in these critically ill patients, these low plasma arginine levels may be secondary to the presence of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSC), which express arginase known to convert arginine into nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. Indeed, in a series of 28 non-surgical critically ill patients, we showed a dramatic increase in gMDSC compared to healthy subjects (P?=?0·0002). A significant inverse correlation was observed between arginine levels and gMDSC (P?=?0·01). As expected, gMDSC expressed arginase preferentially in these patients. Patients with high gMDSC levels on admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) presented an increased risk of death at day 7 after admission (P?=?0·02). In contrast, neither plasma arginine levels, monocytic MDSC levels nor neutrophil levels were associated with overall survival at day 7. No relationship was found between body mass index (BMI) or simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score or gMDSC levels, eliminating a possible bias concerning the direct prognostic role of these cells. As gMDSC exert their immunosuppressive activity via multiple mechanisms [production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-10, arginase, etc.], it may be more relevant to target these cells, rather than simply supplementing with L-arginine to improve immunosuppression and its clinical consequences observed in critically ill patients.

AB  - Autoinflammatory diseases are hyperinflammatory, immune dysregulatory conditions that typically present in early childhood with fever and rashes and disease-specific patterns of organ inflammation. This review provides a historic background of autoinflammatory disease research, an overview of the currently genetically defined autoinflammatory diseases, and insights into treatment strategies derived from understanding of the disease pathogenesis. The integrative assessment of autoinflammatory conditions led to the identification of innate pro-inflammatory cytokine ?amplification loops? as the cause of the systemic and organ-specific disease manifestations, which initially centered around increased IL-1 production and signaling. More recently, additional innate pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification loops resulting in increased Type I IFN, IL-17, IL-18, or IL-36 signaling or production have led to the successful use of targeted therapies in some of these conditions. Clinical findings such as fever patterns, type of skin lesions, genetic mutation testing, and the prevalent cytokine abnormalities can be used to group autoinflammatory diseases.

AB  - Abstract Resolution of inflammation is a coordinated and active process aimed at restoration of tissue integrity and function. This review integrates the key molecular and cellular mechanisms of resolution. We describe how abrogation of chemokine signalling blocks continued neutrophil tissue infiltration and how apoptotic neutrophils attract monocytes and macrophages to induce their clearance. Uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages reprograms macrophages towards a resolving phenotype, a key event to restore tissue homeostasis. Finally, we highlight the therapeutic potential that derives from understanding the mechanisms of resolution.

AB  - Mammals harbor a complex gut-associated microbiota, comprising bacteria that provide immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits to the host, and contribute to their well-being. However, dysregulation of the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, along with the associated mucosal immune response have a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, among others. In addition, outside the gut lumen, bacteria from microbiota are the causative agent of peritoneal inflammation, abdominal sepsis and systemic sepsis. Critical care interventions during sepsis by antibiotics induce dysbiosis and present acute and long-term poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss immunomodulatory effects of the microbial molecules and products, highlighting the role of Bacteroides fragilis, a human commensal with ambiguous interactions with the host. Moreover, we also address the impact of antibiotic treatment in sepsis outcome and discuss new insights for microbiota modulation.

AB  - Abstract The mechanism by which trauma initiates healing remains unclear. Precise understanding of these events may define interventions for accelerating healing that could be translated to the clinical arena. We previously reported that addition of low-dose recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) at the fracture site augmented fracture repair in a murine tibial fracture model. Here, we show that local rhTNF treatment is only effective when administered within 24 h of injury, when neutrophils are the major inflammatory cell infiltrate. Systemic administration of anti-TNF impaired fracture healing. Addition of rhTNF enhanced neutrophil recruitment and promoted recruitment of monocytes through CCL2 production. Conversely, depletion of neutrophils or inhibition of the chemokine receptor CCR2 resulted in significantly impaired fracture healing. Fragility, or osteoporotic, fractures represent a major medical problem as they are associated with permanent disability and premature death. Using a murine model of fragility fractures, we found that local rhTNF treatment improved fracture healing during the early phase of repair. If translated clinically, this promotion of fracture healing would reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed patient mobilization.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.
