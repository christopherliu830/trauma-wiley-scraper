AB  - Central venous catheters (CVC) remain a frequently used form of vascular access in children receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD). Whereas standard dual-lumen catheters (DL) are used in many centers, the Tesio catheter has proven to be superior to the DL catheter in terms of catheter survival and infection rates in at least one pediatric study (Sheth RD et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2001). Recently, the Ash Split catheter became available which, while similar to the Tesio internally, being comprised of 2 separate catheters, may be preferable because of the requirement for only one skin puncture for placement vs. two for the Tesio. However, no pediatric data pertaining to the Ash Split catheter have been published to date. Therefore, we reviewed and compared our experience with a small number of Ash Split (# 16) and Tesio (# 8) catheters used for semipermanent vascular access in our chronic HD population with reference to survival, infectious complications, patency, and dialysis adequacy. The results of this experience are as follows: Tesio Ash Split Survival >3 months 6/8 12/15 Sepsis (epi/catheter mo) 1/30 1/25 Exit-site infection (epi/catheter mo) 1/8.6 1/19 sp Kt/V urea 1.67 1.88 % sp Kt/V urea >1.2 100 90 Reasons for the removal of Tesio catheters were transplant (4), sepsis (1), deterioration of tubing (1), and accidental (1). Ash Split catheter removal resulted from sepsis (2), fistula placement (4), thrombosis (1), and accidental (2). This preliminary experience reveals similar outcome data for the Tesio and Ash Split catheters when used in pediatric HD patients. Definitive statements regarding the superiority of either catheter awaits additional data collection and analysis.

AB  - Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. started its nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) program in September 1997. Purpose of study:? To evaluate episodes of exit site infections, catheter sepsis, safety, and longevity of accesses for patients doing NHHD. Methods:? If IJ catheter was chosen, patient was started on Coumadin 2?mg/day when catheter was placed. If catheter malfunctioned, it was locked with a thrombolytic agent and Coumadin was adjusted to meet a goal INR of 1.5?2.25. If the problem persisted, the catheter was exchanged. For catheters, the B-D InterLink device was used to prevent air emboli and infection, and a locking device was used to prevent disconnects. If AV fistula was used, 4 buttonholes were established using 16 gauge needles. If AV graft was used, patients were taught the ladder cannulation technique using 16 gauge needles. Results:? As of September 1, 2003, 45 patients have completed training and have performed 27,063 treatments at home. Total catheter time at home was 930 months. Total AV fistula and AV graft time at home was 190 and 20 months, respectively. Upon completion of training, 34 patients were using tunneled IJ catheters, 10 using AV fistulas, and 1 using an AV graft. The IJ catheter exit site and sepsis infection rate was 0.35 and 0.49 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Average catheter life was 8.5 months with the longest 66.7 months and the shortest 0.2 months. The AV fistula and graft exit site and sepsis infection rates were 0.16 and 0 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Catheter complications included 1 episode of disconnect due to patient's failure to use locking device, 1 episode of central stenosis, and 1 episode of intracranial hemorrhage, due to prolonged INR, with resolution of symptoms. Conclusion:? Data support that tunneled IJ catheters, AV fistulas, and AV grafts were effective and safe permanent accesses for patients on NHHD.

AB  - Poorly functioning dialysis access, whether graft or AV fistula, is a contributor to decreased efficiency of dialysis. Thrombosis results in the need for surgery and increases patient suffering. Objectives:? To determine whether an advanced glycation end product (AGE), pentosidine, might serve as a marker of disease activity and thrombosis of dialysis access. These results were obtained during the blinded phase of a study to evaluate the efficacy of the antioxidant vitamin E in preventing vascular access thrombotic events. Methods:? Twenty-six patients had blood drawn and access flow evaluated initially and at intervals for up to 1.5 years. In the study design, participants received either 800?IU vitamin E daily by mouth or identical placebo capsules. Blood plasma was examined to determine pentosidine content at baseline and every 3?m. Patients with an access flow of <800?mL/min were referred to a surgeon for evaluation. Access flow was evaluated by using the transonic flow meter and the saline release method. When sequential double dialyzers were used, saline injection method was applied post dialyzers, but before the venous drip chamber. Results:? Mean initial level of pentosidine before the administration of vitamin E was 20.22?pmol/mg (range 5.04?59.62?pmol/mg). During the study period, 5 patients had procedures related to thrombosis performed on their accesses. Blood drawn before the thrombotic event showed an increase above baseline of 6.87?±?15.47 (range ?5.9 to +33.7?pmol/mg). Patients without events showed a mean decrease of 9.7?± 12.24?pmol/mg pentosidine (p?<?0.02). Conclusion:? An increase in levels of pentosidine was associated with clotting of hemodialysis access. This change may reflect the effects of oxidative stress and/or thrombus formation. As these data are gathered from an ongoing double-blinded study, the effect of vitamin E on thrombus formation and pentosidine levels has not yet been ascertained.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - It has been shown that daily hemodialysis as well as convective transfer by hemofilitration improve the quality of extra renal treatment. Two following phases of treatment of three weeks each were tested in 2 patients: daily hemodialysis 2.5?h 6 times/week (HD*6) and daily hemofiltration 2.75?h 6 times/week (HF*6) performed according to the following modalities. Phase I, blood flow rates (QB): 300?mL/min, hemofilter 1.4 m2AN 69 dialysate flow 500?mL/min. Phase II, QB: 150?mL/min, hemofilter 1m2AN 69, exchange volume of 10?L/session; 5?L predilution and 5?L postdilution (conditions were limited by the device). We measured, during the third week of treatment of each phase, the weekly mass transfers and the predialysis plasma levels of urea (U), creatinine (C), phosphate (P), and B2 microglobulin (B2M). In the 2 phases, HD*6 and HF*6, respectively, the weekly urea Kt was: 120 vs. 60?L; std Kt/V: 3.30 vs. 2.0; npcr: 1.26 vs. 1.42?g?kg?1?day?1. Mass transfer/week Predialytic levels/L HD*6 HF*6 HD*6 HF*6 U (mmol) ?2366 ?2204 ?23.2 ?38.5 C (µmol) 67240 51096 769.5 934.8 P (mmol) ??127 ??111.5 ??1.91 ??2.34 B2M (mg) ??311 ??763.5 ?34.2 ?30.16 In HF*6, predialysis solute concentration increased and weekly small molecule mass transfer was insufficient. B2M mass transfer was significantly increased and predialytic plasma concentration decreased, showing a higher clearance of middle molecules with convective transfer. The clinical tolerance was excellent during the two phases of treatment. This study allows to determine the optimal conditions for adequate daily HF: higher QB and exchange volume. Further studies with QB of at least 300?mL/min and with exchange volume of 15?L/session seem to be necessary.

AB  - Background and Purpose:? Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in plasma rises by ultrafiltration during hemodialysis, and it consequently causes plasma refilling in which water moves from interstitial tissue to capillary space. Although hemodynamic stability is one of the important factors for good dialysis outcome, no informative and convenient indicators are available other than monitoring of blood pressure. Thus, we measured COP during hemodialysis whether COP can be used as an indicator for the hemodynamic status in comparison with hematocrit (Ht). Plasma osmolality, ultrafiltration volume, and the alteration of blood pressure were also measured to examine whether COP is associated with them. Method:? Sixteen patients hospitalized in this hospital were examined. Amongst them, 10 patients underwent both dialysis and ultrafiltration, while 4 patients received only dialysis and 2 patients were with ultrafiltration only by extracorporeal ultrafiltration method. Ultrafiltration was performed with constant speed to the dry weight for 4?h. The measurements of COP, plasma osmolality, Ht levels, and blood pressure were performed at 30?min (12.5% of the total water removal), 1?h (25%), 2?h (50%), and 3?h (75%) after the start of hemodialysis and also at the end of dialysis (100%). Result:? COP markedly rose by 26.0% (±13.3%) in the patients who received both dialysis and ultrafiltration, whereas Ht rose by only 13.6% (±5.21%). And the curve for COP increase was sigmoid shape, whereas that for Ht showed linear change. On the other hand, in the patients whose Ht levels showed low values, the curves for both COP and Ht showed similar pattern. Conclusion:? These results suggest that COP is a more sensitive indicator to be monitored for the hemodynamic status than Ht during hemodialysis.

AB  - A high mortality rate after hip arthroplasty has been reported in hemodialysis patients; however, there has been no previous study on predictors of mortality after hip arthroplasty so far. Objectives:? The purpose of the present study was to identify any risk factors associated with early death in hemodialysis patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. Methods:? We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients on hemodialysis who underwent hip arthroplasty between 1994 and 2001. The average age was 60 years, and the average hemodialysis duration was 116 months at the time of operation. Body mass index (BMI), operating time, and total blood loss were reviewed. Serum levels of albumin (Alb), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured preoperatively. Results:? Of these 34 patients, 9 died (26%). There were 2 perioperative deaths and 7 during follow-up period between 2 and 19 months. No significant difference was found with respect to patient age, hemodialysis duration, Alb, Ca, P, Alp, operating time, and total blood loss. Patients with lower BMI and PTH levels had an earlier mortality than patients with higher BMI and PTH levels (p?<?0.05 and p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? We conclude that despite an intensive care directed to our hemodialysis patients, the incidence of early death after hip arthroplasty is still high. If low BMI and serum levels of low PTH were detected before operation, we should pay special attention to early mortality after hip arthroplasty.

AB  - Background:? A recent meta-analysis suggested that the relative risk of mortality is 8% higher in private for-profit hemodialysis (HD) centers than private not-for-profit HD centers (Devereaux et al. JAMA 2002; 288: 2449). Objective:? To assess the association between dialysis center profit status and mortality using USRDS data in the current era under DOQI guidelines. Methods:? We studied incident HD patients from 1995 to 2000 who had Medicare as primary payer during the 4th through 6th month after ESRD initiation. Patients who died or underwent transplant during the 6 months after initiation were excluded. Primary dialysis provider was determined from the majority provider during the 6 months after initiation. Patient mortality for the following 12 months was evaluated via Cox regression, which adjusted for age, gender, primary cause of ESRD, race, cumulative hospital days, and comorbidity measures, which were assessed through both Medicare claims during the entry period and the Medicare Evidence form 2728. Patients were followed up until transplantation, death, or completion of the 12 months. Results:? 189,932 patients receiving HD during 1995?2000 were included in our analysis. The adjusted mortality rate was 271.6 per 1000 person-years at the private for-profit centers and 272.2 at the private not-for-profit centers. The mortality risk relative to private for-profit vs. not-for-profit centers was 1.009 (95% CI, 0.978?1.042; p?=?0.558). Sub-analyses that excluded hospital-based facilities showed similar results. Although public not- for-profit facilities were excluded from the analysis, a sub-analysis performed with these also showed similar results. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that dialysis center profit status was not associated with mortality. This lack of association was found in the combined 1995?2000 population and in separate models for each year. Freestanding vs. hospital-based and public vs. non-public facility had no impact on the results.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD) is a rare entity affecting patients with renal failure, often on chronic dialysis or after transplantation (TXP). The patient profile at risk for this debilitating condition is yet undefined as is the role of renal failure in its etiology. We diagnosed 4 chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients with NFD. A 55-year-old Caucasian male on HD for 5 years, secondary to diabetic nephropathy, developed woody, indurated skin of the extremities, decreased mobility, and wheelchair dependence. He died within 1 year. A 66-year-old African-American male with diabetes, hypertension, and pancreatic cancer developed thick indurated skin on his extremities after being on HD for approximately 20 months. He died 3 months later from sepsis. A 26-year-old Caucasian female on HD for approximately 10 years, secondary to hyperoxaluria-induced renal failure, had undergone combined liver and kidney TXP with primary nonfunction of the renal TXP. She succumbed to cholangitis approximately 1 year after progressive skin thickening and joint contractures were noted. A 75-year-old Caucasian female with renal failure secondary to recurrent hemolytic uremic syndrome and TXP failure was dialysis dependent for 6 years. Over a 3-month period, she developed skin changes consistent with NFD and entered hospice care secondary to marked deterioration in her quality of life. In all of these cases, skin changes were restricted to the extremities, sparing the trunk, face, and internal organs. Skin biopsy findings included thickened dermis with particularly thickened collagen bundles, mucin deposition, and fibroblast proliferation and were distinct from scleromyxedema and scleroderma. Autoimmune disease workup was negative. Indeed, NFD is a novel cutaneous fibrosing disorder of progressively debilitating nature in patients with renal failure that needs further clinical and pathological characterization.

AB  - Purpose:? In April 2001, the Northern Alberta Renal Program (NARP) in Edmonton, Alberta received a government grant to start a Home Nocturnal Hemodialysis program for 17 patients. At that time NARP did not have a home program, so the challenge was to develop and operationalize the program and to stay within the requirements related to the grant. Methods:? We describe our experience with specific reference to funding, infrastructure, human resources, monitoring, and the target population. Results:? Funding from the grant allowed space for one dialysis teaching station and clinic area. A multidisciplinary team of a nurse, technician, social worker, and dietitian were recruited. New procedures were written, and new manuals were prepared for teaching. Several new machines were evaluated. The Bellco Formula machine from Genpharm was chosen. This machine had very limited use in North America and had never been used in a home program or a nocturnal program with monitoring. Initiating the monitoring proved to be one of our main challenges. We initiated monitoring with Capital Health Link, the telephone health information line for our region, to provide the observers for the monitoring. Initially the program was intended to serve people who lived in remote areas not serviced by a satellite hemodialysis unit, but in a population of 600 dialysis patients we were having difficulty recruiting. We widened the criteria and expanded our marketing strategy. Based on a survey of other programs and a patient satisfaction survey, we discontinued the monitoring after one year as it did not prove clinically beneficial and patients viewed it as restrictive. Conclusion:? Through perseverance and teamwork we were able to establish this innovative program ?from scratch.? We received an award for innovation from our health authority in 2003. The program now has 15 patients at home enjoying the benefits of home nocturnal hemodialysis, and we are expecting to expand the program. The evaluation to date is encouraging with respect to this therapy being clinically more effective than conventional dialysis and an improved quality of life for the patients.

AB  - In early 2003, cases of SARS had surfaced around the world. The vast majority happened in China, Hong Kong, and Canada. In Toronto, the individual who manifested symptoms of SARS after visiting China died on March 22, 2003. A few days later SARS was declared a provincial emergency. Corona virus, the causative agent, is not well known. Its transmission and mutation had to be researched. Shortly thereafter, clusters of people were showing symptoms of the virus. There were 258 probable cases of SARS by May 14. The Ontario Ministry of Health and health care providers took steps to contain the virus, isolating those who were exposed and adopting new infection control procedures. On May 17, the provincial emergency was lifted. On May 25, there was a new wave of SARS cases (2nd outbreak). This was traced back to an RN who worked in a non-SARS unit. Nurses working directly with SARS were faced with very challenging times. SARS was a huge concern and impacted all health care professionals. The hemodialysis unit was no exception. After all, dialysis patients are already immunocompromised, mostly elderly, and frequent visits to the hospital make them more susceptible to the virus. Objective:? To identify how hemodialysis nurses were impacted by the SARS outbreak and the nursing management to control the disease. Method:? Saint Michael's Hospital in Toronto took a leadership role and became one of the SARS Tertiary Response Team. Four hemodialysis nurses were designated as trainers to train the other staff regarding infection prevention and control. Measures were in place such as: (a) strict screening methods for patients, staff, and visitors; (b) mask fitting for all staff; (c) use of PPE (protective protection equipment) (d) use of Hospital ID bar code for staff to declare themselves free of SARS. Results/Conclusion:? On August 25, there was only one probable case and there was no evidence of transmission of the virus in the hemodialysis unit. As for the nurses and all the unsung heroes who always put the needs and safety of their patients ahead of themselves, they continue to be dedicated in maintaining quality patient care even in the face of crisis or in an environment of fear.

AB  - Heparin-free anticoagulation in hemodialysis (HD) is advocated for patients with clotting abnormalities and risk of bleeding. Objective:? First publication on regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in children. RCA is free from systemic effects, guarantees excellent dialyzer life, but requires careful monitoring. Methods:? We report on 3 patients treated by intermittent RCA HD (4?h each, high-flux dialyzer F40, Fresenius): (1) 17-year-old boy (renal transplant failure, access via cubital Cimino fistula) after hypertensive intra-cerebral hemorrhage (2 sessions); (2) 13-year-old girl (hemolytic uremic syndrome, access via jugular vein Shaldon catheter) after abdominal surgery and bleeding (8 sessions); and (3) 7-year-old boy (hyperoxaluria, access via PermCath? jugular vein catheter) after renal transplant biopsy (3 sessions). Sodium citrate 30% was infused into the extra corporeal circuit (blood flow 150?mL/min) before dialyzer (initial flow 30?mL/min) and calcium gluconate 10% for antidote into venous line near of catheter or fistula (initial flow 40?mL/min). Post-dialyzer extracorporeal serum Ca++ (aim?<?0.3?mmol/L) and pre-dialyzer intra-corporeal Ca++ (aim?>?0.9) were measured for every 30?min. Serum Na+, K+, base excess (BE), blood flow, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood out-flow and in-flow pressure were also monitored. Results:? For adequate RCA (mean extracorporeal serum Ca++ 0.24?±?0.04?mmol/L), a mean citrate flow of 36.1?±?5.9?mL/h and a mean calcium substitution rate of 40.8?±?3.4?mL/h were needed. Intra-corporeal Ca++ was kept at 1.10?±?0.07?mmol/L. Extracorporeal activated clotting time (ACT) was 194?±?41 and intra-corporeal ACT 90?±?12?sec. Serum Na+, K+, and BE during HD were 138?±?2, 3.5?±?0.3, and ?0.6?±?1.1?mmol/L, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressures of patients 1?3 were 117?±?5, 103?±?5, and 102?±?6?mmHg. All patients were stable and without any bleeding during HD. The only adverse event was 1 episode of hypocalcemia (Ca++?<?0.6?mmol/L) cured by stopping dialysis. Conclusions:? Local anticoagulation with sodium citrate during intermittent HD can be applied safely in children and adolescents.

AB  - Atherosclerotic lesion of coronary artery frequently accompanies intimal hyperplasia of radial artery. We have reported that the lesion of radial artery (intimal hyperplasia) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is associated with early access failure (EAF) as well as ischemic heart disease (IHD) (Am J Kidney Dis. 2003; 41: 422?428). Objective:? This study was designed to determine the impact of IHD on the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 125 nondiabetic HD patients who received radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula operation for the first time. We evaluated IHD before the operation through clinical symptoms and electrocardiography and then investigated EAF within 1 year after the operation. We analyzed the access patency rates between the patients with and without IHD, using Kaplan?Meier method and log-rank test. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors of the EAF. Results:? The mean age of the patients was 48?±?14 years, and the number of females was 54 (43.2%). Of the total 125 patients, 19 patients (15.4%) had IHD before the operation. The EAF developed in 23 patients (18.4%) within 1 years after the operation. The access patency rate in the patients with IHD was lower than that in the patients without IHD (39.7 vs. 88.3%, p?<?0.001). IHD and old age were independent risk factors of the EAF in nondiabetic HD patients. But sex, smoking history, hypertension, and the levels of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, albumin, and total cholesterol checked before the operation were not associated with the EAF. Conclusion:? This study suggests that IHD is closely associated with EAF in nondiabetic HD patients.

AB  - The Dialysis Outcome and Quality Initiative has guidelines for vascular access and states that the dialysis catheter (DC) should be limited to less than 20% of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Our center has found this target difficult to achieve. Objective:? We wondered what the reasons for use of a DC might be. Methods:? We noted the number of patients with a DC in place and assessed the reasons why the DC was being used on 8/1/03. Results:? 73 of the 170 (42.9%) patients had a DC on 8/1/03. 24 (32.9%) of the patients refused to have initial arteriovenous fistulae or grafts (AVF/G) or a secondary AVF/G revision or replacement procedure performed after initial AVF/G failure. 15 (20.5%) patients had a maturing AVF/G, 12 (16.4%) had significant medical and/or surgical contraindications for AVF/G placement, 9 (12.3%) patients were awaiting surgical thrombectomy, revision or placement of AVF/G, 6 patients (8.2%) were awaiting transfer to CPD therapy, 4 (5.5%) patients were undecided about having an AVF/G placed, and 1 (1.4%) had acute renal failure and early ESRD recovery was expected. Only 2 (2.7%) patients had no access plan by the nephrology team. Conclusions:? Patients' refusal for an AVF/G placement and patients with a maturing AVF/G or awaiting surgical revision or placement were the most common reasons for the use of a DC in our center. To significantly impact on the high use of the DC, it would be crucial to better understand the reasons for patients? refusals.

AB  - Substantial morbidity occurs within the hemodialysis population due to complications of vascular access, most frequently manifests as thrombotic events. An access management goal was the reduction of thrombotic events and associated morbidity. Intra-dialytic vascular access blood flow (ABF) measurements using Crit-Line Delta H ABF have been previously shown to provide objective and accurate access flow data and were our primary method of evaluating access function. A designated ?access manager? was assigned responsibility to track all issues related to vascular access. Each patient's ABF was measured monthly and the flow ?trend? was graphed using Crit-Line Access Manager software. Additional data, including auscultation, cannulation difficulties, failing URR, and increased venous pressures were also recorded. These data and ABF trends were used to establish an angiography ?hot list?. Following angioplasty, ABF was again measured to confirm a successful intervention. The ?hot list? led to 43 angiography referrals of which 83.7% (36/43) required subsequent intervention resulting in significant reductions of thrombosis events in PTFE grafts and native fistulae. The annual incidence of thrombotic events decreased from 1.6 to 0.4 events/patient year in grafts and 0.5?0.0 events in fistulae. Additionally, the percentage of URR's?>?70 increased from 82.3 to 90.1% over the same time period. Use of the Crit-Line Delta H ABF device in conjunction with a vascular access management program can significantly reduce the number of thrombotic events per patient year.

AB  - Dialysis adequacy indexed by Kt/V in hemodialysis (HD) patients is recommended as a single-pool Kt/V of at least 1.2 per session thrice weekly. But many patients cannot achieve this adequacy target. Although dialysis time is the most important as a factor influencing Kt/V, it is difficult to prolong dialysis time in practice because of its economic impact and poor patient compliance. Objective:? The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of increasing blood flow rate on dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V. Methods:? This study enrolled 36 HD patients with single-pool Kt/V <1.2 per session thrice weekly, which was measured in dialyzer blood flow rate of 230?mL/min. We increased 15% of blood flow rate in patients <65?kg of body weight and 20% in patients >65?kg. And then we compared Kt/V and urea reduction ratio (URR) between before and after increasing blood flow rate. Results:? The mean age was 48?±?11 years (23?73 years), and the number of males was 25. Of the total patients, 24 patients had dry weight <65?kg. Mean dialysis duration was 52?±?50 months (3?216 months). Mean Kt/V before increasing blood flow rate was 1.02?±?0.09. It increased to 1.14?±?0.12 after increasing blood flow rate (p?<?0.001). Of the total 36 patients, 13 patients (36.1%) achieved adequacy target (Kt/V?≤?1.2). Mean URR before increasing blood flow rate was 56.9?±?4.0%. It also increased to 60.8?±?4.1% (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that increasing blood flow rate by 15?20% of previous flow rate is effective in achieving dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V.

AB  - In March 2003, a series of cases of sudden respiratory disease syndrome (SARS) has been reported to be spreading in Toronto. With limited knowledge of the causative agent, an immediate strategy that would help contain and prevent the dissemination of the disease especially among our immunosuppressed hemodialysis patients was required. Objective:? To share the precautionary measures implemented in our unit in containing or preventing the spread of the virus among our hemodialysis patients. Methods:? Retrospective analysis of the impact of the implementation of strict measure of disease control and education of all staff. Other data were gathered through interviews of some Microbiologists in Toronto, St. Michael's Hospital Infection Control Department and Health, Canada. Result:? The precautionary measure implemented has been successful. None of our dialysis patients or health care workers were affected. Conclusion:? The measures implemented has not been proven 100% effective in protecting our dialysis patients and our staff, but we hope that the data will help prepare other health care professionals and other dialysis institutions in the event of another outbreak.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.
