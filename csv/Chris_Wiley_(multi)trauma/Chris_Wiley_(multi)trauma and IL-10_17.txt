AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxfylline are associated with a number of clinical benefits. These include reduction in mortality in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants or suffer peritonitis. In infants with sepsis, a reduction in mortality has also been associated with pentoxyfylline administration. The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxyfylline, as well as its bronchodilator, diuretic and respiratory muscle stimulant effects suggest it may have a useful role in BPD. Interim analysis of a prophylactic trial suggests pentoxyfylline may reduce treatment requirements after the neonatal period and that, in established BPD, pentoxyfylline and dexamethasone may be of similar efficacy.

AB  - Abstract Fever is a cardinal symptom of infectious or inflammatory insults, but it can also arise from noninfectious causes. The fever-inducing agent that has been used most frequently in experimental studies designed to characterize the physiological, immunological and neuroendocrine processes and to identify the neuronal circuits that underlie the manifestation of the febrile response is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our knowledge of the mechanisms of fever production and lysis is largely based on this model. Fever is usually initiated in the periphery of the challenged host by the immediate activation of the innate immune system by LPS, specifically of the complement (C) cascade and Toll-like receptors. The first results in the immediate generation of the C component C5a and the subsequent rapid production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The second, occurring after some delay, induces the further production of PGE2 by induction of its synthesizing enzymes and transcription and translation of proinflammatory cytokines. The Kupffer cells (Kc) of the liver seem to be essential for these initial processes. The subsequent transfer of the pyrogenic message from the periphery to the brain is achieved by neuronal and humoral mechanisms. These pathways subserve the genesis of early (neuronal signals) and late (humoral signals) phases of the characteristically biphasic febrile response to LPS. During the course of fever, counterinflammatory factors, ?endogenous antipyretics,? are elaborated peripherally and centrally to limit fever in strength and duration. The multiple interacting pro- and antipyretic signals and their mechanistic effects that underlie endotoxic fever are the subjects of this review. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Limb/digit amputation is a common event in humans caused by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. Although the loss of a digit is not lethal, it affects quality of life and imposes high costs on amputees. In recent years, the increasing interest in limb regeneration has led to enhanced scientific knowledge. However, the limited ability to develop functional limb regeneration in the clinical setting suggests that a challenging issue remains in limb regeneration. Recently, the emergence of regenerative engineering is a promising field to address this challenge and close the gap between science and clinical applications. Cell signalling and molecular mechanisms involved in the limb regeneration process have been extensively studied; however, there is still insufficient data on cell therapy and tissue engineering for limb regeneration. In this review, we intend to focus on therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration that are closely related to gene, immune, and stem cell therapies, as well as tissue engineering approaches that take into consideration the peculiar developmental properties of the limbs. In addition, we attempt to identify the challenges of these strategies for limb regeneration studies in terms of clinical settings and as a road map to accomplish the goal of functional human limb regeneration.

AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - Summary Meningococcal disease is a leading infectious cause of death in children in industrialized countries. The induction of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis-related multi-organ failure. Here, we demonstrate that N. meningitidis serotypes A and B induce significantly higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α positive cells in vitro in infants and young children compared with adults (serotype A/B; infants: 64·9%/63·9%; children: 77·8%/64·3% versus adults: 27·7%/32%; P?<?0·005). Serotype A induces also higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6 positive cells in neonates and infants compared with adults (serotype A; newborn 55·4%; infants 58·8% versus adults 49%; P?<?0·05). Treatment with human recombinant erythropoietin in vitro resulted in significant attenuation of the N. meningitidis-induced proinflammatory response in all age groups (reduction rate of erythropoietin for IL-6 after stimulation with serotype B: newborn 28%, infants 15%, children 23% and adults 28% and for TNF-α after stimulation with serotype B: newborn 27%, infants 22%, children 20% and adults 28%; P?<?0·05). We conclude that (i) Neisseria meningitidis induces a higher TNF-α response in infants and children compared with adults and (ii) erythropoietin was able to attenuate IL-6 and TNF-α production in all investigated age groups. These data may explain the high incidence of meningococcal infection in infants and makes erythropoietin a potentially attractive candidate for interventional strategies in an otherwise devastating course of the disease.

AB  - Biofilm infections are one of the modern medical world's greatest challenges. Probably, all non-obligate intracellular bacteria and fungi can establish biofilms. In addition, there are numerous biofilm-related infections, both foreign body-related and non-foreign body-related. Although biofilm infections can present in numerous ways, one common feature is involvement of the host response with significant impact on the course. A special characteristic is the synergy of the innate and the acquired immune responses for the induced pathology. Here, we review the impact of the host response for the course of biofilm infections, with special focus on cystic fibrosis, chronic wounds and infective endocarditis.

AB  - Summary:? The gastrointestinal system is a common entry point for pathogenic microbes to access the inner environment of the body. Anti-microbial factors produced by the intestinal mucosa limit the translocation of both commensal and pathogenic microbes across the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. The regulation of these host defense mechanisms largely depends on the activation of innate immune receptors by microbial molecules. Under steady-state conditions, the microbiota provides constitutive signals to the innate immune system, which helps to maintain a healthy inflammatory tone within the intestinal mucosa and, thus, enhances resistance to infection with enteric pathogens. During an acute infection, the intestinal epithelial cell barrier is breached, and the detection of microbial molecules in the intestinal lamina propria rapidly stimulates innate immune signaling pathways that coordinate early defense mechanisms. Herein, we review how microbial molecules shed by both commensal and pathogenic microbes direct host defenses at the intestinal mucosa. We highlight the signaling pathways, effector molecules, and cell populations that are activated by microbial molecule recognition and, thereby, are involved in the maintenance of homeostatic levels of host defense and in the early response to acute enteric infection. Finally, we discuss how manipulation of these host defense pathways by stimulating innate immune receptors is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or alleviate intestinal disease.

AB  - Abstract Behcet?s disease (BD) is thought to be caused by multiple genetic, environmental and immunological factors, one of the most prominent being the strong association with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-Bw51, an HLA-Bw4-associated allele. We examined the presence/absence of 14 killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their ligands in 134 Turkish individuals with BD and compared the results with those of 154 ethnically matched controls. Although KIR3DL1 with its ligand (HLA-Bw4) was significantly increased in the patients with BD (P?=?0.0003), this no longer applied when the patients and controls were categorised by HLA-Bw51 status. Thus, no association was identified between presence or absence of any of the 14 KIR genes studied and BD. In addition, we did not find any associations of KIR with various manifestations of the disease nor with gender or age of onset.
