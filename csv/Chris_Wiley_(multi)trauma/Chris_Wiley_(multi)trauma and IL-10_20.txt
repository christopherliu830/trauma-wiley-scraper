AB  - Abstract In the present study we investigated whether donor gender of the effects of sex hormones play the greater role in the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. Kidneys of male and female Fisher rats were orthotopically transplanted into castrated male Lewis recipients. Animals were treated with testosterone, estradiol, or vehicle and the kidneys were harvested 20 weeks after transplantation for histological, immunohistological, and molecular analysis. Testosterone treatment resulted in increased proteinuria and profound glomerulo-sclerosis, irrespective of donor gender. In addition, mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) and platelet-derived growth factor-A and B (PDGF-A and B) chains were enhanced in these allografts. Estradiol reduced glomerulosclerosis and mononuclear cell infiltration in allografts of both genders that paralleled a decreased mRNA expression of TGF-?1, PDGF-A and B. No donor gender-related differences were noted in vehicle-treated animals. Our findings demonstrate that sex hormones rather than donor gender have a significant impact on chronic allograft nephropathy.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - Summary Background? Although development of visceral pain is an important defensive mechanism, hypersensitivity results in a significant clinical problem and is likely to be one of the major factors involved in the pathogenesis of abdominal and chest pain in functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in peripheral sensitization of visceral nociceptors has advanced as a result of the experimental studies, especially in animal models, which have led to knowledge and identification of key mediators and receptors. Aim? To provide a comprehensive review focused on the peripheral mechanisms believed to be responsible for sensitization and potential molecular targets for a disorder which is common, distressing and has sub-optimal treatment options. Methods? Literature review using Ovid and Pubmed from 1966. Results? There is substantial interest in the development of new drugs for treatment of FBDs in the background of advances in understanding the molecular and physiological mechanisms of visceral hypersensitivity. The potential drug targets include TPRV1, ASICs, voltage-gated sodium channels, ATP, PAR-2, cannabinoid, prostaglandin, tachykinin and 5HT3 receptors. Conclusion? It is anticipated that with advancing molecular understanding of the basis of visceral hypersensitivity, the next decade will see accelerated development of new molecules for treatment of functional bowel diseases.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a basis for understanding how and why hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may effectively treat severe autoimmune diseases (ADs) and describes the preclinical studies that have contributed to this understanding. It begins with an overview of how normal antigen-specific immune responses develop, followed by a discussion of why autoimmunity occurs. Thereafter, studies on preclinical models using HCT for the treatment of autoimmune syndromes are presented. The HCT studies are described as they were originally performed using congenic, syngeneic, or pseudoautologous donors with the understanding that all of these graft types serve as models for autologous HCT. ADs arise when immune effector cells cause damage to tissues. The response may be organ specific or systemic, and more than one autoimmune syndrome can exist in an individual. Depletion of host T cells is the most extensively studied mechanism by which allogeneic HCT can alter immune function.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract Pain afflicts up to 20% of the population in the Western World and represents a challenge for clinicians and scientists because of a large interindividual variability in: (a) pain sensitivity, (b) in development of chronic pain and (c) in the response to analgesics. The personal and socioeconomic costs are considerable. The genetic approach to investigate pain has identified several potential areas of interest to understand genetic predisposition, the occurrence of pain and the variability of pain in human and in mice. In this paper, we will focus on genetic methods and variables influencing pain and pharmacotherapy elucidating the complexity of the area. Examples of promising candidate genes and allelic variables have been intensively studied and the number has been increasing during recent years with more or less reproducible results.

AB  - Abstract Several forms of arthritis and rheumatism can sometimes complicate leprosy. However, its presentation as an acute onset arthritis is unusual. We report two adult male naïve patients who presented to our rheumatology outpatient clinic with acute onset inflammatory polyarthritis, skin rash and mild sensory neurodeficit. Borderline lepromatous leprosy (in type I lepra reaction) was diagnosed. We also refer to 19 case records of Hansen arthritis in the clinic database (1998?2007) from approximately 35,000 patients and a community study to highlight the missed diagnosis of Hansen's disease and its unusual association with rheumatoid arthritis. In countries like India where leprosy is endemic, this disease also merits attention in rheumatology clinics.

AB  - Abstract Introduction:? Previous studies have shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels correlated with mortality in critically ill patients. Goal:? To determine the effect of ketamine on IL-6 levels in liver resections patients with a temporary porto-arterial occlusion (Pringle manoeuvre). Materials and methods:? Controlled, prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. One group (n?=?21) received ketamine whereas the other group (n?=?17) received placebo. IL-6 levels were obtained at baseline, 4, 12, 24?h, 3 and 5 days. Results:? There were no significant differences in IL-6 levels between the groups (basal P?=?089, 4?h P?=?0.83, 12?h P?=?0.39, 24?h, P?=?0.55, 3 days P?=?0.80 and 5 days P?=?0.45). Both groups had elevated IL-6 levels that became almost undetectable by day 5. There was no major morbidity and no mortality in either group. Conclusions:? Ketamine does not seem to have an effect on plasma levels of IL-6. This could be interpreted as a potential finding associated with outcome as we did not encounter any deaths or major complications. Further studies will likely be needed to determine the range of IL-6 levels associated with survival and mortality, and whether it could be a predictor of survival.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate extended release (XR) in the treatment of Korean subjects with acute schizophrenia. Methods This was an 8-week, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate XR at a daily dose of 400?800?mg. Changes in total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week?8 were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine XR. Additionally, the Clinical Global Impression scale and the Montgomery?Åsberg Depression Rating Scale were administered. Results The mean change in PANSS total scores was ?26.8, and the mean PANSS total score at the endpoint was significantly lower than that at baseline. The mean PANSS positive score, negative score, and general score showed statistically significant reductions at the end of the study. Statistically significant changes were also observed in Clinical Global Impression-Severity and Montgomery?Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. The most common treatment-related adverse events in the group receiving quetiapine XR were sedation (10.6%) and constipation (9.6%). Conclusions In this study of Korean patients with acute schizophrenia, quetiapine XR showed clinical efficacy and relatively good tolerability. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary The use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) for the treatment of equine injuries and diseases holds immense potential, and is expanding from its original application in orthopedics into the treatment of ischemic, inflammatory, and neurologic disorders. The use of MSC for primary tissue regeneration was initially advocated on the basis of their ability to differentiate into various tissue types. As such, the regeneration of damaged tissues would be directly stimulated, since injected MSC colonize the injury site, differentiate into the appropriate mesenchymal tissue type, and affect repair. Since 2003, the clinical use of MSC has exploded, with thousands of horses now being treated worldwide. Demonstrating true efficacy should be a collective goal of the equine veterinary community, by performing clinical trials that include a sufficient amount of similar cases, and a consistent and standardized panel of objective outcome measures.

AB  - Abstract Background We aim to study the level of inflammatory cytokines in aqueous of post-vitrectomy eyes. Methods Aqueous samples were obtained from post-vitrectomy eyes that underwent cataract surgery. Samples from age-related cataract patients were also collected as controls. The concentrations of cytokines were measured by array-based multiplex sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system and microparticle-based multiplex cytokine assay. Results Eighteen post-vitrectomy eyes from 18 patients were included; all received one vitrectomy with gas injection for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The mean interval between vitrectomy and cataract surgery was 22.33?months (range 6 to 80). Primary results show that in post-vitrectomy eyes the levels of many cytokines, such as B-lymphocyte chemo-attractant, I-309, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, were higher than control. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were significantly elevated in post-vitrectomy eyes, even after the subjects were divided by their refractive state. Conclusions The concentrations of some cytokines were increased in the anterior chambers of post-vitrectomy eyes even a long time after vitreous surgery. This surge in post-operative cytokines might cause changing in the micro-environment of the anterior, and this might contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma or fasten the development of cataract in these eyes.
