AB  - Summary Membrane-bound and intracellular immune receptors respond to microbial pathogens by initiating signaling cascades that result in production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial factors. These host responses need to be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage and other harmful consequences of excessive inflammation. CARD-only proteins (COPs) and Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are human- and primate-specific dominant negative inhibitors that modulate inflammatory and innate immune responses. In addition, several poxviruses encode POPs that interfere with inflammatory and host defense responses. COPs and POPs modulate inflammatory signaling at several checkpoints by sequestering key components of the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling cascades, thus hampering downstream signal transduction. Here, we review and discuss current understanding of the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms by which roles of host- and virus-encoded COPs and POPs may regulate inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, we address their (patho)physiological roles and highlight topics for further research.

AB  - Implication of Pigment Cell Biology for Understanding Human Diseases was the topic of the The Sixth Annual Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center: Carcinogenesis and Cancer Prevention conference, jointly sponsored by the University of California Irvine College of Medicine and the PanAmerican Society of Pigment Cell Research This was a multi-disciplinary, three-and-one-half day conference for basic science and clinical investigators. The overall objectives of the meeting were to expand ideas, approaches, and collaborations for members of the society by bringing together experts in disciplines relevant to pigment cell research and associated diseases such as melanoma, albinoism, vitiligo, and other diseases of pigment cells. The meeting focused on recent developments in the genetics, novel gene function, gene expression pattern, and post-transcriptional processing of melanocyte specific proteins, melanosome function, melanin structure, and implications of recent basic advances for understanding human pigmentary diseases. These areas have been particularly productive due to recent breakthroughs and rapid progress in microarray gene expression, mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and other physical chemical and molecular biotechnologies.

AB  - Abstract An acute administration of the hippocampal toxicant trimethyltin (TMT) produced a specific pattern of neuronal necrosis in dentate granule cells with accompanying astrogliosis and initiation of a cytokine response within 24 hours. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DEX), on the pattern of cytokine expression and neuronal degeneration occurring after an acute TMT injection. Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered to 21-day-old male mice 1 hour prior to an injection of TMT hydroxide (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice receiving 0.2 mg/kg DEX received a second injection 6 hours after TMT. Twenty-four hours later, neuronal necrosis and astrogliosis were assessed and found to be similar in animals treated with TMT, either in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Pretreatment with dexamethasone failed to prevent the neurodegeneration and astrogliosis. The TMT-induced injury response was represented in elevations of mRNA levels for the injury-associated host response genes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), EB22/5.3, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The combination of DEX and TMT produced increased elevation in mRNA levels for EB22/5.3 and ICAM, while GFAP levels remained the same as with TMT alone. The injury response from TMT was accompanied by elevations in mRNA levels for the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, TNF?, and interleukin (IL)-1α. Treatment with dexamethasone prior to TMT resulted in significantly elevated levels of TNFα, TNF?, and IL-1α as compared to TMT alone. These data represent the inability of glucocorticoids to downregulate the injury response in rat hippocampus following a systemic injection of TMT and suggest a stimulation and ?priming? of hippocampal cells by dexamethasone.

AB  - Abstract With an increase in the ageing population worldwide, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases at an alarming rate in both male and female irrespective of their ethnicity. At present, the currently available therapeutic options are mostly limited to either bone resorptive or bone forming efficacies and both approaches are associated with serious side effects. Despite these options, there is still need for newer therapeutics to treat osteoporosis, which can offer beneficial effects for maintaining balanced dynamics between bone formation and bone resorption, devoid of any side effect. The proper understanding of pathophysiology of the disease is essential for designing or investigating an effective and safe anti-osteoporotic agent. This review represents a discussion around the molecular targets with their implications in disease progression, available therapeutic options, the emerging targets, and the importance of designing an effective anti-osteoporotic agent.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of arthritis worldwide and represents a significant healthcare burden, particularly in the context of an ageing population. Traditionally, painkillers, injections and physiotherapy have been the mainstay of treatment, with patients being referred for joint replacement surgery (arthroplasty) when these options fail. Whilst effective in reducing pain and improving joint function, these approaches are not without potential complications. With the development of tissue-engineering techniques over recent years there has been considerable interest in applying these strategies to provide new, innovative, alternative effective means of treating OA. This review explores the unique microenvironment present within an osteoarthritic joint, highlighting the features that comprise the osteoarthritic niche and could be modulated in the development of novel treatments for OA. Existing tissue-engineering strategies for repairing bone and cartilage defects are discussed, with particular reference to how these might be modified, both to improve existing treatments, such as impaction bone grafting, as well as in the development of future treatments for OA.
