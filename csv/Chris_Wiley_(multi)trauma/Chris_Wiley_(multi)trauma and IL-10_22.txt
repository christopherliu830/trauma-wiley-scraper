AB  - Background and purpose:? Interleukin-1beta (IL-1?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are involved in inflammatory responses during large vessel occlusion in animal models. The aim of this study was to investigate the intrathecal levels of cytokines in patients with acute small infarcts. Methods:? Forty patients with acute minor stroke and 32 non-stroke patients (including 29 age- and gender-matched subjects) who received operations with spinal anesthesia were studied prospectively and underwent measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-1? and IL-6 levels. Results:? After an age- and gender-matched analysis of 58 patients (29 pairs), the mean intrathecal levels of IL-1? were 0.80?pg/ml in patients with small infarcts and 0.59?pg/ml in non-stroke patients (P?<?0.0001). In addition, the mean CSF levels of IL-6 were 21.54?pg/ml and 7.52?pg/ml in the stroke and control groups, respectively (P?=?0.38). These results were consistent with the data without matching. The CSF levels of IL-1? in the 40 stroke patients were significantly higher than in the 32 non-stroke controls (P?<?0.0001). Conclusions:? The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1?, but not IL-6, remained elevated in the CSF of patients in the acute stage of small infarcts.

AB  - Abstract Despite of its long history as a drug, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) still fascinates investigators across the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine. In this regard, the development of aspirin derivatives with new, beneficial, biological properties still remains a challenge for chemists. This short review focuses on the chemistry and the biological activity of organometallic (those with metal-carbon bond) aspirin derivatives. Organometallic derivatization of aspirin has a profound influence on its mode of action and biological activity profile. In most organometallic ASA derivatives, the original ability for COX-1/2 acetylation persists, yet the acetylation sites are modified in comparison to that triggered by ASA itself. This alternation results from a combination of the electronic effect and the steric hindrance provided by the organometallic entity. Secondly, the metal center itself has a strong influence on biological activity through e.?g., the ability for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the cells. All of these examples, which are uncommon for ASA molecular action mechanisms, contribute to new pharmacological properties of organometallic ASA derivatives. These properties comprise anticancer, antiparasitic, and antibacterial activity.

AB  - Summary: The T-helper 17 (Th17) lineage is a recently described subset of memory T cells that is characterized by its CD4+ status and its ability to make a constellation of cytokines including interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-22, and, in humans, IL-26. Although most extensively described in the autoimmunity literature, there is growing evidence that the Th17 lineage plays a significant role in mediating host mucosal immunity to a number of pulmonary pathogens. This review highlights our current understanding of the role of the Th17 lineage and Th17 cytokines in mediating mucosal immunity to both pulmonary and gastrointestinal pathogens. While we have the strongest evidence that the Th17 lineage is centrally involved in mediating the host response to Gram-negative extracellular pulmonary pathogens, this literature is rapidly evolving and demonstrates a central role for Th17 cytokines both in primary infection and in recall responses seen in vaccine studies. In this review, we summarize the current state of this literature and present possible applications of Th17-targeted immunotherapy in the treatment and prevention of infection.

AB  - Despite the inherent ability of bone to regenerate itself, there are a number of clinical situations in which complete bone regeneration fails to occur. In view of shortcomings of conventional treatment, gene therapy may have a place in cases of critical-size bone loss that cannot be properly treated with current medical or surgical treatment. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of gene therapy in general, nonviral techniques of gene transfer including physical and chemical methods, RNA-based therapy, therapeutic genes to be transferred for bone regeneration, route of application including ex vivo application, and direct gene therapy approaches to regenerate bone. ?2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reduced HLA-DR expression on monocytes has been suggested as a predictive marker of immunosuppression following very high risk surgery, but there are few reports in lower risk surgery. In 32 patients undergoing low to intermediate risk surgery, blood samples were analysed by flow cytometry for HLA-DR expression and numbers in both CD14high and CD14lowCD16+ monocyte subsets. The numbers of CD14high monocytes increased at 24?h (mean (SD), 5.0 (2.2) vs 7.6 (3.9)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01) while CD14lowCD16+ monocytes decreased (0.68 (0.36) vs 0.44 (0.36)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01). HLA-DR expression was significantly reduced in both subsets by 24?h (mean (SD) fluorescent intensity 440 (310) vs 160 (130) for CD14high and 1000 (410) vs 560 (380) for CD14lowCD16+ subsets; p?<?0.01). This reduction of monocyte HLA-DR expression 24?h following lower risk surgery raises questions about the purported clinical utility of this biomarker as an early predictor of postoperative complications. Our results also suggest that surgery induces significant trafficking (i.e. mobilisation, margination and extravasation) of monocyte subsets, and that monocyte HLA-DR depression is the result of a down-regulatory phenomenon (decreased protein expression on each cell) rather than the differential trafficking of monocyte subsets.
