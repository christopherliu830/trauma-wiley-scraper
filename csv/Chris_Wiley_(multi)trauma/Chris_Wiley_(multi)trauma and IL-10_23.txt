AB  - Summary: There is compelling evidence that epithelial cells (ECs) at mucosal surfaces, beyond their role in creating a physical barrier, are integral components of innate and adaptive immunity. The capacity of these cells to license the functions of specific immune cell populations in the airway and gastrointestinal tract offers the prospect of novel therapeutic strategies to target multiple inflammatory diseases in which barrier immunity is dysregulated. In this review, we discuss the critical functions of EC-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 in the development and regulation of T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine-dependent immune responses. We first highlight recent data that have provided new insights into the factors that control expression of this triad of cytokines and their receptors. In addition, we review their proinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions in models of mucosal infection and inflammation. Lastly, we discuss new findings indicating that despite their diverse structural features and differential expression of their receptors, TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 cross-regulate one another and share overlapping properties that influence Th2 cytokine-dependent responses at mucosal sites.

AB  - Abstract Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common disease for which a specific treatment remains elusive. The key determinants of the outcome from AP are persistent organ failure and infected pancreatic necrosis. The prevention and treatment of these determinants provides a framework for the development of specific treatment strategies. The gut-lymph concept provides a common mechanism for systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Acute and critical illness, including AP, is associated with intestinal ischemia and drastic changes in the composition of gut lymph, which bypasses the liver to drain into the systemic circulation immediately proximal to the major organ systems which fail. The external diversion of gut lymph and the targeting of treatments to counter the toxic elements in gut lymph offers novel approaches to the prevention and treatment of persistent organ failure. Infected pancreatic necrosis is increasingly treated with less invasive techniques, the mainstay of which is drainage, both endoscopic and percutaneous. Further improvements will occur with the strategies to accelerate liquefaction and through a fundamental re-design of drains, both of which will increase drainage efficacy. The determinants of severity and outcome in patients admitted with AP provide the basis for innovative treatment strategies. The priorities are to translate the gut-lymph concept to clinical practice and to improve the design and active use of drains for infected complications of AP.

AB  - Abstract The cecum contains a high concentration of microbes, which are a combination of Gram-negative and Gram-positive flora. These bacteria range from anaerobic to facultative aerobic to aerobic organisms. In the procedure described in this unit, the ligation of the cecum produces a source of ischemic tissue as well as polymicrobial infection. This combination of ischemic/necrotic tissue and microbial infection distinguishes this multifactorial model from a number of other bacterial sepsis models, including but not limited to: bacteremia secondary to intravenous or intraperitoneal administration; fecal administration or intraperitoneal administration of fecal or bacterial plugs; colonic stents; and bacterial abscess formation.

AB  - SUMMARY Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a pivotal cytokine at the centre of a cascade of cytokines and inflammatory mediators which modulate the host response to infection and trauma, and in particular the metabolic changes resulting in shock and subsequent multi-organ failure. The cytokine IL-8?predominantly an activator and chemotactic factor for circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes?is produced in response to TNF-αin vitro, and high circulating levels of IL-8 are found in septic primates. We have studied the release of IL-8 into the circulation of subjects with chronic hepatitis B undergoing a 10 week pilot trial of recombinant TNF-α (rTNF-α) therapy in doses of 15-100 ?g/m2, A marked dose-dependent increase in plasma IL-8 levels was seen commencing at 30-60 min after the start of rTNF-α infusion and peaking between 2 and 3 h (mean peak level 4300 ng/l). The temporal pattern of IL-8 production exactly echoed that of IL-6, another component of the cytokine cascade, but peak plasma levels of IL-8 were up to 17 times higher than those of IL-6. This study confirms in vitro data suggesting that IL-8 is a component of the acute circulating cytokine cascade with a potential role in the modulation of the acute immune and metabolic response to infection and trauma.

AB  - Abstract Fibrosis and scar formation results from chronic progressive injury in virtually every tissue and affects a growing number of people around the world. Myofibroblasts drive fibrosis, and recent work has demonstrated that mesenchymal cells, including pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts, are their main progenitors. Understanding the cellular mechanisms of pericyte/fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, myofibroblast proliferation and the key signalling pathways that regulate these processes is essential to develop novel targeted therapeutics for the growing patient population suffering from solid organ fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about different progenitor cells of myofibroblasts, discuss major pathways that regulate their transdifferentiation and discuss the current status of novel targeted anti-fibrotic therapeutics in development.

AB  - Abstract Vein graft failure remains a major concern after coronary artery bypass graft operations, and is initiated by loss of endothelial cell integrity. Preservation of saphenous vein grafts in the optimal solution after meticulous harvesting can limit the endothelial damage. Despite both experimental and clinical results in favor of buffered solutions, normal saline is still the most widely used solution. This review examines the literature to identify the most optimal storage solutions currently available for vein graft preservation.

AB  - Abstract Background L-arginine (L-Arg) is deficient in sickle cell disease (SSD) during vasoocclusion. We investigated possible causal relationship between L-Arg deficiency and immune dysfunction in SSD in steady-state. Procedure Fifteen patients with SSD in steady-state and 13 controls were studied. Plasma L-Arg levels were measured using liquid chromatography. T cell subsets and CD3zeta (CD3?) chain expression were analyzed using flow cytometry. Lymphocyte proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and production of IL-6 and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) were evaluated with and without L-Arg. Results SSD patients had significantly lower L-Arg levels than controls. CD3 and CD19 cell populations were comparable for both groups, but SSD patients had above normal numbers of natural killer cells (P?=?0.06). Patients and controls exhibited significantly increased lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA after introduction of L-Arg to cultures; response of patients was significantly greater than values for control individuals. Proliferative response to candida in SSD patients was significantly lower than in controls; L-Arg supplementation did not increase this response. L-Arg had no effect on blastogenic response to PPD and candida albicans. No effect was likewise seen in production of IL-6 and IFN-? after addition of L-Arg. CD3? chain expression increased after addition of L-Arg in both groups; differences were insignificant. Conclusion L-Arg levels in steady-state SSD are significantly lower than in controls. L-Arg supplementation enhanced lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA for both controls and patients, but not in response to antigen. There were no significant differences in CD3? chain expression although upregulation of expression occurred after L-Arg supplementation for both groups.

AB  - Abstract Patients who have been diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis should be, on principle, hospitalized. Crucial fundamental management is required soon after a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis has been made and includes monitoring of the conscious state, the respiratory and cardiovascular system, the urinary output, adequate fluid replacement and pain control. Along with such management, etiologic diagnosis and severity assessment should be conducted. Patients with a diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis should be transferred to a medical facility where intensive respiratory and cardiovascular management as well as interventional treatment, blood purification therapy and nutritional support are available. The disease condition in acute pancreatitis changes every moment and even symptoms that are mild at the time of diagnosis may become severe later. Therefore, severity assessment should be conducted repeatedly at least within 48 h following diagnosis. An adequate dose of fluid replacement is essential to stabilize cardiovascular dynamics and the dose should be adjusted while assessing circulatory dynamics constantly. A large dose of fluid replacement is usually required in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Prophylactic antibiotic administration is recommended to prevent infectious complications in patients with severe acute pancreatitis. Although the efficacy of intravenous administration of protease inhibitors is still a matter of controversy, there is a consensus in Japan that a large dose of a synthetic protease inhibitor should be given to patients with severe acute pancreatitis in order to prevent organ failure and other complications. Enteral feeding is superior to parenteral nutrition when it comes to the nutritional support of patients with severe acute pancreatitis. The JPN Guidelines recommend, as optional continuous regional arterial infusion and blood purification therapy.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the dermatological consequences of bed bug bites along with the immunological basis for the reaction in humans. With the recent rise in bed bug infestations, there has also been an increase in the number of patients presenting with allergic responses, and systemic reactions that have beentreated with an immunosuppressant. The signs and symptoms developing from the bite are due to the host's response to the trauma, the subsequent inflammatory response, and immune system reaction to antigens present in the saliva. When a patient is bitten by large numbers of bed bugs, multiple separate lesions can coalesce to mimic generalized maculopapular exanthema. The lesions may be further modified by excoriations and lichenification from persistent scratching, complicating the differential diagnoses. The first step is bed bug eradication from the patient's living environment and prevention of reinfestation. Eradication can be challenging and in most cases requires a licensed and trained pest management professional (PMP).

Sepsis-induced changes in signalling cascades -? Divergent effects on phagocytic cells during sepsis -? Harmful effects of C5a and C5a receptors in experimental sepsis ?? Future directions Sepsis in human beings is a major problem involving many individuals and with a high death rate. Except for a single drug (recombinant activated protein C) that has been approved for treatment of septic patients, supportive measures represent the main clinical approach. There are many models of experimental sepsis, mostly in rodents. A commonly used model is cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, robust activation of complement occurs together with up-regulation of C5a receptors (C5aR, C5L2) in a variety of different organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart). In septic human beings there is abundant evidence for complement activation. Interception of C5a or its receptors in the CLP model greatly improves survival in septic rodents. There is compelling evidence that CLP causes an intense pro-inflammatory state and that C5a interaction with its receptors can be linked to apoptosis of the lymphoid system and cells of the adrenal medulla, loss of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils, consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac dysfunction. These findings may have implications for therapeutic interventions in human beings with sepsis.
