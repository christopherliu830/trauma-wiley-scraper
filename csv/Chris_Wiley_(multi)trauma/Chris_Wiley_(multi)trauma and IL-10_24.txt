AB  - Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), that is Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, affects about 1.5 million persons in the USA and 2.2 million in Europe. The pathophysiology of IBD involves immunological, genetic and environmental factors. The treatment is medico-surgical but suspensive. Anti-TNFα agents have revolutionized the treatment of IBD but have side effects. In addition, a non-negligible percentage of patients with IBD stop or take episodically their treatment. Consequently, a nondrug therapy targeting TNFα through a physiological pathway, devoid of major side effects and with a good cost-effectiveness ratio, would be of interest. The vagus nerve has dual anti-inflammatory properties through its afferent (i.e. hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal axis) and efferent (i.e. the anti-TNFα effect of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway) fibres. We have shown that there is an inverse relationship between vagal tone and plasma TNFα level in patients with CD, and have reported, for the first time, that chronic vagus nerve stimulation has anti-inflammatory properties in a rat model of colitis and in a pilot study performed in seven patients with moderate CD. Two of these patients failed to improve after 3 months of vagus nerve stimulation but five were in deep remission (clinical, biological and endoscopic) at 6 months of follow-up and vagal tone was restored. No major side effects were observed. Thus, vagus nerve stimulation provides a new therapeutic option in the treatment of CD.

AB  - Abstract The study was aimed to explore the functions of circulating fibrocytes (CFs) on injury repair in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) mice model and its clinical value as a biomarker for ALI/ARDS. ALI/ARDS mice model was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of ALI/ARDS model and flow cytometry was used to measure CFs defined as cells positive for CD45 and collagen-1. Histological changes of lung tissues were evaluated by H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. The correlations of CFs counts with damnification of lung tissue and the severity of pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of collagen-1. ELISA was applied to determine cytokine CXCL12 concentration. Clinical relevance between CFs and ALI/ARDS was investigated. The greater number of CFs in the ALI/ARDS group implied higher degree of lung injury and more severe pulmonary fibrosis. The protein expression of collagen-1 and concentration of cytokine CXCL12 in ALI/ARDS group were higher than that in control group. Clinical and prognostic analysis revealed the higher injury degree and death rates in ALI/ARDS group than those in control group, and identified a greater severity and mortality for patients with ARDS than those with ALI. ROC curve analysis indicated the counts of CFs greater than 5.85% can predict death rates with AUC?=?0.928. CFs had an inhibitory effect on injury repair in ALI/ARDS mice model. This might be unfavorable as a clinical marker for progression of ALI/ARDS.

AB  - Background: Hyper-immunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome is a complex immune deficiency characterized by chronic eczematous dermatitis, recurrent staphylococcal infections, pneumatoceles, reduced neutrophil chemotaxis, and variably impaired T cell function. Although decreased interferon-? (IFN-?) production in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome is pointed out and known as a cause of reduced neutrophil chemotaxis, precise mechanism of their inadequate production of IFN-? remains unknown. To elucidate the pathogenesis of the defective production of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome, we assessed the in vitro production and secretion of IFN-? by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Methods: Chemotaxis of neutrophils, mRNA levels of several cytokines, intracellular production and extracellular secretion of IFN-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 by PBMCs from three patients with hyper-IgE syndrome were determined. Results: The transcription of IFN-? mRNA and the production of its protein molecules progressed normally. However, selective insufficiency in the secretion of IFN-? molecules was found in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome.Confocal laser scanning microscopy clearly demonstrated the accumulation of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Conclusion: We demonstrated that there was a selective insufficiency in the secretion of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. We hope that this fact would offer a new paradigm for understanding this disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT The elevation of tissue pO2 induced by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a physiological stimulus that elicits a variety of cellular responses. These effects are largely mediated by, or in response to, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). The major consequences of elevated RONS include increased oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant capacity, and modulation of redox-sensitive cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, these phenomena underlie both the therapeutic and potentially toxic effects of HBO. Emerging evidence indicates that supporting mitochondrial health is a potential method of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of, and preventing oxygen toxicity during, HBO. This review will focus on the cellular consequences of HBO, and explore how these processes mediate a delicate balance of cellular protection versus damage. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Urosepsis is defined as sepsis caused by an infection in the urogenital tract (Table 1). In urosepsis, as in other types of sepsis, the severity of sepsis depends mostly upon the host response. Patients who are more likely to develop urosepsis include elderly patients; diabetics; immunosuppressed patients, such as transplant recipients; cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or corticosteroids; and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndromes. However, all patients can be affected by bacterial species capable of inducing inflammation within the urinary tract.

AB  - Histological differentiation between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms such as trichoepithelioma and trichoblastoma can be difficult on small biopsies. Therefore, several attempts have been made to identify immunohistochemical differences between these entities. Recent studies showed androgen receptor expression in a number of mature epithelial structures in the skin and in epithelial neoplasms including basal cell carcinoma. In contrast, androgen receptor expression was absent in mature hair follicles or the few trichogenic neoplasms studied to date. These findings suggested that androgen receptor expression might be a useful adjunct in the histological differential diagnosis between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of androgen receptor expression in 32 basal cell carcinomas and 10 benign trichoblastic tumors (6 trichoepitheliomas and 4 trichoblastomas). In our study, expression of androgen receptor was detected in 78% of basal cell carcinomas. None of the trichoblastic tumors showed any androgen receptor immunoreactivity. These results confirm the lack of androgen receptor expression in benign trichoblastic neoplasms and indicate that finding of androgen receptor expression points to basal cell carcinoma as the most likely diagnosis.

AB  - Aim Neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, bipolar and schizophrenia frequently exhibit a neuroprogressive course from prodrome to chronicity. There are a range of agents exhibiting capacity to attenuate biological mechanisms associated with neuroprogression. This review will update the evidence for putative neuroprotective agents including clinical efficacy, mechanisms of action and limitations in current assessment tools, and identify novel agents with neuroprotective potential. Method Data for this review were sourced from online databases PUBMED, Embase and Web of Science. Only data published since 2012 were included in this review, no data were excluded based on language or publication origin. Results Each of the agents reviewed inhibit one or multiple pathways of neuroprogression including: inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotrophin dysregulation and apoptotic signalling. Some demonstrate clinical efficacy in preventing neural damage or loss, relapse or cognitive/functional decline. Agents include: the psychotropic medications lithium, second generation antipsychotics and antidepressants; other pharmacological agents such as minocycline, aspirin, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, statins, ketamine and alpha-2-delta ligands; and others such as erythropoietin, oestrogen, leptin, N-acetylcysteine, curcumin, melatonin and ebselen. Conclusions Signals of evidence of clinical neuroprotection are evident for a number of candidate agents. Adjunctive use of multiple agents may present a viable avenue to clinical realization of neuroprotection. Definitive prospective studies of neuroprotection with multimodal assessment tools are required.
