AB  - ABSTRACT Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is difficult to manage and can result in significant patient morbidity. Currently, the clinical use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for painful tendons has received attention, but its efficacy remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of PRP and its biological components. A total of 156 patients with LE were randomly divided into group 1, treated with a single injection of 2-ml autologous PRP, and group 2, treated with a control received only physical therapy without injection. Both groups used a tennis elbow strap and performed stretching and strengthening exercises during 24 weeks? follow-up. Pain and functional improvements were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), Modified Mayo Clinic Performance Index for the elbow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). White blood cell count, platelet count, and levels of platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), PDGF-BB, transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and interleukin-1 ? in PRP were measured and investigated for statistical correlation with the clinical score. At 24 weeks, all pain and functional variables, including VAS score, Mayo Clinic performance scores, and MRI grade, improved significantly in group 1 (p?<?0.05). PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-? levels were more significantly increased in PRP than in whole blood. TGF-? level significantly correlated with Mayo Clinic performance score and MRI grade improvement. Thus, TGF-? level in PRP is considered to play a pivotal role in tendon healing. These results may contribute to identifying the best protocol for PRP application in tendinopathies. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Frequently used experimental models of sepsis include cecal ligation and puncture, ascending colon stent peritonitis, and the i.p. or i.v. injection of bacteria or bacterial products (such as LPS). Many of these models mimic the pathophysiology of human sepsis. However, identification of mediators in animals, the blockade of which has been protective, has not translated into clinical efficacy in septic humans. We describe the shortcomings of the animal models and reasons why effective therapy for human sepsis cannot be derived readily from promising findings in animal sepsis.

AB  - Summary Functional foods fall into two broad categories: plant origin and animal origin. A review conducted in 1992 proves that plant-based foods have some components that act against lethal diseases, such as cancer. A vast number of components, such as fish oil and dairy products naturally present in animal sources are potentially beneficial to health. Nutraceuticals deliver a concentrated form of a biologically active component from a food to enhance health in dosages that exceed those that could be obtained from regular food. The use of probiotics in combination with prebiotic has been very effective against several chronic diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics provide an alternate source for the management of different intestinal disorders. The major contributions associated with the work of probiotics on human health are proper colonic function and increased metabolism. Research indicates that there is an estimated global market for functional foods of US$33 billion.

AB  - Modern medical practices allow patients to survive acute insults and be sustained by machinery and medicines for extended periods of time. We define chronic critical illness as a later stage of prolonged critical illness that requires tracheotomy. These patients have persistent elevations of inflammatory cytokines, diminished hypothalamic?pituitary function, hypercatabolism, immobilization, and malnutrition. The measurement of bone turnover markers reveals markedly enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption that is uncoupled from osteoblastic bone formation. We review the mechanisms by which these factors contribute to the metabolic bone disease of chronic critical illness and suggest potential therapeutics.

AB  - Abstract Postoperative tissue adhesion causes serious complications and suffering in 90% of patients after peritoneum surgery, while commercial anti-adhesion agents cannot completely prevent postoperative peritoneal adhesions. This study demonstrates electrospining of a blended solution of chitosan, poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to fabricate a chitosan-based nanofibrous mat as a postoperative anti-adhesion agent. Rheological studies combined with scanning electron microscopy reveal that the spinnability of the chitosan-PLGA solution could be controlled by adjusting the blend ratio and concentration with average fiber diameter from 634 to 913 nm. Biodegradation of the nanofiber specimens showed accelerated hydrolysis by chitosan. Proliferation of fibroblasts and antimicrobial activity of nanofibers containing chitosan was analyzed. Abdominal defects with cecum adhesion in rats demonstrated that the blend nanofiber mats were effective in preventing tissue adhesion as a barrier (4 weeks after abdominal surgery) by coverage of exfoliated peritoneum and insufficient wound sites at the beginning of the wound healing process. Chitosan?PLGA?PEO blend nanofiber mats will provide a promising key as a postoperative anti-adhesion agent. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal disorder characterized by dystrophin absence, courses with chronic inflammation, sarcolemmal damage, and skeletal muscle degeneration. Among the multiple pathogenic mechanisms proposed for DMD, oxidative stress and inflammation are directly involved in the dystrophic process. Unfortunately, there is no current treatment for DMD, and the inflammatory process is an important target for therapies. Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of melatonin, we investigated whether melatonin treatment may reduce the dystrophic process. Ten DMD patients aged 12.8?±?0.98?yr, were treated with melatonin (60?mg at 21:00?hr plus 10?mg at 09:00?hr), and plasma levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitrites (NOx), interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-?, and plasma markers of muscle injury, were determined at 3, 6 and 9?months of treatment. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were used as controls. The results show a significant increase in LPO, NOx, and cytokine levels in plasma of DMD patients compared with controls. Melatonin administration reduced these values to control levels at 3?months of treatment, decreasing further 9?months later. In parallel, melatonin also reduced plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK; 50%), lactate dehydrogenase (28%), aspartate aminotransferase (28%), alanine aminotransferase (20%), and myoglobin (13%). These findings strongly support the conclusion that melatonin administration significantly reduced the hyperoxidative and inflammatory process in DMD patients, reducing the muscle degenerative process.

AB  - The mechanisms which lead to secondary brain damage following transient ischaemia are incompletely defined. As discussed in this hypothesis article, the events which lead to such damage could encompass (a) a perturbed membrane handling of calcium, leading to a slow, gradual increase in the free cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i), with subsequent calcium overload of mitochondria, (b) a sustained reduction of protein synthesis which, in the long run, deprives cells of enzymes or trophic factors essential to their survival, or (c) the initiation of an inherent program for cell death. Results obtained in ischaemia of brief to intermediate duration demonstrate that the ultimate cell death is heralded by a reduction in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. However, the results fail to demonstrate whether or not such a reduction precedes deterioration of the bioenergetic state which then precipitates cell death. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has recently been shown to dramatically improve the delayed CA1 damage following transient forebrain ischaemia. Since CsA is known to block a deleterious permeability transition (PT) in mitochondria from several tissues in response to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, the results on CsA effects in forebrain ischaemia support a mitochondrial origin for the delayed cell death. Furthermore, comparisons with the effects of CsA and α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in thymocytes and other cells undergoing programmed cell death suggest that delayed neuronal damage occurs by a sequence of events akin to those leading to apoptotic cell death. However, whether cell death is apoptotic or necrotic may depend on the severity of the insult (and its duration). We speculate that the initial ischaemic transient leads to gradual mitochondrial calcium overload, the latter triggering a PT, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Since similar results have been obtained in normoglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemia of intermediate duration, and in animals with preischaemic hyperglycaemia, it seems likely that both increased ischaemia duration and hyperglycaemia accelerate damage to mitochondria in the reperfusion period. Recent results obtained in transient focal ischaemia of 2 h duration demonstrate that the free radical spin trap PBN reduces infarct size, even when given 1 or 3 h after the start of reperfusion, thus providing a second window of therapeutic possibility. A major effect of the drug is exerted on the recovery of energy metabolism of the tissue since it reduces a secondary deterioration in the bioenergetic state, occurring after 2?4 h of reperfusion. At least in part, the spin trap may exert its effect by reducing microvascular dysfunction caused by oedema and to adhesion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, which give rise to an inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, lipid mediators, or free radicals. This contention is supported by the reduction in focal ischaemic damage by antibodies to adhesion molecules for PMNs. However, it has now been found that the secondary deterioration of the bioenergetic state of core and penumbral tissues are mirrored by corresponding changes in the respiratory functions of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that, also in this type of ischaemia, the mitochondria suffer secondary damage. It is conceivable that a significant fraction of malfunctioning mitochondria emanate from microvascular tissue, explaining why antibodies to adhesion molecules mitigate the ischaemic lesions.

AB  - Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common and poses a significant problem in high-risk populations. In most cases, ICD resolves despite continued exposure in a process known as ?hardening?, allowing individuals to continue with their work. Those who cannot clear ICD develop chronic ICD, which is a significant source of emotional, physical, and financial distress for affected individuals. While hardening is well known among labourers and clinicians, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much can be learned from the study of self-healing processes like the hardening phenomenon. This overview briefly documents the pathogenesis of ICD, focuses on the latest advances pertaining to the hardening phenomenon in ICD, and then highlights potential avenues of productive research. A better understanding of the ?hardening? process in the skin will hopefully lead to advances for the treatment of ICD.
