AB  - Objectives To determine whether past history of depression is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, and whether history of gestational diabetes is associated with increased rates of postpartum depression. Research design Data for this case?control study consisted of de-identified chart records for 1439 women who received pregnancy care at a large university hospital between 1998 and 2017. Results A history of depression prior to pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes requiring insulin, although not with subtler degrees of gestational hyperglycemia. Diabetes in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Trauma history was associated with both impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy and postpartum depression. Conclusions Past episodes of depression increase risk for the most severe form of gestational diabetes; however, gestational diabetes does not contribute significantly to risk for postpartum depression. This suggests a unidirectional association, unlike the bidirectional association of diabetes with depression among the general population. History of trauma increases risk for both gestational hyperglycemia and postpartum depression, suggesting important health effects of trauma that may differ measurably from those associated with depression.

AB  - Abstract The intranuclear architectural protein that is termed high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) was recently identified as a potent proinflammatory mediator when present extracellularly. HMGB1 has been demonstrated to be a long-searched-for nuclear danger signal passively released by necrotic, as opposed to apoptotic, cells that will induce inflammation. Furthermore, HMGB1 can also be actively secreted by stimulated macrophages or monocytes in a process requiring acetylation of the molecule, which enables translocation from the nucleus to secretory lysosomes. Subsequenttransport out of the cells depends on a secretion signal mediated by either extracellular lysophophatidyl-choline or ATP. HMGB1 passively released from necrotic cells and HMGB1 actively secreted byinflammatory cells are thus molecularly different. Extracellular HMGB1 acts as a cytokine by signaling via the receptor for advanced glycated end-products and via members of the Toll-like receptor family. The initiated inflammatory responses include the production of multiple cytokines, chemoattraction of certain stem cells, induction of vascular adhesion molecules and impaired function of intestinalepithelial cells. Therapeutic administration of HMGB1 antagonists rescues mice from lethal sepsis, even when initial treatment is delayed for 24?h after the onset of infection, establishing a clinically relevant therapeutic window that is significantly wider than for other known cytokines.

AB  - Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for the induction of primary T-cell responses and may serve as ?biologic adjuvants? in therapeutic protocols. However, given the ?plasticity? of this antigen-presenting cell, it remains unclear which DC type (source, subtype, and stage of differentiation) should be applied clinically. To provide additional insight in this selection process, we have, for the first time, analyzed the in vitro differentiation of CD34+ precursor-derived and monocyte-derived DCs for ultrastructure, phenotype, and function. The ultrastructural intracytoplasmic differentiation of DCs correlated with increasing T-cell stimulatory activity of these cells. ?Early-stage?-DCs proliferate, exhibit high levels of soluble antigen uptake, and moderate T-cell stimulatory capacity, and are characterized by centrally located nuclei and numerous enlarged mitochondria. ?Intermediate-stage?-DCs are enlarged cells with enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity and pronounced cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery. ?Late-stage? (LS)-DCs exhibit a mature secretory cell phenotype and low proliferative index. They express high levels of the HLA-DR, CD40L, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules and CD83, a specific marker of mature DCs, and appear maximally stimulatory to T cells. Ultrastructurally, LS-DCs feature an accentric nucleus, an enlarged cytoplasm, containing numerous secretory storage vesicles, along with a fully developed Golgi complex. LS-DCs exhibited numerous multivesicular and multilaminar structures containing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, consistent with the MIIC (peptide-loading) compartment. In extended studies, cultured CD14+ monocyte-derived DCs displayed a similar, but accelerated, temporal differentiation staging pattern.

PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract The controversy regarding the role of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in the treatment of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning has been re-ignited following the publication of a further randomized controlled trial by Weaver et al., the results of which appear to conflict with our findings. Comparative analysis suggests that the apparent outcome differences may be secondary to the design, analysis and interpretation of the results of the two studies. Following careful analysis of these two papers and further results from a study by Raphael et al on 385 CO-poisoned patients, we can still find no convincing evidence favouring HBO therapy. Pending further research to determine optimal oxygen therapy for CO-poisoning, current therapy should involve stratifying patients for risk of a poor outcome. This stratification may be aided by the evolving availability of biochemical markers of brain injury and the finding that patients with transient loss of consciousness and poor performance on neuropsychological tests of the supervisory attention system are at higher risk of neuropsychological sequelae. We propose that those patients most at risk be admitted and receive more prolonged normobaric oxygen therapy whilst those with more minor CO-poisoning should be provided with normobaric oxygen of no less than 6 h duration and certainly until sign and symptom free.

AB  - Abstract Critical illness, more precisely defined as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), occurs in 20%?50% of patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 1 week in an intensive care unit. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and myopathy (CIM), singly or in combination, occur commonly in these patients and present as limb weakness and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. Critical illness myopathy can be subdivided into thick-filament (myosin) loss, cachectic myopathy, acute rhabdomyolysis, and acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care. SIRS is the predominant underlying factor in CIP and is likely a factor in CIM even though the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids predominate in CIM. Identification and characterization of the polyneuropathy and myopathy depend upon neurological examination, electrophysiological studies, measurement of serum creatine kinase, and, if features suggest a myopathy, muscle biopsy. The information is valuable in deciding treatment and prognosis. Muscle Nerve, 2005

AB  - Abstract LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein with the ability to bind and transfer LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as cell wall compounds of other pathogenic bacteria. This soluble pattern-recognition molecule is present in high concentrations in serum and represents an important defense mechanism of the host. Regulation of the hepatic acute-phase response and its termination are important mechanisms for limiting systemic inflammatory activity of the host organism. We show here that TGF-?1, in a dose-dependent fashion, is able to inhibit LBP transcript accumulation and LBP protein synthesis induced by IL-6, IL-1? and dexamethasone in hepatoma cell lines. These data were confirmed employing primary human hepatocytes, where TGF-?1 also inhibited LBP protein synthesis. We identified and analyzed several Smad-binding sites (Smads are major regulatory elements of TGF-?1) within the LBP promoter, and found that one of them was active. We furthermore identified an AP-1-binding site clearly conferring inhibitory effects of TGF-?1 towards LBP promoter activity, shown by gel shift and promoter mutagenesis experiments. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel intervention strategies for the acute-phase response, sepsis, and septic shock.

AB  - One of the main research areas in biology from the mid-1980s through the 1990s was the elucidation of signaling pathways governing cell responses. These studies brought, among other molecules, the small GTPase Rho to the epicenter. Rho signaling research has since expanded to all areas of biology and medicine. Here, we describe how Rho emerged as a key molecule governing cell morphogenesis and movement, how it was linked to actin reorganization, and how the study of Rho signaling has expanded from cultured cells to whole biological systems. We then give an overview of the current research status of Rho signaling in development, brain, cardiovascular system, immunity and cancer, and discuss the future directions of Rho signaling research, with emphasis on one Rho effector, ROCK*. *The Rho GTPase family. Rho family GTPases have now expanded to contain 20 members. Amino acid sequences of 20 Rho GTPases found in human were aligned and the phylogenetic tree was generated by ClustalW2 software (EMBL-EBI) based on NJ algorithm. The subfamilies of the Rho GTPases are highlighted by the circle and labeled on the right side. Rho cited in this review refers to the original members of Rho subfamily, RhoA, RhoB and RhoC, that are C3 substrates, and, unless specified, not to other members of the Rho subfamily such as Rac, Cdc42, and Rnd.

AB  - Inflammation is a hallmark of virtually all liver diseases, such as liver cancer, fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cholangiopathies. Liver macrophages have been thoroughly studied in human disease and mouse models, unravelling that the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system is more versatile and complex than previously believed. Liver macrophages mainly consist of liver-resident phagocytes, or Kupffer cells (KCs), and bone marrow-derived recruited monocytes. Although both cell populations in the liver demonstrate principal functions of macrophages, such as phagocytosis, danger signal recognition, cytokine release, antigen processing, and the ability to orchestrate immune responses, KCs and recruited monocytes retain characteristic ontogeny markers and remain remarkably distinct on several functional aspects. While KCs dominate the hepatic macrophage pool in homeostasis (?sentinel function?), monocyte-derived macrophages prevail in acute or chronic injury (?emergency response team?), making them an interesting target for novel therapeutic approaches in liver disease. In addition, recent data acquired by unbiased large-scale techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, unraveled a previously unrecognized complexity of human and murine macrophage polarization abilities, far beyond the old dogma of inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Despite tremendous progress, numerous challenges remain in deciphering the full spectrum of macrophage activation and its implication in either promoting liver disease progression or repairing injured liver tissue. Being aware of such heterogeneity in cell origin and function is of crucial importance when studying liver diseases, developing novel therapeutic interventions, defining macrophage-based prognostic biomarkers, or designing clinical trials. Growing knowledge in gene expression modulation and emerging technologies in drug delivery may soon allow shaping macrophage populations toward orchestrating beneficial rather than detrimental inflammatory responses.

AB  - Abstract Iron (Fe) is essential to almost all organisms, as required by cells to satisfy metabolic needs and accomplish specialized functions. Its ability to exchange electrons between different substrates, however, renders it potentially toxic. Fine tune-mechanisms are necessary to maintain Fe homeostasis and, as such, to prevent its participation into the Fenton reaction and generation of oxidative stress. These are particularly important in the context of inflammation/infection, where restricting Fe availability to invading pathogens is one, if not, the main host defense strategy against microbial growth. The ability of Fe to modulate several aspects of the immune response is associated with a number of ?costs? and ?benefits?, some of which have been described in this review. ? 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(6):442?450, 2017
