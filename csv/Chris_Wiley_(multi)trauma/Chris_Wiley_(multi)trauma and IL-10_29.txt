AB  - Abstract The incidence of NHL has increased dramatically since at least the 1950s, and during this timeframe there has been a major increase in the use of blood transfusions, invasive surgical procedures and anesthesia, all of which can impact immune function. We evaluated these factors with NHL risk in a population-based study of 759 cases and 589 frequency-matched controls. Risk factor data were collected during in-person interviews. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for the matching factors. History of transfusion was associated with a 26% higher risk of NHL (95% CI 0.91?1.73), and the elevated risk was specific to transfusions first given 5?29 years before the reference date (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.08?2.62) and transfusions given for a medical condition (OR = 2.09; 95% CI 1.03?4.26). The total number of surgeries and dental procedures (OR = 1.53 for 26+ surgeries compared to 0?6; 95% CI 1.02?2.29) and to a lesser extent the total number of exposures to general or local/regional anesthesia (OR = 1.35 for 24+ times compared to 0?6; 95% CI 0.91?2.02) were positively associated with risk of NHL. Inclusion of transfusion and surgery or transfusion and anesthesia in the same model did not attenuate these associations. All results were broadly consistent for both DLBCL and follicular subtypes. Blood transfusions were associated with NHL risk, but appear to be a marker for underlying medical conditions. Multiple surgical procedures and/or repeated administration of anesthesia have not been previously reported to be associated with risk of NHL and these exposures warrant further evaluation.

AB  - Patients with burn shock can be challenging to resuscitate. Burn shock produces a variety of physiologic derangements: Patients are hypovolemic from volume loss, have a increased systemic vascular resistance, and may have a depressed cardiac output depending on the extent of the thermal injury. Additionally, the burn wound produces a significant inflammatory cascade of events that contributes to the shock state. Fluid resuscitation is foundational for the initial treatment of burn shock. Typical resuscitation is with intravenous lactated Ringer's in accordance with well-established formulas based on burn wound size. In the past century, as therapies to treat thermal injuries were being developed, plasma was the fluid used for burn resuscitation; in fact, plasma was used in World War II and throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Plasma was abandoned because of infectious risks and complications. Despite huge strides in transfusion medicine and the increased safety of blood products, plasma has never been readopted for burn resuscitation. Over the past 15 years, there has been a paradigm shift in trauma resuscitation: Less crystalloid and more blood products are used; this strategy has demonstrated improved outcomes. Plasma is a physiologic fluid that stabilizes the endothelium. The endotheliopathy of trauma has been described and is mitigated by transfusion strategies with a 1:1 ratio of RBCs to plasma. Thermal injury also results in endothelial dysfunction: the endotheliopathy of burns. Plasma is likely a better resuscitation fluid for patients with significant burn wounds because of its capability to restore intravascular volume status and treat the endotheliopathy of burns.

AB  - ABSTRACT There is growing evidence in support of the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Harpagoside, one of the bioactive components of Harpagophytum procumbens (Hp), has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Here we used an in vitro model of inflammation in OA to investigate the potential of harpagoside to suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6 and matrix degrading proteases. We further investigated the likely targets of harpagoside in primary human OA chondrocytes. OA chondrocytes were pre-treated with harpagoside before stimulation with IL-1?. mRNA expression profile of 92 cytokines/chemokines was determined using TaqMan Human Chemokine PCR Array. Expression levels of selected mRNAs were confirmed using TaqMan assays. Protein levels of IL-6 and MMP-13 were assayed by ELISA and immunoblotting. Total protein levels and phosphorylation of signaling proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Cellular localization of IL-6 and c-Fos was performed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. DNA binding activity of c-FOS/AP-1 was determined by ELISA. Harpagoside significantly altered the global chemokine expression profile in IL-1?-stimulated OA chondrocytes. Expression of IL-6 was highly induced by IL-1?, which was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment of OA chondrocytes with harpagoside. Harpagoside did not inhibit the IL-1?-induced activation of NF-?B and C/EBP? transcription factors but suppressed the IL-1?-triggered induction, phosphorylation, and DNA binding activity of c-FOS, one of the main components of AP-1 transcription factors. Further, harpagoside significantly inhibited the expression of MMP-13 in OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. siRNA-mediated knockdown of IL-6 resulted in suppressed expression and secretion of MMP-13 directly linking the role of IL-6 with MMP-13 expression. Taken together, the present study suggests that harpagoside exerts a significant anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the inflammatory stimuli mediated by suppressing c-FOS/AP-1 activity in OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Polymer monolith materials of 2?mm thickness with open interconnected pores were obtained by a visible light induced radical polymerization of carbonate- or phthalate containing dimethacrylate in the presence of aliphatic alcohols (60 to 70 wt %) as porogenic additives. Obtained materials absorb water easily and reveal a specific surface area of 3.1 to 21.5?m2?g?1 and a porosity of 55?72%. According SEM data the porous monoliths consist of polymer particles (size up to 1??m) that form 3D structures with a pore size up to 5??m for poly(carbonatedimethacrylate) and tens of microns for phthalate-containing polydimethacrylates. Mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow (MSC-BM) of the pig were picked out and characterized. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tests on polymers obtained have shown their non-cytotoxicity. MSC-BMs spread out well on the polymeric samples and retained their viability and typical morphology during 7?days. Adhesion and viability of MSCs on the surface of materials were detected by calcein staining. The data obtained indicate that the porous polymers derived from dimethacrylates might be promising for construction of plastics for bone grafting.

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.
