Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.

AB  - Abstract In the epidermal compartment of skin, keratinocytes (KC), Langerhans cells (LC), and their soluble products, i.e. cytokines, constitute a unique immunologic microenvironment. KC participate in cutaneous immune responses by producing various cytokines. LC, a member of the dendritic cell (DC) family, represent the professional antigen-presenting cells in the epidermis. Although it has been demonstrated that migration of LC from skin to lymph nodes is a critical step for the antigen presentation, molecular mechanisms for such an event remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that cytokines are able to modulate LC/DC migration. There is accumulating evidence that proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor a promote LC emigration from the skin, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is a counter-regulator. LC/DC express chemokine receptors. Chemokines generated from lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph node cells play a role in the directional migration of LC/DC into lymph nodes. This article reviews current studies on the role of cytokines in LC/DC migration. J. Leukoc. Biol. 66: 33?39; 1999.

AB  - Summary Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely well equipped antigen (Ag)-presenting cells. Their classic function was thought to be that of potent initiators of innate and adaptive immunity to infectious organisms and other Ags (including transplanted organs). Evidence has emerged, however, that DCs have a central and crucial role in determining the fate of immune responses toward either immunity or tolerance. This dichotomous function of DCs, coupled with their remarkable plasticity, renders them attractive therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In transplantation, much recent work has focused on the ability of DCs to silence immune reactivity in an Ag-specific manner in the hope of preventing rejection and diminishing reliance on potentially harmful immunosuppressive agents. Experimental strategies have included in vivo targeting of DCs, as well as ex vivo generation of regulatory (or tolerogenic) DCs with subsequent reinfusion (i.e. cell therapy). Different approaches to ?program? DC toward tolerogenic properties include genetic (transgene insertion), biologic (differential culture conditions, anti-inflammatory cytokine exposure) and pharmacologic manipulation. Recent data suggest a promising role for pharmacologic treatment as a means of generating potent regulatory DCs and have further stimulated speculation regarding their potential clinical application. Herein, we discuss evidence that the potential of regulatory DC therapy is considerable and that there are compelling reasons to evaluate it in the setting of organ transplantation in the near future.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the perioperative systemic immunity of laparoscopy-assisted and open radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proven by endoscopy and biopsy were eligible, while patients with preoperative staging of T4, N2?3, or M1 were excluded. Eligible patients willing to undertake laparoscopic surgery in the consecutive cohort were assigned to the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) group, while concurrent patients were assigned to the conventional open gastrectomy (OG) group. All operations were performed with the intention of radical resection. Various immunological parameters were tested in peripheral venous blood collected at preoperative 1st day and postoperative 2nd day (POD2) and 7th day (POD7). SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty patients were included, 15 each in the LAG and OG groups. The general characteristics and short-term outcomes (harvested lymph nodes number, hospital stay, complications, and mortality rate) of the two groups were comparable, but the operation time was significantly longer in LAG (P = 0.001). Moreover, intergroup comparisons indicated no significant differences between the groups in levels of neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, interleukin-6, or interleukin-10 at any time point (P?>?0.05). However, there was a gradual decrease in natural killer cell count in the LAG group up to POD7 (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The changes in systemic immunity markers were comparable between laparoscopy-assisted and open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. However, there was a trend of suppression of natural killer cells in the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy group.

AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.

AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - Abstract Background: Proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be elevated in individuals experiencing chronic stress as well as in those with major depressive disorder. Much less is known about cytokines in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD). We hypothesized that PD and PTSD would be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. Method: We utilized Luminex technology to examine 20 cytokines and chemokines in serum from 48 well-characterized individuals with a primary DSM-IV PD or PTSD diagnosis, and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We conservatively employed a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (α=.05/20=.0025). Results: Individuals with primary PTSD or PD had significantly elevated median peripheral cytokine levels for 18 of 20 different cytokines compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (all P<.0025). To assess for the presence of a generalized proinflammatory state, we also examined the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of at least six of nine common proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, and IFN-α). For men and women, 87% of anxiety patients had six or more detectable levels of these proinflammatory cytokines, compared with only 25% of controls (Fisher's Exact Test (FET) P=.000). Confirmatory analysis of the subset of individuals without current psychiatric medication use or comorbid depression was of comparable significance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a generalized inflammatory state may be present in individuals with PD or PTSD. Depression and Anxiety, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aging is associated with a decline of performance leading to reduced reproductive output and survival. While the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging has attracted considerable attention, the molecular/physiological functions underlying the early-life benefits/late-life costs paradigm remain elusive. We tested the hypothesis that while early activation of the inflammatory response confers benefits in terms of protection against infection, it also incurs costs in terms of reduced reproductive output at old age and shortened longevity. We infected mice with the malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii and increased the inflammatory response using an anti-IL-10 receptor antibody treatment. We quantified the benefits and costs of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of the infection and at old age. In agreement with the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, the inflammatory response provided an early-life benefit, since infected mice that were treated with anti-IL-10 receptor antibodies had reduced parasite density and anemia. However, at old age, mice in all treatment groups had similar levels of C-reactive protein, reproductive output, survival rate, and lifespan. Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that the benefits of a robust response to malaria infection in early life incur longer term fitness costs.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients a blunt chest trauma is an important trigger of the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response. There is clinical evidence that fracture healing is delayed in such patients, however, experimental data are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the influence of a thoracic trauma on fracture healing in a rat model. Male Wistar rats received either a blunt chest trauma combined with a femur osteotomy or an isolated osteotomy. A more rigid or a more flexible external fixator was used for fracture stabilization to analyze whether the thoracic trauma influences regular healing and mechanically induced delayed bone healing differently. The blunt chest trauma induced a significant increase of IL-6 serum levels after 6 and 24?h, suggesting the induction of a systemic inflammation, whereas the isolated fracture had no effect. Under a more rigid fixation the thoracic trauma considerably impaired fracture healing after 35 days, reflected by a significantly reduced flexural rigidity (three-point-bending test), as well as a significantly diminished callus volume, moment of inertia, and relative bone surface (µCT analysis). In confirming the clinical evidence, this study reports for the first time that a blunt chest trauma considerably impaired bone healing, possibly via the interaction of the induced systemic inflammation with local inflammatory processes. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic osteolytic disease that shares pathogenic inflammatory features with other conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation. A hallmark of PD is inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. Myeloid cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages (Mac), are essential players in PD by control of gingival biofilm pathogenicity, activation of adaptive immunity, as well as nonresolving inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Despite mounting evidence of significant innate immune implications to PD progression and healing after therapy, myeloid cell markers and targets for immune modulation have not been validated for clinical use. The remarkable plasticity of monocytes/Mac in response to local activation factors enables these cells to play central roles in inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis and provides opportunities for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery for management of chronic inflammatory conditions, including osteolytic diseases such as PD and arthritis. Along a wide spectrum of activation states ranging from proinflammatory to pro-resolving, Macs respond to environmental changes in a site-specific manner in virtually all tissues. This review summarizes the existing evidence on Mac immunomodulation therapies for osteolytic diseases in the broader context of conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation, and discusses osteoimmune implications of Macs in PD.

AB  - Abstract:? Melatonin reportedly exerts beneficial effects to attenuate multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in septic shock. Heatstroke resembles septic shock in many aspects. Thus, this study was performed on the anesthetized rats by using heat exposure to induce heatstroke-associated MODS. We evaluated the effect of melatonin, a versatile molecule synthesized in the pineal gland and in many organs, in heatstroke rats and showed that melatonin (0.2?5.0?mg/kg of body weight, i.v., immediately after the start of heat stress) significantly (i) attenuated hyperthermia, hypotension and hypothalamic ischemia and hypoxia, (ii) reduced plasma index of the toxic oxidizing radicals like nitric oxide metabolites and hydroxyl radicals, (iii) diminished plasma index of hepatic and renal dysfunction like creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase, (iv) attenuated plasma systemic inflammation response molecules like soluble intercellular and lesion molecule-1, E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1?, and IL-6, (v) promoted plasma levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, (vi) reduced an index of infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the lung like myeloperoxidase activity, and (vii) promoted the survival time to fourfold compared with the heatstroke alone group. Thus, melatonin could be a novel agent for the treatment of heatstroke animals or patients in the early stage.

AB  - Background Postoperative inflammation is a common consequence of surgery and the ensuing stress response. Local anesthetics have anti-inflammatory properties. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if LA administrated intraperitoneally perioperatively might inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines. Methods This was a, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrial.gov reg no: NCT02256228) in patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. Patients were randomized to receive: intraperitoneal ropivacaine (Group IPLA) or saline (Group P) perioperatively. Except for study drug, patients were treated similarly. At the end of surgery, a multi-port catheter was inserted intraperitoneally, and ropivacaine 2 mg/mL or 0.9% saline, 10 mL was injected intermittently every other hour during 72 hours postoperatively. Systemic expression of cytokines and plasma ropivacaine were determined before and 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. Stress response was measured by serum glucose, cortisol, and insulin. Results Forty patients were recruited, 20 in each group. There was no statistical significant difference in systemic cytokine between the groups at any time point. Serum cortisol was significantly lower in the IPLA group at 6 hours, median 103 nmol/L (IQR 53-250) compared to placebo, median 440 nmol/L (IQR 115-885), P = 0.023. Serum glucose and insulin were similar between the groups. Total and free serum concentrations of ropivacaine were well below toxic concentrations. Conclusion In this small study, perioperative intraperitoneal ropivacaine did not reduce the systemic inflammatory response associated with major abdominal surgery. Total and free ropivacaine concentrations were below known toxic concentrations in humans.

AB  - Aim To analyze the prognostic impact of short-term changes in the intensity of delirium in association or not with sepsis. We also aimed to analyze if s100B, a serum protein derived from astrocytes related to cerebral damage, could be a marker of delirium or sepsis. Methods We included 47 patients with acute delirium and sepsis, 36 with delirium and no evidence of infection, and 36 patients with sepsis without delirium. The diagnosis of delirium was established by the Confusion Assessment Method. To evaluate delirium, we recorded the following characteristics on the first and third day after admission: level of consciousness, orientation, attention, hallucinations, psychomotor activity, language and disorganized thinking. Results In 53 patients, delirium improved during hospitalization with 3.8% of mortality, whereas in the 30 patients in which delirium did not improve or worsened, 50% died during hospitalization. The improvement on the third day of consciousness, orientation, attention and disorganized thinking was related to a better long-term survival. s100B and inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and interferon-? were increased in patients with sepsis and confusion when compared with control participants; furthermore, s100B, interleukin-6 and interferon-? were increased in septic patients without confusion, but also in delirious patients without sepsis. Conclusions The main factor related to mortality was the recovery from delirium during hospitalization. We found increased s100B serum levels in patients with delirium, but also in septic patients without delirium. This increase was not related to mortality. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 1161?1167.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are proteins or glycoproteins which are produced by cells and act on other cells that display on their surface specific cytokine receptors. Cytokines are used by cells to communicate. Within a determined sequence, these mediators lead the responding cells to modify their function (e.g., secretion, proliferation, induction, inhibition, enhanced or reduced function, migration, apoptosis). Despite cytokines having mainly been discovered by immunologists as a product of cells of leukocyte lineage, they are now recognized as elements of a universal language used by most cells of any other lineage. Accordingly, they are essential for many events through life, such as reproductive tissue remodeling, embryogenesis, steady-state and adaptive hematopoiesis, surveillance and maintenance of tissue structure, functions of the immune system, inflammation, cell survival, and cell death. Cytokines also allow a dialog with the central nervous system, and some may modify different behaviors (e.g., fever, anorexia, sleep). Cytokines usually act within their vicinity, but they can also act via an endocrine fashion. Their production is tightly controlled within a complex network of positive and negative loops. They are a prerequisite for the control of infection by invasive microorganisms, though their exacerbated production may be deleterious at local or systemic levels. Their ?half-angel/half-devil? aspect has rendered cytokines difficult to use for therapeutic purposes, though some recombinant cytokines or cytokine-neutralizing strategies have been used successfully in different pathological conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a fatal thrombohemorrhagic disorder. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that have tremendous therapeutic effect. Our aim was to explore whether the immune mechanisms were associated with BMSCs-afforded protection against DIC. We generated a rat model of DIC by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 3?mg/kg) injection via the tail vein. In the treatment group, rats were pre-treated with 1???l03, 1???l04, 1???l05, and 1???l06 allogeneic BMSCs before LPS injection. Blood sample was withdrawn from the abdominal aorta at 0 (before), 4, and 8?h after LPS injection and used for biochemical analyses. After experiments, the mice were sacrificed and their organs were harvested and observed by H&E and PTAH staining. Continuous infusion of LPS into the rats gradually impaired the hemostatic parameters and damaged organ functions. However, pre-treatment with BMSCs dose-dependently improved the hemostatic parameters. Meanwhile, the treatment significantly suppressed the fibrin microthrombi formation and alleviated liver, heart, lung, and renal injuries. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that BMSCs pre-treatment inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of CD3+CD8+ T cells and CD3+/CD161a+ NKT cells in the peripheral blood. BMSCs pre-treatment reversed the upregualtion of the B-cell population and the percentage of CD43+/CD172a+ monocytes in the DIC models. Finally, BMSCs pre-treatment decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-? (IFN-?), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and increased the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in LPS-induced DIC models. Pre-treatment with BMSCs can reduce coagulation and alleviate organ dysfunction via peripheral immune responses in LPS-induced DIC rat model. J. Cell.
