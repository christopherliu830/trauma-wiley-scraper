AB  - Summary:? The caspase family of cysteine proteases becomes activated in response to diverse cellular insults and coordinates apoptosis through proteolysis of hundreds of cellular substrates. Cytotoxic lymphocytes are adept at promoting apoptosis of virally infected or transformed cells through delivery of cytotoxic enzymes, such as granzyme B, into target cells via the granule exocytosis pathway. Granzyme B promotes apoptosis of target cells through direct processing of certain caspases, which leads to their autoactivation. Granzyme B can also activate caspases indirectly through proteolysis of Bid, a protein that promotes mitochondrial permeabilization and consequent activation of the apoptosome pathway to caspase activation. Evidence also indicates that granzyme B may contribute to antiviral immunity by directly suppressing viral replication through direct proteolysis of viral proteins that are essential for pathogenicity. Recent reports also suggest that granzyme B may have additional non-cytotoxic roles under certain circumstances and may also function in the extracellular space. Here, we discuss the cytotoxic and putative non-cytotoxic functions of granzyme B within the immune system.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract Aim Over the past several decades, there has been a growing research interest in the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This review aims to summarize evidence in support of this relationship, to discuss biological mechanisms that might explain it, and to explore the translational impact by examining evidence from trials of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of schizophrenia. Methods This narrative review of the literature summarizes evidence from observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and to discuss associated implications for treatment. Results Epidemiological evidence and animal models support a hypothesis of maternal immune activation during pregnancy, which increases the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. Several biomarker studies have found associations between classical pro-inflammatory cytokines and schizophrenia. The precise biological mechanisms by which inflammatory processes might contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain unclear, but likely include the actions of microglia and the complement system. Importantly, several trials provide evidence that certain anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents show beneficial effects in the treatment of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is a need for further precision-focused basic science and translational research. Conclusions Increasing our understanding of the role of inflammation in schizophrenia will enable novel opportunities for therapeutic and preventative interventions that are informed by the underlying pathogenesis of this complex disorder.

AB  - Dental tissue infection results in immune and inflammatory responses mediated by molecular and cellular events that, if unchecked, result in tissue breakdown. The tooth, like other tissues and organs within the body, will attempt to repair and regenerate its own hard and soft tissues given the appropriate conditions and environment. However, unchecked infection and inflammation will have a significant impact on the natural regenerative responses of the dental tissues. Thus far, there have been limited studies addressing the inter-relationship between these two processes, which are clearly linked by molecular and cellular events. Indeed, locally derived growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all sequestrated within the dental tissue extracellular matrix and are also expressed by pulpal cells, immune cells, and/or necrotic host tissue, will have considerable impact on the cellular events within the tissue. In addition to the molecular signaling, there will be important cellular interactions that will occur as stem cells, resident or recruited to the pulp, have known immuno-modulatory activity with significant implications for regenerative events. In this review, we aim to explore how the pulpal tissue responds to the invading bacteria and the signaling mechanisms that are now being described and are important in regulating both the immune/inflammatory and regenerative responses.

Effect of chondroitin sulphate on the synovial membrane -? Effect of chondroitin sulphate on subchondral bone ?? Human use of chondroitin sulphate -? Chondrotin sulphate in osteoarthritis -? Chondrotin sulphate in psoriasis -? Chondrotin sulphate in atherosclerosis -? Chondroitin sulphate in IBD -? Chondroitin sulphate in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) -? Other autoimmune diseases that may benefit from chondroitin sulphate ?? Conclusions Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is a natural glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix and is formed by the 1?3 linkage of D-glucuronic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine. In chondrocytes, CS diminishes interleukin-1 p (IL-1p)-induced increases in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and decreases nuclear factor-KB (NF-kB) nuclear translocation and as a consequence, reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 p and TNF-a, and pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2). The mechanism of action of CS explains its beneficial effect on the cartilage, synovial membrane and subchondral bone. On the other hand, in vivo, CS given orally prevents hepatic NF-kB nuclear translocation, suggesting that systemic CS may elicit an anti-inflammatory effect in many tissues besides the articulation. There is preliminary evidence showing that in human beings, CS may be of benefit in other diseases where inflammation is an essential marker, such as psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The review of the literature suggest that CS might also be of interest for the treatment of other diseases with an inflammatory and/or autoimmune character, such as inflammatory bowel disease, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system and stroke, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 119, 1052?1063. Abstract Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) improve functional outcome in a number of disease models through suppression of inflammation. However, their effects on neuroinflammation are unknown. In this study, we show that MSCs suppress endotoxin-induced glial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated OHSCs activated MSCs to increase the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and produce prostaglandin E2. MSC-derived prostaglandin E2, then suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the OHSCs. Together, the results suggest the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of MSCs in models of disease and support earlier observations that MSCs may offer a therapy for neuroinflammation produced by trauma or disease.

AB  - Summary Mental illness exerts a major burden on human health, yet evidence-based treatments are rudimentary due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathologies. Clinical studies point to roles for the immune system in psychiatric diseases, while basic science has revealed that the brain has an active and multi-cellular resident immune system that interacts with peripheral immunity and impacts behavior. In this perspective, we highlight evidence of immune involvement in human psychiatric disease and review data from animal models that link immune signaling to neuronal function and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework for linking advances in basic neuroimmunology to their potential relevance for psychiatric diseases, based on the subtypes of immune responses defined in peripheral tissues. Our goal is to identify novel areas of focus for future basic and translational studies that may reveal the potential of the immune system for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses
