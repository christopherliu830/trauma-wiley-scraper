AB  - Abstract The sex and gender identity disorders of the DSM are reviewed. The major male and female sexual dysfunctions, concerns, and problems are described, including assessment, diagnostic considerations, and causes of these difficulties. Controversies surrounding how to conceptualize sexual problems are discussed, as are theoretical and practical problems of classification in the DSM. Psychogenic, interpersonal, psychosocial, and organic factors in the development of the sexual dysfunctions are reviewed. Such distinctions are more accurate in theory than in practice, where sexual problems are typically multi-determined. Sexual problems tend to be intertwined, as when difficulties with arousal and lubrication lead to pain on intercourse as well as lack of orgasm. The importance of appreciating the context in which clients/patients, their partners, and clinicians come to define sexual and gender difficulties as pathological is underscored for each of the sexual and gender problems. The sex script defining ?normal? sexuality and gender provides the social backdrop for viewing and diagnosing other forms of sexual and gender expression as pathological. A variety of other sexual problems, including sexual disappointment, the pain of affairs, infertility, and are not listed in the DSM but may lead to patients presenting in clinicians' offices. Controversies surrounding the paraphilias, the need to distinguish between normophilic and paraphilic interactions, and the implications of such distinctions are discussed. Gender identity disorders are outlined, including the controversies surrounding its inclusion and revision process in the DSM, and the emergence of a transgender community's reaction to diagnostic labeling.

AB  - Abstract ?Decoy? oligonucleotides can be used as gene-specific nuclear factor (NF-?B) inhibitors to regulate gene expression. We applied two different decoy oligonucleotides that contained the NF-?B binding consensus sequences present in the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-?B and Bcl-x promoter into 7-day-old (P7) rat lateral ventricles before hypoxia/ischemia (HI) and compared their effects on gene expression in hippocampi to saline-treated, scrambled decoy-treated, or untreated hippocampi exposed to HI. Left hippocampi were collected at 12 hr after HI. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that the two decoy treatments had different effects on NF-?B binding to the IgG-?B and Bcl-x promoter-specific consensus sequences, respectively. We assessed the decoys' effects on gene expression 12 hr after HI using ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) and Affymetrix DNA microarrays. RPAs showed that both decoys significantly decreased interleukin (IL)-1α mRNA levels but had no impact on IL-1?, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA levels. IgG-?B decoys significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and TNF-? mRNA levels compared to minimal changes after treatment with Bcl-x decoys. DNA microarray analyses showed that Bcl-x decoy treatment significantly decreased Bcl-xL mRNA levels. The decreased Bcl-xL mRNA levels after Bcl-x decoy treatment was confirmed by RPA analysis. DNA microarray data also indicated that several other genes were affected by both decoys. Our results suggest that different NF-?B decoy treatments could differentially regulate transcriptional responses to central nervous system trauma. Careful design of decoy sequences, however, is essential to acquire selective effects on cell death outcome. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary The 4th Haemophilia Global Summit was held in Potsdam, Germany, in September 2013 and brought together an international faculty of haemophilia experts and delegates from multidisciplinary backgrounds. The programme was designed by an independent Scientific Steering Committee of haemophilia experts and explored global perspectives in haemophilia care, discussing practical approaches to the optimal management of haemophilia now and in the future. The topics outlined in this supplement were selected by the Scientific Steering Committee for their relevance and potential to influence haemophilia care globally. In this supplement from the meeting, Jan Astermark reviews current understanding of risk factors for the development of inhibitory antibodies and discusses whether this risk can be modulated and minimized. Factors key to the improvement of joint health in people with haemophilia are explored, with Carlo Martinoli and Víctor Jiménez-Yuste discussing the utility of ultrasound for the early detection of haemophilic arthropathy. Other aspects of care necessary for the prevention and management of joint disease in people with haemophilia are outlined by Thomas Hilberg and Sébastian Lobet, who highlight the therapeutic benefits of physiotherapy and sports therapy. Riitta Lassila and Carlo-Federico Perno describe current knowledge surrounding the risk of transmission of infectious agents via clotting factor concentrates. Finally, different types of extended half-life technology are evaluated by Mike Laffan, with a focus on the practicalities and challenges associated with these products.

AB  - Abstract We report a case of arsenic keratosis and pigmentation accompained by multiple Bowen's disease and genitourinary cancer in a 64-year-old man. He was a psoriasis patient with a history of herbal medication for about thirty years. He showed multiple hyperkeratotic plaques on the bilateral palms, soles, and multiple, brownish, scaly, elevated papules on the back in addition to diffuse hyperpigmentation. Biopsy confirmed arsenic keratosis and Bowen's disease. Transitional cell carcinoma was also detected on his ureter and bladder during follow-up. The skin lesions were treated with topical 5-fluorouracil, etretinate, and excision with improvement.

AB  - Abstract Models of sepsis have been instructive in understanding the sequence of events in animals and, to an extent, in humans with sepsis. Events developing early in sepsis suggest that a hyperinflammatory state exists, accompanied by a buildup of oxidants in tissues reflective of a redox imbalance. Development of immunosuppression and degraded innate and adaptive immune responses are well-established complications of sepsis. In addition, there is robust activation of the complement system, which contributes to the harmful effects of sepsis. These events appear to be associated with development of multiorgan failure. The relevance of animal models of sepsis to human sepsis and the failure of human clinical trials are discussed, together with suggestions as to how clinical trial design might be improved.

AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Inspired by the physiological events of the ?wound healing cascade?, the integration of biomaterials and growth factors is generally accepted as an emerging and powerful strategy for bone regenerative therapy. As a type of biological mediator, growth factors play a key role in functional bone regeneration. In this review, recent progress in the enhancement of bone-related growth factors via a biomaterial strategy will be discussed. Two main reinforcing mechanisms, temporal regulation and efficacy manipulation, are described in detail, highlighting the potential capability of biomaterials to harness the interactions between growth factors and specific cells. The effects of biomaterials for promoting bone formation via growth factor-mediated osteogenesis are further elucidated. Finally, an outlook of the prospects in terms of superior communication among growth factors, cells, and biomaterials in the microenvironment is presented, which might provide new directions for the design of medical devices for bone regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Following spinal cord injury (SCI), the population of mature oligodendrocytes undergoes substantial cell death; promoting their preservation and replacement is a viable strategy for preserving axonal integrity and white matter repair in the injured spinal cord. Dramatic upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) is shown to pose an obstacle to endogenous repair processes, and targeting CSPGs improves functional recovery after SCI. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of CSPGs remain largely undefined. Modulation of CSPGs specific signaling receptors, leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), and protein tyrosine phosphatase-sigma (PTPσ) allows us to uncover the role and mechanisms of CSPGs in regulating oligodendrocytes in SCI. Here, utilizing specific functionally blocking peptides in a clinically relevant model of contusive/compressive SCI in the rat, we demonstrate that inhibition of PTPσ and LAR receptors promotes oligodendrogenesis by endogenous precursor cells, attenuates caspase 3-mediated cell death in mature oligodendrocytes, and preserves myelin. In parallel in vitro systems, we have unraveled that CSPGs directly induce apoptosis in populations of neural precursor cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and limit their ability for oligodendrocyte differentiation, maturation, and myelination. These negative effects of CSPGs are mediated through the activation of both LAR and PTPσ receptors and the downstream Rho/ROCK pathway. Thus, we have identified a novel inhibitory role for PTPσ and LAR in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation and apoptosis in the injured adult spinal cord and a new feasible therapeutic strategy for optimizing endogenous cell replacement following SCI.
