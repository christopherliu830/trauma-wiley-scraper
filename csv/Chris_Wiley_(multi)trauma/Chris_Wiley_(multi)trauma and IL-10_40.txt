AB  - BloodSafe is a joint initiative between the South Australian (SA) Department of Health, Australian Red Cross Blood Service, hospitals and transfusion service providers. It has successfully established quality assurance programs to improve the safety and quality of blood management practice within the SA health system. BloodSafe began as a project in September of 2002 initially with 12?months funding from the Safety and Quality Council. Four Transfusion Nurse Consultants were appointed across five major metropolitan teaching hospitals. Audit of practice within these hospitals demonstrated three major problem areas- transfusion specimen collection, the decision to transfuse and administration of blood. A further 12?months funding was granted including extension of the project to include a Nurse Educator for the state to introduce initiatives into country and private hospitals. Reaudit of practice after interventions and education demonstrated that the Transfusion Nurse Consultants were effective change agents. In particular red cell use outside the NHMRC/ASBT guidelines fell from 18% to 4%(p?<?0.01) in stable adult orthopaedic patients audited. A number of other important aspects of transfusion practice also showed significant improvement including documentation, consent and administration. Recurrent funding for BloodSafe Transfusion Nurse Consultants was granted by the SA Department of Health from July 2004. Factors contributing to the success of BloodSafe include a multidisciplinary team, Transfusion Nurses of clinical nurse consultant level, demonstration of a clear need for the initiatives, evidence of successful practice improvement, statewide collaboration and interventions, benchmarking across hospitals, and impartiality of the BloodSafe name with acceptance by stakeholders.

AB  - Focus on the risks of viral transmission via transfusion has pushed recognition of other transfusion risks to the background over the last several decades. With reduction in the risks of HCV and HIV to very low levels (well less than 1/million units), productive attention can now be directed toward other risks. Bacterial contamination of platelets represents the largest morbidity and mortality risk faced by a platelet recipient, and the risk of dieing due to a contaminated unit is at least 10- if not 100-times greater than the chance of HIV transmission. Approximately 1 in every 1?4,000 units of platelets can be shown to contain bacteria, and the frequency of fatality due to port-transfusion sepsis is 14/million units transfused. Bacterial contamination is often not recognized clinically, however, because of the situation of the patient. A variety of techniques to limit and detect bacterial contamination are available for implementation. Culturing is used most widely. Checking pH, glucose concentration or preservation of swirling are simple and inexpensive techniques but suffer from lack of sensitivity. The development of immunologic techniques that can be accomplished rapidly may shift the testing to immediately before issuance for transfusion, a time at which any contamination would be easier to detect because of growth during the storage period. Not only will detection techniques improve transfusion recipient safety, but they can lead to cost-savings through extension of the platelet storage period as has already been implemented in several European countries.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been implicated in certain adverse patient outcomes. Immunomodulation may play a central role. The aim of this project was to determine the ability of supernatants and cellular fractions of RBC concentrates to modulate the immune response of allogeneic mononuclear cells (MNCs), particularly monocytes. Non-leucocytereduced, buffy-coat-depleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected on day 1 and fortnightly until product expiry, and centrifuged to obtain supernatant and cellular fractions. On the?day of RBC sample collection, whole blood (WB) and MNCs were prepared from ABO-compatible allogeneic donors. Induction of monocyte CD11b and CD54 was determined by flow cytometry by incubating allogeneic WB with RBC supernatants or cellular fractions, followed by staining with fl uorescently-labelled anti-CD14, anti-CD11b and anti-CD54. Cytokine release was determined by incubating MNCs with RBC supernatants and culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA for IL-8, TNFalpha; and IL-10. Supernatant and cellular fraction from non-leucocyte-reduced RBC concentrates induced expression of CD11b and CD54 on allogeneic monocytes. Buffy-coatdepleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates had minimal effect on monocyte CD11b or CD54 expression. Cytokine release from MNCs incubated with RBC supernatant suggested a tenuous balance between proinflammatory (IL-8 and TNF alpha;) and immunosuppressive (IL-10) responses. All RBC product types induced cytokine release from MNCs. The results from this study indicate that stored RBC concentrates can modulate allogeneic MNCs. Both proinflammatory and immunosuppressive responses were evident. Leucocytes in RBC concentrates appear to favour a proinflammatory response by MNCs.

AB  - Abstract Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is no longer used in kidney transplant recipients. However, there is no consensus regarding whether or not to ligate a well-functioning AVF after successful kidney transplantation, particularly in patients with well and stably functioning kidney transplants. Most AVFs without complications are left in situ and more than one-third of native AVFs close spontaneously. The currently accepted policy toward thrombosed AVFs is retention within the patient's extremity without treatment. These thrombosed AVFs seldom cause serious problems. However, when combined with aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal vein adjacent to the arterial anastomotic area, the AVF could act as the source of distal arterial emboli. This is very similar clinical scenario to that observed in embolization from a peripheral arterial aneurysm. Here we describe a case report of upper extremity ischemia following massage of a thrombosed aneurysmal AVF. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of catheter-directed thromboaspiration, thrombolysis, and surgical repair of the thrombosed AVF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of upper extremity embolism after massage of a thrombosed aneurysmal AVF involving this combined treatment.

AB  - Stage 1 of routine antenatal RhD immunoglobulin prophylaxis was recommended in late 2002, for RhD negative women having their first child. This was as a result of a 1999 National Health Medical Research Council [NHMRC] recommendation as best practice to further reduce the incidence of HDN due to anti-D. Revised guidelines were released in 2003 by the National Blood Authority with NHMRC endorsement. It is likely that stage 2 [for all pregnancies in RhD negative women] will be in place by early 2005. The introduction of antenatal prophylaxis has raised a number of issues for pathology laboratories: a)?frequency of antenatal testing within this new program b)?laboratory protocols where the presence of RhD immunoglobulin is confirmed or suspected c)?reporting formats in such circumstances d)?inventory and supply issues including product traceability e)?testing of maternal and cord samples at delivery in women who have received antenatal prophylaxis The Australian & New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion released revised antenatal testing guidelines in early 2004 to assist laboratories in dealing with some of these issues. Collaboration with ARCBS, CSL and RANZCOG has also resulted in useful information being made available covering other aspects of this new initiative. The presentation will explore some of the above issues leading to more general discussion during the symposium.

AB  - The prophylactic use of rhesus immunoglobulin has led to a significant reduction in the incidence of haemolytic disease of the newborn secondary to rhesus alloimmunisation, which now only occurs in 1 in 1000 live births. Despite prophylaxis, antibodies to the D antigen are still the commonest cause of rhesus isoimmunisation. Although now a rare pregnancy disorder rhesus isoimmunisation continues to be a challenging obstetric complication and while the face of this disease has undergone many changes over recent years, the principles of management remain unchanged. Pregnancies at risk of the disease are identified by past obstetric history and the antenatal detection of red cell antibodies with serial measurement of antibody levels. In cases of heterozygous paternity the real risk of fetal disease can be determined using new DNA techniques to determine the fetal blood cell type with tissue obtained from amniocentesis, and now by molecular analysis of circulating fetal DNA in the maternal plasma and serum. Sensitised pregnancies are monitored for the development of fetal anaemia. Since its introduction into clinical practise by Liley over 40?years ago, spectral analysis of amniotic fluid bilirubin as an indirect measure of fetal haemolysis has been the primary method of screening for fetal anaemia. Noninvasive evaluation is now possible with the use of doppler ultrasound to detect changes to fetal blood flow secondary to fetal anaemia, most commonly using the middle cerebral artery, and ultrasound evaluation of fetal haemopoetic organs and for the diagnosis of hydrops. Ultrasound guided intrauterine transfusion of red blood cells remains the treatment for the severely affected fetus. Perinatal survival rates in the non hydropic fetus are reported at over 90% and long term studies have revealed normal neurological outcomes for more than 90% cases.

AB  - Training doctors in transfusion medicine needs a new perspective because the existing knowledge based structure has neither attracted enough doctors nor made the system safer. Safety: Intra-hospital transfusion systems, where most transfusions are delivered by overworked, under skilled PGY1s or PGY2s or nurses, are usually inherently unstable and unsafe. The system itself has to be designed to protect the patient in real hospital life situations. That means competency based training of all staff connected with transfusion and fail safe system design with continuous quality review. Knowledge: The range of knowledge required in a blood centre underscores the difficulty of pigeon holing transfusion medicine in a particular College. More fundamentally, the issue is about what practical benefit the knowledge brings to its owner in terms of jobs or recognition. It includes ?Health assessment of well donors ?Relevant viruses, bacteria and prions, ?Immunology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels and the associated clinical syndromes and their management ?Haematology at molecular, cellular, process and tissue levels of inflammation and coagulation and the congenital anaemias ?Cytotoxic, immunological or inflammatory effects of chemotherapy and transplantation in malignant haematology ?Resuscitation and immunological or inflammatory conditions in medicine & surgery, with implications for blood products ?Public health particularly for management of public safety, regulatory systems and health economics Transfusion knowledge is broad and often task specific. Developing appropriate task specific experts requires training and research publications to develop credibility and professional networks.

AB  - The use of autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) has increased in Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma. A patient, who had a relapse of Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma after a remission of 13?years, required an autologous stem cell transplant. However, he was found to have cold agglutinins. The problem was raised as to whether or not he could have stem cells collected and if they would survive following freezing and storage. A literature search was undertaken and very little information found on stem cell collection in patients with cold agglutinins. Some anecdotal information was reported by colleagues all of which seemed to point to less than favourable outcomes. It was decided to mobilize the patient for stem cell collection and devise a method of collection, storage and transplantation. This paper will give an account of the collection, treatment and progress of the patient, and discuss the procedures involved. It will demonstrate the collaboration between medical, nursing and laboratory staff to achieve a positive patient outcome.

AB  - During their education all Medical Scientists will be exposed at some stage to the intricacies of blood grouping, crossmatching and the investigation of adverse responses to the transfusion of blood and blood products. For some, this exposure engenders fear and trepidation and they cannot wait to get into a discipline that is less demanding and stressful. For others the discipline is a challenge that allows them to use their problem solving skills and to experience the adrenal rush of responding to urgent requests for blood from theater or casualty to help save a bleeding patient. As in all disciplines of Laboratory Medicine, technology, especially information communication technology (ICT), is having a significant impact upon how blood transfusion science is being practiced. However unlike all other disciplines, blood transfusion is also subject to the regulations of the Therapeutic Goods Authority which impose a broad range of safety requirements on the products that Medical Scientist work with and release for patients. Whilst some testing technology such as column agglutination and ICT is seemingly simplifying the preparation and release of products for patients, developments in other areas are opening up new challenges. The creation of Cell Therapies laboratories in a number of the major hospitals in Australia is the latest development in transfusion practice. Could the next stage in our progression be the incorpor ation of the hospital blood bank into the Cell and Tissue Therapies Laboratory, where the testing and processing of all cell and tissue products is undertaken under the one coordinating body. This presentation will review the education and training of Medical Scientists at RMIT University for the discipline of Transfusion Science and present a perspective on where future directions in our educational programs might go.

AB  - The application of formal regulatory structures to the field of blood component and blood product manufacture is an understandable response to public and governmental concern over the safety of such products. Internationally the trend is to greater central control of blood service provision and regulation is one of several tools used to achieve this. In both Australia and New Zealand, blood components are treated as medicinal products for the purposes of regulation. The imminent creation of a TransTasman Regulatory Authority provides an opportunity to review systems used for the regulation of these products within Australasia and to ensure that an appropriate balance between clinical need and quality conformance is achieved. The control of human derived medicinal products presents a number of specific challenges. This is particularly the case in relation to blood components where biological variation will impact on the ?formulation? of any given product. Essentially each component becomes a unique batch. Efforts at control and regulation should recognise this. Two broad approaches can be used for regulation. In the first control is achieved through the application of standard processes. In the second the necessary outcome is defined but the process not formally defined. Increasingly regulatory control of blood component manufacture favours control of the process. Control through process can however ultimately restrict clinical flexibility and responsiveness. Care must be taken to ensure that this is recognised and addressed in the development of systems utilised to assure the quality and safety of blood components.

AB  - Since its establishment on 1 July 2003, the National Blood Authority (NBA) has been making steady progress towards fulfilling its vision of ?Saving and improving Australian lives through a world-class blood supply?. While the NBA?s early focus has been on developing organisational infrastructure and meeting compliance requirements as a new Commonwealth agency, it has already begun to bring about improvements to the management of the blood sector in line with the recommendations of the 2001 Stephen Review. As the centralised procurement agency for blood and blood products, the NBA is responsible for managing existing supply contracts with the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, CSL Limited and a number of pharmaceutical companies, and is currently negotiating new contracts with two major suppliers. The NBA has also been working with the signatories to the National Blood Agreement, all nine Australian Government Jurisdictions, to coordinate national demand and supply planning. It is introducing an agreed single national pricing schedule and has developed improved forecasting models and reporting mechanisms to ensure that jurisdictional requirements for blood and blood products are more closely matched to supply. With time, the NBA hopes to play a greater facilitation role in encouraging the better clinical use of blood and blood products as this will not only result in better patient outcomes, but will also contribute to ensuring the adequacy of the blood supply. This presentation discusses why the NBA was established, its roles and responsibilities, and how it is working to bring about reforms in the sector in terms of increased value for money, transparency and accountability.

AB  - Following the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the introduction of testing for erythropoietin in elite athletes, it became apparent that many athletes had reverted to blood doping using homologous and autologous transfusions. The Science and Industry Against Blood doping research consortium approached Dr Nelson at RPAH to determine if a test could be developed to detect recent blood transfusions. A grant was provided by the US Anti-Doping Agency to develop a flow cytometric assay which detects the expression of a panel of minor blood group antigens. Most blood bank reagents are IgM and are not satisfactory as they cause aggregation. A series of IgG polyclonal antibodies were sourced and the optimal titre of each antibody to detect minor negative and positive red cell populations in in vitro mixtures was determined. The test was validated by four Sydney flow cytometry laboratories who tested unknown samples in a proficiency exercise. In April 2004, IOC, WADA and ATHOC agreed to introduce the test into the Athens laboratory in time for the 2004 Olympics with assistance from RPAH. From May till August, RPAH sourced suitable antibodies, performed antibody titrations, provided a standard operating procedure, consulted daily with both the Athens lab and the Anti-doping lab in Lausanne and conducted a series of 3 Proficiency Testing exercises for both labs. No false positives were found in 254 antibody/sample test combinations. The Athens lab used a panel which included antibodies to C, c, E, Jka, Jkb, Fyb, Fyb, M, N and S. Reagents for anti s, K and e were also provided by RPAH. Two weeks before the Games, the lab personnel moved into the IOC Athens Testing lab. A total of 350 endurance athletes were tested. This included placegetters plus randomly selected competitors.

AB  - The regulation of blood, blood product, tissue and gene technology therapies are viewed as critical to protecting the health of Australians. In response to the growing community concerns regarding the ethics, quality and safety of tissue and biological therapy products, the Australian Health Ministers Council, in 2002, recommended the development and introduction of a regulatory framework for tissues and emerging biological therapies. The proposal for tissues and emerging biological therapies parallels the regulation of blood and blood components introduced by the TGA in 2000 following similar ministerial recommendations, policy development and consultation A comprehensive system for the regulation of cellular and tissue based therapies within a proposed trans Tasman framework will be characterised by the following principles: ??All therapeutic products definable as cellular and tissue therapies, including cell-based gene therapy products, will be overseen by the system ??The level of regulation will be classified according to the risks posed by the therapies to the individual and the community. ??The classification system will align regulation of therapies to: ??standards ??standards and GMP ??standards, GMP and pre-market evaluation according to the level of risk. ??All facilities responsible for the manufacture and supply of cellular and tissue based products will be required to register their organisation with the TGA.

AB  - Aim To identify the medical officers responsible for blood transfusion therapy across the ACT. Method? Medical records of patients having transfusions were audited in one tertiary referral hospital, one general hospital and one associated private hospital as part of a quality improvement project. The clinical status patients, reasons for transfusion and laboratory data were extracted and the appropriateness of transfusion was assessed independently by two of the authors. Differences were resolved by consensus. The prescriber was also identified where possible, defined as the most senior clinician recorded in the medical record involved in the decision to transfuse. Result? The prescriber could be determined in 78% of transfusion episodes. In the majority of cases the decision to transfuse was attributed to specialist staff, in all hospitals. Registrars at the tertiary hospital prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (12%) than specialists (18.1%, p?<?0.05). This was not found at the smaller public hospital. After hours resident and registrar staff prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (3%) than other prescribers across the Territory (18.7%, p?<?0.005). Conclusion? Medical practitioners with varying levels of experience make medical decisions in hospitals. Who is responsible for these decisions has not been well studied. Our findings demonstrate specialist involvement in the majority of transfusion decisions. The results favour a ?top down? approach to quality improvement in transfusion, rather than targeting junior medical officers. The findings also have significant implications in understanding the dynamics of clinical decision making in the hospital setting and for the targeting of other quality improvement strategies.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate the Baxter ?Blood in Motion? temperature controlled system for transportation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) by the blood bank at St Vincent?s Hospital Melbourne. The trial incorporates transport of RBCs between the blood bank and theatre within St Vincent?s, and between St Vincent?s blood bank and blood banks within peripheral laboratories. Interest in this system arose in response to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and ARCBS amendments to packing of RBCs for transport effective 1st January 2004. According to the MOU, RBCs must be transported in a system which maintains a temperature range of 2?10 degrees Celcius. Method? RBCs were transported between the blood bank and theatre in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements on 11 occasions [N(t)?=?11]. RBCs were transported between St Vincent?s blood bank and Werribee Mercy Hospital blood bank in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements contained within a ?Blood in Motion? silver bag on 6 occasions [N(w)?=?6]. An acceptable outcome resulted if the temperature displayed on the LCD thermometer inside the system was within range of 2?10 degrees Celcius on arrival at destination. Result? An acceptable outcome was achieved in 100% of transport episodes to date. Further data will be collected and evaluated. Conclusion? The Baxter ?Blood in Motion? transport system is a viable alternative to the ARCBS packing system for transport of RBCs (and facilitates compliance with the proposed ARCBS MOU). This system would ensure maintenance of RBC quality and safety during transport by St Vincent?s blood bank and minimise wastage of RBCs.

The project aimed to establish a ?donor-centric? collection facility that met evolving donor needs. Methods  (a) the eastern based skew of the existing Pirie Street operation and (b) the demographic profiles of donor and non-donor cohorts, potential sites for further investigation were identified. This process was further enhanced by surveying donors (stakeholder buy in and input) who indicated a preference for a mid-CBD site. This selection was supported by retailing and traffic analysis that reinforced the Currie St. location ? a major street frontage with a transport hub to the western suburbs. ?Guiding Principles? for the design and operation of the centre were developed and stated that the site must; ? have a WOW factor ? make donation easy for donors ? have a modern and professional outlook ? have its own personality ? be creative and bold ? not compete with the existing city site ? cater for a different market segment to existing sites. The Guiding Principles and recommendations from donor focus groups, were used by the architects to develop concept drawings. These were reviewed by the Donor Advisory Committee, and specifications finalised. Furniture, fittings, refreshments and marketing strategies also focussed on the target donor groups and Guiding Principles. Conclusion? A donor focus in the planning, design and development of this centre has produced a facility that currently exceeds collection targets and has been nominated for building industry awards.

AB  - Born at the dawn of the 20th Century, Transfusion Medicine has seen tremendous progress and technical achievement during the last 100?years. As the pace of change increases, the prospects for the future are even brighter. This lecture will review the recent past developments and provide conjecture on future advances in each of the following areas: blood donor services, infectious hazards, non-infectious hazards, process risk, diagnostics and therapeutics. Expectations of what may occur by 2010 and 2015 will be presented. Emerging technologies such as gene array and radio-frequency identification are likely to produce advances in the safety of blood transfusion therapy. More into the future, nanotechnology may re-invent the indications for blood therapies. The field of new therapeutics should be the fastest growing area and the lecture will highlight recent advances in drug development and molecular therapeutics as well as highlight coming technology such as robotic surgery. The therapeutic promise offered by nuclear transfer technology and its impact on cellular therapies will be addressed. With these new opportunities come new challenges and the lecture concludes with an impassioned reminder of the real challenges that await us.

AB  - Australian Rh(D) Immunoglobulin is produced by CSL Bioplasma using plasma containing anti-D collected by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) from Australian voluntary blood donors. The ARCBS Rh Project was established, initially in New South Wales in 1967, with an aim of providing an adequate supply of Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin. In 1999, the NHMRC ?Guidelines on the prophylactic use of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin (Anti-D) in obstetrics? stated that universal prophylaxis with Rh(D) Immunoglobulin to RhD negative women with no preformed anti-D antibodies at 28 and 34 weeks gestation is generally regarded as best practice. With the availablity of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin at that time, the NHMRC recommended a phased implementation commencing with all Rh(D) negative primigravidae with no preformed anti-D antibodies (Phase 1). Phase 1 commenced in late 2002. The NHMRC recommemnded that full antenatal prophylaxis (phase 2) would be implemented when domestic supplies of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin increased sufficiently to cover the increased demand. The ARCBS plays an integral part in the implementation of universal antenatal prophylaxis by being the supplier of plasma containing anti-D for production and as the distributor of the final Rh(D) Immunoglobulin product. In 1999, the ARCBS supplied an average of 15???106?IU of anti-D per month to CSL Bioplasma. Implementation of phase 1 occurred following the introduction of two new products; the Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin 250?IU dose for first trimester indications and the temporary importation of WinRho SDFTM for postnatal use. Implementation of phase 2 and 3 requires the ARCBS to increase the amount of anti-D collected to an average of 30???106?IU and 45???106?IU per month, respectively. Phase 3 of the program is full antenatal prophylaxis supported entirely by domestic product. In 2002, additional funding was allocated to the ARCBS Rh Project to implement strategies to ensure that the input targets for phase 2 and 3 are achieved. In mid 2004, following months of primary immunisation and boosting of both new and existing donors, input levels began to consistently meet or exceed 30???106?IU, and planning for phase 2, implementation began. This presentation will give an overview of the strategies used by the ARCBS to increase the volume of anti-D collected from these donors.

AB  - In 1966, Sydney hosted the conference of the International Society of Blood Transfusion. At an Rh Symposium, experts revealed that several countries had conducted trials proving the safety and efficiency of anti-D in preventing Rh Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn. There have been no other major advances in the prevention of this tragic disease since that time. The source of anti-D in Australia is donated by a small group of Rh Project donors, and we depend entirely on them for the precious antibody which prevents Rh Disease. They have given magnificent service and thousands of babies have been saved. The Rh Project donors? contribution over 37?years is remarkable, inspiring and a triumph over disease.
