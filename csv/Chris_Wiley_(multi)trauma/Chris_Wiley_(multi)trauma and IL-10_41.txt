AB  - By comparison with many other procedures in medicine, apheresis for collection of haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is a relatively innocuous process. The procedure itself is straightforward, serious adverse effects are rare and many donors experience real benefits. But the apparent simplicity of HPC harvest is misleading as apheresis raises substantial issues of consent, risk assessment and conflict of interest. G-CSF primed apheresis is associated with a number of predictable shortterm risks and unpredictable long-term risks, particularly in those who submit to a second or third donation. Donors are often coerced by the very nature of their relationship to the recipient and by expectations of altruism and are infrequently offered a true choice between bone marrow harvest and peripheral HPC harvest. And, as is the case in solid organ donation, HPC donors may consent to HPC collection for a number of different reasons, some of which may negatively impact upon their experience of apheresis and may give rise to concerns regarding late withdrawal from donation. While these issues are complex enough where competent adults are the donors, they are more difficult again where the ?donor? in not competent, is mentally ill or is a child. In this paper I will review the ethics of apheresis, critique the concept of informed consent and the disproportionate concern with unrelated donors, and consider whether current practices are ethically justifiable.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.

AB  - Aim? To understand the underlying cause of a cluster of haemolysis-type adverse event (AE) reports received by CSL/ARCBS in patients receiving Intragam? P. Method? The cluster of AE reports were analysed with respect to patient factors (clinical indication, dose, blood group, concomitant medications and blood products, bone marrow reserve), product factors (batch results, production records) and changes in clinical practice (administration protocols, infusion kits). All Intragam P haemolysis related AEs from clinical trials and post-marketing exposure were reviewed, as well as international literature on this subject. Result Sixteen haemolysis type cases were reported to ARCBS/CSL over a 3?month period, ranging from abnormal laboratory test results (positive Coombs test) to clinical symptoms requiring transfusion. Ten of these reports were received in 4?days from 2 Victorian hospitals following the detection of 2 cases, which precipitated a retrospective review that identified additional similar cases. All patients received high dose (doses exceeding 400?600?mg/kg given every 3?4 weeks either in frequency or quantity) and all but one (where evidence suggested an underlying disorder) were of blood group A or AB. Eight patients were recipients of bone marrow transplants. No product or batch related factors or processes likely to have contributed to the haemolysis type AEs were identified. Anti-A and Anti-B titres of all Intragam P batches were investigated and confirmed to be within regulatory approved release specifications and pharmacopoeial limits. Conclusion? Haemolysis type adverse events are a recognised consequence of IVIG administration and are widely discussed in the literature. This investigation has confirmed the association of high dose IVIG in recipients of blood group A or AB and increased risk of haemolysis type adverse events. It also highlighted the possibility of accentuating any consequent anaemia in patients with diminished bone marrow reserve (eg post bone marrow transplant patients). Pre-infusion ABO blood groups should be determined in patients receiving high dose IVIG and their haemoglobin levels monitored in the?days following therapy.

AB  - Since 1980 a register of all blood donors and patients in Western Australia (WA) with clinically significant red cell and platelet antibodies has been maintained by the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS)-Enterprise. The register is updated by ARCBS daily, and prior to 1999 a microfiche version was sent each month to WA transfusion laboratories. In 1999 ARCBS-Enterprise and the Health Department of WA (HDWA) explored the option of transfusion laboratories in public hospitals obtaining immediate electronic access to the register. A secure telnet radio-link was established between a dedicated stand-alone ARCBS server and the HDWA computer network which allowed password protected enquiry-only access to the database by hospital end-users. All end-users are required to sign an agreement to guarantee proper use of the register. The use of this comprehensive database has been successfully incorporated into the pre-transfusion testing protocols of all transfusion laboratories in WA. The benefits of this system include: ??Reduced delay in obtaining phenotyped units for patients with known antibodies. ??Reduced chance of delayed transfusion reactions in patients whose antibody level has fallen below detectable levels. ??A mechanism for ante-natal monitoring and predicting severity of haemolytic disease of the newborn when patients move between care providers during the pregnancy. ARCBS-Enterprise and end-users are passionate about the continuation of this extremely important resource in the future.

AB  - Aim? Borna Virus (BV) is a negative strand RNA virus associated with neurological diseases in animals. An association with human neuro-psychiatric disease has been suggested. The hypothesis investigated was that potentially infectious levels of blood borne BV may be present in humans. Levels of antibody to BV in human and cat sera were studied by ELISA with antigen from infected horse brain, immunofluorescence with infected cells, Western blot and BV epitope peptide-ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies were used in capture ELISAs to measure BV antigen levels (BVAg) in plasma and RT-PCR and sequencing used to investigate relatedness of BV sequences from humans in Australia with European sequences. Result? In 1% of blood donors, free BV antigen was detected in plasma and reactions with BV p24 or p40 antigens confirmed by Western Blot. Circulating immune complexes, antibody to brain-derived antigen and reactions with two of the eight peptides tested were also detected. Strong positive reactions in tests for circulating immune complexes, free plasma antigen and free antibody, were observed in a small number of blood donors. Individuals with high levels of plasma antigen were investigated by RT-PCR and sequencing. Sequence from the p24 region of the Australian human BV genome was 5% different from European reference strains. Conclusion? These data support the hypothesis that a form of BV is endemic in humans in Australia, including potentially infectious levels in blood donors. The extent of difference, in regions other than p24, between BV in Australia and strains infecting animals overseas remains to be clarified.

AB  - Aim? Since 1995, the SCBB has used three protocols to screen CB for contaminating microbes. The protocols differed in the number of culture bottles inoculated and sample volume used. The aim of this study was to compare microbial detection rates for each method. Method? CB units (n?=?9,618) were tested for microbial contamination using BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles (BioMerieux). Of these, 6,836 had 20?ml plasma waste fraction inoculated into adult anaerobic and aerobic bottles (Group A), 365 had 1?ml final stem cell product into an aerobic paediatric bottle (Group B), and 2,417 had 1?ml final product into a paediatric bottle and 10?ml plasma waste fraction into an adult anaerobic bottle (Group C). All bottles were incubated for a minimum of 5?days. Detection rates for microbe contamination were calculated for each group. Result? Microbe detection rates were: Group A ?345/6836 (5.0%), Group B ? 3/365 (0.8%) and Group C ? 66/2417 (2.7%)(p?<?0.0001). Organisms detected by A but not by B (and to a lesser extent C) included Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Proprionibacterium. Conclusion? Contamination detection rates differ significantly, depending upon the sample volume and type of culture bottle used. A protocol that uses the recommended sample volume and both anaerobic and anaerobic test bottles is likely to detect the highest number of contaminated units. Testing of a small sample from the final product using only a single paediatric aerobic bottle is likely to miss detection of the majority of anaerobic and some aerobic organisms. Prospective studies to define a standardised method for microbial detection for CB are required.

AB  - Aim? The aim of the study is to quantitate D antigenic sites on RBC in weak D and partial D variants in Indian population by flowcytometric method. Method? Dantigenic sites were estimated in 48 cases of partial D, eight cases of weak D (identified by serological methods) and normal Rh phenotypes subjects by flowcytometric technique. The indirect immunoflourescence method was employed using thirty epitope specific monoclonal anti-D as primary antibody. The D antigenic sites were calculated using standard RBC with known D antigenic sites. Result? The mean (±I S.D) D antigenic sites per RBC in weak D and partial D were 4503?±?2067 and 6750?±?3426 respectively. In R1R1 phenotype the range of D antigenic sites was 16500?±?2500 and in R1r it was 10600?±?2520. In four cases of weak D sites were in range of 1700 to 3500 and in other four it was 5000 to 7200?D sites/RBC. Among partial D variants DVI had minimum, and DVa had maximum number of D sites. Conclusion? Flowcytometry is a very good tool for demonstrating minor differences in D antigen sites in partial D and weak D when serological methods are not conclusive.

AB  - BloodSafe is a joint initiative between the South Australian (SA) Department of Health, Australian Red Cross Blood Service, hospitals and transfusion service providers. It has successfully established quality assurance programs to improve the safety and quality of blood management practice within the SA health system. BloodSafe began as a project in September of 2002 initially with 12?months funding from the Safety and Quality Council. Four Transfusion Nurse Consultants were appointed across five major metropolitan teaching hospitals. Audit of practice within these hospitals demonstrated three major problem areas- transfusion specimen collection, the decision to transfuse and administration of blood. A further 12?months funding was granted including extension of the project to include a Nurse Educator for the state to introduce initiatives into country and private hospitals. Reaudit of practice after interventions and education demonstrated that the Transfusion Nurse Consultants were effective change agents. In particular red cell use outside the NHMRC/ASBT guidelines fell from 18% to 4%(p?<?0.01) in stable adult orthopaedic patients audited. A number of other important aspects of transfusion practice also showed significant improvement including documentation, consent and administration. Recurrent funding for BloodSafe Transfusion Nurse Consultants was granted by the SA Department of Health from July 2004. Factors contributing to the success of BloodSafe include a multidisciplinary team, Transfusion Nurses of clinical nurse consultant level, demonstration of a clear need for the initiatives, evidence of successful practice improvement, statewide collaboration and interventions, benchmarking across hospitals, and impartiality of the BloodSafe name with acceptance by stakeholders.

AB  - Focus on the risks of viral transmission via transfusion has pushed recognition of other transfusion risks to the background over the last several decades. With reduction in the risks of HCV and HIV to very low levels (well less than 1/million units), productive attention can now be directed toward other risks. Bacterial contamination of platelets represents the largest morbidity and mortality risk faced by a platelet recipient, and the risk of dieing due to a contaminated unit is at least 10- if not 100-times greater than the chance of HIV transmission. Approximately 1 in every 1?4,000 units of platelets can be shown to contain bacteria, and the frequency of fatality due to port-transfusion sepsis is 14/million units transfused. Bacterial contamination is often not recognized clinically, however, because of the situation of the patient. A variety of techniques to limit and detect bacterial contamination are available for implementation. Culturing is used most widely. Checking pH, glucose concentration or preservation of swirling are simple and inexpensive techniques but suffer from lack of sensitivity. The development of immunologic techniques that can be accomplished rapidly may shift the testing to immediately before issuance for transfusion, a time at which any contamination would be easier to detect because of growth during the storage period. Not only will detection techniques improve transfusion recipient safety, but they can lead to cost-savings through extension of the platelet storage period as has already been implemented in several European countries.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been implicated in certain adverse patient outcomes. Immunomodulation may play a central role. The aim of this project was to determine the ability of supernatants and cellular fractions of RBC concentrates to modulate the immune response of allogeneic mononuclear cells (MNCs), particularly monocytes. Non-leucocytereduced, buffy-coat-depleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected on day 1 and fortnightly until product expiry, and centrifuged to obtain supernatant and cellular fractions. On the?day of RBC sample collection, whole blood (WB) and MNCs were prepared from ABO-compatible allogeneic donors. Induction of monocyte CD11b and CD54 was determined by flow cytometry by incubating allogeneic WB with RBC supernatants or cellular fractions, followed by staining with fl uorescently-labelled anti-CD14, anti-CD11b and anti-CD54. Cytokine release was determined by incubating MNCs with RBC supernatants and culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA for IL-8, TNFalpha; and IL-10. Supernatant and cellular fraction from non-leucocyte-reduced RBC concentrates induced expression of CD11b and CD54 on allogeneic monocytes. Buffy-coatdepleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates had minimal effect on monocyte CD11b or CD54 expression. Cytokine release from MNCs incubated with RBC supernatant suggested a tenuous balance between proinflammatory (IL-8 and TNF alpha;) and immunosuppressive (IL-10) responses. All RBC product types induced cytokine release from MNCs. The results from this study indicate that stored RBC concentrates can modulate allogeneic MNCs. Both proinflammatory and immunosuppressive responses were evident. Leucocytes in RBC concentrates appear to favour a proinflammatory response by MNCs.

AB  - Aim? Variant MNS (vMNS) phenotypes are characterised by the presence of multiple antigens that provoke complex antibody responses. The hypothesis tested was that red cell-agglutinating antibodies of a single specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on peptides representing vMNS antigens. The Vw and Hut/Mut antigens vary only at glycophorin residue 28, Vw methionine-28, Hut and Mut lysine-28. The Mur peptide TYPAHTANEV was aa 33 to 42 of GpMur. For each experiment a 5?ml pool of 4 and 10 sera that agglutinated Mi-positive cells of known MNS-peptide-ELISA activity, was subjected to affinity chromatography on a single peptide. Result? For a serum pool that was strong peptide-ELISA positive with the lysine-28 peptide but was methionine-28 peptide negative, the antibody eluate was lysine-28 pos by ELISA and agglutinated all MUT and HUT pos cells tested but not Vw cells or Mi(a) negative cells. For the MUT antigen the hypothesis that a rbc-agglutinating antibody of a defined specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on a linear peptide representing the antigen was confirmed. In a similar fashion a specific anti-Mur was prepared. However, for one serum pool the antibody eluted from the Mur-column reacted with Hut (MiII) as well as Mur-positive cells, suggesting that Mut.Mur was recognised as a single antigen. Conclusion? Purified monospecific polyclonal antibodies that define vMNS phenotypes may be useful in resolving difficult serological investigations. The complexity of responses to vMNS glycophorins is confirmed by the recovery of an antibody reacting with sequentially adjacent antigens as a single entity.

AB  - Aim? To find incidence of partial D variants in India and classify them by molecular techniques. Method? Partial D variants were identified by screening blood samples of subjects from Western India by using partial D kit (Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service). Molecular characterization of partial D variants was performed using multiplex PCR(M-PCR). Result? The incidence of partial D was 0.15% in the population studied. Forty eight partial D variant samples identified by serological studies were classified by M-PCR. 29% of partial D variants identified were of DFR and 14.6% were of DVI category. 77% of partial D variants identified in Indian population were characterized by M-PCR. Fifteen families of partial D variants were studied and ten more individuals of same variant were identified. All partial D variants were of R1r (DCe/dce) phenotype. The family studies showed partial D hybrid (RHD-CE-D) was linked with Ce gene. Conclusion? DFR was most frequently found partial D in Indian population. Majority of partial D variants characterized in Indian population arise due to substitution of part of RHD exon with RHCE equivalent.

AB  - Adherence of red blood cells (RBCs) to vascular endothelium impairs blood flow, decreases oxygen delivery and leads to vaso-occulusion. RBCs are relatively non-adherent however little is known of how changes to RBCs for transfusion during storage may affect their adherence properties. The aim of this study was to monitor adherence of stored RBCs to vascular endothelium under conditions of continuous flow in vitro. Specifically the influence of RBC storage time and leucocyte burden of stored red cell preparations was investigated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Nonleucocyte- reduced, buffy-coat-reduced and leucocyte-filtered RBC products were prepared according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected at multiple time points until product expiry and perfused across an EC monolayer using a parallel flow chamber mounted to an inverted microscope. Perfusion of RBCs was controlled for shear stress and temperature. RBC-EC interactions were recorded using a digital camera attached to the microscope. The number of RBCs adhering to the EC layer progressively increased with product storage time. RBCs from products stored for 28 and 42?days were significantly more adherent than fresher cells. RBCs from products containing leucocytes were also significantly more adherent to the EC layer on days 28 and 42 of storage than RBCs from leucocyte-reduced products. Our findings indicate that product storage time and leucocyte burden increase the adhesion of RBCs to an EC layer. These results may lead to greater understanding of the interaction of transfused RBCs with recipient endothelium and the biological consequences of this adherence.

AB  - Serious and repeated infections with bacteria, yeast, and fungus continue to be a consequence of severe neutropenia. Previous attempts to prevent and/or treat these infections in severely neutropenic patients through use of neutrophil (PMN) transfusions achieved only modest success ? largely due to the collection and transfusion of relatively small numbers of PMNs. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has revolutionized the collection of PMNs for transfusion because stimulation of donors with G-CSF plus corticosteroids before leukapheresis permits collection of 6?8???10 to the 10 PMNs per each transfusion. Although questions and concerns have been raised about the biology and potential toxicity of giving G-CSF?+?steroids to normal allogeneic donors, these issues have questionable clinical significance. Properly controlled, clinical trials have not been performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PMN transfusions collected from donors stimulated with G-CSF?+?steroids. Therefore, despite the somewhat compelling ?logic? that transfusing very high numbers of PMNs should be helpful in treating serious infections in neutropenic patients, this practice can not be justified at this time. Indeed, published reports of individual patients and small series of patients have given mixed results (i.e., successes and failures). Hence, the need for properly-designed clinical trails.

AB  - In 2002 the Victoria Government, through a Blood Matters Collaborative, supported the introduction of Transfusion Nurse roles in participating Victorian Hospitals. The TN role, based on haemovigilance roles internationally, was key to the introduction of change initiatives undertaken as part of the collaborative project. TNs required a broad knowledge of transfusion practice along with training in organisational change and implementation of change concepts. Training for the TNs was provided through a Graduate Certificate in Transfusion Practice developed specifically for the project. This program has now been developed for online delivery. This paper will outline the role development and role vision developed for TNs throughout the Blood Matters Collaborative and considers the issues that have arisen since completion of the project in terms of role sustainability. Important issues include the place of TNs within organisational structures, development of sustainable systems of role integration and the ongoing integrity and sustainability of programs developed for role preparation.

AB  - Aim? Anti-Mi(a) has been used as a generic term to describe a number of antibodies to variant MNS (vMNS) antigens. The aim of this study was to compare the specificty reported for an anti-Mia) monoclonal antibody with monospecific polyclonal antibodies recovered from human sera by affinity chromatography. The hypothesised pattern was equal reactions with QNTDK28HKRDT and QNTDM28HKRD peptides. Sepharose columns one with each form of the peptide (K28 or M28) were prepared. A 10?ml pool of sera that reacted with the M28-peptide AND strongly agglutinated Vw cells, was subjected to affinity chromatography on the M28-peptide column. Result? A concentrated eluate reacted only with the M28-peptide by ELISA and agglutinated all Vw, HUT, MiIII and Mi VI cells tested. This was an anti-Mi(a) but with different pattern of ELISA reactivity to that reported for the monoclonal antibody. In a sequential second affinity chromatography, the fraction that did NOT bind to the M28-peptide was applied to the K28-peptide column: The concentrate reacted with K-containing peptide and agglutinated all Vw, HUT, MiIII and Mi IV cells ? an anti-Mi(a) with a different (lysine-specific) pattern of reactivity. In one case an antibody that also reacted with cells with an Sta phenotype was isolated from the K28-peptide column. Conclusion? In human antisera to Mi(a) there are several patterns of reaction for antisera that agglutinate Vw and Mi(a) cells. None of these resembled the MAb (hypothesis refuted). Complex reactivities predicted by early serolgists in the field can now be studied using specific antisera.

AB  - Aim? A lady of 30?years was referred to our Institute for investigations who had an obstetric history of one living child, followed by one still birth and then a termination of pregnancy due to suspected fetal ascitis. Method? Blood grouping and Rh genotyping was done by us by standard serological procedures and patient?s serum was investigated for atypical antibodies by panel of cells. Fourteen family members were investigated for ABO grouping and Rh genotyping. Result? Patient?s blood group was identified as O Rh Positive showing a rare Rh genotype D-- with presence of only D antigen and absence of C, c, E and e antigens. Confirmation of this was done by absorption of patient?s red cells with anti-C, anti-c, anti-E and anti -e antisera and testing the eluate reactivity for presence of the respective antigens. Patient?s serum reacted with all panel red cells of the common Rh genotypes and the antibody is anti ? Hro which is the most potent antibody a D-- individual produces. Amongst the family members of the propositus, seven probable heterozygote D-- individuals were identified by testing with incomplete anti -D by saline technique. Conclusion? The patient had a rare Rh genotype D--/D-- and had produced anti ? Hro antibody due to fetomaternal leak during pregnancies and this must have been responsible for the fetal loss. No other family member exhibited this rare Rh genotype in homozygous form.
