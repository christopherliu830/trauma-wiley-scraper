AB  - Governance is the exercise of power consequent on the assumptions of responsibility. Clinical Governance is the process and framework through which Health Services achieve accountability for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguard high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care can flourish in a patient centred environment. In terms of clinical governance as it pertains to safe and appropriate use of blood and blood products it is being rolled out in Victoria at two levels. At a hospital level, as part of clinical governance there is a requirement for organisations to have an active transfusion committee to provide oversight on the usage, appropriateness and adverse events related to blood and blood products. This committee should report through to the hospitals clinical risk/quality committee. Transfusion nurses have been funded to amongst other things resource this committee. At a state level Victoria has established a Better Safer Transfusion (BeST) practice program supported by a BeST advisory committee. The work will support hospital transfusion committees and advise on future work in the area.

AB  - Factor XIII (FXIII) is the last enzyme in the clotting cascade. Its main function is to convert the loose fibrin polymer into a firm, cross-linked structure. FXIII inhibitor is a rare condition, in which three different types of inhibitors have been described usually due to IgG antibodies. We describe two male patients with acquired FXIII deficiency (age; 73 and 69?years), who had a history of significant bleeding. Functional assay using the acetic acid/urea clot solubility test showed residual FXIII levels between 1?2%. Molecular studies by PCR and DNA sequencing excluded an inherited FXIII deficiency. In addition, we demonstrated an inhibitor pattern for FXIII by in vitro mixing studies with both purified FXIII (Fibrogammin, Aventis Behring) and cryoprecipitates as sources of FXIII. Transglutaminase assay of FXIII (Dade Behring) was normal for both patients, consistent with a type III FXIII inhibitor, which believed to be directed against the activated FXIII-fibrin complex. Both patients showed transient correction of clot solubility to normal after infusion of high doses of Fibrogammin. In view of previous reports describing FXIII inhibitors of the IgG class, we attempted a novel treatment with rituximab (chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, Roche) to interfere with production of the inhibitor. However, neither patient showed correction of FXIII activity as measured by clot solubility tests during and up to 2 weeks after therapy. Preliminary results suggest that high dose Fibrogammin is required to correct FXIII deficiency due to an acquired type III inhibitor. The role of rituximab or other immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation.

AB  - Aim? Review of four failures of refrigeration facilities in Victorian institutional blood banks reported to ARCBS in the first 4?months of 2004. These incidents at both public and private institutions, in metropolitan and regional settings, resulted in loss of 148 units of red cells, 7 vials of RhD Ig and 2 bottles of Albumex. Incidents were investigated and root causes identified by initial phone interview and visits to blood bank storage facilities. Result? Case 1: Temperature fell below 0?°C at remote site, alarm was activated at monitoring centre (main lab) but without response. Case 2: Power failure resulted in rise in temperature. Alarm did not activate until power was restored. Alarms were set outside required storage temperatures. Case 3: Circuit failure resulted in loss of power. Alarm was activated, but then switched off and no further action taken. Case 4: Compressor failure resulted in alarm activation. Alarm and monitoring devices were deactivated while repairs carried out. Product was not moved to other storage facilities. These cases all highlight the importance of procedures, training, equipment and maintenance. Conclusion? Losses of precious blood components and products through refrigeration failures are preventable. Vital improvements should include commissioning refrigeration equipment that meets AS 3864, protocol development and staff training in use of procedures to be followed when out of temperature events occur, and performance of regular preventative maintenance, calibration and testing of storage and monitoring equipment. ARCBS can work with institutional blood banks to improve storage and management of blood.

AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - The aim of this project was to identify potential protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions in stored red cell concentrates. Previously, research into protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions has focussed on specific proteins, such as cytokines. In this study, a global approach was taken which involved two-dimensional electrophoresis based Proteomics, which has the potential to uncover previously unrecognised mediators or novel proteins. Red cell products with and without pre-storage leukoreduction (each n?=?6) were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. Supernatant samples were taken at several time points until product expiry. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and those that accumulated in the supernatant were selected for identification by mass spectrometry. The protein profile of supernatant from leukoreduced red cell products was less complex compared to non-leukoreduced products (from 4.4 fold fewer proteins at day 1 to 1.6 fold fewer at day 43). Several proteins were observed to be predominantly present in leukoreduced products which may potentially be beneficial to red cell survival. These proteins were identified as being involved in the maintenance of a stable extracellular environment. Conversely, a number of proteins, which may have detrimental effects, were predominantly expressed in non-leukoreduced products. These proteins included a neutrophil chemoattractant (activator) and a potential acute-phase reactant. A number of proteins identified by mass spectrometry were matched to theoretical proteins of unknown function. The findings confirm the usefulness of Proteomics to investigate storage effects on blood products. The clinical relevance of these proteins is the focus of our future investigations.

AB  - Summary Bladder cancer is the most common urothelial malignancy. More than 90% arise from the transitional cell lining of the urinary tract. The remainder of the histological variants include squamous cell cancer, adeno carcinoma, and other rare tumours. Urothelial cancer is associated with smoking and exposure to industrial carcinogens. This cancer generally affects people who are older and who have many comorbidities, which makes their management more challenging. More than two-thirds of the urothelial cancers are non-muscle?invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) confined to the mucosa or submucosal layers of the bladder wall and remainder are muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). NMIBC have tendency to recur, and the risk of recurrence varies between 15 and 80% and the majority of the recurrences occur within 6?12?months. Hence, intensive surveillance with cystoscopy and imaging of the urinary tract is required, which in turn incurs a high cost to the healthcare systems. The NMIBC cancers are classified based on their risk of recurrence and progression into low, intermediate, and high risk to tailor subsequent management and surveillance. In addition to the initial transurethral resection, intravesical therapies in the form of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination are used to reduce recurrence or progression of the disease. For MIBC or high-risk NMIBC, radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the mainstay of treatment. Radical cystectomy is a life-changing operation and is associated with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, experts in the field are striving to minimise the morbidity of the procedure by using minimal invasive techniques of laparoscopy or robotic surgery in combination with enhanced recovery pathways to expedite recovery. There remains a risk of recurrence even after radical cystectomy due to micrometastasis. Various chemotherapy regimens have been used to decrease this in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has so far provided 5?8% absolute survival benefit at the expense of significant morbidity. In patients unfit or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy, bladder preservation is an alternative which includes external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy after transurethral resection. There is not enough evidence to prove the equivalence of this to radical surgery. In those with advanced or metastatic disease, patients are put on palliative care pathway because the natural history of the disease is poor with four to six?months expected survival. However, some newer immuno-therapies that inhibit the interaction between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), present on the surface of tumour or antigen-presenting cells, and programmed death 1 (PD-1), present on the surface of activated lymphocytes, are offering new hope to the patients with advanced disease. In some cases of locally advanced cancer, palliative cystectomy can be performed for control of recurrent bleeding.

AB  - Aim? Blood Matters was a project funded by the Victorian Department of Human Services to introduce sustainable improvements in hospital transfusion practice. An evaluation was conducted at two metropolitan hospitals to review progress against stated aims and identify key elements leading to changes in transfusion practice and highlight any unintended consequences. Method? During the project, each hospital chose to focus improvement efforts in key areas. Measurable, specific goals were developed. Using a case study approach, the evaluation was conducted by review of the aim-specific data collected during the project and by semi-structured interviews from which key themes (eg assumptions underpinning decisions) were identified. Interviews were conducted with at least 10 representative individuals from each organisation whose roles were considered necessary for change in their institution?s transfusion practice. Result? Measurable improvements have been made (eg an 87 percent improvement in reduction of patient identification error) and the Transfusion Nurse position made operational at both sites. Examples of key success factors identified are: a committed transfusion team to direct improvements in the organisation; integration of transfusion data reporting into existing organisational quality/risk management structures to provide ongoing visibility for transfusion issues and; mentorship and support for the Transfusion Nurse role. Conclusion? This project has, in the short term, successfully generated improvements in hospital transfusion practice and influenced hospital systems to enable changes to be sustainable in the longer term.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - As in many aspects of transfusion medicine, practices have developed based on low levels of evidence. Let?s review some assumptions and think how these might change in future:- (1)?Indications. 80% of platelet transfusions are given prophylactically to patients with bone marrow failure, yet no trials have demonstrated the value of prophylaxis over treatment of bleeding alone. (2)?Trigger. A trigger of 10???10?g/l is now accepted. Reducing this further will depend on accurate counting, challenging at this level. (3)?Dose & frequency. The optimum dosing schedule has not been derived by pharmacokinetic studies, but by what can be conveniently manufactured. An adult dose of 3???1011 platelets is accepted, but there is wide variation in practice. (4)?Manufacture. Globally, 3 methods (pooled buffy coats, platelet rich plasma and apheresis) all produce an efficacious product. Although apheresis platelets reduce donor exposure, no functional advantage has been demonstrated. (5)?In vitro assessment of function. A battery of tests is recommended, but only pH has been shown to correlate with posttransfusion survival. (6)?ABO matching. ABO compatible platelets give better increments, and transfusing ABO incompatible plasma can be associated with haemolysis, but ABO matching to patient is often compromised by stock management. (7)?Use of platelet additive solution. A 70:30 mix of PAS:plasma would reduce reactions and perhaps TRALI but this is not standard practice. Is the plasma useful? (8)?CMV safety. Overall, leucocyte depletion alone appears to provide a high degree of protection, but this is not universally accepted. (9)?Assessment of response. 1 and 24?hr increments are standard, but is regression analysis the way forward? (10)?Management of refractoriness. Better HLA and HPA matching is now technically possible. Should these lead to better HLA matching for all? (11)?Is one product for all appropriate? 20% of platelets go to surgical patients who are bleeding. Do they need a product with a different specification?

As the pace of change increases, the prospects for the future are even brighter. This lecture will review the recent past developments and provide conjecture on future advances in each of the following areas: blood donor services, infectious hazards, non-infectious hazards, process risk, diagnostics and therapeutics. Expectations of what may occur by 2010 and 2015 will be presented. Emerging technologies such as gene array and radio-frequency identification are likely to produce advances in the safety of blood transfusion therapy. More into the future, nanotechnology may re-invent the indications for blood therapies. The field of new therapeutics should be the fastest growing area and the lecture will highlight recent advances in drug development and molecular therapeutics as well as highlight coming technology such as robotic surgery. The therapeutic promise offered by nuclear transfer technology and its impact on cellular therapies will be addressed. With these new opportunities come new challenges and the lecture concludes with an impassioned reminder of the real challenges that await us.

AB  - Australian Rh(D) Immunoglobulin is produced by CSL Bioplasma using plasma containing anti-D collected by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) from Australian voluntary blood donors. The ARCBS Rh Project was established, initially in New South Wales in 1967, with an aim of providing an adequate supply of Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin. In 1999, the NHMRC ?Guidelines on the prophylactic use of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin (Anti-D) in obstetrics? stated that universal prophylaxis with Rh(D) Immunoglobulin to RhD negative women with no preformed anti-D antibodies at 28 and 34 weeks gestation is generally regarded as best practice. With the availablity of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin at that time, the NHMRC recommended a phased implementation commencing with all Rh(D) negative primigravidae with no preformed anti-D antibodies (Phase 1). Phase 1 commenced in late 2002. The NHMRC recommemnded that full antenatal prophylaxis (phase 2) would be implemented when domestic supplies of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin increased sufficiently to cover the increased demand. The ARCBS plays an integral part in the implementation of universal antenatal prophylaxis by being the supplier of plasma containing anti-D for production and as the distributor of the final Rh(D) Immunoglobulin product. In 1999, the ARCBS supplied an average of 15???106?IU of anti-D per month to CSL Bioplasma. Implementation of phase 1 occurred following the introduction of two new products; the Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin 250?IU dose for first trimester indications and the temporary importation of WinRho SDFTM for postnatal use. Implementation of phase 2 and 3 requires the ARCBS to increase the amount of anti-D collected to an average of 30???106?IU and 45???106?IU per month, respectively. Phase 3 of the program is full antenatal prophylaxis supported entirely by domestic product. In 2002, additional funding was allocated to the ARCBS Rh Project to implement strategies to ensure that the input targets for phase 2 and 3 are achieved. In mid 2004, following months of primary immunisation and boosting of both new and existing donors, input levels began to consistently meet or exceed 30???106?IU, and planning for phase 2, implementation began. This presentation will give an overview of the strategies used by the ARCBS to increase the volume of anti-D collected from these donors.

AB  - In 1966, Sydney hosted the conference of the International Society of Blood Transfusion. At an Rh Symposium, experts revealed that several countries had conducted trials proving the safety and efficiency of anti-D in preventing Rh Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn. There have been no other major advances in the prevention of this tragic disease since that time. The source of anti-D in Australia is donated by a small group of Rh Project donors, and we depend entirely on them for the precious antibody which prevents Rh Disease. They have given magnificent service and thousands of babies have been saved. The Rh Project donors? contribution over 37?years is remarkable, inspiring and a triumph over disease.

AB  - As a cosmic element Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe. Its presence in the atmosphere and solubility in water makes life on Earth possible. As a human element Oxygen makes up approximately 60% of our body weight and access to too little or too much is fatal. Medically, Oxygen is an essential therapeutic element and its technical delivery has led to the development of blood transfusion, ventilators and intensive care units. The discovery and evolution of our understanding of Oxygen as ?The Molecule that made the World? is a story of genius, serendipity and politics. To the haematologist and transfusionist Oxygen?s relationship to the red cell and the haemoglobin molecule is a constant source of amazement and fascination. The red cell, the only cell in the body that is not dependent on Oxygen for energy production, has, in conjunction with the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the awesome responsibility of delivery adequate amounts of Oxygen to every cell in the body 24 hours a day 7?days a week. Haemoglobin, probably the most studied molecular in biology, has been pivotal in the broader understanding of molecular structure and function and continues to reveal it?s secrets. Oxygen, as an economic element is essential to industry and as an environmental element is closely linked to conservation of planet Earth. Many sports have a close and frequently dubious interest in enhancing delivery of oxygen to the muscles. On the basis of doubtful people who feel the need are increasingly being enticed to ?Flood their bodies with Oxygen as therapy against our polluted World?. It is the presenter?s aim that this lecture will illustrate the paramount role of Oxygen to our existence and it?s central importance in the history of medicine, and blood transfusion in particular.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - On behalf of the ?Blood Matters? Planning Group. The Blood Matters Collaborative was structured around a series of specific projects designed to improve distinct aspects of the sequence of care processes that ultimately determine the safety of each and every fresh blood product (red cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) transfusion. These commence with the appropriateness of the clinical decision to transfuse blood products, then move to ensure that procedures for patient, sample and blood product identification and blood administration are robust and that any procedural errors and adverse events associated with transfusion are captured, analysed and acted upon. Finally and very importantly the collaborative sought to improve the patient and carers understanding of the risks and benefits of transfusion. It was an ambitious program of work but there seemed little alternative other than addressing all of the interdependent processes that determine the quality and safety of transfusion. All elements in this chain contribute to the actual levels of transfusion safety. With support from the Clinical Innovation Agency and planning group members, local multi-disciplinary hospital teams set out to deliver changes to improve transfusion safety. The collaborative methodology, initially developed by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in the United States of America, has been adopted and used by a large number of health systems internationally and within Australia. It is based on answering three key questions [Q1. What are we trying to accomplish? Q2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? Q3. What changes can we make that will result in improvement?] and testing ideas through the plan, do, study, act cycles of change. Individual projects monitored progress using ?run charts? to record their measured performance. These indicated progress towards achieving locally set targets and collaborative improvement goals. Our objectives were translated into tangible benefits for patients requiring blood product transfusion. Fundamental to the collaborative approach to improving transfusion practice is the belief that changes can be tested rapidly on a small scale without risk. For example, an idea can quickly be tried with one patient, one clinic or ward, a single consultant or hospital. Only if it proved successful was it suggested for wider adoption as an improvement in care across an entire Health Service or system of care. Our successes reinforced the value of using a systematic method for translating ideas into practice such as that used by the collaborative. The governance structures and teams established during our participation in the collaborative have helped us to identify key local issues and implement strategies to enhance the quality of our transfusion services to our patients. Our aim is to ensure that the continued review and improvement of transfusion practices becomes an integral part of the way that clinical teams and hospital and health system clinical governance structures work. The role of state or national bodies is to support this to happen. We hope to build a series of improvement partnerships that all focus on optimising the quality of transfusion services and the outcomes of patients receiving transfusion during their clinical care.

AB  - Removing, inactivating or detecting pathogens in platelet units are panaceas that some expect to revolutionize transfusion support for patients. Opting for transfusion without concern for the presence of pathogens may not be such a simple decision, however. The effect of pathogen reduction treatment may reduce platelet number and/or function. Clinical trials have documented that treated platelets provide effective hemostatic support for thrombocytopenic patients. However, platelets may need to be transfused in greater quantity, and thus the treatment technique may create a greater demand for the production of platelets through the supply system. Toxicologic concerns about the treatments must be addressed to ensure that there is net benefit for patients. Testing reported to date suggests that any residual compounds are at concentrations far below that associated with detectable toxicity, but the concept of transfusing a component containing even minute amounts of toxic substances may be unsettling to some. Detecting bacteria may remove the largest remaining infectious threat in platelet units and would leave platelets undamaged to function normally. This opens the option for extending the storage period of platelet units, but any extension of storage would be expected to be associated with a decrease in recovery and survival. To avoid continuing decrements with each proposed change in processing or storage, a new standard for efficacy has been proposed that would compare the recovery and survival of the platelet component to fresh platelets from the same donor. This standard appears useful and applicable in ensuring safe and efficacious platelets for transfusion. The question remains: Which direction is best for platelet recipients?
