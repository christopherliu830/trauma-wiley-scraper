AB  - Abstract A novel allergy vaccine (Pollinex? Quattro) has been developed for the prevention or relief of allergic symptoms caused by a variety of pollens. Within this range, the grass pollen allergy vaccine contains extracts of 12 grass pollens and rye cereal (all chemically modi?ed by glutaraldehyde) that are adsorbed onto l-tyrosine with addition of the immunostimulatory adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL?). A speci?c preclinical safety testing strategy was developed to support clinical use, comprising single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies. Dose levels of up to 0.5 ml per animal (mouse) and up to 1.0 ml per animal (rat and rabbit) were used with vaccines containing 2000 or 12 000 standardized units (SU) ml?1 of grass pollen allergoids, 50 µg ml?1 of MPL? adjuvant and 20 mg ml?1 of tyrosine. Overall, the product showed no toxicological ?ndings of signi?cance at levels greatly in excess of those proposed for clinical use. A not unexpected, but relatively minor, immunostimulatory effect was seen following repeated dosing (once weekly for 3 weeks) at 1.0 ml per rat. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - SUMMARY It is widely accepted that immune tolerance toward ?self? is established by central and peripheral adaptations of the immune system. Mechanisms that have been demonstrated to play a role in the induction and maintenance of tolerance include thymic deletion of self-reactive T cells, peripheral T cell anergy and apoptosis, as well as thymic and peripheral induction of regulatory T cells. However, a large body of experimental findings cannot be rationalized solely based on adaptations of the immune system to its environment. Here we propose a new model termed Ecoimmunity, where the immune system and the tissue are viewed as two sides of a continuously active and co-evolving predator?prey system. Ecoimmunity views self-tolerance, not as an equilibrium in which autoimmunity is chronically suppressed, but as a symmetrical balanced conflict between the ability of immune cells to destroy tissue cells by numerous mechanisms, and the capacity of adapted tissue cells to avoid predation. This balance evolves during ontogeny, in parallel to immune adaptations, embryonic tissue cells adapt their phenotype to the corresponding immune activity by developing the ability to escape or modulate damaging local immune responses. This phenotypic plasticity of tissue cells is directed by epigenetic selection of gene expression pattern and cellular phenotype amidst an ongoing immune pressure. Thus, whereas some immune cells prey predominantly on pathogens and infected cells, self-reactive cells continuously prey on incompetent tissue cells that fail to express the adapted phenotype and resist predation. This model uses ecological generalization to reconcile current contradictory observations as well as classical enigmas related to both autoimmunity and to tolerance toward foreign tissues. Finally, it provides empirical predictions and alternative strategies toward clinical challenges.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract The immune and endocrine systems ensure two vital functions in the body. The immune system protects us from lethal pathogens, whereas the endocrine system ensures proper metabolic function of peripheral organs by regulating systemic homeostasis. These two systems were long thought to operate independently. The immune system uses cytokines and immune receptors, whereas the endocrine system uses hormones to regulate metabolism. However, recent findings show that the immune and endocrine systems closely interact, especially regarding regulation of glucose metabolism. In response to pathogen encounter, cytokines modify responsiveness of peripheral organs to endocrine signals, resulting in altered levels of blood hormones such as insulin, which promotes the ability of the body to fight infection. Here we provide an overview of recent literature describing various mechanisms, which the immune system utilizes to modify endocrine regulation of systemic metabolism. Moreover, we will describe how these immune?endocrine interactions derail in the context of obesity. From a clinical perspective we will elaborate how infection and obesity aggravate the development of metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2 in humans. In summary, this review provides a comprehensive overview of immune-induced changes in systemic metabolism following infection, with a focus on regulation of glucose metabolism.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.

AB  - Abstract The use of alcohol in a dependent or even a regular heavy pattern predisposes the drinker to a range of adverse consequences. These include a risk of direct harm from alcohol, including organ damage, mental health disorders and a range of social and legal problems associated with behaviours due to alcohol's effects. The range of organ damage associated with regular heavy alcohol consumption is well described. Much new information on the mechanisms by which damage occurs is available and is reviewed in this paper. New knowledge can assist in the development of more appropriate management strategies for those affected by the medical complications of alcohol use. Genetic susceptibility to tissue injury is explored and the reasons why many heavy drinkers do not appear to experience organ damage are considered. Approaches to the management of certain alcohol-related disorders are outlined.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adult skeletal muscle can regenerate effectively after mild physical or chemical insult. Muscle trauma or disease can overwhelm this innate capacity for regeneration and result in heightened inflammation and fibrotic tissue deposition resulting in loss of structure and function. Recent studies have focused on biomaterial and stem cell-based therapies to promote skeletal muscle regeneration following injury and disease. Many stem cell populations besides satellite cells are implicated in muscle regeneration. These stem cells include but are not limited to mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, pericytes, fibroadipogenic progenitors, side population cells, and CD133+ stem cells. However, several challenges associated with their isolation, availability, delivery, survival, engraftment, and differentiation have been reported in recent studies. While acellular scaffolds offer a relatively safe and potentially off-the-shelf solution to cell-based therapies, they are often unable to stimulate host cell migration and activity to a level that would result in clinically meaningful regeneration of traumatized muscle. Combining stem cells and biomaterials may offer a viable therapeutic strategy that may overcome the limitations associated with these therapies when they are used in isolation. In this article, we review the stem cell populations that can stimulate muscle regeneration in vitro and in vivo. We also discuss the regenerative potential of combination therapies that utilize both stem cell and biomaterials for the treatment of skeletal muscle injury and disease. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Techniques for selective isolation, labeling, stimulation, and destruction of ameboid microglia allow study of some fundamental questions in neuroimmunology. Examination of surface morphology, proliferative capacity, and cytochemistry suggests that microglia are a class of brain mononuclear phagocytes distinct from blood monocytes, spleen macrophages, or resident peritoneal macrophages. Morover, cultured ameboid microglia isolated from newborn brain can be induced to grow thin cytoplasmic projectios several hundred microns in length; these process-bearing cells resemble a differentiated form of microglia found in adult brain. Ameboid microglia may contribute to brain inflammation by engulfing debris, by releasing cytotoxins, by killing neighboring cells, and by secreting astroglial growth factors. Importantly, ameboid microglia are closely tied to a network of immunomodulators that include colony-stimulating factors and Interluekin-1. The presence of activated microglia during normal embryogenesis and at sites of penetrating brain injury suggests that these cells serve as important effectors linking the immune system with growth and repqir of the CNS.
