AB  - Abstract Techniques for selective isolation, labeling, stimulation, and destruction of ameboid microglia allow study of some fundamental questions in neuroimmunology. Examination of surface morphology, proliferative capacity, and cytochemistry suggests that microglia are a class of brain mononuclear phagocytes distinct from blood monocytes, spleen macrophages, or resident peritoneal macrophages. Morover, cultured ameboid microglia isolated from newborn brain can be induced to grow thin cytoplasmic projectios several hundred microns in length; these process-bearing cells resemble a differentiated form of microglia found in adult brain. Ameboid microglia may contribute to brain inflammation by engulfing debris, by releasing cytotoxins, by killing neighboring cells, and by secreting astroglial growth factors. Importantly, ameboid microglia are closely tied to a network of immunomodulators that include colony-stimulating factors and Interluekin-1. The presence of activated microglia during normal embryogenesis and at sites of penetrating brain injury suggests that these cells serve as important effectors linking the immune system with growth and repqir of the CNS.

AB  - Personalized medicine is rapidly becoming a reality in today's physical medicine. However, as yet this is largely an aspirational goal in psychiatry, despite significant advances in our understanding of the biochemical, genetic and neurobiological processes underlying major mental disorders. Preventive medicine relies on the availability of predictive tools; in psychiatry we still largely lack these. Furthermore, our current diagnostic systems, with their focus on well-established, largely chronic illness, do not support a pre-emptive, let alone a preventive, approach, since it is during the early stages of a disorder that interventions have the potential to offer the greatest benefit. Here, we present a clinical staging model for severe mental disorders and discuss examples of biological markers that have already undergone some systematic evaluation and that could be integrated into such a framework. The advantage of this model is that it explicitly considers the evolution of psychopathology during the development of a mental illness and emphasizes that progression of illness is by no means inevitable, but can be altered by providing appropriate interventions that target individual modifiable risk and protective factors. The specific goals of therapeutic intervention are therefore broadened to include the prevention of illness onset or progression, and to minimize the risk of harm associated with more complex treatment regimens. The staging model also facilitates the integration of new data on the biological, social and environmental factors that influence mental illness into our clinical and diagnostic infrastructure, which will provide a major step forward in the development of a truly pre-emptive psychiatry.

AB  - Abstract Primary objective: To evaluate a multicentre clinical trial design for testing powered toothbrushes. Secondary objective:? To compare the efficacy of a prototype brush head (N2.3) for the Philips Jordan Sensiflex 2000 powered toothbrush (PTB) to that of Braun Oral-B D15 PTB in removing dental plaque Material and methods:? 137 volunteers (ages 18?25?years) were recruited to this 3-centre, 2-week, 2-group, 2-treatment, single-blind trial. Plaque was recorded at screening and again 14?days later at baseline. Stratification of subjects, for gender and screening PI, occurred at baseline. Subjects were then asked to abstain from all oral hygiene measures for 48?h followed by a supervised episode of brushing for 3?min with the allocated PTB. The allocated PTB was used at home for the next 12?days before a second abstinence from all oral hygiene measures for the 48?h prior to a second supervised brushing episode. Plaque levels were scored using a modification of the Quigley & Hein plaque index (PI) at full mouth (FM), interproximal (IP) and smooth surfaces (SS). To enable the means of the within subject differences (pre to postbrushing) to be compared between groups PIs were recorded before and after the supervised brushing episodes, differences between centres, groups and visits were examined. Results: No significant differences in PI between groups at screening, baseline or prior to the supervised brushings were detected (P?>?0.05 anova). The results of the analysis of variance showed there to be a highly significant difference (P?<?0.001) between brushing groups, but, significant differences between centres (P?<?0.001) and a significant interaction effect between centre and brushing group (P?<?0.001) was also detected. Therefore the difference between groups was not present at all three centres. Further examination of the single centre data showed there to be greater levels of plaque removed by the N2.3 compared to the D15 (FM reduction in PI 1.95 vs. 1.13, respectively) at centre 3 in contrast to the other two centres where no difference was detected. The precise reason for these differences could not be established. Conclusions:? A multicentre study design is applicable for evaluating PTBs but a minimum of 3 centres should be included so that differences between centres can be identified. The prototype brush head N2.3 for the Philips Jordan Sensiflex 2000 PTB has comparable plaque removal efficacy to the Braun Oral-B D15 PTB at FM, IP and SS sites.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - The cognitive and behavioral deficits caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the immature brain are more severe and persistent than injuries to the adult brain. Understanding this developmental sensitivity is critical because children under 4 years of age of sustain TBI more frequently than any other age group. One of the first events after TBI is the infiltration and degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in the brain, releasing a range of immunomodulatory substances; inhibition of these cells is neuroprotective in other types of neonatal brain injury. This study investigates for the first time the role of MCs in mediating injury in a P7 mouse model of pediatric contusion-induced TBI. We show that various neural cell types express histamine receptors and that histamine exacerbates excitotoxic cell death in primary cultured neurons. Cromoglycate, an inhibitor of MC degranulation, altered the inflammatory phenotype of microglia activated by TBI, reversing several changes but accentuating others, when administered before TBI. However, without regard to the time of cromoglycate administration, inhibiting MC degranulation did not affect cell loss, as evaluated by ventricular dilatation or cleaved caspase-3 labeling, or the density of activated microglia, neurons, or myelin. In double-heterozygous cKit mutant mice lacking MCs, this overall lack of effect was confirmed. These results suggest that the role of MCs in this model of pediatric TBI is restricted to subtle effects and that they are unlikely to be viable neurotherapeutic targets. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Sepsis is characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection that is associated with high morbidity and mortality despite optimal care. Invariant natural killer T (iNK?T) cells are potent regulatory lymphocytes that can produce pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus shaping the course and nature of immune responses; however, little is known about their role in sepsis. We demonstrate here that patients with sepsis/severe sepsis have significantly elevated proportions of iNK?T cells in their peripheral blood (as a percentage of their circulating T cells) compared to non-septic patients. We therefore investigated the role of iNK?T cells in a mouse model of intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). Our data show that iNK?T cells are pathogenic in IAS, and that T helper type 2 (Th2) polarization of iNK?T cells using the synthetic glycolipid OCH significantly reduces mortality from IAS. This reduction in mortality is associated with the systemic elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 and reduction of several proinflammatory cytokines within the spleen, notably interleukin (IL)-17. Finally, we show that treatment of sepsis with OCH in mice is accompanied by significantly reduced apoptosis of splenic T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, but not natural killer cells. We propose that modulation of iNK?T cell responses towards a Th2 phenotype may be an effective therapeutic strategy in early sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Few treatments for human diseases have received as much investigation in the past 20 years as probiotics. In 2017, English-language meta-analyses totaling 52 studies determined the effect of probiotics on conditions ranging from necrotizing enterocolitis and colic in infants to constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy in adults. The strongest evidence in favor of probiotics lies in the prevention or treatment of 5 disorders: necrotizing enterocolitis, acute infectious diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and infant colic. Probiotic mechanisms of action include the inhibition of bacterial adhesion; enhanced mucosal barrier function; modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems (including induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells); secretion of bioactive metabolites; and regulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Future research is needed to identify the optimal probiotic and dose for specific diseases, to address whether the addition of prebiotics (to form synbiotics) would enhance activity, and to determine if defined microbial communities would provide benefit exceeding that of single-species probiotics.
