AB  - Summary Over-nutrition and its late consequences are a dominant theme in medicine today. In addition to the health hazards brought on by over-nutrition, the medical community has recently accumulated a roster of health benefits with obesity, grouped under ?obesity paradox.? Throughout the world and throughout history until the 20th century, under-nutrition was a dominant evolutionary force. Under-nutrition brings with it a mix of benefits and detriments that are opposite to and continuous with those of over-nutrition. This continuum yields J-shaped or U-shaped curves relating body mass index to mortality. The overweight have an elevated risk of dying in middle age of degenerative diseases while the underweight are at increased risk of premature death from infectious conditions. Micronutrient deficiencies, major concerns of nutritional science in the 20th century, are being neglected. This ?hidden hunger? is now surprisingly prevalent in all weight groups, even among the overweight. Because micronutrient replacement is safe, inexpensive, and predictably effective, it is now an exceptionally attractive target for therapy across the spectrum of weight and age. Nutrition-related conditions worthy of special attention from caregivers include excess vitamin A, excess vitamin D, and deficiency of magnesium.

AB  - Background To date there are no biomarkers with proven reliability as a measure of disease burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of our study is to assess the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples as a measure of disease activity and progression in ALS. Methods Thirty-seven consecutive patients with ALS, 25 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and 21 with other neurodegenerative diseases were evaluated. CSF NFL levels were assayed by two-site solid-phase sandwich ELISA. In patients with ALS, neurological status was assessed by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-r) and the Medical Research Council scale, and the progression of the disease was evaluated using the ?diagnostic delay? and the ?progression rate?. Results Cerebrospinal fluid NFL levels were higher in ALS cases than in controls (P < 0.0001). Using receiver operating curve analysis, an optimal NFL cut-off of 1981 ng/l discriminated between patients with ALS and neurological controls, with a sensitivity of 78.4% and specificity of 72.5%. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed the association between CSF NFL levels and the presence of ALS (age and sex adjusted odds ratio for ALS 8.9; 95% CI 3.1?25.8; P < 0.0001). In ALS, CSF NFL negatively correlated with the diagnostic delay (P < 0.0001) and the ALSFRS-r (P = 0.014) and positively with the progression rate (P < 0.0001). Conclusions High CSF NFL levels were found in patients with ALS, reflecting the burden of neurodegeneration. The significant relation between CSF NFL levels and disease progression suggests that NFL may be a useful marker of disease activity and progression in ALS.

AB  - Pancreatitis is a gastrointestinal disease with a worldwide sharp surge during the past decade. Pancreatitis includes acute and chronic subtypes, which are graded based on the amount of pancreatic inflammation. Phytoconstituents represent a promising class of therapeutic agents with wide acceptability not only based on folk practices but sound presence of pharmacological and molecular evidences. Growing research evidence indicates that different molecular mechanisms are involved in their protective effect. Many phytoremedies have been tried for the treatment of pancreatic injuries and have shown success in preclinical animal models of pancreatitis. The literature was largely collected through PubMed and Google scholar database. A large proportion of phytochemicals targets the inflammatory cascade and modulates the overtly acting redox balance among which nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells is the key molecule. Inhibition of apoptosis (artemisinin, embelin), inflammasome (withaferin A), neutrophil rolling (fucoidan), Ca+2 release (caffeine), mitogen activated protein kinase (guggulsterone) and many other novel mechanisms apart from antioxidant effect have been postulated behind the protective effect of phytoconstituents. The present review deals to fill the gap of hitherto unavailable comprehensive review on various plant products screened for the treatment of pancreatitis. The possible mechanistic profile of these phytochemicals is summarized. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a diverse pathologic process, defined as the formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.
