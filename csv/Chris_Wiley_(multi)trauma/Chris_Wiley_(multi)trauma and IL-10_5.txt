AB  - Abstract Background Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes motor and sensory defects, has strong impact on life quality and still has no effective therapy. Miconazole is one of the most widely used antifungal drugs; the aims of the study were to investigate the effects of miconazole during sciatic nerve regeneration in a mouse model of sciatic nerve crush injury. Methods We established peripheral nerve crush model and investigated the effects of miconazole by multiple aspects. We further studied the potential mechanism of action of miconazole by Western blotting, fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and PCR analysis. Results Miconazole improves the symptoms of crushed nerve by improving inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelinating myelin of sciatic nerve. Affected by miconazole, the proportion of inflammatory M1 macrophages in the distal part of the sciatic nerve was reduced, and the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was increased. Finally, the neuroprotective properties of miconazole may be regulated by the nuclear factor (NF)-?B pathway. Conclusions Our data suggest that miconazole can effectively alleviate PNI, and the mechanism involves mediating a phenotype change of M1/ M2 macrophages. Thus, miconazole may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for nerve crush injury.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) treatment initiating after inflammation stage on the process of bone-tendon junction (BTJ) healing in a rabbit model. Thirty-six rabbits undergoing partial patellectomy were randomly divided into two groups: control and LIPUS. The period of initial inflammatory stage is 2 weeks. So LIPUS treatment was initiated at postoperative week 2 and continued until the patella-patellar tendon (PPT) complexes were harvested at postoperative weeks 4, 8, and 16. At each time point, the PPT complexes were harvested for qRT-PCR, histology, radiographs, synchroton radiation micro computed tomography (SR-µCT), and biomechanical testing. The qRT-PCR results showed that LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 played an anti-inflammatory role in BTJ healing. Histologically, the LIPUS group showed more advanced remodeling of the lamellar bone and marrow cavity than the control group. The area and length of the new bone in the LIPUS group were significantly greater than the control group at postoperative weeks 8 and 16. SR-µCT demonstrated that new bone formation and remodeling in the LIPUS group were more advanced than the control group. Biomechanical test results demonstrated that the failure load, ultimate strength and energy at failure were significantly higher than those of the control group. In conclusion, LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 was able to accelerate bone formation during the bone-tendon junction healing process and significantly improved the healing quality of BTJ injury. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by deterioration in kidney function resulting in multisystem abnormalities. Much of the morbidity and mortality associated with AKI result from a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This study described herein is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter US study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) treatment on AKI requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the ICU. The study enrolled 35 subjects. The mean age was 56.3?±?15. With regard to race, 71.4% of the subjects were Caucasian, 22.9% were Black, and 5.7% were Hispanic. Average SOFA score was 11.3?±?3.6. Death from any cause at Day 60 was 31.4%. Renal recovery, defined as dialysis independence, was observed in all of the surviving subjects at Day 60. The results of this pilot study indicate the potential for a substantial improvement in patient outcomes over standard of care therapy, which is associated with a greater than 50% 60-day mortality in the literature. The SCD warrants further study in scientifically sound, pivotal trial to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

AB  - Hepatic IR (ischemia reperfusion) injury is a commonly encountered obstacle in the post-operative management of hepatic surgery. Hepatic IR occurs during ?Pringle maneuver? for reduction of blood loss or during a brief period of cold storage followed by reperfusion of liver grafts. The stress induced during hepatic IR, triggers a spectrum of cellular responses leading to the varying degrees of hepatic complications which in turn affect the post operative care. Different preconditioning methods either activate or subdue different sets of molecular signals, resulting in varied levels of protection against hepatic IR injury. Yet, there is a serious lacuna in the knowledge regarding the choice of preconditioning methods and the resulting molecular changes in order to assess the efficiency and choice of these methods correctly. This review provides an update on the various preconditioning approaches such as surgical/ischemic, antioxidant, pharmaceutical and genetic preconditioning strategies published during last six years (2009?2015). Further, we discuss the attenuation or inhibition of specific inflammatory, apoptotic and necrotic markers in the various experimental models of liver IR subjected to different preconditioning strategies. While enlisting the controversies in the ischemic preconditioning strategy, we bring out the uncertainties in the existing molecular targets and their reliability in the attenuation of hepatic IR injury. Future research studies would include the novel preconditioning strategies employ i) the targeted gene silencing of key molecular targets inducing IR, ii) hyper expression of beneficial molecular signals against IR via gene transfer techniques. The above studies would see the combination of these latest techniques with the established preconditioning strategies for better post-operative hepatic management.

AB  - Objective To compare indicators of systemic inflammatory response in the second trimester in women who developed pre-eclampsia with normal pregnancies. Design Prospective nested case control study derived from a cohort of 2190 pregnant women. Blood samples were obtained at 18 weeks of gestation. The following inflammatory parameters were measured: tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, IL-10, microCRP and tissue factor (TF). Setting Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Oslo, and Department of Medical Genetics, Ullevål University Hospital and Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aker University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Sample The cases were 71 women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia. The controls were 71 healthy, pregnant women matched for age, parity and first trimester body mass index (BMI). Methods Venous blood was drawn from fasting subjects into 5 mL test tubes containing EDTA. Samples were analysed for inflammatory parameters : IL-1-?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, PAI-1, TF (ELISA-technique) and CRP (latex-enhanced immunonephelometric assay), strictly according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Main outcome measures The matched case and control subjects were compared by the paired two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. All P values were two-tailed and P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results We found no differences in plasma concentrations of PAI-1, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, microCRP, TNF-α or TF at 18 weeks of gestation between women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia and matched control women. Conclusion In contrast to findings from women with overt pre-eclampsia, the present study indicates that there are no indications of intensified systemic inflammatory response at 18 weeks of gestation in women who later develop pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Inflammatory and immune responses play important roles following ischaemic stroke. Inflammatory responses contribute to damage and also contribute to repair. Injury to tissue triggers an immune response. This is initiated through activation of the innate immune system. In stroke there is microglial activation. This is followed by an influx of lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain, triggered by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response contributes to further tissue injury. There is also a systemic immune response to stroke, and there is a degree of immunosuppression that may contribute to the stroke patient's risk of infection. This immunosuppressive response may also be protective, with regulatory lymphocytes producing cytokines and growth factors that are neuroprotective. The specific targets of the immune response after stroke are not known, and the details of the immune and inflammatory responses are only partly understood. The role of inflammation and immune responses after stroke is twofold. The immune system may contribute to damage after stroke, but may also contribute to repair processes. The possibility that some of the immune response after stroke may be neuroprotective is exciting and suggests that deliberate enhancement of these responses may be a therapeutic option.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - Adult multipotent stem/progenitor cells, with remarkable regenerative potential, have been isolated from various components of the human periodontium. These multipotent stem/progenitor cells include the periodontal ligament stem/progenitor cells (PDLSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), the gingival mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (G-MSCs), and the alveolar bone proper stem/progenitor cells (AB-MSCs). Whereas inflammation is regarded as the reason for tissue damage, it also remains a fundamental step of any early healing process. In performing their periodontal tissue regenerative/reparative activity, periodontal stem/progenitor cells interact with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environmental, through their expressed receptors, which could influence their fate and the outcome of any periodontal stem/progenitor cell-mediated reparative/regenerative activity. The present review discusses the current understanding about the interaction of periodontal stem/progenitor cells with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environment, elaborates on the inflammatory factors influencing their stemness, proliferation, migration/homing, differentiation, and immunomodulatory attributes, the possible underlying intracellular mechanisms, as well as their proposed relationship to the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.

AB  - Abstract Plants have emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional mammalian cell cultures or microbial cell-based systems system for the production of valuable recombinant proteins. Through recombinant DNA technology, plants can be engineered to produce large quantities of pharmaceuticals and industrial proteins of high quality at low costs. The recombinant production, by transgenic plants, of therapeutic proteins normally present in human plasma, such as cytokines, coagulation factors, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulins, represents a response to the ongoing challenges in meeting the demand for therapeutic proteins to treat serious inherited or acquired bleeding and immunological diseases. As the clinical utilization of fractionated plasma molecules is limited by high production costs, using recombinant biopharmaceuticals derived from plants represents a feasible alternative to provide efficient treatment. Plant-derived pharmaceuticals also reduce the potential risks to patients of infection with pathogens or unwanted immune responses due to immunogenic antigens. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in molecular farming of cytokines. We also examine the technological basis, upcoming challenges, and perspectives for the biosynthesis and detection of these molecules in different plant production platforms.

AB  - Abstract? Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a physiological gas found at low levels in the atmosphere and produced in cells during the process of aerobic respiration. Consequently, the levels of CO2 within tissues are usually significantly higher than those found externally. Shifts in tissue levels of CO2 (leading to either hypercapnia or hypocapnia) are associated with a number of pathophysiological conditions in humans and can occur naturally in niche habitats such as those of burrowing animals. Clinical studies have indicated that such altered CO2 levels can impact upon disease progression. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CO2 has shown that like other physiological gases such as molecular oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO), CO2 levels can be sensed by cells resulting in the initiation of physiological and pathophysiological responses. Acute CO2 sensing in neurons and peripheral and central chemoreceptors is important in rapidly activated responses including olfactory signalling, taste sensation and cardiorespiratory control. Furthermore, a role for CO2 in the regulation of gene transcription has recently been identified with exposure of cells and model organisms to high CO2 leading to suppression of genes involved in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation. This latter, transcriptional regulatory role for CO2, has been largely attributed to altered activity of the NF-?B family of transcription factors. Here, we review our evolving understanding of how CO2 impacts upon gene transcription.
