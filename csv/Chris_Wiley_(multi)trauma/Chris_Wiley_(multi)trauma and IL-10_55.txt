AB  - Background:? Bilayered cell therapy (BLCT) is a significant advancement in the field of wound healing. BLCT expresses multiple growth factors found in normal skin, and provides a biologically active matrix in chronic wounds. Antibiotic-resistant bacterium continues to be a major problem in chronic wounds. The use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents could be one of the first steps in prevention of wound infection, although their use with BLCT is limited due to reported toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Objectives:? This study was designed to see whether a topical antimicrobial agent is able to permeate through the BLCT and inhibits the growth of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin was used because of its lack of toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Methods:? MRSA (ATCC# 33591) strain was used for these studies. The entire surface of blood agar plates were covered with a high inoclum of MRSA. BLCT specimens were placed on the agar plates and mupirocin was then applied on the top surface. As a positive control, mupirocin was applied directly on the agar plate, while BLCT specimens alone were used as negative control. The plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours after which the zones of inhibition were assessed. Results:? Placing mupirocin on top of BLCT gave a 41.9?±?17.2?mm inhibition zone diameter. Although it was smaller than the inhibition zone diameter produced by direct administration of mupirocin (26.3?±?9.4?mm), this difference was not statistically significant. BLCT by itself did not create a zone of inhibition. Conclusion:? Mupirocin is able to permeate BLCT and inhibit the bacterial growth underneath it. This study may have important clinical implications.

AB  - Various matrices containing both synthetic or natural polymers are currently used for local regional drug delivery to a number of disease locations such as chronic cutaneous wounds, joints, bone, muscle, and nerves. Insert Therapeutics has developed a novel synthetic matrix which consists of a copolymer of ?-cyclodextrin and polyethylene-glycol (PEG). Addition of di- or multifunctionalized adamantane-PEG molecules results in noncovalent cross-linking through inclusion complex formation. The resulting hydrogel showed rheological characteristics amenable to topical application or local-regional injection into a variety of tissues (Bellocq et al. (2004) Bioconjug Chem 15(6): 1201?1211). This matrix was shown to be biocompatible, allowing for cellular growth and migration in vitro. It also allowed for efficient delivery of an adenovirus gene therapy vector to dermal fibroblast cells. In vivo, the matrix demonstrated efficient delivery of biotherapeutics such as recombinant adenovirus and non-viral gene therapy vectors after intradermal injection. The matrix was well tolerated and was as efficient as collagen in promoting wound healing when an adenoviral gene therapy vector expressing PDGF-bb was delivered to cutaneous wounds of diabetic mice. The matrix can additionally be modified to incorporate therapeutic small molecules, peptides, or proteins, either through inclusion complex formation or chemical linkage. Using biodegradable linker chemistry, the release rate of covalently attached molecules can be controlled. The cyclodextrin-PEG matrix is therefore an attractive alternative to existing matrices that is biocompatible, biodegradable, tunable with regard to its physicochemical properties, and can be designed to deliver multiple therapeutic agents to a variety of tissues in a controlled fashion.

AB  - Introduction:? Open wounds following oncologic reresection of skin cancer of the hand can be problematic from a soft tissue reconstructive perspective. First, these wounds must often await definitive coverage until permanent negative margin clearance is obtained. This results in the morbidity of chronic painful dressing changes and possible infection. Secondly, for defects of the first web space, the reconstructive options are often limited to skin grafting which can yield functional hazards with contracted healing. Acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold for subsequent skin grafting. Hypothesis:? We proposed to use acellular dermis for wounds stemming from reresection of skin cancers of the first web space to: 1)? obviate dressing changes until permanent histology was confirmed 2)? provide a soft tissue platform that enhances subsequent skin graft take and healing and ameliorates potential graft contracture Methods:? The resected wound area of two patients, 11???5 and 5???4?cm in size, were transiently covered with acellular dermis in the first stage. After confirmation of final histologic clearance of tumor at the margins, split thickness skin graft was placed on the granulating wound bed. Subsequent clinical examination and DASH questionnaires were used to assess outcome. Results:? After 6 months, wounds had healed with good cosmetic result. No contracture of the web space was noted. Average DASH score was 20.5 and no recurrences were noted. Conclusion:? Our observations suggest that acellular dermis is a useful adjunct for covering wounds of the hand, especially for functionally important locations such as the first dorsal web space.

AB  - Background:? Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as an important hospital-acquired pathogen, especially in surgery, burn, and intensive care units. Due to its ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials, wound infection with A. baumannii is difficult to treat, and can lead to septicemia and even death. Use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents in these circumstances could be one of the first steps in prevention of A. baumannii wound infection. Objectives:? In this study, we will discuss the in vitro effects of seven common topical antimicrobial creams and dressings on A. baumannii. Methods:? A. Baumannii ATCC# 6919 was subjected to sensitivity tests against mupirocin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, a double antibiotic combination of polymyxin and bacitracin, a triple antibiotic combination of Neomycin, bacitracin and polymyxin, and two silver-containing dressings. Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 hours incubation period. Results and Conclusion:? Of the evaluated antimicrobial agents, mafenide acetate was the most efficacious followed by mupirocin, triple and double antibiotic combinations in decreasing order. The silver-containing dressings yielded a lesser zone of inhibition as compared to the previously mentioned, and no zone of inhibition was observed using silver sulfadiazine. Further in vivo studies on the effect of antimicrobial agents against A. Baumannii are necessary to substantiate these findings and determine the potential clinical relevance of these therapies.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are major components of the innate defense system that present microbicidal activity against gram positive and negative bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses. The human cathelicidin LL-37 is expressed in skin upon wounding and, in addition to its role in antimicrobial defense, it has also been previously demonstrated that this peptide might be involved in reepithelization. We have generated an adenoviral vector containing the complete sequence of LL-37 along with an Ires-GFP expression cassette. The efficacy of this vector was probed by testing the conditioned medium from adenoviral transduced keratinocytes in preventing bacterial growth. We have studied the in vitro effects of LL-37 on HK migration and proliferation. In addition, we have efficiently transduced human skin grafts (in immunodeficient mice) using an in vivo gene transfer approach and we are currently testing the involvement of this peptide in wound repair.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.
