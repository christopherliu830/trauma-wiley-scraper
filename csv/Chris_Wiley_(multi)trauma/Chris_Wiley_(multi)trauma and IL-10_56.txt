AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are major components of the innate defense system that present microbicidal activity against gram positive and negative bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses. The human cathelicidin LL-37 is expressed in skin upon wounding and, in addition to its role in antimicrobial defense, it has also been previously demonstrated that this peptide might be involved in reepithelization. We have generated an adenoviral vector containing the complete sequence of LL-37 along with an Ires-GFP expression cassette. The efficacy of this vector was probed by testing the conditioned medium from adenoviral transduced keratinocytes in preventing bacterial growth. We have studied the in vitro effects of LL-37 on HK migration and proliferation. In addition, we have efficiently transduced human skin grafts (in immunodeficient mice) using an in vivo gene transfer approach and we are currently testing the involvement of this peptide in wound repair.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Cortisol has been shown to impact upon wound healing through its immunosuppressive properties, and its release is modulated by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which is involved in fear and stress reactions. This study assessed the role of the CeA in modulating proinflammatory chemokine expression following wounding, under both stress and nonstress conditions. Bilaterally CeA-lesioned rhesus monkeys and nonoperated controls received separate dermal wounds on 3 consecutive days. Six hours postwounding, tissue biopsies were obtained from each wound. Following this, animals were subjected to 2?h of confinement as a stressor. Thus, examination of tissues on day 1 represented a nonstressed condition, and on days 2?3 a stressed condition. Using real-time PCR, we determined mRNA expression for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] in wounded and unwounded tissue, two chemokines critical in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in response to tissue injury. Analyses revealed that tissue mRNA levels for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] were increased in both groups following wounding. However, these rises were significantly greater in CeA-lesioned animals than controls. Repeated stress (confinement) attenuated these increases in mRNA expression equally in both groups (days 2?3). These results indicate that the inflammatory response to skin wounds is modulated, in part, by the amygdala. However, stress-induced alterations in inflammation are not CeA dependent for this particular stressor. Importantly, this finding indicates that a lesion of a central brain structure can impact upon peripheral wound healing parameters. (Supported by P50 DE-13749, MH46729, MH52354, MH61083)

AB  - Background:? Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important inflammatory mediator, which has been shown to regulate fibroblast chemotaxis and extracellular matrix production through four G-coupled protein receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4). Previous studies have linked abnormal PGE2 signaling with the development of improper damage repair and tissue fibrosis in the airway. This study begins to address the role of PGE2 in dermal fibrosis, particularly keloid formation. Such an analysis is consistent with data indicating inflammatory/immune abnormalities associated with keloids. Hypothesis:? Keloid fibroblasts respond to PGE2 appropriately, but in a quantitatively diminished manner. Methods:? Cultured fibroblasts from normal human skin and keloid lesions were used for these studies. Fibroblast migration was assayed using a well established two dimensional motility assay. Collagen production was analyzed using Western blot and commercial ELISA methodology. Results:? Administration of PGE2 decreased keloid fibroblast migration in a dose-dependent manner, via a mechanism which appears to involve the EP2/EP4-cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway. PGE2 reversed the transforming growth factor ?-1-induced increase in collagen type I in both normal and keloid fibroblasts. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results, which show that the response of keloid fibroblasts to PGE2 is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to normal fibroblasts. PGE2 decreases the rates of migration and collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts, raising the possibility that exogenous PGE2 may have potential therapeutic applications to reduce keloid formation.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, inducing angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis, all processes essential to wound healing. However, the same mediators have been implicated in pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, vascular occlusion, and necrotic tissue damage. We have previously shown that hyperbaric oxygen caused a prolonged elevation of VEGF and delayed wound healing in a rat model of tissue ischemia. In this study we examine the effect of the ROS scavenger, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), on ischemic wound healing. NAC is a virtually nontoxic free radical scavenger that has been used in many experimental studies to block ROS-mediated signaling. Methods:? Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the ischemic flap previously validated by this laboratory. This model provides two ischemic and two nonischemic excisional wounds. Rats were treated daily with HBO for 90 minutes at 2.4?atm, HBO plus 150?mg/kg NAC intraperitoneal, or control (neither HBO nor NAC). Wounds were analyzed for surface area, lactate, and VEGF. Results:? The HBO/NAC-treated animals had markedly impaired healing of their ischemic wounds at day 7 (0.105?±?.005?cm vs. 0.068?±?.002?cm for ctl and 0.064?±?.006 for HBO) and a twofold elevation of VEGF (120?pg/mg protein vs. 60?pg/mg protein). Lactate levels were not altered by NAC treatment and non-ischemic wounds showed no difference in healing, lactate, or VEGF. Conclusion:? Reactive oxygen species are required for wound healing. Our initial hypothesis was that the delay in wound closure with HBO treatment was due to excess ROS and that NAC would improve healing. The finding of elevated VEGF and delayed wound healing in the presence of a potent free radical scavenger suggests that blocking ROS signaling prevents the normal mitogenic response to VEGF. Additional studies to examine the VEGF receptor and tyrosine kinase activation will further elucidate the mechanism of ROS signaling in response to HBO treatment.

AB  - Clinical Problem:? An 89-year-old white male presented to his dermatologist with a pressure ulcer on his left medial foot. He was not a surgical candidate (CHF, pacemaker, edema) and not diabetic. Past Management:? For 2 years the dermatologist provided standard of care therapies treating the wound with regular debridements and Regranex therapy. The wound remained unhealed. At the age of 91 the patient developed osteomyelitis. Antibiotic therapies were initiated. Current Clinical Approach:? In addition to antibiotic therapy the patient agreed to have a continuous supply of oxygen delivered transdermally to the wound at a rate of 3?ml/hour from a device that derived pure oxygen from atmospheric air (EpiFLOSD) as the patient ambulated. 24/7 oxygen therapy was used in conjunction with a fully occlusive Johnson & Johnson 3????4? island dressing. Patient Outcomes:? After 3 weeks of continuous oxygen and antibiotic therapies the patient was able to ambulate without pain. The planned amputation was canceled. The wound bed was characterized by new granulation tissue and reepithelialization. The antibiotic treatment was discontinued after 30 days, but the tiny, 2 ounce oxygen therapy device was continued until full wound closure 11 weeks later. The wound remained closed for 36 months, the remainder of the patient?s life. Conclusions:? The effectiveness of the antibiotics in this patient as well as other oxygen-sensitive wound healing processes may have been potentiated and enhanced by the continuous availability of oxygen at this dosage. Further carefully controlled studies of transdermal sustained oxygen delivery for the treatment of chronic wounds with osteomyelitis are needed to clarify the underlying scientific mechanisms of this beneficial effect. The support of Ogenix Corporation in supplying EpiFLOSD for this project is appreciated.

AB  - We have previously reported that local injection of small doses of long-acting insulin-zinc suspension maintained sufficiently high insulin concentration in the wound fluid and accelerated the healing. The present experiment was to measure the rates of cell proliferation (reflected by DNA synthesis) and protein metabolism in the wound. These are the underlying metabolic processes responsible for the healing. Partial thickness skin donor wound was created on the back and indwelling catheters were placed in the carotid artery and jugular vein in adult rabbits under general anesthesia. The wound was covered with Aquaphor gauze, OpSite membrane, and surgical gauze. On day 7 after wounding, the wound was either injected with 0.2 units of insulin-Zn, Zn alone, or no injection; stable isotopes were infused into the jugular vein catheter in conscious rabbits for measurement of DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and breakdown in the wound. The local insulin-Zn injection raised wound insulin concentration to 168?±?39??U/ml. In contrast, in the control and Zn groups wound insulin concentrations were below the detectable level. The local injection of insulin-Zn suspension increased (p?=?0.03) DNA synthesis in the wound with minor changes in blood glucose concentration which did not require exogenous glucose replacement. In the Zn group, whereas the rate of DNA synthesis tended to increase (p?=?0.051 vs. control), the protein net balance (synthesis ? breakdown) was lower (p?<?0.05) than those in the control and insulin-Zn (Table 1). We conclude that local injection of a small dose (0.2 units insulin) long-acting insulin-Zn suspension stimulated wound DNA synthesis without major systemic side effects thereby providing an effective and safe approach to accelerate wound healing. Although local Zn injection might also stimulate wound DNA synthesis, the benefit on the healing process was limited by decreased net protein deposition. 1 Wound DNA and protein metabolism.

AB  - Background:? Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate the healing of venous leg and diabetic foot ulcerations. It appears to function as cell-based therapy (e.g., delivering growth factors), rather than as a true graft. Given this mechanism of action, its use could be expanded to areas in which traditional skin grafting is not routinely employed. Methods:? A 64-year-old wheel-chairbound Caucasian male presented to the wound clinic with a grade III left trochanteric pressure ulcer which had been present since 1976. He had been seen by numerous physicians and treated with debridement, topical antimicrobials, negative pressure therapy, growth factors, and a variety of dressings. We spent several months preparing the wound bed: maintaining adequate moisture balance, performing serial debridement, utilizing offloading surfaces and reducing the bacterial burden. His nutritional status was optimized. The wound bed developed a healthy granulating base but failed to close. Results:? A single unit of Apligraf was meshed at a 1:1.5 ratio and applied to the wound. It was fixed in place using a nonstick silicone dressing, foam, and a self-adhesive covering. The dressing was changed weekly in the wound clinic. The initial response was a decrease in wound depth followed by steady epithelialization. Complete closure occurred 17 weeks after grafting. The wound has not recurred. Conclusion:? This single case study suggests that bilayered cell therapy may have application in difficult wounds, such as pressure ulcerations. Further study into the efficacy of Apligraf in pressure ulcerations is ongoing.

AB  - In persons with venous ulcers and an absence of arterial disease, high compression as exemplified by the four layer bandage (Profore) has been demonstrated to be effective by a meta-analysis of existing studies. Despite optimized compression, some venous ulcers do not heal at the expected rate and persistent inflammation or infection may delay or prevent healing. We report the results of a case series that demonstrates an ionized silver dressing with prolonged release of nanocrystalline crystals (Acticoat 7) can decrease bacterial burden and accelerate healing in venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under a four layer bandage (Profore) for 12 weeks, or until healing. The primary efficacy objective measured the effect of the silver dressing on the wound microflora. Biopsies of the wounds were taken at baseline and after treatment with the silver dressing (Acticoat 7) and were analyzed for the bacterial species and number of bacteria present. In addition, serum silver levels were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and week 12 or final assessment. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. Of those patients who did not heal, 4 had more than a 94% reduction in wound area by the end of the 12-week study period. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase (p?=?0.054) in serum silver concentration during the treatment period. At baseline, prior to the silver dressing treatment (Acticoat 7), the median silver concentration was 0.3??g/L (range: 0.20?1.90??g/L). The median within patient change from baseline serum silver concentration was an increase of 0.15??g/L (range: ?0.3?2.8??g/L). Although this small increase was observed it was not considered clinically significant. This study illustrates the use of prolonged release nanocrystalline silver dressing to decrease the bacterial burden of chronic venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate.

AB  - Often chronic wounds have an increased bacterial burden that can impair healing without the classical clinical signs of infection. Silver dressings may provide an alternative topical method to control bacterial burden. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 2?4 weeks therapy with the Silver Containing Hydrofiber? dressing on quantitative bacterial burden and clinical improvement in chronic wounds not healing at the expected rate. This was a single centre, four-armed study which included a total of 30 patients with diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and miscellaneous wounds that did not fit into any of the above categories. Patients had a baseline quantitative bacterial biopsy and this was repeated at weeks 2 to 4. The wound size was recorded along with a semi quantitative estimate of exudate and the periwound temperatures. Repeat measurements were performed at the follow-up visits and the decrease in wound size calculated. The underlying cause of the ulceration was be treated and corrected. This was followed by application of silver containing hydrofiber? dressing. There was a significant delay in healing of the leg ulcers associated with increased bacterial burden in the quantitative biopsy bacterial burden results at week 0 and healing at week 2. (p?=?0.01). Other subgroups had a similar association that did not reach statistical significance. The presence of an increased exudate in the leg ulcers at week two was associated with delayed healing at week 4 (p?=?0.05). There was also a significant increase in skin surface temperature of the surrounding skin with an increased quantitative bacterial biopsy of the deep wound compartment for venous, diabetic neurotrophic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers with p values of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.01 respectively. There was no significant decrease in exudate or increased healing of the wounds with the application of the silver hydrofiber dressing in this difficult to heal population. The population studied in this case series had increased bacterial burden in the deep compartment as measured with increased exudate and or an increased temperature of the periwound skin. These patients have an increased bacterial burden in the deep wound compartment that does not respond to topical ionized silver in the dressing studied.

AB  - How wound dressings may act locally to aid chronic wound healing is poorly understood. Along with an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, and the realization that these ulcers exhibit a high degree of inflammation, models have been developed linking the disease etiology and the visible ulcer. Furthermore, these models have suggested ways in which present therapeutic regimens, such as compression, aid healing. However, little focus has been placed on understanding how locally applied wound dressings aid in the overall healing response in the context of elevated inflammation. Here, we propose that if wound dressings have the correct combination of novel materials and physical characteristics they may provide effective management of the damaging local factors (i.e., proteinases and/or bacteria), thereby promoting a local environment supportive of healing. For example, the management of damaging wound exudates, limiting its exposure to the wound bed and surrounding skin, reduces the irritant effects of these exudates, leading to a reduction in the localized stimulation of inflammation. A better understanding of local environment and wound dressing interactions will help in the development of more effective wound dressings in the future.

AB  - We have previously shown that resident fibroblasts from human chronic wounds are phenotypically abnormal, displaying an impaired response to TGF-beta 1, decreased TGF-beta Type II receptor expression, and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2, Smad3, and p42/44 MAPK. We now report that these human cells delay healing by approximately 30% when implanted in mouse incisional wounds and in a dorsal flap model. These new findings point to the need for the transplantation of new healthy cells in human chronic wounds. Bioengineered living skin constructs can deliver new cells to chronic wounds, at least for a limited period of time. However, most available bioengineered skin constructs consist of already differentiated allogeneic cells, which do not allow for the possibility of engraftment and reconstitution of wound structures. Recently, in a preliminary report, we have shown that autologous bone marrow-derived cells can dramatically enhance the healing of recalcitrant chronic wounds when all other treatments have failed. Our present efforts are now focused on characterizing the bone marrow cells involved in this stimulation of wound healing and in developing better ways for their topical delivery to the wound. Here we present evidence that a fibrin construct may be an ideal way of applying bone marrow-derived cells to human chronic wounds. Autologous bone marrow cells are allowed to grow in culture under conditions favoring the survival and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), as shown by surface markers and functional studies. This usually requires two weeks after bone marrow harvesting. The cellular component is then placed in a fibrinogen solution which, when simultaneously combined with thrombin through a CO2 driven flow, delivers a fine cell-containing fibrin polymer film to the wound. In vitro and in vivo experiments, both in mouse models and in human wounds, show the feasibility of this approach.

AB  - Purpose:? The purpose of this study was to determine the current use of wet-to-dry dressings as the principal wound care modality ordered by health care providers. In addition, this study describes the types of wounds wet-to-dry dressings are currently used for, the specialty of health care providers most likely to order these dressings, and associated data that indicates whether or not the clinical condition of the wound warrants the use of wet-to-dry dressing for mechanical debridement. Method:? This descriptive study involved a retrospective chart review of 202 home health and HMO case managed patients with open wounds One hundred and two HMO charts were reviewed; only 74 had sufficient data documented. One hundred and sixty-one home health charts were reviewed; only 128 were appropriate for data collection (closed incisions, drainage tubes, ostomies, and those charts where more than six items on the data collection sheet were not documented in the chart, were not used). The data was analyzed using SPSS. Findings:? This study suggests that the current use of wet-to-dry dressings is over 41% of all principal wound care modalities, followed by enzymatic (7.43%) and dry gauze (6.93%). The majority of wet-to-dry dressings ordered are for surgical wounds (69%), followed by neuropathic ulcers (10%) and pressure ulcers (5.9%). Furthermore, this study suggests that general surgeons are most likely to order wet-to-dry dressings (38%). Data also indicated that in over 78.6% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings, mechanical debridement was not indicated (the percent of granulating tissue in the wound bed was?>?75%). In only 3.5% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings was mechanical debridement possibly indicated by the amount of nonviable tissue in the wound bed. Discussion:? Clinicians need to be involved in research that will lead to evidenced based clinical practice and standardized wound care. The scientific literature suggests that wet-to-dry dressings are not evidenced based, but are detrimental to the granulating wound bed, painful, costly, and one of the least effective methods of debridement available today.

AB  - Induced organ regeneration is de novo synthesis of a physiological, or nearly physiological, organ at the same anatomical site as the organ that is being replaced. Regeneration of skin, peripheral nerves, and the conjunctiva have been accomplished using nothing more than biologically active scaffolds (regeneration templates) seeded with epithelial cells; devices for regeneration of the first two organs are in clinical use. Templates appear to function by blocking contraction well as by acting as temporary configurational guides for synthesis of new stroma that resembles that of the organ under replacement. The combined evidence supports a theory which predicts that selective blocking of the adult healing response uncovers part, at least, of the latent fetal response to injury and, in the presence of the appropriate scaffold, eventually leads to organ regeneration. An independent theory suggests that loss of regenerative potential, which is observed during the mammalian fetal-adult transition, is associated with simultaneous acquisition of individual immunocompetence.

AB  - Background:? The human forearm biopsy model is employed by the Wound Healing Cooperative Group to evaluate the effect of novel agents on acute wounds. Bismuth Subgallate/Borneal (Suile) is a new product with FDA permission for the treatment of partial thickness wounds. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Suile may be effective in the treatment of full thickness wounds because of its antimicrobial, hemostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Methods:? In our randomized, investigator-blinded study, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent two 6?mm full-thickness skin biopsies on the flexor surface of each forearm (two wounds per subject). Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to control (daily bacitracin) or to the treatment arm (daily Suile). The wounds were examined, measured by digital planimetry, and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events and pain levels were monitored. Healing velocity and time-to-complete closure were determined. Results:? The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of wound healing outcomes achieved by the Suile regimen versus bacitracin alone. Subject compliance was excellent. The conduct of the study was further facilitated by the use of handheld electronic documentation. Conclusion:? The forearm biopsy model has several advantages: It allows for a direct comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion, studies can be conducted rapidly with good patient compliance and it allows investigators to gain firsthand experience with products prior to embarking on large clinical trials in chronic wounds.

AB  - Background:? Previously, we showed in a human forearm biopsy model of wound healing that acute healing dynamics can be characterized at the clinical and genetic level. Growth factor application by recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) accelerates the velocity of wound healing and modulates gene expression in wounds. To profile the function, structure, and genomics of acute healing, the human results were compared with a murine model of acute circular and incisional wounds. Methods:? Full thickness 8?mm circular skin wounds and linear surgical incisional wounds were created in 6-week-old Balb-C mice and recombinant angiogenic growth factors (PDGF vs. PDGF/FGF2/VEGF) were administered topically to wounds daily. Velocity of healing and time to complete closure were determined by digital planimetry. Tissue was examined for histopathological, morphometric, functional, and gene expression parameters, and compared to human results. Results:? Acute healing velocity can be quantified and compared in human and murine models. Linear incisions heal in distinct morphological, immunohistochemical and gene expression patterns compared to circular wounds. The cellular profile shows differences between wound types. Topical PDGF accelerates angiogenesis and time to complete acute healing. Human and murine gene expression was correlated. Results will be presented. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan component of normal dermis and a major component of the matrix synthesized during wound healing. Previous studies have shown that uncrosslinked HA is rapidly degraded and cleared in vivo, limiting its clinical utility. We have used a novel HA hydrogel scaffold that is crosslinked for prolonged bioavailability. It has a porous interior and a smooth surface. This scaffold can also be fabricated with collagen and linked to proteins or DNA to direct cell growth and differentiation. We hypothesized that this novel HA formulation might itself improve wound healing by enhancing cell migration. Purpose:? The present study explored the effects of a crosslinked HA hydrogel on wound healing. Methods:? Using an established model of wound healing, four 7?mm punch wounds were made on each ear of New Zealand rabbits. Each wound was immediately treated with topical application of one of the following: HA hydrogel (n?=?26), HA/collagen hydrogel (n?=?27), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)(n?=?16). Wounds were harvested on day 8 for histologic evaluation. Sections were examined for epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth into wounds. Results:? HA- and HA/collagen-treated wounds showed statistically significant increases in epithelial (p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.007, respectively) and granulation tissue ingrowth (p?=?0.004 and p?=?0.01, respectively) when compared to PBS-treated controls. Conclusions:? In the rabbit ear ulcer model, the application of crosslinked HA and HA/collagen hydrogels accelerated wound healing as measured by epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth.

AB  - Aims:? A method to test the axial and transverse tensile properties of skin was developed in order to improve our understanding of the mechanical behavior of skin, and how it changes with the scarring response. This experimental technique was used to investigate the bidirectional mechanics of skin in the juvenile Yorkshire pig model. Methods:? Skin samples were taken upon sacrifice, and all subcutaneous tissue was carefully removed via dissection. Dumbbell-shaped specimens were obtained from the skin using a custom designed stainless steel punch, to provide consistent geometry, and to avoid stress concentrations that can result from specimen gripping. Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions. Specimens were secured in an INSTRON universal test machine with serrated soft tissue grips, elongated to a desired preload, subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period. They were then returned to the original length and failed in tension at constant velocity. Results:? This method of sample preparation indicated high repeatability in specimen geometry, showing standard deviations of 2% and 3% in gauge length and width, respectively (N?=?12). Furthermore, no slippage was observed at the skin/grip interface, and all failures occurred within the specimen gauge length. Conclusions:? This technique shows great promise for evaluating the viscoelastic and failure properties of skin, scar tissue, and pathologic scarring. Combining this biomechanical method with our parallel studies in molecular biology and biochemistry can likely produce correlations between constituent material organization and the mechanical properties of the tissue, as well as provide valuable information for the design of bioengineered tissue constructs.

AB  - Despite recent advances in wound care, chronic infected ulcers still remain a huge challenge to the modern society. Nitric oxide has been identified as a mediator for important biological processes such as vasodilation, antimicrobial, and wound repair. The aim of the present study was to explore the antimicrobial properties of exogenous nitric oxide gas (gNO) as well as its effect on skin cells in vitro. To test this, a specialized gNO chamber was designed to expose S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in saline continuously to 200?ppm gNO or air. A colony count was obtained following gNO treatment. Furthermore, fibroblast-populated collagen gel, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells were cultured in DMEM, KSFM, and M199, respectively. Endothelial migration was tested by a 3D Matrigel tubule formation assay. Fibroblast matrix production and keratinocyte differentiation were monitored by mRNA expression of procollagen type I, interstitial collagenase, and involucrin. All cells were exposed to 200?ppm gNO for 8 hours a day for 3 consecutive days. A MTT assay was used to observe cell proliferation. The results revealed 100% bacterial kill following 4 hour exposure to 200?ppm gNO. Interestingly this dose did not exhibit any significant toxic effect on fibroblast, keratinocyte, and endothelial proliferation. Dermal fibroblasts migration out of the collagen gel was not affected by gNO treatment when compared to the control. The keratinocytes in both groups were able to express involucrin, an indicator of cell?s ability to differentiate. The migration and tube formation by endothelial cells within the matrigel was not compromised following gNO treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence for potential application of gNO for reducing bacterial burden in chronic infected wounds without compromising re-epithilialization, proliferation, and angiogenesis in the wound healing process.
