AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are major components of the innate defense system that present microbicidal activity against gram positive and negative bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses. The human cathelicidin LL-37 is expressed in skin upon wounding and, in addition to its role in antimicrobial defense, it has also been previously demonstrated that this peptide might be involved in reepithelization. We have generated an adenoviral vector containing the complete sequence of LL-37 along with an Ires-GFP expression cassette. The efficacy of this vector was probed by testing the conditioned medium from adenoviral transduced keratinocytes in preventing bacterial growth. We have studied the in vitro effects of LL-37 on HK migration and proliferation. In addition, we have efficiently transduced human skin grafts (in immunodeficient mice) using an in vivo gene transfer approach and we are currently testing the involvement of this peptide in wound repair.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Cortisol has been shown to impact upon wound healing through its immunosuppressive properties, and its release is modulated by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which is involved in fear and stress reactions. This study assessed the role of the CeA in modulating proinflammatory chemokine expression following wounding, under both stress and nonstress conditions. Bilaterally CeA-lesioned rhesus monkeys and nonoperated controls received separate dermal wounds on 3 consecutive days. Six hours postwounding, tissue biopsies were obtained from each wound. Following this, animals were subjected to 2?h of confinement as a stressor. Thus, examination of tissues on day 1 represented a nonstressed condition, and on days 2?3 a stressed condition. Using real-time PCR, we determined mRNA expression for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] in wounded and unwounded tissue, two chemokines critical in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in response to tissue injury. Analyses revealed that tissue mRNA levels for IL-8 and MIP-1[alpha] were increased in both groups following wounding. However, these rises were significantly greater in CeA-lesioned animals than controls. Repeated stress (confinement) attenuated these increases in mRNA expression equally in both groups (days 2?3). These results indicate that the inflammatory response to skin wounds is modulated, in part, by the amygdala. However, stress-induced alterations in inflammation are not CeA dependent for this particular stressor. Importantly, this finding indicates that a lesion of a central brain structure can impact upon peripheral wound healing parameters. (Supported by P50 DE-13749, MH46729, MH52354, MH61083)

AB  - Background:? Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important inflammatory mediator, which has been shown to regulate fibroblast chemotaxis and extracellular matrix production through four G-coupled protein receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4). Previous studies have linked abnormal PGE2 signaling with the development of improper damage repair and tissue fibrosis in the airway. This study begins to address the role of PGE2 in dermal fibrosis, particularly keloid formation. Such an analysis is consistent with data indicating inflammatory/immune abnormalities associated with keloids. Hypothesis:? Keloid fibroblasts respond to PGE2 appropriately, but in a quantitatively diminished manner. Methods:? Cultured fibroblasts from normal human skin and keloid lesions were used for these studies. Fibroblast migration was assayed using a well established two dimensional motility assay. Collagen production was analyzed using Western blot and commercial ELISA methodology. Results:? Administration of PGE2 decreased keloid fibroblast migration in a dose-dependent manner, via a mechanism which appears to involve the EP2/EP4-cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway. PGE2 reversed the transforming growth factor ?-1-induced increase in collagen type I in both normal and keloid fibroblasts. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results, which show that the response of keloid fibroblasts to PGE2 is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to normal fibroblasts. PGE2 decreases the rates of migration and collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts, raising the possibility that exogenous PGE2 may have potential therapeutic applications to reduce keloid formation.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, inducing angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis, all processes essential to wound healing. However, the same mediators have been implicated in pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, vascular occlusion, and necrotic tissue damage. We have previously shown that hyperbaric oxygen caused a prolonged elevation of VEGF and delayed wound healing in a rat model of tissue ischemia. In this study we examine the effect of the ROS scavenger, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), on ischemic wound healing. NAC is a virtually nontoxic free radical scavenger that has been used in many experimental studies to block ROS-mediated signaling. Methods:? Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the ischemic flap previously validated by this laboratory. This model provides two ischemic and two nonischemic excisional wounds. Rats were treated daily with HBO for 90 minutes at 2.4?atm, HBO plus 150?mg/kg NAC intraperitoneal, or control (neither HBO nor NAC). Wounds were analyzed for surface area, lactate, and VEGF. Results:? The HBO/NAC-treated animals had markedly impaired healing of their ischemic wounds at day 7 (0.105?±?.005?cm vs. 0.068?±?.002?cm for ctl and 0.064?±?.006 for HBO) and a twofold elevation of VEGF (120?pg/mg protein vs. 60?pg/mg protein). Lactate levels were not altered by NAC treatment and non-ischemic wounds showed no difference in healing, lactate, or VEGF. Conclusion:? Reactive oxygen species are required for wound healing. Our initial hypothesis was that the delay in wound closure with HBO treatment was due to excess ROS and that NAC would improve healing. The finding of elevated VEGF and delayed wound healing in the presence of a potent free radical scavenger suggests that blocking ROS signaling prevents the normal mitogenic response to VEGF. Additional studies to examine the VEGF receptor and tyrosine kinase activation will further elucidate the mechanism of ROS signaling in response to HBO treatment.

AB  - Clinical Problem:? An 89-year-old white male presented to his dermatologist with a pressure ulcer on his left medial foot. He was not a surgical candidate (CHF, pacemaker, edema) and not diabetic. Past Management:? For 2 years the dermatologist provided standard of care therapies treating the wound with regular debridements and Regranex therapy. The wound remained unhealed. At the age of 91 the patient developed osteomyelitis. Antibiotic therapies were initiated. Current Clinical Approach:? In addition to antibiotic therapy the patient agreed to have a continuous supply of oxygen delivered transdermally to the wound at a rate of 3?ml/hour from a device that derived pure oxygen from atmospheric air (EpiFLOSD) as the patient ambulated. 24/7 oxygen therapy was used in conjunction with a fully occlusive Johnson & Johnson 3????4? island dressing. Patient Outcomes:? After 3 weeks of continuous oxygen and antibiotic therapies the patient was able to ambulate without pain. The planned amputation was canceled. The wound bed was characterized by new granulation tissue and reepithelialization. The antibiotic treatment was discontinued after 30 days, but the tiny, 2 ounce oxygen therapy device was continued until full wound closure 11 weeks later. The wound remained closed for 36 months, the remainder of the patient?s life. Conclusions:? The effectiveness of the antibiotics in this patient as well as other oxygen-sensitive wound healing processes may have been potentiated and enhanced by the continuous availability of oxygen at this dosage. Further carefully controlled studies of transdermal sustained oxygen delivery for the treatment of chronic wounds with osteomyelitis are needed to clarify the underlying scientific mechanisms of this beneficial effect. The support of Ogenix Corporation in supplying EpiFLOSD for this project is appreciated.

AB  - We have previously reported that local injection of small doses of long-acting insulin-zinc suspension maintained sufficiently high insulin concentration in the wound fluid and accelerated the healing. The present experiment was to measure the rates of cell proliferation (reflected by DNA synthesis) and protein metabolism in the wound. These are the underlying metabolic processes responsible for the healing. Partial thickness skin donor wound was created on the back and indwelling catheters were placed in the carotid artery and jugular vein in adult rabbits under general anesthesia. The wound was covered with Aquaphor gauze, OpSite membrane, and surgical gauze. On day 7 after wounding, the wound was either injected with 0.2 units of insulin-Zn, Zn alone, or no injection; stable isotopes were infused into the jugular vein catheter in conscious rabbits for measurement of DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and breakdown in the wound. The local insulin-Zn injection raised wound insulin concentration to 168?±?39??U/ml. In contrast, in the control and Zn groups wound insulin concentrations were below the detectable level. The local injection of insulin-Zn suspension increased (p?=?0.03) DNA synthesis in the wound with minor changes in blood glucose concentration which did not require exogenous glucose replacement. In the Zn group, whereas the rate of DNA synthesis tended to increase (p?=?0.051 vs. control), the protein net balance (synthesis ? breakdown) was lower (p?<?0.05) than those in the control and insulin-Zn (Table 1). We conclude that local injection of a small dose (0.2 units insulin) long-acting insulin-Zn suspension stimulated wound DNA synthesis without major systemic side effects thereby providing an effective and safe approach to accelerate wound healing. Although local Zn injection might also stimulate wound DNA synthesis, the benefit on the healing process was limited by decreased net protein deposition. 1 Wound DNA and protein metabolism.

AB  - Background:? Preclinical animal studies with a fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix suggest that fibroblasts quickly populate the material. At the same time there is a rapid ingrowth of new blood vessels. In short, the matrix quickly becomes living tissue. Experience with bioengineered skin constructs and porcine small intestinal submucosal products suggest that the application of a scaffold or matrix may play a role in the healing of venous leg ulcerations in humans. Methods:? A fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix (Primatrix) was applied to patients with long-standing venous leg ulcerations. Histologic examination pre and post application with trichrome staining was employed to differentiate matrix from native collagen. Comparisons between animal and human ulcers were made grossly and histologically. Results:? In all patients there was rapid formation of granulation tissue with a decrease in the depth of the wound. This was followed by epithelialization and wound closure. The stimulatory effect persisted for approximately 1 month after which time a second matrix was applied. In contrast to the animal study the grafts exhibited ?take? in only one of our patients. Histologic examination in both animals and humans suggests a stimulation of native collagen production as well as an initial incorporation of the Primatrix into the wound bed. Conclusion:? Primatrix has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and in a series of patients with venous leg ulcerations. The product may function as a scaffold for the ingrowth of cells essential to wound healing. Further investigation in a randomized controlled study setting is recommended. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Introduction:? Currently freeze-dried, gamma-sterilized, or glycerol-preserved amniotic membranes are widely used. However, it is not clear whether this devitalized state is the optimal application form. Therefore within this study the ideal condition for midterm storage of human amniotic membranes was assessed to ensure the availability of vital amniotic membranes, in particular for burn wounds. Methods and Materials:? For this purpose mothers were serologically tested and term placentae were collected and washed. After the amniotic membrane was peeled off and further washed, biopsies were taken for microbiological testing and various storage experiments (different media and temperatures). ?? cell culture medium, 37?°C ?? glycerol, 4?°C ?? 10% DMSO, ?80?°C Viability of fresh and stored amniotic membranes was determined with the MTT-based EZ4U- Assay (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). Results and Discussion:? Best results were obtained while storing the membranes in cell culture medium at 37?°C, whereas storage in glycerol at 4?°C resulted in cell death within the first 4 days. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the viability of amniotic membrane under different storage conditions. The influence on wound healing is currently under investigation.

AB  - The treatment of venous ulcers must start with compression and if the ankle brachial index is greater than 0.8 high compression bandages can be applied. Despite edema control, there are a number of venous ulcers that do not heal at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers of greater than 4 weeks duration were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under the 4 layer bandage, Profore for 12 weeks, or until healing. Biopsies were obtained from the ulcer base at week 0 for histology and bacterial burden. Duplicate biopsies for quantitative bacteriology were performed with one submitted whole and the second bisected into superficial and deep components. The paired biopsies were then repeated after a median of 6.5 weeks (range 2 to 12 weeks). The histological specimens were examined by the histopathologist (SR). Inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the superficial, middle and deep segments of the biopsies. Acute infiltrates were identified through the concentration of neutrophils and chronic infiltrates by the presence of lymphocytes. Each biopsy and each segment was graded for infiltrates on a four point semi quantitative score. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There were 12 sets of paired biopsies that were analyzed. There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Analysis of the histology and bacteriology data demonstrated that the presence of a high neutrophilic infiltrate in skin biopsies was associated with high bacterial counts (superficial compartment of the quantitative biopsies) at week 4 and delayed healing (p?=?0.037). In the week 0 biopsy, increased lymphocytic infiltrates within the superficial and middle segments were associated with accelerated healing in the first 4 weeks (p?=?0.26 and 0.09). The nanocrystalline silver dressing has demonstrated an anti-bacterial and permissive but selective anti-inflammatory action allowing lymphocytic infiltrates to increase associated with an accelerated reduction in ulcer size.

AB  - Introduction:? Fibrocytes are a unique bone marrow origin leukocyte subpopulation which display fibroblast-like properties and are antigen-presenting cells that are up-regulated systemically after burn injury. This study investigated their role in FPD of the skin using leukocyte-specific protein-1 (LSP1) specific for fibrocytes in HTS, keloids, and mature scar. Materials and Methods:? Fibrocytes were cultured from PBMC isolated from burn patients and normal individuals. Skin biopsies were taken from burn patients with hypertrophic (3) and mature scar (3) and normal skin (20) as well as patients with keloids (3). Double immunostaining (IHC) with antibodies to LSP1 and to the C-propeptide of type I collagen were performed on cryosections to identify fibrocytes in tissue. Extraction of fibrocytes from keloids, HTS, mature scar, and normal skin allowed quantification of fibrocytes by flow cytometry. Results:? LSP1 was found in both fibrocytes and lymphocytes, but not in fibroblasts. Western blot analysis showed that LSP1 expression was significantly higher in fibrocytes than in lymphocytes obtained from all five patients examined. Fibrocytes in hypertrophic scar were seen as duallabeled spindle-shaped cells. In normal skin, fibrocytes were present in the upper layers of the dermis and <1% of cells extracted, whereas, approximately threefold more fibrocytes were found in HTS and primarily in the papillary dermis. Preliminary data suggests that normal dermis contains 0.51%?±?0.35 fibrocytes, mature scar 0.30%?±?.031, keloids 1.18?±?0.22, and HTS 1.12%. Conclusions:? Fibrocytes are up-regulated systemically after injury and in FPD in skin where they appear to be up-regulated contributing to the development of keloids and hypertrophic scarring. More investigation is required to determine the functional roles of these bone marrow derived cells in fibroproliferative disorders.

AB  - Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising cell resource of osteoprogenitor cells for bone tissue engineering. However, the diverse characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells within the bone marrow of individual subjects require varying treatments to stimulate osteogenic differentiation. Thus, an effective monitoring system is needed to identify the progression of osteogenesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy was used in the present study to monitor osteogenesis of tissue engineering (TE) constructs prepared by human bone MSCs seeded on scaffolds of gelatin sponges. The characteristics of MR images and parameters corresponded to osteogenic progression of TE constructs exposed to differentiation medium, significantly differing from control groups exposed to basic medium. Upon quantification, MR image and parameters correlated well to cell seeding densities and alkaline phosphatase activities of various TE constructs. In conclusion, MR can effectively detect the biochemical cascades of osteogenic differentiation of TE constructs and may be a promising, noninvasive monitoring system to provide three-dimensional information for bone tissue engineering.

AB  - Introduction:? Healing wounds are characterized by high lactate levels. In the past, the shift to an anaerobic energy metabolism was thought to be the main source for increased lactate concentration. Lactate is also generated by leukocytic NADPH-linked oxygenase using oxygen and glucose as one of its substrates, a mechanism called aerobic glycolysis. We hypothesize that hyperbaric oxygen therapy by increasing oxygen availability enhances wound lactate production by aerobic glycolysis. Material and methods:? Four wire mesh wound cylinders (n?=?142) were implanted underneath the dorsal skin in each of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (312?±?11?g). Animals were randomized to two groups: The first group (n?=?18) received 100% oxygen with 2.1 ATA for 90 minutes twice a day for a total of 7 days. The second group (n?=?18) was treated with 21% oxygen with 1 ATA for the same time schedule. Hyperbaric treatments were administered in a hyperbaric chamber designed for small animals. Wound fluid from the cylinders was aspirated between the two treatment cycles at day 2 and 5 and analysed for lactate using a lactate analyser. Additionally, at day 10 (after 2 days of treatment with 21% oxygen in 1 ATA in both groups) lactate concentrations in wound fluid were measured again. Data are expressed as mean?±?SD. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results:? Wound lactate concentration was significantly increased both in control and hyperbaric rats at day 5 and day 10 compared to day 2 (controls 4.5?±?1, 5.9?±?0.8, 6.7?±?1.2?mmol/l; p?=?0.04 and hyperbarics 4.4?±?1.2, 6.5?±?1.3, 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). At day 2 and day 5 there was no significant difference in lactate levels between control and hyperbaric rats. However, at day 10 lactate concentration was significantly higher in the hyperbaric group compared to the control group (6.7?±?1.2 vs. 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). Conclusion:? This investigation provides evidence for the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen action since lactate is known to stimulate collagen production and angiogenesis.

AB  - Neuropathic ulcers represent a significant cause of morbitity for diabetics in the United States. Diabetic wounds are notoriously difficult to resolve. Treatment options are limited due in part to the lack of knowledge about the molecular events that regulate successful resolution of wounds. To identify differences between normal and diabetic gene regulation in wounds, we examined the level of expression of 12,000 genes in granulation tissue and wound-edge epithelium in normal animals and in an experimental model of diabetes following induction of full thickness skin injuries. Full thickness injuries in diabetic mice were characterized in part by altered regulation of structural genes and genes that regulate energy metabolism and utilization. The energy cycle contributes backbone structures for the synthesis of a variety of amino acids, the molecular building blocks essential for wound repair. A direct consequence of a diminished ability to efficiently exploit energy supplies would be decreased availability of regulatory and structural proteins necessary for efficient healing in diabetic wounds. We have successfully enhanced healing in diabetic wounds by treatment with the angiotensin II peptide NorLeu3A(1?7). NorLeu3A(1?7) accelerates healing of full thickness injuries in diabetic mice. While NorLeu3A(1?7) enhances healing by accelerating collagen deposition and reepithelialization, gene array studies show that NorLeu3A(1?7) acts locally within the wound site by altering gene expression within the granulation tissue. Specifically at day 7 after injury, NorLeu3A(1?7) reduced the expression of MMP genes and increase the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. Supported by PHS grant NIAMS 2 R44 AR47481

AB  - MIST ultrasound, a recently FDA-cleared noncontact ultrasound therapy, was utilized prospectively in an IRB-approved trial for the treatment of recalcitrant wounds of various etiologies. Twenty-nine wounds from 23 patients were studied. Inclusion criteria included wounds greater than 4 weeks duration with no evidence of clinical improvement (>15% area reduction) over the prior 2 weeks before enrollment. The wounds were required to be free from clinical signs of infection. After an initial debridement and wash-out period, patients were treated 3 times a week with MIST for 4 minute treatment applications. Dressing regimens were left up to the investigator as dictated by wound conditions. The primary endpoint is complete healing. Data will be presented looking at MIST-derived healing, as defined by complete healing using MIST therapy all the way to closure. MIST-assisted healing, as defined by MIST therapy for wound bed preparation followed by an alternative means of closure will also be presented. ?Overall healing? defined by the combination of the two prior groups will complete the outcomes report, as this reflects a more ?real-world? clinical application for the technology. Wound dynamics, Kaplan Meier survival plots and laser Doppler imaging estimations of angiogenesis will all be presented. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Inappropriate control of the expression and function of the components of the TGF-? signaling pathway has been implicated in impaired wound healing and abnormal scarring. Factors that have been shown to have profound effects on skin homeostasis and wound healing include steroids and oxygen tension. These agents may exert their effects (at least in part) on the skin and wound healing by modulating TGF-? action. To identify steroids and oxygen tension as mediators of TGF-? action in the skin, we examined the effects of hypoxia and glucocorticoids on the levels of active TGF-? and its signaling receptors and on the phosphorylation of its intracellular mediators, Smad 2 and Smad 3, in skin fibroblasts. Our results show that the active TGF-? levels, expression of types I and II receptors and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 are markedly up-regulated by 2?hrs of hypoxia, whereas all these parameters are significantly downregulated by 24?hrs of hypoxia. Dexamethasone treatment of 2?hrs, on the other hand, increased active TGF-? levels and TGF-? receptor expression with little effect on the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. However, dexamethasone treatment of 24?hrs downregulated the active TGF-? levels while maintaining the higher receptor expression, again with no significant effect on phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels. Interestingly, hypoxia had an additive effect on the steroid-induced downregulation of active TGF-? levels while counteracting the steroid-induced upregulation of TGF-? receptor expression. The upregulation at 2?hrs and the downregulation at 24?hrs of the components of TGF-? signaling pathway by hypoxia is consistent with the beneficial effect of initial hypoxia and the deleterious effect of sustained hypoxia, respectively, on wound healing. The synergestic and antagonistic effects of dexamethasone and hypoxia on the TGF-? signaling components emphasize the complex regulation of TGF-? signaling at multiple levels.

AB  - Atherosclerotic plaque formation involves recruitment and adhesion of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel wall injury followed by their migration into the subendothelial space stimulated by MCP-1 (monocyte-chemoattractant-protein1). Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, cells that release a variety of factors and take up oxidized LDL, becoming foam cells. Smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall differentiate and migrate to the subendothelial space, interact with foam cells and components of the ECM to form a ?fatty streak,? the precursor of plaque. Adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipocytes, circulates in the blood, maintains blood vessel wall stability and inhibits foam cell formation. Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis, although the mechanisms remain unknown. We showed previously that both firsthand and secondhand cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 in endothelial cells and others have shown that adiponectin levels in smokers with cardiovascular disease are reduced. We hypothesized that a localized increase in MCP-1 and a decrease in adiponectin are critical for cigarette smoke-induced plaque formation. To test this possibility, we used mice transgenic for human ApoB100, a model system that closely mimics human conditions that lead to atherosclerosis, and a smoking machine that closely simulates human smoking. We found that, in smoking mice, the micro vessels in the heart tissue are often filled with lipids, the areas surrounding the plaque-prone regions have numerous neutrophils, that these cells express high levels of MCP-1, and that the plaques are larger than in control mice. In addition, the level of the adiponectin monomer in the blood of smoking mice is lower and the presence of this protein in the heart tissue is also decreased. In conclusion, the decrease in adiponectin and the increase in MCP-1 levels may be responsible for cigarette smoke-induced atherogenesis.

AB  - Patients who are hospitalized, elderly, or have spinal cord injury develop stage IV pressure ulcers in sacral, ischial, and trochanteric regions. Bone exposure of these pressure ulcers becomes a significant clinical problem. We propose that treatment of exposed bone with bone resection and a fibroblast-populated construct (FPC)(Dermagraft) accelerates healing. Four patients with stage IV sacral or ischial pressure ulcers where randomized to the control group and underwent bone resection with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Four other patients were randomized to the treatment group and underwent bone resection with application of FPC. Both groups were clinically monitored and treated with culture-specific antibiotics. The data showed that patients treated with FPC had their exposed bone covered after an average at 2.25 weeks, while the control groups required at least 4 weeks for bone coverage. Therefore, the preliminary data suggest that FPC is effective in reducing the time of bone exposure after sacrectomy/ischiectomy in pressure ulcer surgery. Acknowledgments:?
