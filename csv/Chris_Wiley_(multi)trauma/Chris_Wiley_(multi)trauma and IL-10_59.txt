AB  - Introduction:? Healing wounds are characterized by high lactate levels. In the past, the shift to an anaerobic energy metabolism was thought to be the main source for increased lactate concentration. Lactate is also generated by leukocytic NADPH-linked oxygenase using oxygen and glucose as one of its substrates, a mechanism called aerobic glycolysis. We hypothesize that hyperbaric oxygen therapy by increasing oxygen availability enhances wound lactate production by aerobic glycolysis. Material and methods:? Four wire mesh wound cylinders (n?=?142) were implanted underneath the dorsal skin in each of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (312?±?11?g). Animals were randomized to two groups: The first group (n?=?18) received 100% oxygen with 2.1 ATA for 90 minutes twice a day for a total of 7 days. The second group (n?=?18) was treated with 21% oxygen with 1 ATA for the same time schedule. Hyperbaric treatments were administered in a hyperbaric chamber designed for small animals. Wound fluid from the cylinders was aspirated between the two treatment cycles at day 2 and 5 and analysed for lactate using a lactate analyser. Additionally, at day 10 (after 2 days of treatment with 21% oxygen in 1 ATA in both groups) lactate concentrations in wound fluid were measured again. Data are expressed as mean?±?SD. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results:? Wound lactate concentration was significantly increased both in control and hyperbaric rats at day 5 and day 10 compared to day 2 (controls 4.5?±?1, 5.9?±?0.8, 6.7?±?1.2?mmol/l; p?=?0.04 and hyperbarics 4.4?±?1.2, 6.5?±?1.3, 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). At day 2 and day 5 there was no significant difference in lactate levels between control and hyperbaric rats. However, at day 10 lactate concentration was significantly higher in the hyperbaric group compared to the control group (6.7?±?1.2 vs. 8.2?±?1.3?mmol/l; p?=?0.01). Conclusion:? This investigation provides evidence for the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen action since lactate is known to stimulate collagen production and angiogenesis.

AB  - Neuropathic ulcers represent a significant cause of morbitity for diabetics in the United States. Diabetic wounds are notoriously difficult to resolve. Treatment options are limited due in part to the lack of knowledge about the molecular events that regulate successful resolution of wounds. To identify differences between normal and diabetic gene regulation in wounds, we examined the level of expression of 12,000 genes in granulation tissue and wound-edge epithelium in normal animals and in an experimental model of diabetes following induction of full thickness skin injuries. Full thickness injuries in diabetic mice were characterized in part by altered regulation of structural genes and genes that regulate energy metabolism and utilization. The energy cycle contributes backbone structures for the synthesis of a variety of amino acids, the molecular building blocks essential for wound repair. A direct consequence of a diminished ability to efficiently exploit energy supplies would be decreased availability of regulatory and structural proteins necessary for efficient healing in diabetic wounds. We have successfully enhanced healing in diabetic wounds by treatment with the angiotensin II peptide NorLeu3A(1?7). NorLeu3A(1?7) accelerates healing of full thickness injuries in diabetic mice. While NorLeu3A(1?7) enhances healing by accelerating collagen deposition and reepithelialization, gene array studies show that NorLeu3A(1?7) acts locally within the wound site by altering gene expression within the granulation tissue. Specifically at day 7 after injury, NorLeu3A(1?7) reduced the expression of MMP genes and increase the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. Supported by PHS grant NIAMS 2 R44 AR47481

AB  - MIST ultrasound, a recently FDA-cleared noncontact ultrasound therapy, was utilized prospectively in an IRB-approved trial for the treatment of recalcitrant wounds of various etiologies. Twenty-nine wounds from 23 patients were studied. Inclusion criteria included wounds greater than 4 weeks duration with no evidence of clinical improvement (>15% area reduction) over the prior 2 weeks before enrollment. The wounds were required to be free from clinical signs of infection. After an initial debridement and wash-out period, patients were treated 3 times a week with MIST for 4 minute treatment applications. Dressing regimens were left up to the investigator as dictated by wound conditions. The primary endpoint is complete healing. Data will be presented looking at MIST-derived healing, as defined by complete healing using MIST therapy all the way to closure. MIST-assisted healing, as defined by MIST therapy for wound bed preparation followed by an alternative means of closure will also be presented. ?Overall healing? defined by the combination of the two prior groups will complete the outcomes report, as this reflects a more ?real-world? clinical application for the technology. Wound dynamics, Kaplan Meier survival plots and laser Doppler imaging estimations of angiogenesis will all be presented. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Inappropriate control of the expression and function of the components of the TGF-? signaling pathway has been implicated in impaired wound healing and abnormal scarring. Factors that have been shown to have profound effects on skin homeostasis and wound healing include steroids and oxygen tension. These agents may exert their effects (at least in part) on the skin and wound healing by modulating TGF-? action. To identify steroids and oxygen tension as mediators of TGF-? action in the skin, we examined the effects of hypoxia and glucocorticoids on the levels of active TGF-? and its signaling receptors and on the phosphorylation of its intracellular mediators, Smad 2 and Smad 3, in skin fibroblasts. Our results show that the active TGF-? levels, expression of types I and II receptors and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 are markedly up-regulated by 2?hrs of hypoxia, whereas all these parameters are significantly downregulated by 24?hrs of hypoxia. Dexamethasone treatment of 2?hrs, on the other hand, increased active TGF-? levels and TGF-? receptor expression with little effect on the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. However, dexamethasone treatment of 24?hrs downregulated the active TGF-? levels while maintaining the higher receptor expression, again with no significant effect on phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels. Interestingly, hypoxia had an additive effect on the steroid-induced downregulation of active TGF-? levels while counteracting the steroid-induced upregulation of TGF-? receptor expression. The upregulation at 2?hrs and the downregulation at 24?hrs of the components of TGF-? signaling pathway by hypoxia is consistent with the beneficial effect of initial hypoxia and the deleterious effect of sustained hypoxia, respectively, on wound healing. The synergestic and antagonistic effects of dexamethasone and hypoxia on the TGF-? signaling components emphasize the complex regulation of TGF-? signaling at multiple levels.

AB  - Atherosclerotic plaque formation involves recruitment and adhesion of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel wall injury followed by their migration into the subendothelial space stimulated by MCP-1 (monocyte-chemoattractant-protein1). Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, cells that release a variety of factors and take up oxidized LDL, becoming foam cells. Smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall differentiate and migrate to the subendothelial space, interact with foam cells and components of the ECM to form a ?fatty streak,? the precursor of plaque. Adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipocytes, circulates in the blood, maintains blood vessel wall stability and inhibits foam cell formation. Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis, although the mechanisms remain unknown. We showed previously that both firsthand and secondhand cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 in endothelial cells and others have shown that adiponectin levels in smokers with cardiovascular disease are reduced. We hypothesized that a localized increase in MCP-1 and a decrease in adiponectin are critical for cigarette smoke-induced plaque formation. To test this possibility, we used mice transgenic for human ApoB100, a model system that closely mimics human conditions that lead to atherosclerosis, and a smoking machine that closely simulates human smoking. We found that, in smoking mice, the micro vessels in the heart tissue are often filled with lipids, the areas surrounding the plaque-prone regions have numerous neutrophils, that these cells express high levels of MCP-1, and that the plaques are larger than in control mice. In addition, the level of the adiponectin monomer in the blood of smoking mice is lower and the presence of this protein in the heart tissue is also decreased. In conclusion, the decrease in adiponectin and the increase in MCP-1 levels may be responsible for cigarette smoke-induced atherogenesis.

AB  - Patients who are hospitalized, elderly, or have spinal cord injury develop stage IV pressure ulcers in sacral, ischial, and trochanteric regions. Bone exposure of these pressure ulcers becomes a significant clinical problem. We propose that treatment of exposed bone with bone resection and a fibroblast-populated construct (FPC)(Dermagraft) accelerates healing. Four patients with stage IV sacral or ischial pressure ulcers where randomized to the control group and underwent bone resection with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Four other patients were randomized to the treatment group and underwent bone resection with application of FPC. Both groups were clinically monitored and treated with culture-specific antibiotics. The data showed that patients treated with FPC had their exposed bone covered after an average at 2.25 weeks, while the control groups required at least 4 weeks for bone coverage. Therefore, the preliminary data suggest that FPC is effective in reducing the time of bone exposure after sacrectomy/ischiectomy in pressure ulcer surgery. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - It has been speculated that a prolonged and elevated neutrophilic response has an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic wounds. This has raised the possibility that one or more of these proteases might be useful as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for chronic wounds. The purpose of this study was to examine several primarily neutrophil-derived proteases present in pressure ulcer tissues and to determine whether protease activity could be correlated with neutrophil levels. Biopsies of pressure ulcers were taken from consented subjects (n?=?13) and again after 3 months standard care. Mean wound volume decreased 2.4?cm3 per month; however, volumes of six wounds were increased at the end of the study. Levels of extractable myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase, collagenase-2 (MMP-8), and gelatinase (MMP-9) activities were determined. Mean levels of MPO (n?=?11) at study initiation and after 3 months were nearly identical (2945 and 2845 milliunits per mg extract, respectively). Interestingly, these levels were similar to that previously found in healing open dermal wounds at 4 days postwounding. MPO levels increased in the extracts obtained from three subjects and declined in five subjects. Elastase (corr. 0.265 p?=?0.233) and MMP-8 (corr. ?0.05 p?=?0.835) activities correlated poorly with MPO. This is likely a reflection of differences in the access of protease inhibitors (e.g., alpha1-antitrypsin, TIMP, and alpha2?macroglobulin) to these wounds. As expected, a greater correlation level was observed between the proteases (MMP-8 vs. elastase corr. 0.362 p?=?0.097; MMP-8 vs. MMP-9 corr. 0.55 p?=?0.009). The results from this study highlight the high degree of variability that can be observed in the pressure ulcer environment. This further suggests that a combination of biomarkers will be required for making accurate diagnostic assessments of chronic wounds. This work was supported by NIH GM 58530.

AB  - The Thermage system is a radiofrequency (RF) device designed to treat human skin. The Thermage ThermaCool TC? is a noninvasive, nonablative, nonlaser system that combines cryogen cooling and radiofrequency (RF) energy to volumetrically heat dermal and subdermal tissue. Thermage treatment causes collagen contraction resulting in immediate skin tightening. It has also been clinically shown to tighten skin over time. This long-term tightening effect is believed to result from the body?s wound healing response. We performed studies in a juvenile pig to characterize the wound healing response after ThermaCool treatment in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular events resulting from treatment. Histological markers of the wound healing process were examined over a 1-month period. Collagen gene expression was examined by quantitative PCR. Macrophages and mast cells are important inflammatory cell types that stimulate fibroblast recruitment, collagen synthesis and blood vessel growth. Three to 5 days following treatment, macrophages and mast cells were present in the dermis. By 28 days, both increased dermal blood vessel density and epidermal thickness was observed. Collagen I and collagen III genes were expressed at elevated levels by 21 days posttreatment. ThermaCool? treatment stimulates dermal remodeling by initiating a wound-healing response. This study demonstrates that thermage treatment results in the recruitment of important cellular mediators of wound healing and increased collagen synthesis in an animal model. These events are presumed to be responsible for dermal remodeling and skin tightening over time in human subjects. Because the Thermage device noninvasively delivers heat energy, it may be a unique tool for the examination of aseptic thermally induced wound models.

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in many tissues, is most highly concentrated in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. HA is believed to have an important role in wound healing. HA is thought to be actively produced during wound healing and tissue repair to provide a framework for ingrowth of blood vessels and fibroblasts. The present study was performed to investigate the histology, levels, and molecular weight of hyaluronan in human open dermal wounds. Methods:? Dermal wounds were created using a 4?mm punch biopsy on the buttocks of 10 healthy adult subjects. Wounds were harvested using a 6?mm punch biopsy at postwound days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Tissue was then extracted for determining hyaluronan levels using a biotin hyaluronic acid link protein assay. The molecular weight distribution of hyaluronan was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Histology was performed using HA biotinylated binding protein with hyaluronidase controls. Results:? The levels of hyaluronan were found to have a bimodal distribution within the 28-day time course. Levels of HA increased from baseline values 12.4?±?6.3 to 47.3?±?7.5 (p?<?0.05) on postwound day 1. The lowest HA levels were found on postwound day 3 (26.4?±?8.5), with levels again increasing on postwound day 7 to the highest levels 73.4?±?13.6 (p?<?0.05). Postwound days 14 and 28 showed levels gradually declining toward baseline (49.4?±?5.7, 43.9?±?6.8). Molecular weight analysis showed smaller size HA on postwound day 1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in the granulation tissue of healing wounds. Conclusion:? This is the first detailed examination of HA expression in human wounds. The bimodal display of HA levels in these wounds suggest that HA may be subject to fragmentation at times when the inflammatory index of these wounds is greatest.

AB  - Wound healing is a complicated biological process that involves interactions of multiple cell types, various growth factors, their mediators and the extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we have studied the differential regulation of angiogenic genes during wound healing in transgenic diabetic mice and non-diabetic mice. One 8?mm full thickness cutaneous wound under aseptic conditions was created on either side of the midline. Wound tissues were studied at 4, 7, and 11 days postwounding and healing was assessed by histology. The pathway specific gene expression profile of wound tissue in transgenic diabetic mice was compared with the normal mice. Profiling of these genes showed differential regulation of many angiogenic promoters, inhibitors, growth factors and cytokines. Furthermore, in our study hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1a), osteopontin (OPN) and osteonectin are induced early at day 4, in both the diabetic and nondiabetic wound. The expression was downregulated by 11-day postwounding in the nondiabetic wound, whereas diabetic wounds showed constitutively high expression of these genes. The expression patterns of these genes were concomitant with the extent of healing as assessed by histology at different time point postwounding. These results suggest wound healing is a complex process that involves cascade of interaction of various factors. Although a single gene may not be solely responsible for any impairment in healing; however, an in-depth study of these genes and precise balance between the inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis may provide an answer to the delayed healing in diabetic conditions.

AB  - Substance P(SP) modulates cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression by inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to injury. A major proinflammatory effect includes nitric oxide(NO) production. Three nitric oxide synthase(NOS) isoforms include neuronal(nNOS), inducible(iNOS), and endothelial(eNOS). In this study, we determined which NOS enzymes mediate SP-induced NO upregulation in endothelial cells. Confluent human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with SP(10?8?M) for 48?h with and without the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 4?uM) or specific inhibitors against nNOS (L-thiocitrulline;60?nM), iNOS (n-3-aminomethyl benzyl acetamidine;7?nM), eNOS (N-5-1-iminoethyl-L-ornithine; 0.5?uM). Inhibitors were added for 3?h prior to and continued throughout SP stimulation. Nitrate/nitrite levels were measured in cell extracts using Greiss reagents and standardized with protein concentration for each sample. Results are expressed as uM nitrate/mg protein. Statistical analysis was determined using ANOVA. Result are expressed as mean?±?sd; p?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. SP effectively elevated nitrate levels (2.96?uM/mg protein;p?≤?0.05) compared to control treatment (2.1?uM/mg protein). All NOS inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on substance P induced NO production. However, only L-NAME (1.9?uM/mg protein) and the specific eNOS inhibitor (2.32?uM/mg protein) demonstrated a significant decrease (p?<?0.05.) Our data suggest that SP up-regulation of NO in HMECs is primarily mediated by eNOS, but that other NOS enzymes may also contribute. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of NOS in SP signaling.

AB  - Background:? Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is a novel method for producing a strong tissue-tissue seal using photosensitization. PTB cross-links tissues without causing thermal damage, although the mechanism of action in skin is not completely understood. Apligraf, a bilayered tissue-engineered skin construct, is currently applied to chronic wounds and fixed in place by bolster, suture, staple, or glue. We postulated that PTB may have application for attaching Apligraf to skin. Materials and Methods:? An ex vivo model was used to characterize bonding of Apligraf and skin by PTB. Argon laser (514?nm) or IPL irradiation in the presence of the photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal was used to bond Apligraf and human cadaveric or porcine skin. Various outcome measurements were made to evaluate the efficacy and histological characteristics of the bonding. Conclusions:? Photochemical tissue bonding of Apligraf to human skin can be performed and further characterization is under way. Potential applications of PTB and Apligraf include the treatment of acute wounds, split thickness skin graft donor sites, burns, and debrided chronic wounds.

AB  - The understanding of bioengineered tissue has evolved over the past 5 years. Now considered ?cell therapy,? bioengineered tissue can provide a nonhealing wound with the appropriate complement of cytokines, growth factors, and healthy cells to promote the patient?s healing process. As clinicians have gained experience with Apligraf*, the process of wound bed preparation has proven to be a critical step in order to achieve optimal outcomes with the tissue construct. Recently, the investigators have evaluated a novel device, MIST? ultrasound , recently FDA cleared for the cleansing and debriding of wounds. A subgroup from a total of 23 patients in a research trial using MIST therapy for nonhealing wounds received an Apligraf as part of their treatment regimen. The'bioengineered tissue remained intact for a full 4 weeks postapplication and the appearance of the graft was quite different than our prior experience with the product. On removal of the wound/graft eschar, patients had achieved complete epithelialization.

AB  - Wound healing is a multistep process that concludes with scar formation. A common clinical observation is that oral wounds exhibit privileged healing compared to extra-oral wounds. Current data demonstrates reduced inflammation and more rapid reepithelialization of oral wounds suggesting that reduced inflammation is vital to privileged repair. To examine the initiation of inflammation, the present study examines IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα production by oral versus cutaneous keratinocytes and compares mast cell infiltration in oral versus cutaneous wounds. Two 1?mm diameter excisional wounds were placed on the lateral tongue or dorsal skin of anesthetized BALB/c mice. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after injury, wound tissue was harvested for analysis. Cytokine expression levels were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR normalized to actin. At every time point, levels of IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα mRNA were less in oral than dermal wounds. When analyzed by ELISA, IL-1 protein levels peaked at 6 hours in both oral and cutaneous wounds, yet the levels were lower in oral wounds. Mast cell infiltration was measured by counting toluidine blue positive cells in fixed wound sections. The number of mast cells/mm2 was decreased overall in oral mucosal wounds. These findings suggest that a decreased early inflammatory response to injury may be responsible for the privileged repair of oral mucosa.

AB  - Advocate Christ hospital is a 650-bed, level-one tertiary-care center that created a comprehensive wound care program in November 1998. Over the first 3 years of the program there were over 140 admissions per year directly from the wound center along with numerous hospital to hospital transfers for complex wound management. Prevalence rates therefore increased linearly over this time frame. The wound team calculated a system-wide (eight hospitals) spend of $2.1 million per year for specialty rental beds. Incidence rates for the system were at, but not lower than, national levels despite the high cost incurred. A $1.3 million capital purchase for KCI atmos-air 9000? mattresses resulted in the complete replacement of all medical surgical beds in all eight hospitals. An internal prevalence and incidence team was created and data were collected both at the hospital and system-wide level on a quarterly basis. Hospital and system incidence rates fell to or below 7%(targeted goal) and the entire project will achieve a return on investment in 18 months. Data to be presented include prevalence and incidence results, rental bed costs pre- and postbed purchase, and a detailed review of the process of creating an electronic prevalence and incidence tracking system.

AB  - Previous wound healing studies have attempted to improve angiogenesis (new blood vessel ingrowth). Recent studies suggest, however, that revascularization of wounds may also be accomplished by vasculogenesis: endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow and blood that home to sites of tissue damage and form new blood vessels. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of systemic and topical transplantation of EPCs for wound healing in an in vivo rabbit model. It was hypothesized that applying cells topically through an EPC-seeded albumin scaffold may promote revascularization from inside the wound versus only from the periphery. Further, it was hypothesized that combining topical and systemic transplantation of EPCs may increase vessel formation from both directions. Full thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of New Zealand White rabbits. Wounds were treated with either an EPC-seeded scaffold, nonseeded scaffold, or no treatment (control). Additionally, half of the animals were given systemic injections of EPCs. Digital pictures were taken weekly until sacrifice to determine healing rates. Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging scans were used to measure changes in blood perfusion during healing. Animals were sacrificed at 2 or 4 weeks; wounds were excised and prepared for histological examination. Histomorphometry was used to calculate epithelialization and contraction rates, as well as the volume fraction of cell nuclei and blood vessels. Preliminary results suggest that animals that received systemic transplantations of EPCs had higher overall healing rates than those with no injection. Systemic transplantation alone improved healing over the control by the end of 2 weeks. When combined with a topical scaffold (both EPC-seeded and nonseeded), systemically injected cells showed improved healing by the end of the first week. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Electric fields of the magnitude likely to occur in electrical injury can result in skeletal muscle electroporation. It has been reported that Poloxamer 188 (P188) is able to seal damaged cell membranes. Using a previously described rat hind limb model of electrical injury, in this study we employ MRI to demonstrate that intravenously administered P188 arrests muscle tissue edema caused by electrical shock. Methods:? Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat hindlimbs were subjected to 12 electrical shock pulses of 2?kV and ?2A amplitude with duration of 4?ms. There was a 10-second separation period between shocks to allow thermal relaxation. Animals received either P188 or Lactated Ringer?s Injection (control) intravenously at 60 minutes after shock. Proton MRI were recorded using a 4.7-Tesla Bruker scanner (200?MHz). A Multi-Slice Multi-Echo (MSME) spin echo sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted images. Ten slices over the entire midthigh region were taken. For each slice, images from 10 echos in the TE range of 10?ms?100?ms and TR?=?2000?ms were collected. Imaging began at 60 minutes and continued until 3 hours postshock. The signal intensities at different TE times were used to fit an exponential decay and measure the T2 value in each voxel. Voxels with T2 values?>?80?ms were considered injured. Results:? There were noticeable increases of injured area with time for electrically injured limbs due to development of edema. Control-treated rats averaged a 58.0%(±6.59% SD) increase in total area of injury. The total area of injury for P188-treated rats increased by 46.6%(±2.96% SD) In nonelectroporation limbs, no change in T2 occurred. Discussion:? Disruption of the plasma membrane due to electrical current leads to edema. We treated the injured muscles with P188 and observed that it helped to arrest edema. MRI proved effective not only in characterizing the degree of injury resulting from electrical shock but also in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Introduction:? Electroporation of cells leads to breakdown of the ion gradients and release of intracellular contents. This triggers edema, which raises the local hydration level over its physiological value. Therefore, the state of water in an injured tissue is changed and the compartmentalization and dynamics of the spin populations during magnetic relaxation differ from healthy tissue. Methods:? We measured spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and spin density (M0) parameters of water protons in electroporated rat muscles by using a 4.7-Tesla GE/Bruker Omega scanner. The rats were sacrificed 3?h postshock and extensor digitorum longus, soleus and biceps femoris muscles were collected. Contralateral muscle samples served as controls. T2 and M0 were obtained using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill methods. Following MR imaging the water content in the tissue samples was measured. To infer T2 from the value corresponding to bulk water we also measured T2 of lysozyme and ribonuclease(1?mM) solutions (10?mM phosphate buffer at pH?=?7.0) as a function of protein concentration. Results:? T2 values were determined by fitting the signal amplitude from the echoes to the decay time. We obtained for deionized distilled water T2?=?614?±?31?ms, for lysozyme, T2?=?478?±?25?ms and for ribonuclease A, T2?=?423?±?22?ms. The analysis of T2-weighted MR images in rat muscles showed a 25?75% increase of the water T2 relaxation time in the three different muscle samples, of which soleus muscle showed the largest increase of 75%, from ?40?ms in controls to ?70?ms in injured muscles. Conclusions:? Electroporation leads to increased in T2, which may have two components. First, the accumulated water adds extra hydration layers to proteins. Second, the dynamics of water molecules may be altered as a result of development of the structural damage due to activation of degradative processes in the tissue.
