AB  - To better understand the mechanisms of dermal restoration in burn wound we examined the mRNA expressions, using a porcine secondary-degree burn wound model, of major dermal matrices including type I, III collagens and elastin, basement membrane components of collagen IV and laminins, regulatory Matrix Metalloproteinase MMP 1 and MMP 9, as well as growth factors of bFGF, CTGF, TGF?, and VEGF. Fresh skin burn wound samples from six pigs were collected at days 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) were used with gene-specific primers. RT-PCR products were run on ethidium bromide gel and analyzed under UV light with Bio-Rad Gel Document 2000 system. One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. The results showed:'1) There were increases of all dermal extracellular matrices and growth factors tested; 2) A significant increase of type IV collagen occurred the earliest, while expressions of type I collagen and elastin increased at the latest; 3) A dramatic induction of MMP 1 and MMP 9 was observed shortly after wounding, which lasted through entire experiment; 4) The increased expression of VEGF, which is critical to angiogenesis, occurred early with peak at days 1 and 4, respectively. The expression pattern of bFGF, which has strong promoting effects on both endothelial cells and fibroblasts, is similar to that of VEGF; 5) For growth factors important for matrix deposition, both TGF beta 1 and 3 expressions increased gradually with sustained high level during entire experiment. The expression of CTGF, which is important in matrix production and remodeling, increased in later stage. This study showed the correlation between growth factor expression and dermal matrix deposition, which may have implications in developing strategies to improve burn wound healing. This study was supported by grants from DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.

AB  - The typical management of ?sternal infection? is sternectomy and flaps. Healed wounds and low mortality are the rule, but problems of surgical morbidity, chest instability, respiratory mechanics, and upper extremity function complicate these procedures. However, when pathophysiology of sternal failure is critically assessed, and contemporary good bone and wound care are applied, results improve. Specifically, the sternotomy is a fracture. Sternal biomechanics after sagittal osteotomy promote nonunion. When the poor fixation of twist wires fails, sternal dehiscence and wound bursitis ensue, typical of any pseudarthrosis. Commonly misinterpreted as ?infection,? the bone remains intrinsically healthy, and these wounds simply need proper wound management until they can be reclosed, and then stable bone fixation with hardware. Experience.? 28 patients had plate-and-screw fixation of the sternum. Original operations: heart surgery, 26?pts (21?m/6?f, ages 44?82); thoracic cancers, 2?pts (42?m, 39?f). Presentation: dehiscence, abscess, open wound, 20?pts (variable acuity, variable surgery-until-complication intervals); healed wounds with instability symptoms, 8?pts. Ten pts had rewirings or other prior procedures which failed. For open wounds or abscess, debridement was followed by a period of open wound care (often outpatient) until suitable for closure. In all but the first 4 patients, hardware fixation used a mandibular plating system with 2.7?mm screws. Flaps and nonautogenous bone grafts were used as needed to fill gaps. Results.? Two early closures failed during intense coughing. The other 26 repairs withstood all postoperative stresses, and the fractures healed. Instability symptoms and disabilities were corrected. Bedside debridements and outpatient wound care kept utilization low in permissible circumstances, with no inpatient days for a few. The habitual indiscriminate designation of all sternal complications as ?infection? is inconsistent with well-understood principles of bone and wound pathology. Most sternums fail due to mechanical dehiscence. With bone preserving wound care followed by rigid internal fixation, as is practiced for all other fractures, outcomes, by all measures, are improved.

AB  - Angiogenesis is a dynamic process that requires interaction of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. Several methodologies have been used to evaluate this process. The quail chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a suitable model to explore angiogenesis in vivo. Recently, the morphometric parameters of fractal dimension (Df) and grid intersection (?) are used to quantify angiogenesis in CAM. However, more information is necessary to understand angiogenic mechanisms. New methods to measure additional parameters such as the average blood vessel thickness, tortuousity, total branch length and complexity (junction node number), are described herein. For the analysis, CAM images were obtained from ex ovo culture of E8-E9 quail embryos. MatLab?(The MathWorks, Natick, MA) software was used for the analyses of branches nodes, thickness and length of the forming branches. Conventional morphometry was done using IPLab (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). To validate the new parameters, leptin, VEGF and neutralizing antibodies were evaluated. Leptin and VEGF treated CAM had increased complexity and vascular densities (Df?=?1.5?±?0.005; ??=?12.3?±?0.689) and (Df?=?1.6?±?0.006; ??=?14.3?±?0.465), respectively, compared to PBS control (Df?=?1.3?±?0.035; ??=?8.6?±?0.439). There was a corresponding decrease antileptin and anti-VEGF antibodies. The node-structural map applied to CAM images reveled 53% increase in the number of one-branch nodes and 50% increase in three-branch nodes with leptin compared to controls. Additionally, the total branch length was 30% greater with leptin along with a decrease in vessel thickness, The analyses allowed quantification of branching, tortuousity, thickness, and length of the new blood vessels. Together with the conventional morphometric parameters, these new analyses will help understand the mechanisms exerted by angiogenesis-modulating molecule.

AB  - Background and Objectives:? Hyaluronan (HA), a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan is synthesized by one of three distinct hyaluronan synthases (HAS). The purposes of this study were to determine whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1?(IL-1?), and hyaluronan expression in normal jejunum-derived mesenchymal cells (JDMCs), to identify possible mechanisms involved and to determine the effects of glucocorticoids, a common therapy for intestinal inflammatory pathologies including Crohn?s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), on cytokine-mediated hyaluronan expression. Experimental Procedures:? JDMCs were stimulated with IL-1? for 20?hr with or without pretreatment for 1?hr with mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors or dexamethasone. HA levels from culture media were quantified using a slot blotting approach. HAS transcript levels were quantified using RPA. Immunoblotting was used to detect and quantify activation of MAP kinases. Results:? Preliminary data of sample tissue from patients with Crohn?s or UC indicated increased HAS transcript levels. Similarly, IL-1? induced an approximate 18-fold increase in both HAS2 steady state transcripts and HA levels. These increases were blocked by dexamethasone (95%). Knockdown with siRNA demonstrated that IL-1? induction of HA expression occurred via HAS2. Immunoblot analysis indicated that IL-1? activated the ERK1/2, p38 and JNK pathways. Inhibitors of the p38 and ERK1/2, but not JNK, blocked the IL-1? induction of HA expression (80 and 90%, repectively). Similarly, dexamethasone was also found to block activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 pathways indicating a mechanism for glucocorticoid steroid regulation of HAS expression. Conclusion:? This study provides evidence for proinflammatory cytokine regulation of HA expression in JDMCs. Furthermore, this study provides support for the hypothesis that HA may be one of the targets involved in the treatment of steroid-dependent inflammatory bowel disease. Support:? This work was supported by NIH GM 58530.

AB  - Introduction:? There is extensive data implicating the role of the TGF-beta pathway in hypertrophic scarring. However, few studies have examined the temporal expression of the various TGF-beta cytokines and their receptors. Purpose:? This study sought to determine the temporal mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TGFR-I, TGFR-II, Smad-3, and collagen I in a rabbit ear model of hypertrophic scarring compared to smaller, nonhypertrophic control scars. Methods:? In an established model of hypertrophic scarring, 7?mm (hypertrophic) and 5?mm (nonhypertrophic control) punch wounds were made on the ears of 12 rabbits. Wounds were harvested at days 7, 15, 28, and 40. Histologic evaluation was performed on all scars in order to validate the model. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to compare mRNA expression between the various time points. Results:? At day 7, the 5?mm wounds had epithelialized to a greater extent than the 7?mm wounds. At day 28 and 40, the 7?mm scars were hypertrophic compared to the 5?mm control scars. In both 7?mm and 5?mm scars, TGF-beta1 and beta3 levels declined over time. In 7?mm scars, TGF-beta2 peaked at day 28, TGFR-I levels peaked at day 15, and TGFR-II and Smad-3 remained stable over time. As expected, collagen I expression peaked at day 28. In the 5?mm scars, TGF-beta2 levels remained stable, TGFR-I levels peaked at day 28, while levels of TGFR-II and Smad-3 declined slightly over time. Collagen I expression peaked at day 15. Conclusions:? The up-regulation of TGF-beta2 mRNA expression in hypertrophic but not flat scars indicates that it may be important to scar hypertrophy. The sustained expression of TGFR-II and Smad-3 in hypertrophic scars compared to controls suggests that the role of the TGF-beta family in the process of hypertrophic scarring is complex.

AB  - The role of the EGF superfamily of growth factors and their receptors during wound healing continues to unfold. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of overexpression of erbB3 in wound healing and whether topical application of its various ligands enhances repair. Partial thickness porcine wounds were transfected with recombinant adenoviral particles containing erbB3 receptor gene or a vehicle ?-galactosidase gene (Lac Z). Highly similar ligands: Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Epiregulin (EPR), Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), Heregulin (HER) were topically applied to wounds boosted with erbB3 receptors. Enhanced wound healing parameters were assessed 5 days after initial treatment for reepithelization, dermal depth, macrophage infiltration, proliferating cells, angiogenesis, and apoptotic cells. Treatment with EPR and HB-EGF promoted greater resurfacing of the epidermal layer than EGF, HER, erbB3 only or vehicle treated wounds. Neodermal formation as measured by dermal or granulation depth was significantly different in the EPR and HB-EGF treated wounds compared to EGF, HER, erbB3 only or vehicle. Numerous hallmarks of enhanced wound maturity (fewer infiltrating macrophages, significant reductions in neovascularization, fibroblastic proliferation) were noted in EPR- and HB-EGF-treated wounds transfected with erbB3 as compared to vehicle controls. Only erbB3 wounds treated with these particular ligands showed significant increases in apoptotic cells. Our results indicate that wounds treated with this erbB3 receptor form supplied with topical application of EPR and HB-EGF exhibit synergistic and accelerating reparative effects on porcine partial thickness wounds as compared to vehicle. These in vivo findings suggest the complexity and evidence of synergism between the erbB receptor and its various ligands on wound healing. (This research work was funded by the NIH GM40437.)

AB  - This study examined adult hospitalized patients? responses to wound care pain and its treatment. Wound care included dressing change, packing, irrigation, and debridement. The subjective experience of pain intensity was measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS) prior to, immediately after, and 10 minutes after completion of the procedure. The sample was composed of 412 subjects. Most were male (52.3%), white (73.9%), had one wound (59.5%), and had undergone surgery (73.9%). When pain intensity was compared over time, pain intensity was greatest (NRS 4.4, SD 3.2) during the procedure (p?<?.023), and nonsurgical patients experienced significantly greater pain than surgical patients (p?=?.002)(NRS 5.3, SD 3.0, NRS 4.1, SD3.2, respectively). Most patients underwent multiple wound care procedures. When the pain intensity of undergoing only a dressing change (n?=?61), only packing (n?=?41), or ≥2 procedures (n?=?258) was examined by whether subjects had undergone surgery or no surgery, nonsurgical patients reported greater pain intensity with dressing change (p?<?.001) and ≥2 procedures (p?<?.001). Few subjects received analgesics (7.3% surgical patients 5.9% nonsurgical); there was no difference by group in the amount of opioid administered (p?=?.821). Sedatives and NSAIDS were rarely used. Treatment with pain medication was examined over time. Those with least pain received significantly less pain medication when compared with those who received premedication only and those who received medication prior to and during the procedure (p?<?.05). Findings show wound care is painful and wound care pain is undertreated. Further research is needed to address the effect of pain on wound-related patient outcomes and strategies to minimize pain.

AB  - Angiogenesis plays a critical role in wound healing. In wound healing new blood vessels are generated, then later in scar-resolving stages of the repair process, these newly formed blood vessels undergo destabilization and significant regression. ELR-negative chemokines have been shown to have angiostatic properties and are produced in high concentration late in the granulation tissue and resolving stage of wound repair. The receptor for the ELR-negative chemokines, CXCR3, is expressed on endothelial cells but its function is not known. To understand the physiologic role CXCR3 plays in regulating endothelial function, we analyzed the ability of the CXCR3 ligand, IP-10, to inhibit endothelial cell tube formation. IP-10 was able to inhibit endothelial cell tube formation alone and prevent VEGF-induced tube formation on Matrigel?. Treatment of endothelial cells with IP-10 significantly inhibited endothelial motility. Thus, the ELR-negative chemokines inhibit angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial motility. To identify the signaling pathway(s) mediated by CXCR3 that inhibit endothelial cell motility, we looked at the regulation of key processes. As CXCR3 is a receptor known to generate cAMP, as we show in these cells, we examined PKA-mediated inhibition of calpain. Treatment of endothelial cells with VEGF induced the activation of m-calpain but costimulation with IP-10 significantly decreased m-calpain activity. Using cAMP analogs, 8-Br-cAMP, a PKA activator, is able to inhibit VEGF- induced motility and Rp-8-Br-cAMP, a PKA inhibitor, is able to reverse the inhibitory effects of IP-10 on endothelial migration and calpain activation. To further demonstrate that m-calpain is important in endothelial motility we show that siRNA knockdown of m-calpain inhibited VEGF induced migration. These data indicate that activation of CXCR3 inhibits endothelial migration through the PKA-mediated inhibition of m-calpain. These findings provide new targets to modulate the resolution phase of wound repair.

AB  - Introduction:? There are several proposed animal models of hypertrophic scarring. However, most are quite dissimilar from the actual human event. It has been shown that wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars. We are attempting to fully validate this model. A fourfold increase in mast cells and formation of collagen nodules have been described as characteristics of human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized the occurrence of nodules and mast cells in Duroc scars is similar. Methods:? For nodules, we biopsied human hypertrophic scars (47 cases) taken 5 to 67 months from injury and Duroc scars (six animals) taken 0 to 5 months from injury. For mast cells, we biopsied human hypertrophic scar (five cases) taken 24 to 30 months from injury and Duroc scars (five animals) taken 5 months from injury. We stained the sections with hematoxylin and eosin (nodules) and Giemsa (mast cells) and counted intact mast cells in the upper papillary dermis in 20 and recorded nodules as present or absent. Results:? The results are included the table below. Tissue Month n Nodules mean?±?SD P Duroc Scar ?0?3 10 ?0 ?4?5 ?6 50% NODULES Human Hypertrophic ?5?12 ?9 33% 12?24 22 36% 24?67 16 81% MAST CELLS Duroc Scar ?4?5 ?5 ?41?±?26 <.05 Duroc Uninjured ?5 ?18?±?9 Human Hypertrophic 24?30 ?5 251?±?139 <.01 Human Uninjured ?5 ?60?±?24 Conclusion:? Collagen nodules and increased numbers of mast cells are present in Duroc scar giving further validity to the female, red Duroc pig as an animal model of hypertrophic scarring.

AB  - Background:? Both passive and active dressings and technologies are proposed for treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. A quantitative assessment of healing is needed. Measurement of scattering and absorption characteristics of healing tissue, by Diffuse Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) may provide such a method. Methods:? 20 rats were divided into an induced diabetic and a control group (N?=?10 each). Full thickness wounds were made on the dorsal surface and biopsies sent for histologic analysis. Wounds were interrogated at twice per week intervals using a frequency domain near infrared device with three wavelengths of incident light. Amplitude and phase of scattered light were obtained at four different source-detector distances at each wavelength. The probe was positioned at six different locations. Tissue absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were calculated from amplitude and phase data. Wound dimensions were calculated by cross and parallel polarization. Results:? Thirty-eight wounds were evaluated during the experiment. Wound size decreased at twice the rate in control. Average absorption coefficient was higher, by a factor of 2, in diabetics. The average value of reduced scattering coefficient was 30% higher in diabetics as well. During healing, both scattering and absorption coefficient increased faster in diabetics. Discussion:? Higher absorption in diabetic rats suggest impaired blood flow. Scattering reflects tissue disorganization observed in delayed wound healing. Conclusion:? These data suggest that near-infrared spectroscopy can detect the difference in oxygen delivery to the wound and assess wound healing progression. Further analysis is planned to investigate pathologic correlates with spectroscopic data.

AB  - Cultured skin substitutes (CSS) are used as an adjunctive treatment for closure of massive burn wounds. CSS are prepared with keratinocytes and fibroblasts combined with a collagen-based matrix. A cDNA microarray analysis was performed to characterize CSS at a molecular level. We hypothesized that combination of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in a three-dimensional organo typic culture system would result in changes in gene expression compared with cells grown in monolayer culture. Human skin samples were obtained from breast and abdominal tissue of healthy adult females. Fibroblasts and kera tinocytes were isolated and grown in monolayer cultures; CSS, prepared with cells from four independent donors, were cultured for 2?weeks in vitro. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and CSS using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A gene chip representing over 22,000 human genes. Cluster analysis was performed to identify gene expression ?signatures? for each group, and further analysis was performed to identify genes that were significantly increased or decreased in CSS compared with either cell type. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression upon combination of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in organotypic culture. Genes belonging to several classes were significantly increased in CSS compared with fibroblasts and keratinocytes. For example, genes associated with epidermal differentiation, including fillagrin, corneodesmosin, involucrin, and multiple keratins (1, 10, 13, 16, 23), were increased in CSS. Several genes that are overexpressed in psoriasis (S100A7, SERPINB3, PSORS1C1), as well as cytokines IL- 6 and IL-8, were also increased in CSS. Further, multiple MMP genes were up-regulated in CSS. The results suggest that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions contribute to morphogenesis of CSS, including the remodeling of the dermal layer and stratification and differentiation of the epidermal layer. This analysis reveals that CSS exhibit many characteristics of normal or inflamed human skin.

AB  - Pigs have been accepted as good models for skin wound healing research due to their anatomical similarities to humans. The healing response of excisional wounds in juvenile female Yorkshire (Y) pigs closely resembles normal healing in humans. In contrast, identical wounds in female red Duroc (RD) pigs contracted significantly more, resulting in an 80?90% reduction in wound area. This hypercontraction was associated with marked hyperpigmentation at the wound margins, and some features of the RD healing phenotype, such as increased collagen deposition, are similar to hypertrophic scar formation in humans. Recent investigations have begun to elucidate the genetic transmissibility of the RD healing phenotype. Skin wounds were created on Y???RD F1 female animals (N?=?8), and while hyperpigmentation was not observed, the hypercontraction prevalent in the RD persisted in 100% of animals studied. Further, the degree and kinetics of contraction observed in the F1 animals was significantly greater than in the RD. All F1 animals were subsequently bred to a single Yorkshire boar, producing a cohort of 20 female backcross animals. Healing in the backcross animals generally followed the Y phenotype with regard to wound contraction and pigmentation. However, between days 28 and 56, the backcross animals demonstrated significantly less contraction than the Yorkshire animals. These results suggest that the regulation of wound contraction is controlled by a restricted number of major genes and an unidentified number of other genes, which may positively or negatively modulate the influence of the major genes, as observed in the F1 and backcross animals. These studies have begun the process of elucidating the molecular basis for abnormal skin wound healing and scarring. Further ongoing studies are using genomic and proteomic approaches to further elucidate candidate genes potentially involved in the RD healing phenotype. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Abstract. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common primary vasculitis of adults. The incidence of this disease is practically nil in the population under the age of 50?years, then rises dramatically with each passing decade. The median age of onset of the disease is about 75?years. As the ageing population expands, it is increasingly important for ophthalmologists to be familiar with GCA and its various manifestations, ophthalmic and non-ophthalmic. A heightened awareness of this condition can avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is well known that prompt initiation of steroids remains the most effective means for preventing potentially devastating ischaemic complications. This review summarizes the current concepts regarding the immunopathogenetic pathways that lead to arteritis and the major phenotypic subtypes of GCA with emphasis on large vessel vasculitis, novel modalities for disease detection and investigative trials using alternative, non-steroid therapies.

AB  - Abstract Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients have been reported to have more muscle tension than controls, which has provided a rationale for treating them with muscle relaxation therapies (MRT). We tested this rationale by comparing 49 GAD patients with 21 controls. Participants underwent 5-min relaxation tests, during which they either just sat quietly (QS) or sat quietly and tried to relax (R). GAD patients reported themselves to be more worried during the assessment than the controls, had higher heart rates and lower end-tidal pCO2, but not higher muscle tension as measured by multiple EMGs. QS and R did not differ on most psychological and physiological measures, indicating that intention to relax did not affect speed of relaxation. In the GAD group, self-reported anxiety was not associated with electromyographic or autonomic measures. We conclude that GAD is not necessarily characterized by chronic muscle tension, and that this rationale for MRT should be reconsidered.
