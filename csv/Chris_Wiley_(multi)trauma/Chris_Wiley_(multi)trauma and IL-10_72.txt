AB  - Abstract Objective Cognitive problems are commonly reported by hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors and are associated with poorer physical and mental well-being. It was hypothesized that adverse effects of subjective cognitive impairment occur because cognitive difficulties reduce survivors' confidence that they can manage HSCT-related symptoms?that is, self-efficacy for symptom management. Methods Hematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors (n?=?245), 9?months to 3?years post-HSCT, completed measures of subjective cognitive functioning, self-efficacy for symptom management, and clinically important outcomes: depressed mood, anxiety, and quality of life. Mediation analyses using bootstrapping were conducted to investigate whether effects of subjective cognitive impairment on these outcomes were mediated by self-efficacy for cognitive, emotional (SE-Emotional), social (SE-Social), and physical (SE-Physical) symptom management. Results Self-efficacy mediated relations between subjective cognitive impairment and depressed mood (total indirect effect?=??0.0064 and 95% CI ?0.0097 to ?0.0036), anxiety (total indirect effect?=??0.0045, CI ?0.0072 to ?0.0021), and quality of life (total indirect effect?=?0.0952, CI 0.0901 to 0.2642). SE-Emotional was a unique mediator when the outcome was depressed mood and anxiety. SE-Social, SE-Physical, and SE-Emotional were specific mediators when outcome was quality of life. Conclusions Findings support the conclusion that subjective cognitive impairment reduces HSCT survivors' confidence in their ability to manage common post-HSCT symptoms, with implications for physical and mental well-being. Interventions that help enhance survivors' self-efficacy, particularly self-efficacy for the management of emotional symptoms, are likely to benefit HSCT survivors who report subjective cognitive impairment.

AB  - Summary Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome is a congenital and heritable disorder of dogs and cats resulting from primary conformational defects of structures in the upper airway caused by severe shortening of muzzle. Nasopharyngeal stenosis is thought to occur either as a congenital lesion in which the caudal opening of the choanae is malformed, or as an acquired lesion resulting from chronic inflammation in the caudal aspect of the nasal cavity that forms a cicatrix. Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungus that exists in the yeast form in the animal. Aspergillus is a branching septate mold that is ubiquitous in the environment. Chronic Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common chronic upper respiratory tract disorders seen in the feline population and is characterized by nasal discharge and sneezing with excessive mucus production. Nasal tumors represent a small percentage of neoplasms in cats and dogs. Nasal neoplasia is primarily a disease of older dogs and cats.

AB  - Summary The safe use of anesthetics and sedatives in children has recently been questioned based largely on results from neonatal animal studies. Widespread neuronal cell death was observed immediately following an exposure to all clinically used anesthetics and long-term neurological sequelae were subsequently demonstrated in adulthood. However, human applicability of these findings remains controversial. Several factors characteristic to the perioperative period, such as pain, stress, inflammatory response, and hypoxic-ischemic episodes, can all negatively influence brain development. Anesthetic drugs may mitigate some of these factors, potentially rendering them neuroprotective. Co-morbidities, exposure to opioids, and genetic predisposition represent other confounders of neurodevelopment. Accordingly, several recent epidemiological studies have associated these perioperative stressors with subsequent learning abnormalities. Therefore, this chapter provides a synopsis of the currently available preclinical and clinical data regarding the potential impact of the perioperative period on brain development, with a special emphasis on the effects of anesthetics.
