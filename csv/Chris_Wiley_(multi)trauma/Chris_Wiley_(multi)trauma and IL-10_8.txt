AB  - ABSTRACT Background Men and women appear to exhibit different susceptibilities to sepsis and possibly divergent outcomes. However, the effect of sex and gender in critical illness outcomes is still controversial and the underlying mechanisms appear to be complex. Objectives We aimed to systematically review and synthesize evidence on the influence of sex on outcomes in critically ill adult patients with sepsis, as reported in published studies specifically including investigation of the effect of sex among their aims. Primary outcome measures include in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU. Search strategy The review was based on focused literature searches (CINAHL, PUBMED, EMBASE and COCHRANE). Methodological quality was assessed through the STROBE checklist and the Cochrane Tool for Bias in Cohort Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA. Published observational studies addressing outcomes of sepsis among their primary aims and having included gender comparisons among primary outcomes in critically ill adult patients were included. Results A total of eight eligible studies were included. With the exception of mortality, it was not possible to perform meta-analysis for other outcomes. Included studies reported data on 25,619 patients with sepsis (14?309 male/11?310 female). There is a paucity of well-designed studies addressing the effect of sex on mortality among patients with sepsis, and absence of studies addressing the effects of sex on multiple organ dysfunction of non-infectious origin. There was significant heterogeneity among study estimates (p?=?0·001; I2=78·1%). Conclusions Although results of data syntheses appear to point towards a small disadvantage for survival among women, our results suggest that data on the impact of sex on sepsis outcomes remain equivocal. Implications for future research include approaches to adjustment for confounders and prospective designs. Relevance to clinical practice Clarifying sex-related differences in sepsis, if any, is crucial for informing evidence-based care.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - In adults, acute lung injury or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may complicate a wide range of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which involve direct pulmonary insult. The characteristic histological feature of ARDS is an intense inflammatory process in the lungs, which may progress to fibrosis. The earliest physiological characteristic is an increase in the protein permeability across the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lungs. This clinical syndrome is characterized by arterial hypoxaemia and bilateral radiographic infiltrates, which represent protein-rich oedema fluid. In addition there is a neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrate. ?Pulmonary endothelium is actively involved in the development of ARDS. It alters cell?cell adhesion as the initial step in leucocyte migration which, in turn, changes the permeability that allows protein-rich fluid to move into the interstitium. The quantity of this interstitial oedema may be sufficient to cause bulk flow through the epithelial barrier. There is probably independent epithelial injury. Finally, the endothelium can release and metabolize vasoactive and inflammatory substances, such as endothelins, nitric oxide and cytokines, etc. No single substance is responsible for acute lung injury, but rather a complex interplay exists between diverse pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.

AB  - Abstract:? Traumatic experiences of violence like those that were brought about by the communist regime of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) are still present as if they happened yesterday, causing severe disadvantages in everyday life even after all those years. Consequently, in cases of extreme traumatization induced by political imprisonment, persecution and applied psychological methods of disintegration, regressive processes take place which corrode the ego. The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the failure of empathic connection at the time of the trauma, is the strongest characteristic of severe traumatization. As a result of this destruction for the traumatized there is an inability to keep upright an inner empathic, emotional connection. As we try to grasp, from a Jungian point of view, the psychodynamics of severe traumatization, we can speak of a powerful pathogenous complex, which I call the ?Prometheus-complex?. Gustav Bovensiepen speaks of this complex as a sub-network, a limited fragment of the matrix of all internalized experiences, consisting of internal working models, feelings and patterns of anticipation which interact mutually. The human being, captured in such isolation and paralysis of the mind, can find himself ?in the therapist? on a mental level.

AB  - Abstract Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate immunity receptors that are expressed on a wide range of cell types, including CNS glial cells. In general, TLR engagement by specific sets of microbial ligands triggers production of pro-inflammatory factors and enhances antigen-presenting cell functions. The functional roles of TLR in the CNS, however, are still poorly understood. While adult human astrocytes in culture dominantly express TLR4, they display a strikingly strong and selective induction of TLR3 when activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, TLR3 or TLR4 agonists, or oxidative stress. Gene profiling analysis of the astrocyte response to either TLR3 or TLR4 activation revealed that TLR3, but not TLR4, induces expression of a range of neuroprotective mediators and several other molecules that regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and migration. Also, TLR3 triggered enhanced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-9 (IL-9), IL-10, and IL-11 and downregulation of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. The collective TLR3-induced products were found in functional assays to inhibit astrocyte growth, promote human endothelial cell growth, and importantly, to enhance neuronal survival in organotypic human brain slice cultures. Together, our data indicate that TLR3 is induced on human astrocytes upon inflammation and when activated, mediates a comprehensive neuroprotective response rather than a polarized pro-inflammatory reaction. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P?<?0·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.

AB  - Secreted cytokines and growth factors play a key role in the modulation of stem cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. To investigate the interplay between the changes in their expression levels, we used the newly characterized human amniotic fluid derived-mesenchymal progenitor MePR-2B cell line differentiated to a neuro-glial phenotype and exploited the very high sensitivity and versatility of magnetic beads-based immunoassays. We found that a sub-set of proteins, including the cytokines IL-6, TNFα, IL-15, IFN?, IL-8, IL-1ra, MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES and the growth factor PDGFbb, underwent a significant down-regulation following neuro-glial differentiation, whereas the expression levels of IL-12 p70, IL-5, IL-7, bFGF, VEGF and G-CSF were increased. The role of MCP-1/CCL2, previously identified as a regulator of neural progenitor stem cell differentiation, has been further investigated at transcriptional level, revealing that both the chemokine and its receptor are co-expressed in MePR-2B cells and that are regulated upon differentiation, suggesting the presence of an autocrine and paracrine loop in differentiating cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that exogenous CCL2 is capable to affect neuro-glial differentiation in MePR-2B cells, thus providing novel evidences for the potential involvement of chemokine-mediated signaling in progenitor/stem cells differentiation processes and fate specification.

AB  - Macrophages are central to the inflammatory response and its ability to resolve effectively. They are complex cells that adopt a range of subtypes depending on the tissue type and stimulus that they find themselves under. This flexibility allows them to play multiple, sometimes opposing, roles in inflammation and tissue repair. Their central role in the inflammatory process is reflected in macrophage dysfunction being implicated in chronic inflammation and poorly healing wounds. In this study, we discuss recent attempts to model mathematically and computationally the macrophage and how it partakes in the complex processes of inflammation and tissue repair. There are increasing data describing the variety of macrophage phenotypes and their underlying transcriptional programs. Dynamic mathematical and computational models are an ideal way to test biological hypotheses against experimental data and could aid in understanding this multi-functional cell and its potential role as an attractive therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions and tissue repair.

AB  - Organ donors are sources of physiologically healthy organs and tissues for life-saving transplantation, and have been recently used for human immunology studies which are typically confined to the sampling of peripheral blood. Donors comprise a diverse population with different causes of death and clinical outcomes during hospitalization, and the effects of such variations on immune parameters in blood and tissues are not known. We present here a coordinate analysis of innate and adaptive immune components in blood, lymphoid (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes), and mucosal (lungs, intestines) sites from a population of brain-dead organ donors (2 months-93 years; n = 291) across eight clinical parameters. Overall, the blood of donors exhibited similar monocyte and lymphocyte content and low serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as healthy controls; however, donor blood had increased neutrophils and serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1 which varied with cause of death. In tissues, the frequency and composition of monocytes, neutrophils, B lymphocytes and T cell subsets in lymphoid or mucosal sites did not vary with clinical state, and was similar in donors independent of the extent of clinical complications. Our results reveal that organ donors maintain tissue homeostasis, and are a valuable resource for fundamental studies in human immunology.

AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical condition responsible for high mortality and the development of multiple organ dysfunctions, because of the lack of specific and effective therapies for ALI. Increasing evidence from pre-clinical studies supports preventive and therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, also called mesenchymal stromal cells) in ALI/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Therapeutic effects of MSCs were noticed in various delivery approaches (systemic, local, or other locations), multiple origins (bone marrow or other tissues), or different schedules of administrations (before or after the challenges). MSCs could reduce the over-production of inflammatory mediators, leucocyte infiltration, tissue injury and pulmonary failure, and produce a number of benefit factors through interaction with other cells in the process of lung tissue repair. Thus, it is necessary to establish guidelines, standard operating procedures and evaluation criteria for translating MSC-based therapies into clinical application for patients with ALI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Interleukin (IL)-6 production in contracting skeletal muscle and IL-6 concentration in plasma are increased after prolonged and strenuous exercise. However, as tissue stress or damage are unspecific triggers of increased cytokine levels, we examined whether moderate muscle activity is an independent stimulus for cytokine expression, and to which extent invasive procedures might affectthe results. Soleus muscles were isolated from sedentary rats or from rats that had been running on a treadmill at moderate intensity (70% of maximal oxygen uptake) for 1?h. In another group the soleus muscle was prepared in situ and stimulated intermittently at 5?Hz for 1?h, so that maximal developed force declined by 30%. In situ prepared soleus muscles not subjected to electrical stimulation were used as controls. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 11 cytokines was analysed in the soleus muscles using multiprobe RNAse protection assay, and IL-6 plasma concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treadmill exercise did not affect the mRNA expression of any of the measured cytokines in the soleus muscle. Irrespective of electrical stimulation, mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-1? were significantly increased in the surgically manipulated soleus muscles. Interleukin-6 plasma concentration was not affected by treadmill running or electrical stimulation. Conclusion, gentle surgical manipulation is a strong stimulus for IL-6 and IL-1? mRNA synthesis in skeletal muscle, whereas exercise or electrical muscle stimulation at moderate intensity does not independently affect cytokine mRNA levels in the contracting soleus.

AB  - Abstract Background Patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy remain at increased risk for developing febrile neutropenia (FN). For this heterogeneous population, a biomarker based risk stratification of FN patients may be a useful clinical tool. We hypothesized that serum biomarkers during initial presentation of an FN event could be predictive of subsequent clinical outcome. Procedure Eighty-nine FN events from 36 non-consecutive subjects were analyzed. ?High-risk? FN criteria included prolonged hospitalization (≥7 days), admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or a microbiology confirmed bacteremia. Patients with ?low risk? FN had none of the above. Biomarkers measured during the first 2 days of FN hospitalization were analyzed and correlated with respective clinical outcome. Results Of the 89 FN events, 44 (49%) fulfilled pre-defined high-risk criteria and 45 (51%) were low-risk. Procalcitonin level (>0.11?ng/ml) was found to be associated with the high-risk FN outcome with sensitivity of 97%. With an increase in log scale by 1, the odds of being high-risk FN increased twofold. Hs-CRP >100?mg/L had sensitivity of 88% in predicting high-risk FN. The odds of a high-risk FN event increased by approximately 1.8-fold with an increase in the log scale of hs-CRP by 1 (10-fold). In univariate analysis, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were statistically significant and associated with high-risk FN. However, no statistically significant difference was found for IL-1α, sIL-2Ra, IL-3, or TNF-α. Conclusions Biomarkers with appropriate critical threshold values may be a useful clinical tool for appropriate risk stratification of children with FN.
