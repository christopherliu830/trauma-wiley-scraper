AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of including the fractured vertebra in the short-segment fixation of thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. Methods A total of 32 patients with thoraco-lumbar fractures, selected between August 2013 and February 2016, were managed by short-segment fixation with screws at the level of the fracture, and decompression was performed only for patients with neurological deficits. The patients' functional outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score for neurological condition. All patients were followed up with radiographs. Results Patients with complete neurologic deficits (n = 3) did not show any neurologic recovery. All ASIA B patients improved to ASIA C. Five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA E. The remaining five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA D. All ASIA D patients improved to ASIA B. At the final follow-up examination, the mean anterior vertebral height was 21?±?5?mm, indicating no significant height loss during the follow-up period. Conclusion Short-segment fixation of TL fractures with inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers good correction of segmental kyphosis, vertebral wedging, and vertebral height loss.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract Neurological disorders occur in the central and peripheral nervous system and include Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Activation of the innate immune system inevitably occurs in all forms of neurological disorders. The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multimolecular complex that can sense danger signals associated with neurological disorders. Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes caspase-1-mediated interleukin-1? and interleukin-18 maturation in microglia, where neuroinflammation contributes to neurological disease development and progression. Thus, this review attempts to elucidate the current knowledge regarding NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Recent scientific findings with respect to neuroprotective effects of dietary phytochemicals against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neurological disorders summarized in this review suggest that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by plant-derived phytochemicals could be a potential strategy for prevention or treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract Inflammasomes are a specialized group of intracellular sensors that are key components of the host innate immune system. Autoinflammatory diseases are disorders of the innate immune system that are characterized by recurrent inflammation and serious complications. Dysregulation of the inflammasome is associated with the onset and progression of several autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this review, we discuss the involvement of various inflammasome components in the regulation of autoinflammatory disorders and describe the manifestations of these autoinflammatory diseases caused by inflammasome activation.

AB  - Abstract Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of microglia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of depression. Activated microglia produce a wide range of factors whose prolonged or excessive release may lead to brain disorders. Thus, the inhibition of microglial cells may be beneficial in the treatment of depressive diseases. Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant drug with proven clinical efficacy, but its mechanism of action remains still not fully understood. In the present study, using microglial cultures we investigated whether tianeptine modifies microglial activation after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and which intracellular pathways are involved in the activity of this antidepressant. Our study shows that tianeptine attenuated the LPS-evoked inflammatory activation of microglia by decreasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1?, IL-18, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), the release of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Analyses of signaling pathways demonstrate that tianeptine led to the suppression of LPS-induced TLR4 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, our study reveals the inhibitory impact of tianeptine on caspase-3-induced PKCδ degradation and consequently on the activation of NF-?B factor in microglial cells. Taken together, present results show anti-inflammatory properties of tianeptine in microglial cultures stimulated by LPS. This study provides evidence that the inhibition of microglial activation may underlie the therapeutic activity of tianeptine. Our findings show the anti-inflammatory effect of tianeptine (TIA) in lipopolisaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells. The beneficial tianeptine action is mediated through the inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression as well as the TLR4-related pathways: extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), caspase-3-dependent protein kinase δ (PKCδ) cleavage and the expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B). These findings may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of disorders based on neuroinflammation, including depression.

AB  - Background In health, the hormones amylin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) slow gastric emptying (GE) and modulate glycaemia. The aims of this study were to determine amylin and GLP-1 concentrations in the critically ill and their relationship with GE, glucose absorption and glycaemia. Methods In fasted critically ill and healthy subjects (n?=?26 and 23 respectively), liquid nutrient, containing 100?mg 13C-sodium octanoate and 3?g 3-O-methlyglucose (3-OMG), was administered via a nasogastric tube. Amylin, GLP-1, glucose and 3-OMG concentrations were measured in blood samples taken during fasting, and 30 min and 60?min after the ?meal?. Breath samples were taken to determine gastric emptying coefficient (GEC). Intolerance to intragastric feeding was defined as a gastric residual volume of ≥?250?ml and/or vomiting within the 24?h prior to the study. Results Although GE was slower (GEC: critically ill 2.8?±?0.9 vs. health, 3.4?±?0.2; P?=?0.002), fasting blood glucose was higher (7.0?±?1.9 vs. 5.7?±?0.2?mmol/l; P?=?0.005) and overall glucose absorption was reduced in critically ill patients (3-OMG: 9.4?±?8.0 vs. 17.7?±?4.9?mmol/l.60?min; P?<?0.001), there were no differences in fasting or postprandial amylin concentrations. Furthermore, although fasting [1.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 0.7 (0.3?32.0)?pmol/l; P?=?0.04] and postprandial [3.0 (0.4?8.5) vs. 0.8 (0.4?34.3)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02] GLP-1 concentrations were increased in the critically ill and were greater in feed intolerant when compared with those tolerating feed [3.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 1.2 (0.7?4.6)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02], there were no relationships between GE and fasting amylin or GLP-1 concentrations. Conclusion In the critically ill, fasting GLP-1, but not amylin, concentrations are elevated and associated with feed intolerance. Neither amylin nor GLP-1 appears to substantially influence the rate of GE.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between prealbumin, nutrient intake, and indicators of inflammation for recuperative and rehabilitative care patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Recuperative Care Unit within a Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eleven men (100 white; mean age 80, range 64?93). MEASUREMENTS: Prealbumin and seven markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their soluble receptors) were measured at admission and discharge (median length of stay 23 days, interquartile range 15?40 days). Detailed calorie counts were performed daily, and intake was expressed as a percentage of estimated requirements for protein (1.5?g/kg body weight per day) and energy (Harris-Benedict equation). The study objective was examined using least-squares regression analysis. RESULTS: Discharge prealbumin and the change in prealbumin were positively correlated with protein and energy intake and inversely correlated with markers of inflammation, particularly CRP and IL-6. When all covariates were included in a multivariable regression analysis, the markers of inflammation predominantly accounted for the variance in prealbumin change (56%), whereas discharge protein intake accounted for 6%. CONCLUSION: For older recuperative care patients, prealbumin and its change during hospitalization are positively associated with protein intake, but inflammation or changes in inflammation appear to exert a much more-powerful influence on prealbumin concentration. Given the potential confounding effects of inflammation, monitoring the change in prealbumin is not an adequate substitute for a more-detailed nutritional assessment in this population.

AB  - Abstract Inflammasomes are signalling platforms that sense a diverse range of microbial products and also a number of stress and damage associated endogenous signals. Inflammasome complexes can be formed by members of the Nod-like receptor family or the PYHIN family member AIM2. Upon formation, inflammasomes trigger proteolysis of caspase-1, which subsequently leads to a potent inflammatory response through the maturation and secretion of IL-1 family cytokines, which can be accompanied by an inflammatory cell death termed pyroptosis. Here, we review the sensing mechanisms of the currently characterized inflammasome complexes and discuss how they are involved in the innate immune response against microbial pathogens. We especially highlight recent advances in the molecular understanding of how microbial patterns are detected and discriminated from endogenous compounds by inflammasome sensors. Further, we review how inflammasomes contribute to the anti microbial host defense by cytokine-dependent and cell autonomous mechanisms. This review is part of the review series on host-pathogen interactions. See more reviews from this series..

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to identify pressure ulcer (PU) incidence and risk factors that are associated with PU development in patients in two adult intensive care units (ICU) in Saudi Arabia. A prospective cohort study design was used. A total of 84 participants were screened second daily basis until discharge or death, over a consecutive 30-day period, out of which 33 participants with new PUs were identified giving a cumulative hospital-acquired PU incidence of 39·3% (33/84 participants). The incidence of medical devices-related PUs was 8·3% (7/84). Age, length of stay in the ICU, history of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, infrequent repositioning, time of operation, emergency admission, mechanical ventilation and lower Braden Scale scores independently predicted the development of a PU. According to binary logistic regression analyses, age, longer stay in ICU and infrequent repositioning were significant predictors of all stages of PUs, while the length of stay in the ICU and infrequent repositioning were associated with the development of stages II?IV PUs. In conclusion, PU incidence rate was higher than that reported in other international studies. This indicates that urgent attention is required for PU prevention strategies in this setting.

AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are clinically severe respiratory disorders, and there are currently no Food and Drug Administration?approved drug therapies. Melatonin is a well-known anti-inflammatory molecule, which has proven to be effective in ALI induced by many conditions. Emerging studies suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role during ALI. How melatonin directly blocks activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in ALI remains unclear. In this study, using an LPS-induced ALI mouse model, we found intratracheal (i.t.) administration of melatonin markedly reduced the pulmonary injury and decreased the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into lung. During ALI, the NLRP3 inflammasome is significantly activated with a large amount of IL-1? and the activated caspase-1 occurring in the lung. Melatonin inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by both suppressing the release of extracellular histones and directly blocking histone-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, i.t. route of melatonin administration opens a more efficient therapeutic approach for treating ALI.

AB  - Summary The inflammatory response to acute injury among humans has proved difficult to study due to the significant heterogeneity encountered in actual patients. We set out to characterize the immune response to a model injury with reduced heterogeneity, a tracheostomy, among stable critical care patients, using a broad cytokine panel and clinical data. Twenty-three critical care patients undergoing percutaneous bedside tracheostomies were recruited in a medical intensive care unit. Blood samples were collected at five intervals during 24-h peri-procedure. Patients were followed-up for 28 days for clinical outcomes. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the cytokines between the five time-points when studied as a whole cohort. Longitudinal analysis of the cytokine patterns at the individual patient level with a clustering algorithm showed that, notwithstanding the significant heterogeneity observed, the patients? cytokine responses can be classified into three broad patterns that show increasing, decreasing or no major changes from the baseline. This analytical approach also showed statistically significant associations between cytokines, with those most likely to be associated being interleukin (IL)-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and ferritin, as well as a strong tri-way correlation between GCSF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1? (MIP1?). In conclusion, in this standard human model of soft tissue injury, by applying longitudinal analysis at the individual level, we have been able to identify the cytokine patterns underlying the seemingly random, heterogeneous patient responses. We have also identified consistent cytokine interactions suggesting that IL-6, GCSF, MCP1 and MIP1? are the cytokines most probably driving the immune response to this injury.

AB  - Summary Membrane-bound and intracellular immune receptors respond to microbial pathogens by initiating signaling cascades that result in production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial factors. These host responses need to be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage and other harmful consequences of excessive inflammation. CARD-only proteins (COPs) and Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are human- and primate-specific dominant negative inhibitors that modulate inflammatory and innate immune responses. In addition, several poxviruses encode POPs that interfere with inflammatory and host defense responses. COPs and POPs modulate inflammatory signaling at several checkpoints by sequestering key components of the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling cascades, thus hampering downstream signal transduction. Here, we review and discuss current understanding of the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms by which roles of host- and virus-encoded COPs and POPs may regulate inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, we address their (patho)physiological roles and highlight topics for further research.

AB  - Autoinflammatory diseases are hyperinflammatory, immune dysregulatory conditions that typically present in early childhood with fever and rashes and disease-specific patterns of organ inflammation. This review provides a historic background of autoinflammatory disease research, an overview of the currently genetically defined autoinflammatory diseases, and insights into treatment strategies derived from understanding of the disease pathogenesis. The integrative assessment of autoinflammatory conditions led to the identification of innate pro-inflammatory cytokine ?amplification loops? as the cause of the systemic and organ-specific disease manifestations, which initially centered around increased IL-1 production and signaling. More recently, additional innate pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification loops resulting in increased Type I IFN, IL-17, IL-18, or IL-36 signaling or production have led to the successful use of targeted therapies in some of these conditions. Clinical findings such as fever patterns, type of skin lesions, genetic mutation testing, and the prevalent cytokine abnormalities can be used to group autoinflammatory diseases.

AB  - ABSTRACT Long-term administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can induce detrimental side effects such as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) in human. Although inflammation is known to be associated with BRONJ development, the detailed underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-36α is, in part, responsible for the BRONJ development. We found a notably higher level of IL-36α and lower level of collagen in the BRONJ lesions in mice. We also found that IL-36α remarkably suppressed TGF-?-mediated expression of Collα1 and α-Sma via the activation of Erk signaling pathway in mouse gingival mesenchymal stem cells. When IL-36 signaling was abrogated in vivo, development of BRONJ lesions was ameliorated in mice. Taken together, we showed the pathologic role of IL-36α in BRONJ development by inhibiting collagen expression and demonstrated that IL-36α could be a potential marker and a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of BRONJ. ? 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND Prostatic inflammation is gaining increasing attention as a potential etiologic factor in prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, and CPPS. This study was performed to address the need for a well characterized model of acute prostatic inflammation that may be used to study the effect of acute inflammation on epithelial and stromal cell proliferation, voiding behavior, and neurovascular physiology. METHODS Uropathogenic E. coli 1677 was instilled transurethrally into adult C57BL/6J male mice. Prostates were analyzed at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 14 days post-instillation and compared to saline-instilled and naïve controls. Time course and severity of inflammation were characterized by the quantity and type of inflammatory infiltrate present, hemorrhage, proliferation, and reactive hyperplasia. RT-PCR was performed to characterize inflammatory mediators including IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-1RA, IL-18, IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, TNFα, and COX-2. RESULTS Inflammation was evident in all lobes of the prostate with the DLP most severely affected. Infection consistently led to a significant increase in neutrophils and macrophages in the early stages of prostate infection, followed by lymphocytic inflammation at the later time points. Inflammation was accompanied by induction of several inflammatory genes, including IL-1 family members, IL-6, and COX-2, and induced a significant increase in epithelial proliferation and reactive hyperplasia in all three prostate lobes. CONCLUSIONS Transurethral inoculation of uropathogenic E. coli 1677 reliably infects the mouse prostate, produces a significant inflammatory response, and induces quantifiable epithelial proliferation and reactive hyperplasia.

AB  - Summary Platelets play a critical role at the interphase of thrombosis and inflammation, key features in haemolysis-associated disorders. Exercising this role requires expression of pattern recognition receptors by platelets, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat containing protein 3 (NLRP3), the latter forming intraplatelet multiprotein inflammasome complexes. Platelets are a potential target of various damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, such as free haem, a degradation by-product of haemoglobin oxidation during haemolysis, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a DNA-binding protein released by dying or stressed cells and activated platelets. We have recently identified platelet TLR4, NLRP3, and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) as critical regulators of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, suggesting that the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is a potential therapeutic target. Increasing evidence suggests that these and other DAMP-driven signalling mechanisms employed by platelets might be key in mediating inflammation and thrombosis encountered in haemolytic disorders. However, the precise regulatory triggers and their clinical relevance are poorly understood. We provide new insights into these less-well characterised platelet mechanisms, which are potentially targetable in haemolytic disorders.
