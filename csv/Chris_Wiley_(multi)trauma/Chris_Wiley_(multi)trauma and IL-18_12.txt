AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the contributions of inflammatory activation, particularly that of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in depressive illness and the specific role of stressors may have in this regard. In so doing, the authors necessarily consider the various approaches used to link cytokine functioning and depressive illness. Associations between circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and depressive disorders have provided valuable information concerning the implications of peripheral inflammation in relation to depressive illness. The relationships between elevated inflammation and depression may be moderated by stressors, or alternatively, inflammatory processes might give rise to stressor-like neurochemical changes (e.g., monoamine variations) that come to elicit depressive symptoms. Several animal studies have been conducted in an effort to describe the behavioral syndrome associated with inflammatory activation and to define the factors responsible for the behavioral and biological effects of cytokines.

AB  - Summary All currently recognized neurological diseases are believed to be associated with some degree of neuroinflammation. Indeed, patient postmortem examinations almost always reveal enhanced expression of highly activated immunocompetent microglia within degenerating brain regions, often together with astrocyte and pro-inflammatory cytokine (neuro-immune signaling glycoproteins) accumulation. Paralleling these human studies, data from various genetic and toxin-based animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD, respectively), have likewise demonstrated a prominent cytokine-microglial inflammatory component. Such preclinical work has been critical in moving the discussion surrounding the significance of neuroinflammation in degenerative brain diseases from correlation to causation. Hence, the potential of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory agents to mitigate neurodegeneration in AD and PD deserves serious attention. That said, there is a growing consensus that neuroinflammation may be best viewed as a ?double-edged sword?, with the capacity to influence both positive and negative outcomes. A better understanding of the factors that modulate neuroinflammatory processes is therefore critical for developing optimal strategies for therapeutically manipulating neuro-immune responses in AD and PD.

AB  - It has been recognized for some time that cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are, to a major extent, inflammatory disorders associated with an environment characterized by a sedentary lifestyle together with abundant intakes of calories. Systemic low-level inflammation is suggested to be a cause as well as consequence of pathological processes with local tumor necrosis factor α production as an important biological driver. It is hypothesized that physical inactivity contributes to an enhanced proinflammatory burden independently of obesity, as regular muscle contractions mediate signals with myokines/cytokines as important messengers, which suppress proinflammatory activity at distant sites as well as within skeletal muscle. Muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to possess a central role in anti-inflammatory activities and health beneficial effects in relation to physical exercise. It is discussed how this fits the consistent observation that enhanced plasma levels of IL-6 represent a strong risk marker in chronic disorders associated with systemic low-level inflammation and all-cause mortality.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), that is Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, affects about 1.5 million persons in the USA and 2.2 million in Europe. The pathophysiology of IBD involves immunological, genetic and environmental factors. The treatment is medico-surgical but suspensive. Anti-TNFα agents have revolutionized the treatment of IBD but have side effects. In addition, a non-negligible percentage of patients with IBD stop or take episodically their treatment. Consequently, a nondrug therapy targeting TNFα through a physiological pathway, devoid of major side effects and with a good cost-effectiveness ratio, would be of interest. The vagus nerve has dual anti-inflammatory properties through its afferent (i.e. hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal axis) and efferent (i.e. the anti-TNFα effect of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway) fibres. We have shown that there is an inverse relationship between vagal tone and plasma TNFα level in patients with CD, and have reported, for the first time, that chronic vagus nerve stimulation has anti-inflammatory properties in a rat model of colitis and in a pilot study performed in seven patients with moderate CD. Two of these patients failed to improve after 3 months of vagus nerve stimulation but five were in deep remission (clinical, biological and endoscopic) at 6 months of follow-up and vagal tone was restored. No major side effects were observed. Thus, vagus nerve stimulation provides a new therapeutic option in the treatment of CD.

AB  - Abstract The meglitinides offer an opportunity to target specifically the postprandial hyperglycemia that occurs commonly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Their rapid onset and short duration of action leads to more ?physiological? release of insulin and partially restores the pattern of postprandial insulin secretion that is defective in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This potentially allows tighter glycemic control while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. As prandial glucose regulators they allow flexible dosing such that a tablet need only be taken before a patient has a meal. Repaglinide in particular has been shown to reduce HbA1c and is well-tolerated by patients both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents. It appears to have some advantages from head-to-head studies with sulfonylureas. Nateglinide appears to produce a faster early-phase insulin response that gives it the potential to produce less hypoglycemia, but randomized controlled trials in comparison with sulfonylureas are lacking. Both agents are more expensive than sulfonylureas. Formal data regarding cost-effectiveness are not currently available. However, their flexible administration may be of benefit in certain subgroups such as shift-workers and those with flexible lifestyles. Efficacy in early diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance is currently being investigated. The ability to flexibly dose with these agents makes them useful in patients with flexible lifestyles. Macrovascular and microvascular outcome data for the meglitinides are awaited.

AB  - Summary:? Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis are chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases with a heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. Both the adaptive and the innate immune systems have been suggested to contribute to their pathogenesis and recovery. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system in mediating demyelinating diseases. In particular, we provide an overview of the anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory functions of dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells, ?δ T cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes. We emphasize the interaction of astroctyes with the immune system and how this interaction relates to the demyelinating pathologies. Given the pivotal role of the innate immune system, it is possible that targeting these cells may provide an effective therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases.

AB  - Diabet. Med. 29, e25?e32 (2012) Abstract Aims? There is emerging evidence of a relationship between vitamin?D insufficiency and glucose intolerance. The aim of this study was to determine whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin?D in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods? This nested case?control study examined the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin?D and risk of gestational diabetes within a cohort of pregnant women from March 2008 to December 2009, who had undergone antenatal screening between 15 and 18?weeks gestation and subsequent glucose tolerance testing. Cases were women diagnosed with gestational diabetes and each case was matched to up to two controls without gestational diabetes on age, race and date of blood collection. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin?D was measured from stored antenatal screening samples and compared between cases and controls. Results? Of the 116 women with gestational diabetes and 219 control subjects studied, the average age was 34.3?years and 41% were of non-Caucasian race. Women with gestational diabetes had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin?D compared with control subjects (56.3 vs. 62.0?nmol/l, P?=?0.018). After adjusting for gestational age and maternal weight, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin?D below the top quartile (<?73.5?nmol/l) was associated with a twofold greater likelihood of gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.19?4.13). Conclusions? Lower vitamin?D status in early pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent gestational diabetes that was independent of race, age, season and maternal weight. This study suggests that vitamin?D may influence glucose tolerance during pregnancy and provides support for studies of vitamin D as a potential intervention to prevent gestational diabetes.

AB  - Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreas by an autoimmune response. Due to ethical and practical difficulties, the features of the destructive process are known from a small number of observations, and transcriptomic data are remarkably missing. Here we report whole genome transcript analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction (qRT?PCR) and correlated with immunohistological observations for four T1D pancreases (collected 5 days, 9 months, 8 and 10 years after diagnosis) and for purified islets from two of them. Collectively, the expression profile of immune response and inflammatory genes confirmed the current views on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes and showed similarities with other autoimmune diseases; for example, an interferon signature was detected. The data also supported the concept that the autoimmune process is maintained and balanced partially by regeneration and regulatory pathway activation, e.g. non-classical class I human leucocyte antigen and leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B1 (LILRB1). Changes in gene expression in islets were confined mainly to endocrine and neural genes, some of which are T1D autoantigens. By contrast, these islets showed only a few overexpressed immune system genes, among which bioinformatic analysis pointed to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) (CXCR4) chemokine pathway activation. Remarkably, the expression of genes of innate immunity, complement, chemokines, immunoglobulin and regeneration genes was maintained or even increased in the long-standing cases. Transcriptomic data favour the view that T1D is caused by a chronic inflammatory process with a strong participation of innate immunity that progresses in spite of the regulatory and regenerative mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract: The etiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis ? one of the most common chronic, inflammatory, hyperproliferative skin disorders of man ? have long fascinated dermatologists, pathologists and biologists alike. Here, we have a model disease that offers to study neuroectodermal-mesenchymal interactions in the widest sense possible. Epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells as well as neurons projecting into the skin apparently all interact with each other to generate the characteristic psoriatic lesion. For decades, the ongoing controversy on the molecular nature, choreography and hierarchy of these complex interactions e.g. between epidermal keratinocytes, T cells, neurotrophils, endothelial cells and sensory nerves has served as a driving force propelling investigative dermatology to ever new horizons. This debate has not only been at the heart of our quest to develop more effective forms of therapy for this socially crippling disease, but it also has profoundly influenced how we view the skin as a whole: the numerous competing theories on the pathogenesis of psoriasis published so far also are reflections on the evolution of mainstream thought in skin biology over the last decades. These days, conventional wisdom ? infatuated with a T-cell-centered approach to inflammatory skin diseases ? portrays psoriasis as an autoimmune disease, where misguided T lymphocyte activities cause secondary epithelial abnormalities. And yet, as this CONTROVERSIES feature reminds us, some authoritative ?pockets of academic resistance? are still quite alive, and interpret psoriasis e.g. as a genetically determined, abnormal epithelial response pattern to infectious and/or physicochemical skin insults. Weighing the corresponding lines of argumentation is not only an intriguing, clinically relevant intellectual exercise, but also serves as a wonderful instrument for questioning our own views of the skin universe and its patterns of deviation from a state of homeostasis.

AB  - Abstract Bone and cartilage tissue engineering is an integrative approach that is inspired by the phenomena associated with wound healing. In this respect, growth factors have emerged as important moieties for the control and regulation of this process. Growth factors act as mediators and control the important physiological functions of bone regeneration. Herein, we discuss the importance of growth factors in bone and cartilage tissue engineering, their loading and delivery strategies, release kinetics, and their integration with biomaterials and stem cells to heal bone fractures. We also highlighted the role of growth factors in the determination of the bone tissue microenvironment based on the reciprocal signaling with cells and biomaterial scaffolds on which future bone and cartilage tissue engineering technologies and medical devices will be based upon.
