What are the expectations? Inflammation is a central element of atherogenesis. Innate pathways contribute to vascular inflammation. However, the initial molecular process(es) starting atherogenesis remain elusive. The various risk factors, represented by particular compounds (activators), may cause altered cellular functions in the endothelium (e.g. vascular endothelial cell activation or -dysfunction), in invading cells (e.g. inflammatory mediator production) or in local vessel wall cells (e.g. inflammatory mediators, migration), thereby triggering the innate inflammatory process. The cellular components of innate immunology include granulocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes. Among the molecular innate constituents are innate molecules, such as the toll-like receptors or innate cytokines. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 are among the innate cytokines. Cytokines are potent activators of a great number of cellular functions relevant to maintain or commove homeostasis of the vessel wall. Within the vessel wall, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can significantly contribute to the cytokine-dependent inflammatory network by: (i) production of cytokines, (ii) response to cytokines and (iii) cytokine-mediated interaction with invading leucocytes. The cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are involved in SMC-leucocyte interaction. The IL-6 effects are proposed to be mediated by trans-signalling. Dysregulated cellular functions resulting from dysregulated cytokine production may be the cause of cell accumulation, subsequent low-density lipoprotein accumulation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The deposition of ECM, increased accumulation of leucocytes and altered levels of inflammatory mediators may constitute an ?innate-immunovascular-memory? resulting in an ever-growing response to anew invasion. Thus, SMC-fostered inflammation, promoted by invading innate cells, may be a potent component for development and acceleration of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - Summary The advent of molecular genetic techniques and successful cell culture of the organism towards the end of the 20th century substantially accelerated the understanding of the causative organism, Tropheryma whipplei, and by extension, the underlying clinical condition. Whipple's disease usually is diagnosed at an advanced stage and presents with a variety of clinical manifestations. In classic Whipple's disease small-bowel biopsy usually establishes the diagnosis. The effectiveness of antimicrobials, especially poorly absorbed antibiotics, as the mainstay for treating tropical sprue establishes the central role of enteric bacteria/bacterial overgrowth in the condition. Mycotic infections usually arise from disseminated pulmonary infections and occur usually, but not exclusively, in immunocompromised patients. The differential diagnosis for all mycotic infections of the small intestine is similar and includes other mycotic infections, Crohn's disease, tuberculosis (TB) enteritis, disseminated mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), bacterial typhlitis, intestinal ischemia and carcinoma.

AB  - Abstract With an increase in the ageing population worldwide, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases at an alarming rate in both male and female irrespective of their ethnicity. At present, the currently available therapeutic options are mostly limited to either bone resorptive or bone forming efficacies and both approaches are associated with serious side effects. Despite these options, there is still need for newer therapeutics to treat osteoporosis, which can offer beneficial effects for maintaining balanced dynamics between bone formation and bone resorption, devoid of any side effect. The proper understanding of pathophysiology of the disease is essential for designing or investigating an effective and safe anti-osteoporotic agent. This review represents a discussion around the molecular targets with their implications in disease progression, available therapeutic options, the emerging targets, and the importance of designing an effective anti-osteoporotic agent.

AB  - Abstract The complement cascade has long been recognized to play a key role in inflammatory and degenerative diseases. It is a ?double edged? sword as it is necessary to maintain health, yet can have adverse effects when unregulated, often exacerbating disease. The contrasting effects of complement, depending on whether in a setting of health or disease, is the price paid to achieve flexibility in scope and degree of a protective response for the host from infection and injury. Loss or even decreased efficiency of critical regulatory control mechanisms can result in aggravated inflammation and destruction of self-tissue. The role of the complement cascade is poorly understood in the nervous system and neurological disorders. Novel studies have demonstrated that the expression of complement proteins in brain varies in different cell types and the effects of complement activation in various disease settings appear to differ. Understanding the functioning of this cascade is essential, as it has therapeutic implications. In this review, we will attempt to provide insight into how this complex cascade functions and to identify potential strategic targets for therapeutic intervention in chronic diseases as well as acute injury in the CNS.

AB  - Cerebral air embolism is a known complication of open-heart surgery with devastating consequences. Neurologic injury after CPB can be divided into 2 types: Type I: Focal injury. Type II: Intellectual deterioration/neurocognitive impairment (up to 53% at the time of hospital discharge and 42% could be impaired for up to 5 years). Increasing evidence points to cerebral embolization as the principal culprit. Since the early days of modern cardiac surgery, surgeons have attempted to limits its damage by various means. One of the early techniques propounded was carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial cavity. Carbon dioxide, was uniquely positioned for this, being denser than air, more soluble than air, and easily managed perioperatively if the blood levels were to go up beyond physiological ranges. The technique gradually went into disuse, since there was no instrumentation, in the early days of CPB to measure and establish its impact on the actual outcomes. Secondly, the devices, through which CO2 was delivered, were not effective. There has been increasing enthusiasm for the technique but no consensus on the technical considerations or on the actual benefits of the practice. Our literature search showed that if practiced properly, carbon dioxide flooding does decrease the embolic counts significantly and that, by inference, could possibly improve the neurocognitive outcome. Since, there are no studies at this point in time, which show a direct beneficial correlation, we intend to do a prospective randomized controlled trial, to put things in proper perspective.

AB  - Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response and immune reactions. In the central nervous system (CNS), IL-10 is mainly produced by astrocytes and microglia and it is upregulated after various insults, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, middle cerebral artery occlusion, excitotoxicity and traumatic brain injury. To better understand the effects of IL-10 in the normal and injured CNS, we generated transgenic mice (termed GFAP-IL-10Tg) that expressed the murine IL-10 gene under the transcriptional control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. Previous studies demonstrated marked changes in the microglial phenotype in these mice under basal conditions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of local astrocyte-targeted IL-10 production on glial activation, neuronal degeneration and leukocyte recruitment after axotomy. GFAP-IL-10Tg mice had marked changes in the phenotype of activated microglial cells, as well as in the number of microglial clusters and in microglial cell density. These microglial changes are accompanied by a twofold increase in lymphocyte infiltration in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice and around twofold decrease in neuronal cell death at 21 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggested that astrocyte-targeted production of IL-10 impacted the microglial response and lymphocyte recruitment and culminated in a beneficial effect on neuronal survival.
