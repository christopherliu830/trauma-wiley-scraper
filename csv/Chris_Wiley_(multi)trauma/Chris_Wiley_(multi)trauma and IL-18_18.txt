AB  - Abstract Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients have been reported to have more muscle tension than controls, which has provided a rationale for treating them with muscle relaxation therapies (MRT). We tested this rationale by comparing 49 GAD patients with 21 controls. Participants underwent 5-min relaxation tests, during which they either just sat quietly (QS) or sat quietly and tried to relax (R). GAD patients reported themselves to be more worried during the assessment than the controls, had higher heart rates and lower end-tidal pCO2, but not higher muscle tension as measured by multiple EMGs. QS and R did not differ on most psychological and physiological measures, indicating that intention to relax did not affect speed of relaxation. In the GAD group, self-reported anxiety was not associated with electromyographic or autonomic measures. We conclude that GAD is not necessarily characterized by chronic muscle tension, and that this rationale for MRT should be reconsidered.

AB  - Abstract Activation of the complement system generates the anaphylatoxic peptide C5a, which elicits a broad range of inflammatory activities. The biological activities of C5a are mediated through its binding to the widely expressed C5a receptor (C5aR), a G-protein-coupled seven transmembrane domain receptor. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, the C5aR is expressed on monocytes/macrophages, reactive astrocytes and T cells infiltrating the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate the role of the C5aR in this T cell-driven autoimmunemodel, we induced EAE in C5aR-deficient mice (C5aR?/?) and wild-type mice using a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide as the immunogen. We found that C5aR?/? mice were fully susceptible to MOG-induced EAE with no difference in disease onset or severity in C5aR?/? mice compared to control mice. Cellular infiltrates (macrophages and T cells) were similarin the spinal cords of both animal groups and splenic T cells from C5aR?/? mice and control mice responded identically to MOG in T cell proliferation assays. Ribonuclease protection assays demonstrated no significant differences in pro-inflammatory gene expression between receptor-deficient and sufficient mice. These results indicate that the C5aR is not an essential mediator in the induction and progression of EAE.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric patients undergoing small bowel transplantation are susceptible to postoperative CLABSI. SDD directed against enteric microbes is a strategy for reducing CLABSI. We hypothesized that SDD reduces the frequency of CLABSI, infections outside the bloodstream, and allograft rejection during the first 30 days following transplant. A retrospective chart review of 38 pediatric small bowel transplant recipients at CCHMC from 2003 to 2011 was conducted. SDD antimicrobials were oral colistin, tobramycin, and amphotericin B. The incidence of CLABSI, infections outside the bloodstream, and rejection episodes were compared between study periods. The incidence of CLABSI did not differ between study periods (6.9 CLABSI vs. 4.6 CLABSI per 1000 catheter days; p = 0.727), but gram positives and Candida predominated in the first 30 days. Incidence of bacterial infections outside the bloodstream did not differ (p = 0.227). Rejection occurred more frequently during the first month following transplant (p = 0.302). SDD does not alter the incidence of CLABSI, bacterial infections outside the bloodstream, or allograft rejection in the immediate 30 days post-transplantation. However, SDD does influence CLABSI organism types (favoring gram positives and Candida) and Candidal infections outside the bloodstream.

AB  - Abstract Receptors, located on both the cell surface and within the cell are the defined molecular targets through which drugs produce their beneficial effects in various disease states. Initially conceptualized over a century ago by Ehrlich and Langley, receptor concepts and receptor theory have undergone continuous modification as their behavior in normal and disease states/tissues have been more clearly characterized. Since the isolation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from the Torpedo , some 50 years ago, new techniques of molecular biology have made it relatively routine to isolate receptors, including orphan receptors. Once these have been validated, they can be used in conjunction with high- throughput screening approaches to identify ?hits,? molecules that bind with relatively high affinity to these targets. Such hits can then be optimized to druglike entities using combinatorial/parallel synthesis technology platforms to yield clinical candidates that are potent, efficacious, and bioavailable entities with appropriate safety profiles.
