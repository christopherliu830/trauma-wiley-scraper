AB  - Abstract Cytokines are proteins or glycoproteins which are produced by cells and act on other cells that display on their surface specific cytokine receptors. Cytokines are used by cells to communicate. Within a determined sequence, these mediators lead the responding cells to modify their function (e.g., secretion, proliferation, induction, inhibition, enhanced or reduced function, migration, apoptosis). Despite cytokines having mainly been discovered by immunologists as a product of cells of leukocyte lineage, they are now recognized as elements of a universal language used by most cells of any other lineage. Accordingly, they are essential for many events through life, such as reproductive tissue remodeling, embryogenesis, steady-state and adaptive hematopoiesis, surveillance and maintenance of tissue structure, functions of the immune system, inflammation, cell survival, and cell death. Cytokines also allow a dialog with the central nervous system, and some may modify different behaviors (e.g., fever, anorexia, sleep). Cytokines usually act within their vicinity, but they can also act via an endocrine fashion. Their production is tightly controlled within a complex network of positive and negative loops. They are a prerequisite for the control of infection by invasive microorganisms, though their exacerbated production may be deleterious at local or systemic levels. Their ?half-angel/half-devil? aspect has rendered cytokines difficult to use for therapeutic purposes, though some recombinant cytokines or cytokine-neutralizing strategies have been used successfully in different pathological conditions.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study tested the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer (PU) prevention bundle in reducing the incidence of PUs in critically ill patients in two Saudi intensive care units (ICUs). Design A two-arm cluster randomized experimental control trial. Methods Participants in the intervention group received the PU prevention bundle, while the control group received standard skin care as per the local ICU policies. Data collected included demographic variables (age, diagnosis, comorbidities, admission trajectory, length of stay) and clinical variables (Braden Scale score, severity of organ function score, mechanical ventilation, PU presence, and staging). All patients were followed every two days from admission through to discharge, death, or up to a maximum of 28 days. Data were analyzed with descriptive correlation statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Poisson regression. Findings The total number of participants recruited was 140: 70 control participants (with a total of 728 days of observation) and 70 intervention participants (784 days of observation). PU cumulative incidence was significantly lower in the intervention group (7.14%) compared to the control group (32.86%). Poisson regression revealed the likelihood of PU development was 70% lower in the intervention group. The intervention group had significantly less Stage I (p = .002) and Stage II PU development (p = .026). Conclusions Significant improvements were observed in PU-related outcomes with the implementation of the PU prevention bundle in the ICU; PU incidence, severity, and total number of PUs per patient were reduced. Clinical Relevance Utilizing a bundle approach and standardized nursing language through skin assessment and translation of the knowledge to practice has the potential to impact positively on the quality of care and patient outcome.

AB  - Background: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptaminei agonist (sumatriptan). Methods: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan: 0.01 mg·kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg·kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg·kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg·kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro. Results: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro. Conclusion: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.

AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.

AB  - Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic and poly-aetiological autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies to autologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) which serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers. The defective clearance of apoptotic material, together with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), provides abundant chromatin or self-dsDNA to trigger the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies, although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In SLE patients, the immune complex (IC) of dsDNA and its autoantibodies trigger the robust type I interferon (IFN-I) production through intracellular DNA sensors, which drives the adaptive immune system to break down self-tolerance. In this review, we will discuss the potential resources of self-dsDNA, the mechanisms of self-dsDNA-mediated inflammation through various DNA sensors and its functions in SLE pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol exposure is known to sensitize acinar cells to various insults but the pathophysiological mechanisms of alcoholic pancreatitis remain unknown. Alcohol abuse has been shown to mediate an anti-inflammatory response and periods of immune suppression seem to be associated with organ injury and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts transcriptional activities in the rat pancreas and how alcohol alters the inflammatory response. Using the Lieber?DeCarli alcohol/control diet, rats that were fed with alcohol over 14 weeks demonstrated a decrease of inflammatory cells in pancreatic tissue compared to controls. The anti-inflammatory effects of alcohol were confirmed by decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-1?, IL-18, TGF?, and MCP-1. In addition, alcohol significantly increased the activity of PPAR?, which is a known anti-inflammatory transcription factor, while pro-inflammatory factors including AP-2 and EGR-1 were significantly suppressed. NF?B binding showed a tendency towards a reduction. Electron microscopy studies revealed enlarged and injured mitochondria and lysosomes, accompanied by peri-cellular fibrosis. Furthermore, alcohol exposure increased the activities of trypsin and cathepsin B, both known to be critical in initiating acinar cell injury and pancreatitis. Despite the known alcohol-mediated acinar cell and mitochondrial injury, the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway was attenuated. These data demonstrate that the pancreas exposed to alcohol maintains an anti-inflammatory state by activating PPAR?. Intracellular mitochondrial and lysosomal damage after chronic alcohol exposure induces premature activation of digestive enzymes and establishment of peri-cellular fibrosis in the absence of inflammation.

AB  - Summary:? The gastrointestinal system is a common entry point for pathogenic microbes to access the inner environment of the body. Anti-microbial factors produced by the intestinal mucosa limit the translocation of both commensal and pathogenic microbes across the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. The regulation of these host defense mechanisms largely depends on the activation of innate immune receptors by microbial molecules. Under steady-state conditions, the microbiota provides constitutive signals to the innate immune system, which helps to maintain a healthy inflammatory tone within the intestinal mucosa and, thus, enhances resistance to infection with enteric pathogens. During an acute infection, the intestinal epithelial cell barrier is breached, and the detection of microbial molecules in the intestinal lamina propria rapidly stimulates innate immune signaling pathways that coordinate early defense mechanisms. Herein, we review how microbial molecules shed by both commensal and pathogenic microbes direct host defenses at the intestinal mucosa. We highlight the signaling pathways, effector molecules, and cell populations that are activated by microbial molecule recognition and, thereby, are involved in the maintenance of homeostatic levels of host defense and in the early response to acute enteric infection. Finally, we discuss how manipulation of these host defense pathways by stimulating innate immune receptors is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or alleviate intestinal disease.

AB  - In India, the case fatality ratio of the pandemic A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza was relatively higher when compared to seasonal Influenza A infection. Hypercytokinemia or ?cytokine storm? has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of other influenza viruses. The present study was undertaken to compare the cytokine profiles of A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza and seasonal H3 infection in Indian population and to correlate the findings with disease severity. Plasma levels of 18 cytokines/chemokines were measured by flow-cytometry using a bead based assay in patients infected with A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (n?=?96) and Influenza A seasonal H3 virus (n?=?30) categorised into mild, moderate, and severe groups along with healthy controls (n?=?36). There was an overall trend indicating an exuberant cytokine/chemokine response in A (H1N1) pdm09 as compared to seasonal H3 influenza, which was more evident in severe cases, suggesting a role for these cytokines/chemokines in the pathogenesis of A(H1N1) pdm09. Increased levels of CXCL-8/IL-8, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-17A were seen in both A(H1N1) pdm09 influenza and seasonal H3 cases when compared to healthy controls. However, dysregulated production of proinflammatory chemokines was seen more pronounced in A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza cases as compared to seasonal H3 cases. This study has brought forth the potential role of chemokines as prognostic indicators of disease severity and outcome. Further research on modulating the host immune response to limit severity of the disease could help in the treatment and management of influenza.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis results from a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response induced by allergens. Skin dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the initiation of allergic skin responses. Following encounter with an allergen, DCs become activated and undergo maturation and differentiate into immunostimulatory DCs and are able to present antigens effectively to T cells. The frequency of allergic skin disorders has increased in the past decades. Therefore, the identification of potential sensitizing chemicals is important for skin safety. Traditionally, predictive testing for allergenicity has been conducted in animal models. For regulatory reasons, animal use for sensitization testing of compounds for cosmetic purposes is shortly to be prohibited in Europe. Therefore, new non-animal-based test methods need to be developed. Several DC-based assays have been described to discriminate allergens from irritants. Unfortunately, current in vitro methods are not sufficiently resilient to identify allergens and therefore need refinement. Here, we review the immunobiology of skin DCs (Langerhans? cells and dermal dendritic cells) and their role in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and then explore the possible use of DC-based models for discriminating between allergens and irritants.

AB  - Summary The immune system is an intricate network of specialized tissues, which protect the host from insults and infection. It can be divided into two interactive systems, innate and adaptive immunity. Neuroinflammation occurs when there is chronic activation of the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS). Alterations in the permeability of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) may also occur during neuroinflammation due to changes in local vasculature, that is increased blood flow and vascular permeability. There are several anti-inflammatory systems that play a role in regulating microglia activation, which include CD200/CD200 receptor, vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Apoptosis is a highly orchestrated form of cell death when a number of caspases are activated in a sequential manner. The distinct morphological changes of the cell undergoing apoptosis are that the cell begins to shrink and pull away from other cells, and bubble-like formations appear at its surface.

AB  - Abstract Stimulator of interferons genes (STING) is an adaptor protein that plays a critical role in the secretion of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to cytosolic nucleic acid. Recent research indicates the involvement of the STING pathway in uncontrolled inflammation, sepsis, and shock. STING signaling is significantly up-regulated in human sepsis, and STING agonists are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis and shock. Nevertheless, little is known about the consequences of activated STING-mediated signaling during sepsis. It has been shown that aberrant activation of the STING-dependent way can result in increased inflammation, type I interferons responses, and cell death (including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis). In addition, autophagy modulation has been demonstrated to protect against multiple organs injuries in animal sepsis model. However, impaired autophagy may contribute to the aberrant activation of STING signaling, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and cell death. Here we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in the understanding of STING signaling, focusing on the regulatory mechanisms and the roles of this pathway in sepsis.

AB  - Summary The counter-regulatory mechanisms initiated to limit the overzealous inflammatory process in patients with infectious (sepsis) or non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) led to the concept of ?compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome? (CARS). One major consequence of CARS is the modification of the immune status that could favor the enhanced susceptibility of intensive care patients to nosocomial infections. The expression of surface markers can be modified, and numerous functions of circulating leukocytes are altered in sepsis and SIRS patients, as well as in animal models of sepsis or SIRS. However, this is rather a reprogramming of circulating leukocytes, since there is not a global defect of the immune cells functions.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Background Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a multifactorial disease with unclear etiopathogenesis in which disturbance of immunological processes may be involved. The aim of our study was to investigate three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3806265, rs4612666, rs10754558 in NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), the gene encoding the component of inflammasome, in patients with RAS and healthy controls in the Czech population. Methods A total of 207 subjects were included in this case-control study. Sixty-four patients with RAS and 143 healthy controls were genotyped by a method based on polymerase chain reaction using 5? nuclease TaqMan? assays. Detailed anamnestic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from all subjects. Results The allele and genotype frequencies of NLRP3 polymorphisms (rs10754558 and rs3806265) between both groups were similar. However, statistically significant differences in NLRP3 rs4612666 genotypes between the patients with RAS and controls were found; carriers of the TT genotype had a higher risk of developing RAS than subjects with the CT+CC genotypes (OR = 14.69, 95%CI = 1.73-124.72, P = .004, Pcorr < .05). No associations between NLRP3 haplotypes and RAS were observed. Conclusions Our study indicates that the NLRP3 rs4612666 polymorphism may be involved in the development of RAS in the Czech population.
