AB  - Our current mechanistic understanding on the effects of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) on cellular physiology is derived mainly from 2D cell culture studies. However, conventional monolayer cell culture may not accurately model the mass transfer gradient that is expected in 3D tissue physiology and thus may lead to artifactual experimental conclusions. Herein, using a micropatterned agarose hydrogel platform, the effects of ZnO NPs (25 nm) on 3D colon cell spheroids of well-defined sizes are examined. The findings show that cell dimensionality plays a critical role in governing the spatiotemporal cellular outcomes like inflammatory response and cytotoxicity in response to ZnO NPs treatment. More importantly, ZnO NPs can induce different modes of cell death in 2D and 3D cell culture systems. Interestingly, the outer few layers of cells in 3D model could only protect the inner core of cells for a limited time and periodically slough off from the spheroids surface. These findings suggest that toxicological conclusions made from 2D cell models might overestimate the toxicity of ZnO NPs. This 3D cell spheroid model can serve as a reproducible platform to better reflect the actual cell response to NPs and to study a more realistic mechanism of nanoparticle-induced toxicity.

AB  - Abstract Prion infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterised by a reactive gliosis and the subsequent degeneration of neuronal tissue. The activation of glial cells, which precedes neuronal death, is likely to be initially caused by the deposition of misfolded, proteinase K-resistant, isoforms (termed PrPres) of the prion protein (PrP) in the brain. Cytokines and chemokines released by PrPres-activated glia cells may contribute directly or indirectly to the disease development by enhancement and generalisation of the gliosis and via cytotoxicity for neurons. However, the actual role of prion-induced glia activation and subsequent cytokine/chemokine secretion in disease development is still far from clear. In the present work, we review our present knowledge concerning the functional biology of cytokines and chemokines in prion infections of the CNS.

AB  - Organ donors are sources of physiologically healthy organs and tissues for life-saving transplantation, and have been recently used for human immunology studies which are typically confined to the sampling of peripheral blood. Donors comprise a diverse population with different causes of death and clinical outcomes during hospitalization, and the effects of such variations on immune parameters in blood and tissues are not known. We present here a coordinate analysis of innate and adaptive immune components in blood, lymphoid (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes), and mucosal (lungs, intestines) sites from a population of brain-dead organ donors (2 months-93 years; n = 291) across eight clinical parameters. Overall, the blood of donors exhibited similar monocyte and lymphocyte content and low serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as healthy controls; however, donor blood had increased neutrophils and serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1 which varied with cause of death. In tissues, the frequency and composition of monocytes, neutrophils, B lymphocytes and T cell subsets in lymphoid or mucosal sites did not vary with clinical state, and was similar in donors independent of the extent of clinical complications. Our results reveal that organ donors maintain tissue homeostasis, and are a valuable resource for fundamental studies in human immunology.

AB  - Abstract In the epidermal compartment of skin, keratinocytes (KC), Langerhans cells (LC), and their soluble products, i.e. cytokines, constitute a unique immunologic microenvironment. KC participate in cutaneous immune responses by producing various cytokines. LC, a member of the dendritic cell (DC) family, represent the professional antigen-presenting cells in the epidermis. Although it has been demonstrated that migration of LC from skin to lymph nodes is a critical step for the antigen presentation, molecular mechanisms for such an event remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that cytokines are able to modulate LC/DC migration. There is accumulating evidence that proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor a promote LC emigration from the skin, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is a counter-regulator. LC/DC express chemokine receptors. Chemokines generated from lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph node cells play a role in the directional migration of LC/DC into lymph nodes. This article reviews current studies on the role of cytokines in LC/DC migration. J. Leukoc. Biol. 66: 33?39; 1999.

AB  - Summary While interleukin (IL)-1? plays an important role in combating the invading pathogen as part of the innate immune response, its dysregulation is responsible for a number of autoinflammatory disorders. Large IL-1? activating platforms, known as inflammasomes, can assemble in response to the detection of endogenous host and pathogen-associated danger molecules. Formation of these protein complexes results in the autocatalysis and activation of caspase-1, which processes precursor IL-1? into its secreted biologically active form. Inflammasome and IL-1? activity is required to efficiently control viral, bacterial and fungal pathogen infections. Conversely, excess IL-1? activity contributes to human disease, and its inhibition has proved therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of a spectrum of serious, yet relatively rare, heritable inflammasomopathies. Recently, inflammasome function has been implicated in more common human conditions, such as gout, type II diabetes and cancer. This raises the possibility that anti-IL-1 therapeutics may have broader applications than anticipated previously, and may be utilized across diverse disease states that are linked insidiously through unwanted or heightened inflammasome activity.

AB  - Summary It is still controversial which cell types are responsible for synovial inflammation in osteoarthritic (OA) joints. The aim of this study was to quantify the mononuclear cell populations and their cytokines in patients with different knee OA subtypes. Synovial membrane (SM), synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) were harvested from patients with unicompartmental (UC) and bicompartmental (BC) knee OA. Frequencies of mononuclear cells were assessed by flow cytometry in PB and SM. Naive SF samples were analysed for a broad variety of cytokines by multiplex analysis. SM of both groups displayed a distinct mononuclear cell infiltration, with CD14+ macrophages being the major cell population, followed by CD4+ T cells and only small numbers of CD8+ T, CD19+ B and CD16+CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells. Between the two groups, SM of BC OA showed significantly higher amounts of mononuclear cells (135·7?±?180 versus 805?±?675 cells/mg, P?=?0·0009) and higher CD4+ T cell presence (3·4?±?4·6 versus 9·1?±?7·5%, P?=?0·0267). SF of BC OA displayed significantly higher concentrations for a number of proinflammatory cytokines [CXCL1, eotaxin, interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12]. UC and BC OA show significant differences in their synovial inflammatory pattern. Whereas in UC OA CD14+ macrophages are the predominant cell population, BC OA has a higher inflammatory profile and seems to be driven by CD14+ macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Inclusion of clinical information into the analysis of cellular and molecular results is pivotal in understanding the pathophysiology of OA.

AB  - Abstract? Despite the best efforts of influenza scientists, companies and health officials to prepare for the next pandemic, most of the world?s people will not have access to affordable supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents. They will have to rely on 19th century public health ?technologies? to see them through. In the 21st century, science ought to be able to provide something better. Influenza scientists study the molecular characteristics of influenza viruses and their signaling effects in cell culture and animal models of infection. While these studies have been enormously informative, they have been unable to explain the system-wide effects of influenza on the host, the increased mortality of younger adults in the 1918 influenza pandemic and the much lower mortality rates in children who were more commonly infected with the 1918 virus. Experiments by non-influenza scientists have defined common cell signaling pathways for acute lung injury caused by different agents, including inactivated H5N1 influenza virus. These pathways include several molecular targets that are up-regulated in acute lung injury and down-regulated by anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents, including statins, fibrates, and glitazones. These agents also help reverse the mitochondrial dysfunction that accompanies multi-organ failure, something often seen in fatal Influenza. Observational studies suggest that statins are beneficial in treating patients with pneumonia (there are no such studies for fibrates and glitazones). Other studies suggest that these agents might be able to ?roll back? the self-damaging host response of young adults to the less damaging response of children and thus save lives. Research is urgently needed to determine whether these and other agents that modify the host response might be useful in managing H5N1 influenza and the next pandemic.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - Summary Linear ubiquitination is a post-translational protein modification recently discovered to be crucial for innate and adaptive immune signaling. The function of linear ubiquitin chains is regulated at multiple levels: generation, recognition, and removal. These chains are generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), the only known ubiquitin E3 capable of forming the linear ubiquitin linkage de novo. LUBAC is not only relevant for activation of nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in various signaling pathways, but importantly, it also regulates cell death downstream of immune receptors capable of inducing this response. Recognition of the linear ubiquitin linkage is specifically mediated by certain ubiquitin receptors, which is crucial for translation into the intended signaling outputs. LUBAC deficiency results in attenuated gene activation and increased cell death, causing pathologic conditions in both, mice, and humans. Removal of ubiquitin chains is mediated by deubiquitinases (DUBs). Two of them, OTULIN and CYLD, are constitutively associated with LUBAC. Here, we review the current knowledge on linear ubiquitination in immune signaling pathways and the biochemical mechanisms as to how linear polyubiquitin exerts its functions distinctly from those of other ubiquitin linkage types.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Abstract Plants have emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional mammalian cell cultures or microbial cell-based systems system for the production of valuable recombinant proteins. Through recombinant DNA technology, plants can be engineered to produce large quantities of pharmaceuticals and industrial proteins of high quality at low costs. The recombinant production, by transgenic plants, of therapeutic proteins normally present in human plasma, such as cytokines, coagulation factors, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulins, represents a response to the ongoing challenges in meeting the demand for therapeutic proteins to treat serious inherited or acquired bleeding and immunological diseases. As the clinical utilization of fractionated plasma molecules is limited by high production costs, using recombinant biopharmaceuticals derived from plants represents a feasible alternative to provide efficient treatment. Plant-derived pharmaceuticals also reduce the potential risks to patients of infection with pathogens or unwanted immune responses due to immunogenic antigens. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in molecular farming of cytokines. We also examine the technological basis, upcoming challenges, and perspectives for the biosynthesis and detection of these molecules in different plant production platforms.

AB  - Abstract:? Although less than 1% of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) develop the catastrophic variant, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine today. However, the rarity of this variant makes it extraordinarily difficult to study in any systematic way. In order to put together all the published case reports as well as the new diagnosed cases from all over the world, an international registry of patients with catastrophic APS (?CAPS Registry?) was created in 2000 by the European Forum on Antiphospholipid Antibodies. Currently, it documents the entire clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data of more than 300 patients whose data have been fully registered. This registry can be freely consulted at the Internet (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) and it is expected that the periodical analysis of these data will allow us to increase our knowledge of this condition.

AB  - Oestrogens are powerful endogenous and exogenous neuroprotective hormones in animal models of brain injury, including focal cerebral ischaemia. This protective effect has been demonstrated under a variety of different treatments and injury paradigms, such as in vivo and in vitro stroke conditions. Neuroprotection in the central nervous system by progesterone is less defined. In the present study, cultured cortical and midbrain mouse neurones and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were exposed to combined glucose-serum deprivation (CGSD), which is regarded as a reliable model mimicking the effects of ischaemia in vitro. Cell viability was assayed using lactate dehydrogenase release and metabolic activity. Conditions for CGSD treatment were chosen to yield half-maximal cell death rates. The validity of CGSD in vitro was compared with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo. CGSD for 4?h induced half-maximal neuronal cell death. MCAO in vivo for the same period resulted in significant neuronal loss, also suggesting the validity of CGSD as a suitable stroke-like in vitro model. Combined steroid treatment (17?-oestradiol and progesterone) but not the application of single steroids abolished CGSD-induced cell death of cortical neurones in vitro. By contrast, no cell protection was found in midbrain neurones or neuroblastoma cells. The co-application of oestrogen (ICI 182,780) or progesterone (RU-486) receptor antagonists did not obviously counteract the protective steroid effects. This suggests the operation of nonclassical steroid mechanisms and their implication in mediation of hormonal effects. The surplus of combined protective hormonal effects might be a result of the observed influence of progesterone application on neuronal oestradiol synthesis. The data obtained in the present study clearly highlight the potential of a combined steroid treatment under toxic degenerative brain pathologies.
