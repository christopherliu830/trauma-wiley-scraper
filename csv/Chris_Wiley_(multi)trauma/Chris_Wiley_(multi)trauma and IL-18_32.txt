AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

Hepatic IL-8 release during graft procurement is associated with impaired graft function after human liver transplantation.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 29?35. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? In experimental models, brain death induces inflammatory cascades, leading to reduced graft survival. Thus far, factors prior to graft preservation have gained less attention in clinical setting. We studied pre-preservation inflammatory response and its effects on graft function in 30 brain dead liver donors and the respective recipients. Before donor graft perfusion, portal and hepatic venous blood samples were drawn for phagocyte adhesion molecule expression and plasma cytokine determinations. Donor intensive care unit stay correlated with donor C-reactive protein (R?=?0.472, p?=?0.013) and IL-6 (R?=?0.419, p?=?0.026) levels, and donor (R?=?0.478, p?=?0.016) and recipient gamma-glutamyl transferase (R?=?0.432, p?=?0.019) levels. During graft procurement, hepatic IL-8 release was observed in 17/30 donors. Grafts with hepatic IL-8 release exhibited subsequently higher alkaline phosphatase [319 (213?405) IU/L vs. 175 (149?208) IU/L, p?=?0.006] and bilirubin [101 (44?139) ?mol/L vs. 30 (23?72) ?mol/L, p?=?0.029] levels after transplantation. Our findings support the concept that inflammatory response in the brain dead organ donor contributes to the development of graft injury in human liver transplantation.

AB  - Abstract The term ?catastrophic? antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is defined as an accelerated form of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) usually resulting in multiorgan failure. These patients have in common: (i) clinical evidence of multiple organ involvement developing in a very short time period; (ii) histopathological evidence of multiple small vessel occlusions (a minority also have large vessel thrombosis); and (iii) laboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), usually in high titres. Although less than 1% of patients with the APS develop this complication, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine.

AB  - Background and Objectives? The empiric use of a high plasma to packed red-blood-cell [fresh frozen plasma:red-blood-cells (FFP:RBC)] ratio in trauma resuscitation for patients with massive bleeding has become well accepted without clear or objective indications. Increased plasma transfusion is associated with worse outcome in some patient populations. While previous studies analyse only patients who received a massive transfusion, this study analyses those that are at risk to receive a massive transfusion, based on the trauma-associated severe haemorrhage (TASH) score, to objectively determine which patients after severe trauma would benefit or have increased complications by the use of a high FFP:RBC ratio. Methods? Multicentre retrospective study from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society. Multivariate logistic regression and statistical risk adjustments utilized in analyses. Results? A high ratio of FFP:RBC in the ≥15 TASH group was independently associated with survival, with an odds ratio of 2·5 (1·6?4·0), while the <15 TASH group was associated with increased multi-organ failure, 47% vs. 38%, (P?<?0·005). Conclusions? A predictive model of massive transfusion upon admission might be able to rapidly identify which severe trauma patients would benefit or have increased complications from the immediate application of a high ratio of FFP:RBCs. This study helps to identify the appropriate population for a prospective, interventional trial.

AB  - Background: Dietary supplementation of L-arginine as a mechanism to enhance cellular immune response (T lymphocytes), has slowly gained approval, and appears especially important during critical illness. Despite its clinical use, little is known as to the direct effects of L-arginine on the different T lymphocyte subpopulations. Methods: Lymphocytes were harvested from spleens of C57 Bl/6 mice, and proliferation was induced with anti-CD3 in the presence of different concentrations of L-arginine ranging from 0 to 1000 ?mol/L. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the effect of L-arginine on T lymphocyte subpopulations. Interleukin-2 production was measured by ELISA and gene expression by RT-PCR. Results: L-Arginine at or greater than 100 ?mol/L significantly enhanced anti-CD3 stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation (p =.01). L-Arginine was essential for adequate T lymphocyte (CD3+) cellular maturation (p =.01). Proliferation of Helper T cells (CD4+) was not dependent on L-arginine. In contrast, Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) showed a dose dependent proliferation in response to L-arginine (p =.01). Of the CD8+ cells, an increase in the CD45RA negative CD8 positive (memory) T cell subpopulation was observed with the addition of L-arginine. In addition, the number of cell surface CD8 receptors (CD8R) and CD3 receptors (CD3R) increased in the presence of L-arginine (p =.01, p =.04). Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was not up-regulated by L-arginine. L-Arginine modestly increased IL-2 production and had pronounced effects on its disappearance from the culture media (p <.0001). Interleukin-2 mRNA expression was not dependent on L-arginine. Conclusions: The requirements for L-arginine for the proliferation of CD3 stimulated T lymphocytes vary widely, and have to be taken into account when studying the mechanism of how L-arginine enhances cellular proliferation. L-Arginine may increase cellular proliferation by increasing specific receptor expression and the utilization of interleukin-2. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 25:23?29, 2001)

AB  - Abstract Individuals with spinal cord injury are at risk of sacral pressure ulcers due to, among other reasons, prolonged immobilisation. The effectiveness of a multi-layer foam dressing installed pre-operatively in reducing sacral pressure ulcer occurrence in spinal cord injured patients was compared to that of using a gel mattress, and stratified analyses were performed on patients with complete tetraplegia and paraplegia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from 315 patients admitted in a level-I trauma centre following a spinal cord injury between April 2010 and March 2016. Upon arrival to the emergency room and until surgery, patients were transferred on a foam stretcher pad with a viscoelastic polymer gel mattress (before 1 October 2014) or received a multi-layer foam dressing applied to their sacral-coccygeal area (after 1 October 2014). The occurrence of sacral pressure ulcer during acute hospitalisation was similar irrespective of whether patients received the dressing or the gel mattress. It was found that 82% of patients with complete tetraplegia receiving the preventive dressing developed sacral ulcers as compared to only 36% of patients using the gel mattress. Although multi-layer dressings were suggested to improve skin protection and decrease pressure ulcer occurrence in critically ill patients, such preventive dressings are not superior to gel mattresses in spinal cord injured patients and should be used with precaution, especially in complete tetraplegia.

AB  - Abstract There is growing recognition that traumatic brain injury is a highly variable and complex systemic disorder that is refractory to therapies that target individual mechanisms. It is even more complex in elderly persons, in whom frailty, previous comorbidities, altered metabolism, and a long history of medication use are likely to complicate the secondary effects of brain trauma. Progesterone, one of the few neuroprotective agents that has shown promise for the treatment of acute brain injury, is now in national and international phase 3 multicenter trials. New findings show that vitamin D hormone (VDH) and VDH deficiency in the aging process (and across the developmental spectrum) may interact with progesterone and treatment for traumatic brain injury. In this article we review the use of progesterone and VDH as biologics-based therapies along with recent studies demonstrating that the combination of progesterone and VDH may promote better functional outcomes than either treatment independently.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Abstract The study was designed to investigate whether complement is activated in patients subject to rectal surgery and whether the choice of surgical technique (open or laparoscopic) has any impact on the activation of complement. Our hypothesis is that laparoscopic surgery leads to a lower-level activation of complement than open surgery. Patients (n?=?24) subject to rectal surgery owing to rectal cancer were included. The study was prospective and randomized. The patients were randomized to either laparoscopic surgery (n?=?12) or open surgery (n?=?12). Blood samples for determination of complement activation (C4d, Bb, C3bc and the terminal C5b-9 complex TCC) were drawn before start of surgery (T0) and at the following time-points after start of surgery: 180?min (T1), 360?min (T2), 24?h (T3) and 3?5?days (T4). A significant increase in the alternative pathway activation product Bb and in the terminal pathway activation product TCC was seen over time in both groups (P?<?0.001). Bb peaked early (T1) and returned to baseline levels post-operatively, whereas TCC increased steadily with maximum values in the late post-operative period. The plasma concentrations of C4d and C3bc decreased significantly in both groups at T1 and T2 and returned to baseline levels at T4. There was no significant difference between the groups. Rectal surgery causes activation of the complement system. Complement is activated through the alternative pathway. Results mostly showed no significant differences between laparoscopic and open rectal surgery apart from lower levels of factor Bb in the former group in the perioperative period.

A fluctuating swelling developed ventral to the right eye, causing bulging of the lower eyelid, and a corresponding swelling was present in the caudal vestibule of the oral cavity. Cytological examination of the fluid obtained from asplratlon of the swelling was consistent with the appearance of saliva. A tentative dlagnosls of zygomatlc salivary mucocele was made. Surgical exploration and resectlon of the swelling demonstrated the presence of a multliobular cystic zygomatlc salivary gland. The histopathological appearance of the resected tissue was Interpreted as an Inflammatory reaction to mucus derived from a muitllocular salivary cyst.

AB  - Abstract Fracture healing is a well-organized process between several molecules and mediators. As known from other diseases, genetic polymorphisms may exhibit different expression patterns in these mediators. Concerning fracture healing, this may lead to an extended healing process or non-union. We investigated the incidence of polymorphisms in patients with aseptic non-unions after femoral and tibial shaft fractures as compared to patients with uneventful healing. Exclusion criteria were smoking, diabetes, bilateral fractures, systemic corticoid therapy, and septic non-unions. Analysis of allele frequencies and genotype distribution of various mediators were carried out following PCR. Clinical parameters such as injury severity and in-hospital were analyzed. Fifty patients following non-union (group NU) were enrolled, the control group consisted of 44 patients (group H). A significant association of a PDGF haplotype and non-unions following fracture could be observed. There was a significantly increased in-hospital time and amount of surgical procedures in group NU. Polymorphisms within the PDGF gene seem to be a genetic risk factor for the development of non-unions of the lower extremity following fracture. The early identification of high risk patients could result in an adapted therapeutical strategy and might contribute to a significant decrease of posttraumatic non-unions. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective To review the clinical features, treatments, complications, and outcomes of horses with traumatic orbital fractures. Study design Retrospective study. Sample Population Eighteen horses with confirmed orbital fractures. Procedures Medical records of horses presenting with orbital fractures between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Signalment, etiology of fracture, clinical signs, fracture descriptions, diagnostic imaging, treatments, complications, and outcomes were evaluated. Results Eighteen horses presented with orbital fractures resulting from rearing in a confined space (n = 5), being kicked (4), colliding with a stationary object (3), and unknown trauma (6). Radiography and computed tomography were effective at classifying fractures and evaluating sinus/nasal involvement. Epistaxis/sinusitis were associated with fractures of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (n = 3) and comminuted fractures of multiple bones (5). Seventeen fractures required treatment, with fifteen receiving a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Surgery included reduction of large bony fragments (n = 8), removal of small fragments (12), stabilization with a wire implant (1), and sinus trephination and lavage (5). Factors contributing to a favorable outcome included: globe retention (n = 16), vision (14), comfort (15), cosmesis (9), and return to previous function (13). Conclusions Horses sustaining orbital fractures treated promptly with medical and surgical therapy have a favorable prognosis for return to function and cosmesis. Fractures affecting the zygomatic process of the frontal bone are unlikely to involve the sinus/nasal cavities. Epistaxis and sinusitis warrant more aggressive therapy and decrease functional and cosmetic outcome.

AB  - In adults, acute lung injury or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may complicate a wide range of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which involve direct pulmonary insult. The characteristic histological feature of ARDS is an intense inflammatory process in the lungs, which may progress to fibrosis. The earliest physiological characteristic is an increase in the protein permeability across the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lungs. This clinical syndrome is characterized by arterial hypoxaemia and bilateral radiographic infiltrates, which represent protein-rich oedema fluid. In addition there is a neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrate. ?Pulmonary endothelium is actively involved in the development of ARDS. It alters cell?cell adhesion as the initial step in leucocyte migration which, in turn, changes the permeability that allows protein-rich fluid to move into the interstitium. The quantity of this interstitial oedema may be sufficient to cause bulk flow through the epithelial barrier. There is probably independent epithelial injury. Finally, the endothelium can release and metabolize vasoactive and inflammatory substances, such as endothelins, nitric oxide and cytokines, etc. No single substance is responsible for acute lung injury, but rather a complex interplay exists between diverse pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.
