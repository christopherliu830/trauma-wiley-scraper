AB  - Objective To review the clinical features, treatments, complications, and outcomes of horses with traumatic orbital fractures. Study design Retrospective study. Sample Population Eighteen horses with confirmed orbital fractures. Procedures Medical records of horses presenting with orbital fractures between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Signalment, etiology of fracture, clinical signs, fracture descriptions, diagnostic imaging, treatments, complications, and outcomes were evaluated. Results Eighteen horses presented with orbital fractures resulting from rearing in a confined space (n = 5), being kicked (4), colliding with a stationary object (3), and unknown trauma (6). Radiography and computed tomography were effective at classifying fractures and evaluating sinus/nasal involvement. Epistaxis/sinusitis were associated with fractures of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (n = 3) and comminuted fractures of multiple bones (5). Seventeen fractures required treatment, with fifteen receiving a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Surgery included reduction of large bony fragments (n = 8), removal of small fragments (12), stabilization with a wire implant (1), and sinus trephination and lavage (5). Factors contributing to a favorable outcome included: globe retention (n = 16), vision (14), comfort (15), cosmesis (9), and return to previous function (13). Conclusions Horses sustaining orbital fractures treated promptly with medical and surgical therapy have a favorable prognosis for return to function and cosmesis. Fractures affecting the zygomatic process of the frontal bone are unlikely to involve the sinus/nasal cavities. Epistaxis and sinusitis warrant more aggressive therapy and decrease functional and cosmetic outcome.

AB  - Background Death after injury with low energy has gained increasing focus lately, and seems to constitute a significant amount of trauma-related death. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of deaths from low-energy trauma in a rural Norwegian cohort. Methods All deaths from external causes in Finnmark County, Norway, from 1995 to 2004 were identified retrospectively through the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Deaths caused by hanging, drowning, suffocation, poisoning, and electrocution were excluded. Trauma was categorised as high energy or low energy based on mechanism of injury. All low-energy trauma deaths were then reviewed. Results There were 262 cases of trauma death during the period. Low-energy trauma counted for 43% of the trauma deaths, with an annual crude death rate of 13 per 100,000 inhabitants. Low falls accounted for 99% of the injuries. Fractures were sustained in 89% of cases and head injuries in 11%. Ninety per cent of patients had pre-existing medical conditions, and the median age was 82 years. Death was caused by a medical condition in 85% of cases. Fifty-two per cent of the patients died after discharge from the hospital. Conclusion In this cohort, low-energy trauma was a significant contributor to trauma related death, especially among elderly and patients with pre-existing medical conditions.

AB  - Aim Hip fracture as a result of bone fragility is characterized by poor health outcomes in the medium and long term. Our goal was to compare a new orthogeriatric model with the old trauma model and evaluate improvements in clinical management. Methods We carried out a comparative unicentric study, a historical sample (trauma model) collected from 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2010, versus a prospective sample (orthogeriatric model) collected from 1 June 2010 until 31 May 2013. We included all patients aged >69 years with hip fracture as a result of bone fragility. Results A total of 792 patients were evaluated (mean age 84.3 years). The surgical waiting period went from 2.70 days in the trauma model to 1.86 days in the orthogeriatric model (P < 0.001); the average stay was 15.76 days in the trauma model, and for the orthogeriatric model was reduced to 5.90 days (P < 0.001); mortality went from 4.5% to 1.3% (P ≤ 0.010); 1 month readmission for hip dislocation was reduced from 2.3% to 0.5% (P = 0.032). After a 6-month follow up, we had 302 trauma model patients and 287 orthogeriatric model patients. After 1 year, we had 288 patients in the trauma model and 264 patients in the orthogeriatric model. The main cause of abandonment was death, 108 patients (27.3%) in the trauma model and 100 patients (27.5%) in the orthogeriatric model (P = 0.951). Conclusions When we compared the two models, we found statistically significant better results in the preoperative waiting period, average stay, hospital mortality and 1 month readmission as a result of hip prosthesis luxation in favor of the orthogeriatric model.

AB  - Abstract OBJECTIVES: Pediatric in-hospital arrests are uncommon but are associated with poor outcomes. In preparation for implenting a Rapid Response Team (RRT) at The Children's Hospital, we reviewed our data collection of 13 years of emergency response team (ERT) activations. We describe demographic and clinical variables, including outcomes of ERT activations at a free-standing tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: Analysis was performed on data collected from January 1993 through July 2007. Variables collected included age, sex, admission diagnosis, core event, admission diagnosis and secondary diagnosis, medical division or winter/nonwinter months, day/night shifts, survival of core event, survival to discharge, and primary attending service. RESULTS: There were 1537 ERT activations in the database, 203 were eliminated due to missing data or were adult visitors/employees. The remaining 1334 were included for analysis. Our results showed 39%(511) of all ERT activations occurred in patients under 1 year of age. The most common admission diagnosis category was cardiac disease. There was no statistical significance between summer and winter months although more activations occurred during daytime hours (P < .001). Survival rate of an ERT was 90%, with a 78% survival rate to discharge. CONCLUSION: Our data support the general belief that younger children with chronic disease are at highest risk for ERT activations. These risk factors should be taken into consideration when planning patient placement, medical staffing, and the threshold for ICU consultations or admissions. More extensive multisite studies using clinical data are necessary to further identify hospitalized children at risk for sudden decompensation.

AB  - Summary Multi-lumen extensions used to infuse multiple fluids via a single intravenous cannula might increase resistance and so limit the flow that can be achieved. We constructed low-pressure and high-pressure models and compared the effect of two different multi-lumen extensions on flow rate. Both multi-lumen extensions reduced flows by up to 76% (p < 0.001). The effect was greatest with large cannulae and in the high-pressure model, with the longer and narrower extension most impeding flow. Multi-lumen extensions can therefore significantly impede fluid flow, and should be avoided or removed when rapid infusion is required. These effects are less important in paediatric anaesthesia where smaller cannulae are used. Manufacturers should include internal diameter or flow effects on the packaging of these extensions to assist clinicians in making such decisions.

AB  - Abstract??? Objectives: When coronal fracture occurs in anterior teeth, fragment reattachment can be a valid alternative to a direct restoration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the material and the technique used to reattach the fragment. Materials and methods: Eighty sound maxillary and mandibular incisors were selected and randomly divided into eight groups (n?=?10). The incisal third of each tooth was removed using a saw machine. The fragments in groups 1?4 were reattached using resin-based materials: group 1 adhesive, group 2 flow, group 3 composite, group 4 cement; in groups 5?8, the same materials mentioned before were used but a bevel was also performed on both labial and lingual surfaces. Shear bond strength (SBS) was calculated by applying a load incisal to the reattachment line. A two-way Anova was used to evaluate the influence of materials and techniques on the SBS. Results: The technique used was statistically significant (P?<?0.001), while the material was not (P?=?0.793). Conclusions: The choice of material seems to have no influence on the SBS, whereas a bevel performed on the labial and lingual surfaces can significantly improve the SBS of the reattached fragment.

AB  - Changes in the differential blood cell count, monocyte phenotype and the cytokine plasma levels in a group of seven patients with cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and nine patients with thoracic surgery/without CPB, both receiving identical opioid-based anaesthetic technique, were assessed. A significant reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes was observed after anaesthesia and surgery. Interestingly, at the end of surgery as well as 1 day post-surgery a marked increase in the number of granulocytes was noted. General anaesthesia and surgery caused a significant reduction of HLA-DR and CD11c/CD18 molecules, starting immediately after induction of anaesthesia, and an increase of CD64 at day 1 after anaesthesia. The use of a CPB was followed by a significant reduction of CD32, CD16, CD54 and HLA-ABC antigens expression at the end of surgery. One day after surgery these parameters returned nearly to baseline values with the exception of CD54. A monocyte subpopulation, characterized by low CD14, high CD16 and HLA-DR expression (CD14+CD16+HLA-DR++) was found in both groups at each time point, and the percentage of this cell subset decreased from baseline to 24?h. The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 increased considerably during CPB. No dynamic changes of IL-1 level due to surgery or CPB were found. We conclude that anaesthesia as well as the use of CPB induced profound alterations in the number of circulating leucocytes, and in the phenotype of monocyte and cytokine production.

AB  - Abstract? It was examined whether bulimia and dissociation are common in male self-cutters, as has been found in female self-cutters. The subjects were 796 male inmates of a juvenile prison. A self-reporting questionnaire was used to assess self-cutting, histories of psychoactive substance use, problem behaviors, and traumatic life events in the subjects. The Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale and the Bulimia Investigatory Test of Edinburgh were also used. Subjects were divided into two groups: self-cutting and non-cutting. Questionnaire responses and dissociation and bulimia assessments were compared between the groups. Self-cutters began smoking (P?<?0.001) and drinking (P?<?0.001) earlier, and more frequently used illicit psychoactive drugs (P?<?0.001), experienced childhood physical abuse (P?<?0.001), and reported suicide attempts (P?<?0.001), suicidal ideation (P?<?0.001), and outward violence toward a person (P?<?0.001) or object (P?<?0.001) than non-cutters. Self-cutters also scored significantly higher on the bulimia (P?<?0.001) and dissociation tests (P?<?0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that suicide attempt (odds ratio, 4.311) and suicidal ideation (odds ratio, 2.336) could discriminate between male inmates with and without self-cutting. Male self-cutters showed ?multi-impulsive bulimic? tendencies resembling those of female self-cutters, although to a lesser extent. Clinical features of male as opposed to female self-cutters were influenced by gender differences.

AB  - Abstract Severe traumatic injuries and infections are frequently accompanied by life-threatening shock and are associated with increases in the proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The body's first perception of injury is the nociceptive or pain response. This response is induced at the site of injury and is transmitted systemically by sensory neuropeptides, the tachykinins, released from sensory afferent c-fiber neurons. We studied the role of tachykinins in regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Destruction of terminal sensory nerve endings before lipopolysaccharide administration abrogates tachykinin synthesis and down-regulates TNF-α transcription and secretion. In contrast, the responses of interleukins-1 and -6 are unaffected. Pretreating animals with an antagonist for the substance P-specific NK-1 receptor also down-regulated the TNF-α response, whereas blockade of the NK-2 receptor had no effect. These findings indicate that substance P contributes to the induction of those cytokines that are involved in precipitating the shock response. J. Leukoc. Biol. 63: 602?605; 1998.

AB  - Background and Objectives Pregnant women face considerable barriers to smoking cessation. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and response to smoking cessation treatment in pregnant smokers participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nicotine gum. Methods Participants were 194 low-income, ethnically diverse pregnant smokers. Results Utilizing a structured interview, 45% and 18% of the subjects met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of MDD and PTSD, respectively. There was no difference in response to treatment, based on the presence of either of these psychiatric disorders. Conclusions Cumulatively, these findings provide evidence of the high degree of unmet mental health needs in pregnant smokers. Scientific Significance Pregnant women with a history of MDD and PTSD appear to be as likely to benefit from smoking cessation treatment as those without such a history. (Am J Addict 2013;22:54-59)
