AB  - ABSTRACT As the number of candidates listed for heart transplant continues to rise, it is encouraging that the number of heart transplants also continues to rise steadily each year. Evaluation of waitlist activity demonstrates a growing number of adult candidates removed from the list due to undergoing transplant, but also growing numbers of adult candidates added to the list over the past 3 years. In 2014, 2679 heart transplants were performed, an increase of 28.4% since 2003, and the number of people living with a transplanted heart continued to increase. The number of new pediatric candidates added to the heart transplant waiting list increased to 593 in 2014. The number of pediatric heart transplants performed each year increased from 293 in 2003 to 410 in 2014. Almost 60% of pediatric candidates waiting on December 31, 2014, had been waiting for less than 1 year, compared with 43.0% in 2004. Among pediatric patients who underwent transplant in 2008-2012, overall cumulative incidence of death at 1, 3, and 5 years was 9.2%, 14.7%, and 18.3%, respectively.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives: Low count of total and T helper lymphocytes predicts a poor prognosis in cancer patients and surgical trauma can worsen cancer-related immunodeficiency. Aim of this phase IB study is to verify toxicity and biological effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) at 9 million IU/day subcutaneously (sc.) administered one, two or three preoperative days in patients with gastric cancer undergoing radical surgery. Methods: Absolute value of total and T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes were measured at baseline and at 7th, 14th, and 50th postoperative days in 12 gastric cancer patients, who preoperatively received IL-2 at 9 million IU/day sc. as follows: group A (4 pts) 1-day; group B (4 pts) 2-days; group C (4 pts) 3-days administration. T and total lymphocytes count were recorded and retrospectively analyzed in a historical control-group of 22 consecutive patients, age and stage-matched. Results: Toxicity consisted of fever grade I. In group A (1 day) T helper lymphocytes count decreased at 7th and at 14th postoperative day; in group B (2 days) and group C (3 days) no decrease of neither total nor T helper lymphocyte count occurred postoperatively, whereas in the historical group these parameters decreased significantly postoperatively and recovered only at 50th day. Conclusions: Two- and three-day schedules of sc. IL-2 preoperative administration at 9 million IU/daily prevented postoperative lymphocytopenia, whereas one-day administration did not. Since the IL-2 dose was so tolerable, that it could be given safely as outpatient, based on the previous results on survival observed in colorectal cancer patients with 3-days schedule we suggest that a 3-day schedule of Interleukin-2 as outpatient preoperative treatment seems advisable for further studies in gastric cancer patients.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate whether major abdominal surgery leads to complement activation and interleukin response and whether the kind of anaesthesia influence complement activation and the release of inflammatory interleukins. The study design was prospective and randomised. Fifty patients undergoing open major colorectal surgery due to cancer disease or inflammatory bowel disease were studied. Twenty-five patients were given total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil, and 25 patients were given inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl. To determine complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9) and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins (tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-8, IL-4 and IL-10), blood samples were drawn preoperatively, 60 minutes after start of surgery, 30 minutes after end of surgery and 24 hours postoperatively. Complement was activated and pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-10) were released during major colorectal surgery. There was no significant difference between TIVA and inhalational anaesthesia regarding complement activation and cytokine release. Major colorectal surgery leads to activation of the complement cascade and the release of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There are no significant differences between total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil and inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl regarding complement activation and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins.

AB  - Abstract The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), contributes to neuronal inflammation and cell death induced by ischemia, excitotoxicity, or trauma, while administration of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) reduces neuronal injury. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that endogenous IL-1ra is neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro, and to identify its mechanism of actions. Mice lacking IL-1ra (IL-1ra knock-out (KO]) exhibited a dramatic increase in neuronal injury (3.6-fold increase in infarct size) induced by transient cerebral ischemia compared to wild-type (WT) animals. Basal cell death of cultured cortical neurons from WT and IL-1ra KO was identical, and treatment with NMDA or AMPA (20 ?M) increased cell death to the same extent in WT and IL-1ra KO neurons. However, basal and NMDA- or AMPA-induced cells death was significantly higher in glial?neuronal co-cultures from IL-1ra KO than from WT mice. We further showed that pure microglial cultures, but not pure astrocytes cultures, released IL-1ra in response to treatment with conditioned medium from NMDA- or AMPA-treated primary neurons. These results demonstrate that endogenous IL-1ra produced by microglia is neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia or excitotoxicity. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This single-blind, 8-week study compared the efficacy of a sonic toothbrush and a manual brush in 40 patients with adult periodontitis. Qualitative clinical indices and quantitative laboratory methods were used to monitor the periodontal status of 3 pockets 5 to 7 mm deep in each subject. Patients were randomly assigned either a sonic or manual toothbrush. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, and anatomical location of the test sites. Data were collected from all sites at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Over the 8-week period, both groups showed significant improvements in the clinical indices used. Descriptive statistics indicated the sonic brush group had greater improvement than the manual group in the clinical parameters (gingival index, bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) flow was significantly lower in the sonic brush group (P = 0.018). Considerable variation was present in the levels detected for both inflammatory cytokines tested, however, concentration of interleukin-1 beta was significantly lower in the GCF of sonic group patients (P = 0.05), while concentration of interleukin-6 was significantly reduced in both groups (P ≤ 0.05) (t tests). Under these conditions, there is some evidence to suggest that the sonic toothbrush is more beneficial in resolving inflammation in patients with moderate periodontal disease.

AB  - Abstract Vulvodynia in young women is a significant clinical challenge. This overview focuses on localized provoked vulvodynia (LPV) with regard to medical and physical predictors of the condition. Several causative factors have been proposed and one major conceptual issue is the role of inflammation. Trauma to the vestibular mucosa causes an initial inflammatory response which may result in peripheral and central pain sensitization. In women with LPV, evidence of mucosal nerve fiber proliferation and enhanced systemic pain perception has been found. A dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles is common and many patients also suffer from other bodily pain. In general, the level of scientific quality in published studies on vulvodynia is low. Further research on epidemiology, etiology and conduction of clinical trials with high evidence grade is desired.

AB  - Abstract Objective The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper. Methods Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition, depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and gel electrophoresis. Results ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference in TNF-α and IL-1? levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment. After treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? were significantly decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes. Conclusion ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical symptoms and the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts.

AB  - Summary Several issues related to the risks, costs, and availability of allogeneic blood transfusions have fueled research into other blood substitutes. Artificial oxygen carriers increase the oxygen content of blood by providing additional chemically modified hemoglobin molecules or inert fluids capable of dissolving large amounts of oxygen. Several such products have been developed and many have undergone extensive clinical investigation, demonstrating their efficacy in improving oxygen transportation and avoiding the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. Their clinical use, however, has been marred by the unresolved safety issues and significant numbers of complications. While further research is underway to improve the safety of artificial oxygen carriers, current products remain valuable assets as ?oxygen bridges? in the management of patients suffering from critically low hemoglobin levels at imminent risk of ischemia and death that cannot be transfused.

AB  - Abstract Background Early life stress (ELS) has been linked to health disparities across the human lifespan, particularly increased risk for depression and its recurrence. In this study we explore two plausible and competing pathways through which ELS may lead to depression via inflammation. Methods Participants (ages 18?22; n = 41) completed the Early Trauma Inventory as a measure of ELS. Participants then completed consecutive daily diaries of mood and other sickness behavior for the 7 days prior to and 7 days after receiving the annual influenza vaccine. Circulating concentrations of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured immediately before and 24 hr after vaccination. Results ELS was not associated with the magnitude of change in IL-6 from pre- to post-vaccine, however, exposure to ELS moderated the association between change in IL-6 from pre- to post-vaccine and changes in both cognitive difficulty and depressed mood. Individuals exposed to greater ELS showed greater psychological sensitivity to increases in IL-6. Conclusions Exposure to ELS may increase sensitivity to peripheral inflammation in the central nervous system. Future studies elaborating on the impact of ELS on the sensitivity of specific neural circuits and cells to inflammation are needed.

AB  - Background One major concern in about one third of elder patients after total hip-replacement surgery is post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment is accompanied with changes in serum S-100? protein (S-100?) and inflammatory markers. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the value of serum S-100? and interleukin(IL)-1?, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in reflecting POCD after total hip-replacement surgery. Methods Forty-two elderly patients were enrolled, and 37 patients completed the follow-up. Serum S-100? protein and IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were determined pre-operatively, as well as 1?h and 6?h post-operatively. Neuropsychological tests were performed pre-operatively, as well as on day 1, 3, and 7 post-operatively. Results Seventeen (45.9%, 17/37) patients developed POCD 1?day after surgery, and three (8.1%, 3/37) developed POCD 7?days after surgery. [Correction added after publication 7 February 2012: in the preceding sentence (54.1%, 17/37) was corrected to (45.9%, 17/37)]. Patients with POCD 1?day after surgery had significantly higher serum levels of IL-6 at 6?h (135?±?32?pg/ml vs. 91?±?29?pg/ml, P?<?0.05) and S-100? at 1?h (1872?±?385?pg/ml vs. 1289?±?143?pg/ml, P?<?0.05. No significant post-operative change was detected in levels of TNF-α, IL-1, or CRP. Conclusion The serum levels of pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 and S-100? protein increased after total hip-replacement in elderly patients, and such increase may serve as predicting parameters for the occurrence of POCD.
