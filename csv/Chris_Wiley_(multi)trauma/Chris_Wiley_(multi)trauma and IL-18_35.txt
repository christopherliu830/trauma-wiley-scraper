AB  - Background The magnitude of the systemic response is proportional to the degree of surgical trauma. Much has been reported in the literature comparing metabolic and immune responses, analgesia use, or length of hospital stay between laparoscopic and open procedures. In particular, metabolic and immune responses are represented by measuring various chemical mediators as stress responses. Laparoscopic procedures are associated with reduced operative trauma compared with open procedures, resulting in lower systemic response. As a result, laparoscopic procedures are now well accepted for both benign and malignant processes. Laparoscopic liver resection, specifically, is employed for symptomatic and some malignant tumors, following improvements in diagnostic accuracy, laparoscopic devices, and techniques. However, laparoscopic liver resection is still controversial in malignant disease because of complex anatomy, the technical difficulty of the procedure, and questionable indications. There are few reports describing the stress responses associated with laparoscopic liver resection, even though many studies reviewing stress responses have been performed recently in both humans and animal models comparing laparoscopic to conventional open surgery. Although this review examines stress response after laparoscopic liver resection in both an animal and human clinical model, further controlled randomized studies with additional investigations of immunologic parameters are needed to demonstrate the consequences of either minimally invasive surgery or open procedures on perioperative or postoperative stress responses for laparoscopic liver resection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Hypercatabolism and immune dysfunction are closely associated with the development of systemic inflammatory response?multiple organ dysfunction (SIRS/MODS) in critical illness. It remains unclear however, whether leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone whose levels are influenced by several cytokines and which regulates immune function, food-intake and energy expenditure is independently related to the development of and/or severity and mortality from SIRS/MODS. DESIGN and PATIENTS To assess the role of leptin in SIRS/MODS we performed a matched case control and a longitudinal study (14?days) in 35 critically ill patients with SIRS/MODS and 35 matched controls. RESULTS Baseline leptin levels were positively associated with body mass index (BMI) and TNF-α (P?<?0·01) in patients and with IGF-1 and IL-6 levels (P?<?0·05) in controls. Furthermore, leptin levels exhibited a progressive increase from the first to the last day of the study and although baseline levels were not different, peak leptin levels as well as leptin levels on the last day of the study were significantly higher in cases than in controls (P?<?0·05). TNF-α levels, IL-6 and cortisol levels were also higher, whereas IGF-1 levels were lower in cases (P?<?0·05). To assess whether leptin levels are independently associated with SIRS/MODS we performed multivariate logistic regression analysis which revealed that leptin up-regulation in cases is mediated by elevated TNF-α and cortisol levels. Finally, there was no independent association between leptin and survival in this group of critically ill patients. CONCLUSION We conclude that cytokines and cortisol upregulate leptin levels, which may contribute to the development of the hypercatabolism, wasting and immune dysfunction but leptin levels are not independently associated with severity or mortality of patients with systemic inflammatory response?multiple organ dysfunction .

AB  - Background: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) evokes a systemic inflammatory response involving the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin (iL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Like IL-10, opioids downregulate the immune responses in vivo and in vitro, including the activity of the cytokine-producing monocytes and granulocytes. The proinflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of the hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate if choice of anaesthesia, based on high-dose opioids (fentanyl) versus low-dose opioids influenced the release of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Secondly, it was investigated whether serum amyloid P-component (SAP) is an acute-phase protein in man such as C-reactive protein (CRP), with which it is physically and structurally related. Methods: Sixteen patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomized to either low-dose opioid anaesthesia consisting of thoracic epidural analgesia combined with inhalational anaesthesia (group I) or high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (group II). From each patient 18 blood samples were taken perioperatively. Cytokine analyses were performed with ELISA, CRP and SAP mere measured with rocket immunoelectrophoresis (REI). Results: Surgery and CPB elicited a marked, transient and almost simultaneous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response with no differences between the groups. The cytokine levels returned to preoperative levels 1?3 d after operation. Anaesthesia and surgery did not affect SAP plasma levels while patients showed a major increase in CRP concentrations preceding the cytokine responses. Conclusion: CABG performed during two different anaesthetic techniques, high-dose fentanyl versus low-dose opioid anaesthesia, elicited a well-defined cytokine response with minor variation in the time course of each cytokine. The cytokine production was not modified by type of anaesthesia. Finally, SAP is not an acute-phase protein in men.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - Abstract Background? Most reported sporotrichosis cases came from South American countries, the USA, India and Japan. This mycosis is also endemic in Northeast China. However, the situation is not clear for international researchers due to lack of large series reported in English. Objectives? To report and analyse 457 sporotrichosis cases. Methods? Retrospective study of 457 cases of sporotrichosis diagnosed by fungal culture at the First Hospital of Jilin University from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009. Results? In this series, the male: female ratio was 1:1.42. Mean age was 41.2?years. Cases from age group 51?60?years accounted for most of the cases (22.54%). A total of 434 patients lived in rural areas (94.97%). The onset of symptoms in 67.61% cases happened in cold seasons (winter and spring). History of trauma presented in 133 cases (29.1%). The mean duration of the symptoms before the presentation was 6.41?months. A total of 190 (41.58%) showed lymphocutaneous form, 252 patients (55.14%) showed fixed form, 8 patients (1.75%) showed disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis and the clinical form of 7 patients (1.53%) could not be defined. Extremities and nodules were the most frequently involved sites and founded manifestation. Main histopathology findings were suppurative granuloma, tuberculoid granuloma and mixed inflammatory granuloma. A total of 75 cases (19.74%) had fungal elements revealed by Periodic Acid-Schiff staining. Patients responded well to potassium iodide (KI), itraconazole, terbinafine and combinations of these agents with a mean course of 2.17?months to resolve. Conclusion? As the first report of a large series of sporotrichosis cases from China to be published in English literature, our study indicated a serious sporotrichosis endemic situation in Jilin province, Northeast China, with epidemiological and clinical characteristics similar to those of previous Chinese reports, but different from those in other countries. KI, itraconazole and terbinafine are effective for the treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aims Fragment reattachment is a procedure that offers advantages, such as preservation of tooth structure and maintenance of color, shape, and translucency of the original tooth. The aim of this study was to analyze the reattachment techniques used to restore anterior teeth fractured by trauma. Materials and Methods The PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched in October 2016, and the search was updated in February 2017. A search of the gray literature was performed in Google Scholar and OpenGrey. Reference lists of eligible studies were evaluated to identify additional studies. Two authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted the data. In vitro studies that evaluated permanent human teeth fractured by trauma were included. Results Twenty-one studies remained after screening. The bond strength between the fragment and the crown was evaluated in 119 experimental groups. Ten different techniques were evaluated as follows: no preparation, chamfer, bevel, anchors, overcontour, internal groove, no preparation associated with chamfer after reattachment, fragment dentin removal associated with chamfer after reattachment, bevel associated with overcontour, and groove associated with shoulder. Five different materials were used to reattach the fragment: bonding system, luting composite resin, flowable composite, microhybrid composite, and nanocomposite. Conclusion Fragment reattachment using a technique with no preparation and an adhesive system associated with an intermediate composite with good mechanical properties can restore part of the resistance of the fractured tooth.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? Our study sought to assess the prevalence of and risk factors for opioid drug dependence among out-patients on long-term opioid therapy in a large health-care system. Methods? Using electronic health records, we identified out-patients receiving 4+ physician orders for opioid therapy in the past 12 months for non-cancer pain within a large US health-care system. We completed diagnostic interviews with 705 of these patients to identify opioid use disorders and assess risk factors. Results? Preliminary analyses suggested that current opioid dependence might be as high as 26% [95% confidence interval (CI)?=?22.0?29.9] among the patients studied. Logistic regressions indicated that current dependence was associated with variables often in the medical record, including age <65 [odds ratio (OR)?=?2.33, P?=?0.001], opioid abuse history (OR?=?3.81, P?<?0.001), high dependence severity (OR?=?1.85, P?=?0.001), major depression (OR?=?1.29, P?=?0.022) and psychotropic medication use (OR?=?1.73, P?=?0.006). Four variables combined (age, depression, psychotropic medications and pain impairment) predicted increased risk for current dependence, compared to those without these factors (OR?=?8.01, P?<?0.001). Knowing that the patient also had a history of severe dependence and opioid abuse increased this risk substantially (OR?=?56.36, P?<?0.001). Conclusion? Opioid misuse and dependence among prescription opioid patients in the United States may be higher than expected. A small number of factors, many documented in the medical record, predicted opioid dependence among the out-patients studied. These preliminary findings should be useful in future research efforts.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of paratracheal air cysts (PACs), their correlation with different lung diseases and their connection with the trachea by chest multi detector computed tomography (MDCT). Methods We retrospectively reviewed chest MDCT images of 8240 consecutive patients obtained from January 2010 to December 2011 with a 16-detector multi-detector CT scanner. PACs were assessed for prevalence, location, level, size and the presence of visible communication with the trachea. MDCT diagnoses were classified as normal, primary or metastatic malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and other lung diseases. We randomly selected 330 patients who had no visible PACs for the control group. We evaluated the associations between patients' demographic findings (age and sex), MDCT findings of lung and the presence of PACs. The findings of the PACs and control groups were compared. Statistical analysis used chi-squared test and Mann?Whitney U-test for evaluation. Results PACs were presented in 301 patients (4%); 204 men and 97 women, ranging in age from 14 to 91 years (median?=?57 years). There was no significant difference in the presence of PACs by age (P?>?0.05). Male subjects showed higher prevalence (P?=?0.005). Fifty PACs (16.6%) showed communication with the trachea or main bronchus. Although the relation between COPD and PACs was statistically significant (P?<?0.001), there was no relation between primary or metastatic malignancies, pneumonia and other lung diseases and PACs. Conclusion PACs are common in MDCT and should not be misdiagnosed as pneumomediastinum. It should be kept in mind that PACs may be associated with COPD.

AB  - Abstract Aim Epidural analgesia reduces the surgical stress response. However, its effect on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the genesis of inflammation following major abdominal surgery remains unclear. Our main objective was to elucidate whether perioperative epidural analgesia prevents the inflammatory response following colorectal cancer surgery. Methods Ninety-six patients scheduled for open or laparoscopic surgery were randomized to epidural analgesia (group E) or patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (group P). Surgery and anaesthesia were standardized in both groups. Plasma cortisol, insulin and serum cytokines [interleukin 1? (IL-1?), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor α, interferon ?, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor] were measured preoperatively (T0), 1?6 h postoperatively (T1) and 3?5 days postoperatively (T2). Mixed model analysis was used, after logarithmic transformation when appropriate, for analyses of cytokines and stress markers. Results >There were no significant differences in any serum cytokine concentration between groups P and E at any time point except for IL-10 which was 87% higher in group P [median and range 4.1 (2.3?9.2) pg/ml] compared to group E [2.6 (1.3?4.7) pg/ml] (P = 0.002) at T1. There was no difference in plasma cortisol and insulin between the groups at any time point after surgery. A significant difference in median serum cytokine concentration was found between open and laparoscopic surgery with higher levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 at T1 in patients undergoing open surgery compared to laparoscopic surgery. No difference in serum cytokine concentration was detected between the groups or between the surgical technique at T2. Conclusions Open surgery, compared to laparoscopic surgery, has greater impact on these inflammatory mediators than epidural analgesia vs intravenous analgesia.

AB  - SUMMARY Allogeneic blood transfusions expose a patient to many soluble and cell-bound antigens, expressed on viable and decaying cells. In particular, contaminant leukocytes are presumed to play an important role interacting with the recipient's immune system. This immune response to transfusions is influenced by the condition of the patient, and a patient in steady state will respond differently to a patient in hemorrhagic shock, under anesthesia or after surgical tissue injury. Blood transfusions affect both the innate immediate defense immune system and the adaptive immune response, the latter often resulting in antibodies and (less well characterized) cellular immunity. Removal of allogeneic leukocytes by filtration of red cells and platelet products significantly reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and the formation of leukocyte antibodies, causing refractoriness to platelet transfusions. However, an effect of leukocyte-containing transfusions on cellular immune functions relevant to transplant tolerance, cancer surveillance, viral replication or susceptibility to nosocomial infections is less obvious. Randomized studies showed a significant effect of removal of allogeneic leukocytes in blood transfused to cardiac surgery patients, reducing postoperative mortality. As for the other reported clinical effects of (passenger) leukocytes in blood transfusions, there is not yet sufficient evidence.

AB  - Background:? Road traffic accidents are the main cause of trauma in Malaysia. It has been shown that there was an increase in admissions for trauma patients older than 60?years in the last decade. The purpose of this study was to determine the pattern of maxillofacial injuries in the geriatric patients referred to Seremban Hospital, Malaysia. Methods:? Records of patients aged 60?years or older who sustained oral and maxillofacial injuries between 1998 and 2002 were reviewed. Data related to age, sex, race, etiology, types of injuries and treatment modalities were obtained. Results:? A total of 134 geriatric patients with maxillofacial and dental injuries were seen in Seremban Hospital between January 1998 and December 2002. There were 101 (75.4%) men and 33 (24.6%) women. The age ranged 60?92?years with the mean age of 68.3?years (standard deviation, 7.48). Chinese made up the majority of the patients (51.8%), followed by Malays (37.2%), Indian (20.4%) and other ethnic groups (1.5%). The most common cause of injury was due to road traffic accidents (64.2%) However, falls were more common in those aged 76?years and above. The most common bone fracture documented was the mandible (35.7%) followed by fracture of the zygomatic complex (34.0%). The majority of treatment was conservative or closed reduction. Conclusion:? All the elderly patients with facial trauma were managed conservatively or as closed reduction in this hospital. This was largely because of their comorbid state and financial constraints.
