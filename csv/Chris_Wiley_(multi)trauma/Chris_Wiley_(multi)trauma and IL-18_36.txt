AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

AB  - Autosomal dominant hyper IgE (HIES or Job?s) syndrome is a rare primary immune deficiency characterized by eczema, recurrent skin and lung infections, extremely elevated serum IgE, and a variety of connective tissue and skeletal abnormalities. Individuals with HIES share a characteristic facial appearance and many oral manifestations including retained primary dentition, a high arched palate, variations of the oral mucosa and gingiva, and recurrent oral candidiasis. Mutations in STAT3 account for the majority, if not all, of the cases of autosomal dominant HIES, but the pathogenesis of the many varied features remains poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the clinical phenotype of HIES including immunologic and non-immunologic features, the genetics of HIES, and treatment.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.

AB  - Abstract Introduction:? Previous studies have shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels correlated with mortality in critically ill patients. Goal:? To determine the effect of ketamine on IL-6 levels in liver resections patients with a temporary porto-arterial occlusion (Pringle manoeuvre). Materials and methods:? Controlled, prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. One group (n?=?21) received ketamine whereas the other group (n?=?17) received placebo. IL-6 levels were obtained at baseline, 4, 12, 24?h, 3 and 5 days. Results:? There were no significant differences in IL-6 levels between the groups (basal P?=?089, 4?h P?=?0.83, 12?h P?=?0.39, 24?h, P?=?0.55, 3 days P?=?0.80 and 5 days P?=?0.45). Both groups had elevated IL-6 levels that became almost undetectable by day 5. There was no major morbidity and no mortality in either group. Conclusions:? Ketamine does not seem to have an effect on plasma levels of IL-6. This could be interpreted as a potential finding associated with outcome as we did not encounter any deaths or major complications. Further studies will likely be needed to determine the range of IL-6 levels associated with survival and mortality, and whether it could be a predictor of survival.

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.

AB  - Overproduction of interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis (MG), and thymectomy can cause myasthenic crisis because of surgically induced overproduction of IL-6. Preoperative steroid therapy is beneficial in preventing MG crisis during the perioperative period. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of preoperative steroid therapy on proinflammatory mediators during the perioperative period of transsternal thymectomy for MG. The study group comprised 20 consecutive MG patients undergoing transsternal thymectomy during the period March 2002 through March 2004. Seventeen of these patients received dose-escalated steroid therapy before thymectomy (steroid treatment group) and three did not (non-steroid treatment group). Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 were determined during the perioperative period; clinical outcomes were reviewed, and the results were compared between the two groups. Peak serum IL-6 and CRP concentrations were significantly lower in the steroid treatment group than in the non-steroid treatment group. Amongst perioperative variables subjected to multiple regression analysis, preoperative steroid treatment were found to be the most significant independent predictor of inhibited IL-6 production on postoperative day 1. No postoperative respiratory failure occurred in the steroid treatment group, but it did occur in the non-steroid treatment group. Preoperative steroid therapy can ameliorate IL-6 overproduction and may help stabilize the patient's postoperative condition.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether past history of depression is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, and whether history of gestational diabetes is associated with increased rates of postpartum depression. Research design Data for this case?control study consisted of de-identified chart records for 1439 women who received pregnancy care at a large university hospital between 1998 and 2017. Results A history of depression prior to pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes requiring insulin, although not with subtler degrees of gestational hyperglycemia. Diabetes in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Trauma history was associated with both impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy and postpartum depression. Conclusions Past episodes of depression increase risk for the most severe form of gestational diabetes; however, gestational diabetes does not contribute significantly to risk for postpartum depression. This suggests a unidirectional association, unlike the bidirectional association of diabetes with depression among the general population. History of trauma increases risk for both gestational hyperglycemia and postpartum depression, suggesting important health effects of trauma that may differ measurably from those associated with depression.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to investigate the initiation and course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early inflammatory response and to elucidate the cytokine system in relation to the adrenal response caused by stress. Seven blood samples were collected, pre- and postoperatively (0?72?h) after total hip replacement (THR) due to osteoarthritis. The following cytokines were measured using Cytometric Bead Array: interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 (B Wilcoxon test P?<?0.01) Repeated measurements were also significant (Friedman P?<?0.05). The concentration of IL-8 doubled the day of surgery but did not reach a significant level (Friedman test =0.069). None of the other cytokines showed any significant changes. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was interrupted after the surgery and there was a significant correlation between the cortisol secretion and IL-6 response. This study demonstrates an isolated elevation in IL-6 levels with only a minor elevation in IL-8 following THR. This pro-inflammatory response seemed to decline without activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), but cortisol seemed to play a complicated role in halting the acute inflammatory response.
