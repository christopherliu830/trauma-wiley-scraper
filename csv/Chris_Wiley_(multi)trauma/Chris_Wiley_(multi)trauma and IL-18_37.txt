AB  - Abstract Rhabdomyolysis in deceased donors usually causes acute renal failure (ARF), which may be considered a contraindication for kidney transplantation. From January 2012 to December 2016, 30 kidneys from 15 deceased donors with severe rhabdomyolysis and ARF were accepted for transplantation at our center. The peak serum creatinine (SCr) kinase, myoglobin, and SCr of the these donors were 15 569±8597 U/L, 37 092±42 100 ?g/L, and 422±167 ?mol/L, respectively. Two donors received continuous renal replacement therapy due to anuria. Six kidneys exhibited a discolored appearance (from brown to glossy black) due to myoglobin casts. The kidney transplant results from the donors with rhabdomyolysis donors were compared with those of 90 renal grafts from standard criteria donors (SCD). The estimated glomerular filtration rate at 2 years was similar between kidney transplants from donors with rhabdomyolysis and SCD (70.3±14.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 72.3±15.1 mL/min/1.73 m2). We conclude that excellent graft function can be achieved from kidneys donors with ARF caused by rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Summary Objective:? Review the literature regarding the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to prevent red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in critically ill patients. Data sources:? A computerized search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 through June 2003 was conducted using the terms erythropoietin, anemia, hemoglobin, critical care, intensive care, surgery, trauma, burn, and transfusion. References of selected articles were reviewed. A manual search of critical care, surgery, trauma, burn, hematology, and pharmacy journals was conducted to identify relevant abstracts. Results:? Six randomized studies have evaluated exogenous administration of erythropoietin to prevent RBC transfusions in critically ill patients. Studies vary with respect to rHuEPO dosage regimens, dose of concurrently administered iron, patient characteristics, and transfusion thresholds. Administration of rHuEPO rapidly produces erythropoiesis to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. The largest study conducted to date used weekly rHuEPO administration and found a modest decrease in transfusion requirements although the time to first transfusion was delayed. Reduced intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) was shown in only one study of surgical/trauma patients. Reduced LOS after ICU discharge was found in another study of severely ill patients (APACHE II score >22). Other clinical outcomes were not altered by rHuEPO use. No adverse events were associated with rHuEPO use although studies were not designed to evaluate safety. Conclusions:? rHuEPO reduces the need for transfusions. A cost-effectiveness analysis of rHuEPO for this indication is needed. Defining an optimal dosage regimen, identifying patients most likely to respond to rHuEPO, and determining risk factors for ICU associated anaemia would provide information for appropriate rHuEPO utilization.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Background:? The role of pre-hospital trauma care and the effect of pre-hospital rapid sequence intubation (RSI) on patient outcome are still not clear. This study evaluated the impact of pre-hospital trauma care by emergency physicians (EP) on mortality from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a 180-day Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Methods:? A 48-month parallel non-controlled cohort study compared a group of 64 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9; Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15] who received pre-hospital advanced life support (ALS) with RSI and were transported to the hospital by EPs (EP group), with a group of 60 patients who did not receive pre-hospital ALS with RSI [emergency medical technicians (EMT) group]. Results:? There were no significant statistical differences between the groups in age (P= 0.79), mechanism of injury (P= 0.68), gender (P= 0.82), initial GCS (P= 0.63), initial SaO2 in the field (P= 0.63), initial systolic blood pressure in the field (P= 0.47) and on-scene time (P= 0.41). In the EP group, there was significantly better first hour survival (97% vs. 79%, P= 0.02), first day survival (90% vs. 72%, P= 0.02), better functional outcome (GOS 4?5: 53% vs. 33%, P < 0.01; GOS 2?3: 8% vs. 20%, P < 0.01) and shortened hospitalization time in intensive care unit (ICU) (P= 0.03) and other departments (P= 0.04). In total hospital mortality, we detected no differences between both groups [EP group: 40% (95% CI: 34?45%) vs. EMT group 42% (95% CI: 36?47%, P= 0.76], except in a subgroup of patients with GCS 6?8 where there was significantly lower total hospital mortality in the EP group (24% vs. 78%, P < 0.01). Conclusion:? After starting the trauma care system with emergency physicians in our region, there was a decrease in the number of deaths on hospital admission, a reduction in hospital mortality in the GCS group 6?8, a change in the temporal distribution of deaths, an improvement in functional neurological outcome and shortened hospitalization time.

AB  - Aim The increased prevalence of non-operative management of splenic injuries contributes to the infrequent use of salvage procedures. Nevertheless, salvage procedures are sometimes required. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients. Methods This retrospective study included 27 splenic injury patients divided into two groups: those treated by salvage procedures (splenorrhaphy or partial resection) and those who underwent splenectomy. Our salvage procedure protocol was applied in the following situations: if hemodynamics were stable during laparotomy or bleeding was fully controlled by manual or incisional mobilization of the organ, when no more than two other organs required repair, and if no clinical coagulopathy existed. Results The splenic abbreviated injury scale, intraoperative bleeding, and transfusion requirements of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma requirements in 24?h were significantly lower in the salvage procedure group. There was no difference in the injury severity score, initial amount of bleeding, length of intensive care unit stay, or morbidity and mortality rates between the groups. Patients who underwent salvage procedures were managed without major complication, except one pseudoaneurysm case. Conclusion We confirmed the feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients, particularly for those with simple or lower grade injuries.

AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background: Proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be elevated in individuals experiencing chronic stress as well as in those with major depressive disorder. Much less is known about cytokines in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD). We hypothesized that PD and PTSD would be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. Method: We utilized Luminex technology to examine 20 cytokines and chemokines in serum from 48 well-characterized individuals with a primary DSM-IV PD or PTSD diagnosis, and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We conservatively employed a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (α=.05/20=.0025). Results: Individuals with primary PTSD or PD had significantly elevated median peripheral cytokine levels for 18 of 20 different cytokines compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (all P<.0025). To assess for the presence of a generalized proinflammatory state, we also examined the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of at least six of nine common proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, and IFN-α). For men and women, 87% of anxiety patients had six or more detectable levels of these proinflammatory cytokines, compared with only 25% of controls (Fisher's Exact Test (FET) P=.000). Confirmatory analysis of the subset of individuals without current psychiatric medication use or comorbid depression was of comparable significance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a generalized inflammatory state may be present in individuals with PD or PTSD. Depression and Anxiety, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions in adipose tissue is thought to contribute to chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation and consequently to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whose serum levels are elevated in such patients, have been shown to interfere with cytokine production in vitro. In order to evaluate the effects of elevated NEFA levels on cytokine production in adipose tissue in vivo we used an 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion (OFM) catheter to induce local inflammation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of healthy volunteers and to sample interstitial fluid (IF) specifically from the inflamed tissue. In two crossover studies, nine subjects received either an intravenous lipid-heparin infusion to elevate circulating NEFA levels or saline over a period of 28 h. The former increased the circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs), NEFA, glucose, and insulin over the study period. NEFA effects on locally induced inflammation were estimated by measuring the levels of a panel adipokines in the OFM probe effluent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels increased during the study period but were not affected by lipid-heparin infusion. In contrast, the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced during the final hour of lipid-heparin infusion (saline: 449.2 ± 105.9 vs. lipid-heparin: 65.4 ± 15.4 pg/ml; P = 0.02). These data provide the first in vivo evidence that elevated NEFA can modulate cytokine production by adipose tissue.

Methods The clinical data of 83 patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2016 to February 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. ERAS was applied to 38 patients (ERAS group), while 45 patients received conventional surgical treatment (control group). The operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, visual analogue scale (VAS), postoperative duration of chest tube placement, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications were compared between the groups. Results Surgeries were conducted successfully in all patients, and no mortality occurred during the perioperative period. The ERAS group had better VAS on the third postoperative day, shorter chest tube duration, and shorter length of hospital stay (P?<?0.05). No differences between the groups in terms of operative duration, number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, VAS on the first postoperative day, or complication rate were found (P?>?0.05). Conclusions ERAS using uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for NSCLC patients is safe and practicable, and could also reduce the length of hospital stay.

AB  - Abstract Objective Extracorporeal life support is increasingly used in the treatment of patients presenting with cardiogenic shock or in need of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Identifying therapeutic targets and factors associated with the prognosis are highly desirable. The present study analysed the impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on the outcome of patients undergoing VA ECMO. Methods Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels of 329 patients were analysed prior to, on day 1 and 5 of VA ECMO therapy. IL 6 and 8 serum levels of surviving and non-surviving patients were compared. At time points with significant differences, receiver operating characteristics and cut-off levels were analysed to determine the prognostic value of interleukin serum levels. Survival analysis was performed to compare patients above and below cut-off levels. Results Interleukin 6 serum levels were significantly elevated in non-surviving patients prior to VA ECMO initiation. Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels in non-surviving patients were significantly elevated on day 1 of VA ECMO. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed significant prognostic impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on day 1 of VA ECMO (AUC 0.70 and 0.72). Survival analysis comparing patients above and below cut-off showed a 1 year survival of 32.6% for IL6 and 20.8% for IL8 above, as well as 66.9% for IL6 and 61.9% for IL8 below the cut-off (p<0.05). Conclusion Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels demonstrated prognostic value early in VA ECMO therapy. The technical applicability of interleukin reduction raises interest in interleukin 6 and 8 as therapeutic targets.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the perioperative systemic immunity of laparoscopy-assisted and open radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proven by endoscopy and biopsy were eligible, while patients with preoperative staging of T4, N2?3, or M1 were excluded. Eligible patients willing to undertake laparoscopic surgery in the consecutive cohort were assigned to the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) group, while concurrent patients were assigned to the conventional open gastrectomy (OG) group. All operations were performed with the intention of radical resection. Various immunological parameters were tested in peripheral venous blood collected at preoperative 1st day and postoperative 2nd day (POD2) and 7th day (POD7). SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty patients were included, 15 each in the LAG and OG groups. The general characteristics and short-term outcomes (harvested lymph nodes number, hospital stay, complications, and mortality rate) of the two groups were comparable, but the operation time was significantly longer in LAG (P = 0.001). Moreover, intergroup comparisons indicated no significant differences between the groups in levels of neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, interleukin-6, or interleukin-10 at any time point (P?>?0.05). However, there was a gradual decrease in natural killer cell count in the LAG group up to POD7 (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The changes in systemic immunity markers were comparable between laparoscopy-assisted and open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. However, there was a trend of suppression of natural killer cells in the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy group.

AB  - Abstract: Bacterial sepsis remains a frequent complication after liver transplantation. We previously reported the results of a pilot study that suggested that low expression of HLA-DR on monocytes is a predictive marker for the occurrence of sepsis. We have studied the value of this marker in an additional cohort of patients, and have analyzed the relation of HLA-DR expression with the use of immunosuppressive agents. 20 adult liver transplantation patients were prospectively monitored during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. All were treated according to standard protocols. The percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR was measured by flow cytometry. In addition, the effects of incubation of monocytes with prednisolone in vitro on the expression of HLA-DR was determined in 7 healthy volunteers. Seven patients developed bacterial sepsis after a median 15 (range 10?20) days after transplantation. HLA-DR expression was significantly lower in these patients on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after transplantation compared with non-septic patients. The percentage of HLA-DR positive monocytes was 30% or less, 3 (1?8) days before onset of sepsis. On day 7 after transplantation, HLA-DR expression on 50% or less of monocytes had a positive predictive value for sepsis of 71%, whereas the negative predictive value was 85%. Patients who developed sepsis received significantly more prednisolone. Incubation with prednisolone in vitro lowered the expression of HLA-DR in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that low HLA-DR expression on monocytes is a marker for a high risk of subsequent sepsis in liver transplantation patients. This high risk may be (at least partly) related to the dose of prednisolone.

AB  - ABSTRACT We evaluated the effects of ibuprofen on cytokine production and mortality in a mouse model of septic shock induced by Vibrio vulnificus, strain Chi Mei Vv05191. Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) or saline (control) was given to female BALB/cByJ mice for three consecutive days before exposure to the pathogen. For cytokine production, serum and peritoneal fluid were assayed for IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-2 by ELISA at 3, 6, and 9 hr after intraperitoneal infection of the organism. At 6 hr after infection, serum and peritoneal fluid levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-2 were significantly higher in the ibuprofen group. For mortality determination, 73 mice (37 ibuprofen, 36 control) were injected intramuscularly with V. vulnificus. Kaplan?Meier survival curves were analyzed. Survival was significantly decreased by ibuprofen only for the lowest inoculum (25 CFU) of V. vulnificus. Administration of ibuprofen before infection may augment the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus by stimulating cytokine production.
