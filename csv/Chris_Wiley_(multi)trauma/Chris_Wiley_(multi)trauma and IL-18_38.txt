AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract It is recognised that the commonest organic cause for impotence is diabetes. It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To investigate the effect on survival of two operations done at various intervals before the induction of monobacterial or multibacterial peritonitis in rats. Design: Laboratory study. Setting: Teaching hospital, Belgium. Material: Inbred male white wistar R/A rats. Interventions: Posterolateral laparotomy, hindleg amputation, or control (anaesthetic only) (n = 90 animals in each group), followed by induction of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis at 1, 7 or 14 days. Further groups of rats were similarly operated on (50 in each group), but peritonitis was induced by caecal ligation and puncture. Main outcome measure: Survival 7 days after induction of peritonitis. Results: Of the rats in which E. coli was used to induce peritonitis 27/28 (96%), 29/29 (100%), and 21/30 (70%) had survived 7 days after induction of peritonitis in the group that underwent posterolateral laparotomy, compared with 18/30 (60%), 20/28 (71%), and 18/28 (64%) in the control group; p < 0.001, 0.002, and 0.78, respectively. The figures for hindleg amputation were 21/27 (78%), 23/27 (85%), and 17/30 (57%). The corresponding figures for S. aureus peritonitis were for posterolateral laparotomy 28/30 (93%), 20/30 (67%), and 24/29 (83%) compared with controls 21/30 (70%), 9/30 (30%), and 20/29 (69%); p < 0.04, 0.009, and 0.75, respectively. The figures for hindleg amputation were 21/30 (70%), 12/30 (40%), and 23/30 (77%). Similar results were obtained with peritonitis induced by caecal ligation and puncture. Conclusions: Althought surgical trauma may depress various aspects of the immune response in rats, it does not decrease their resistance to intraperitoneal microbial infections. The previous opening of the peritoneal cavity seemed to improve survival in our model. Copyright ? 1998 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by an inflammatory destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular interleukin-1 (IL-1), have been suggested to be effector molecules based on the observations that pro-inflammatory cytokines cause beta-cell apoptosis in vitro and aggravate diabetes in vivo, and that inhibition of the action of these cytokines reduce diabetes incidence in animal models of type 1 diabetes and islet graft destruction. This review presents the rationale for and design of a recently launched double-blind, multicenter, randomized clinical trial that investigates the effect of interleukin-1 antagonism on beta-cell function in subjects with T1D of recent-onset.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of anterior and posterior instrumentation with different debridement and graft fusion methods for multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 81 patients with multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis who underwent anterior or posterior instrumentation combined with different methods of debridement, decompression, and graft fusion from January 2002 to December 2012. All patients were divided into an anterior instrumentation group and a posterior instrumentation group. In the anterior instrumentation group, there were 39 patients who underwent transthoracic debridement. In the posterior instrumentation group, there were 34 patients who underwent trans-costotransverse decompression and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation, and another 8 patients underwent combined anterior debridement and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation in a single-stage or two-stage procedure. The kyphotic angles were calculated from lateral spinal X-rays using the modified Konstam method. The symptoms and signs of tuberculosis, fusion level, fusion time of the bone graft, average kyphosis angle, average correction, average loss of correction, and clinical complications were recorded. The average follow-up period was 37?months (range, 17?72?months). Results The cohort consisted of 47 males and 34 females with an average age of 38?years. The mean durations of the operations were 3.5 ± 0.4?h in the anterior group and 4.0 ± 0.3?h in the posterior group ( P < 0.05). The mean blood loss volumes during surgery were 450 ± 42 and 560 ± 51?mL for the anterior group and the posterior group, respectively ( P < 0.01). The kyphotic deformities were corrected from 32.1° ± 10.3° to 10.2° ± 2.1° in the anterior group and from 33.8° ± 11.7° to 12.6° ± 2.7° in the posterior group ( P < 0.01). The neurologic statuses of the 23 patients with preoperative neurologic deficits improved in each group. Fusion was confirmed radiographically at 5.4 ± 1.2?months (range, 4?12?months) in the anterior group and 5.6 ± 1.4?months (range, 4?13?months) in the posterior group ( P > 0.05). Postoperative relapses were noted in 1 and 3 patients in the anterior and the posterior group, respectively. Conclusion Posterior instrumentation was more effective than anterior instrumentation in the correction of kyphosis and the maintenance of the correction. However, postoperative sinus formation was more frequent in patients who underwent a single-stage posterior procedure.

AB  - Summary In this study, we compared the manoeuvrability and ease of use of the single-use Ambu aScope and Olympus re-usable fibrescope in a manikin set to simulate difficult fibrescope placement. A total of 75 anaesthetists took part in this randomised crossover non-inferiority study. We recorded the time to task completion, tip surface collision count and participants? impression of ease of use. For the Ambu aScope and Olympus fibrescope, the mean (SD) first attempt time to task completion was 63 (31) s and 53 (23)?s, respectively (95% CI of the difference 3?17?s), p?=?0.008. This rejected the null hypothesis of a difference of >?30?s. The mean (SD) number of tip surface collisions was 2.7 (1.9) and 2.5 (1.8), respectively, (95% CI of the difference ?0.4 to 0.7) p?=?0.56. However, the participants found the Olympus easier to use (p?<?0.001). Mean (SD) visual analogue scores for the perceived ease of use (0?mm?=?extremely difficult and 100?mm?= extremely easy) were 65 (18) mm and 77 (14) mm for the Ambu aScope and Olympus scopes, respectively. This study found that the single-use Ambu aScope is as easy to manoeuvre as the Olympus re-usable fibrescope. This single-use device appears to be an acceptable alternative to the re-usable fibrescope.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To assess the effect of esmolol vs lidocaine to attenuate the detrimental rise in heart rate and blood pressure during intubation of patients with isolated head trauma. Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized study, performed at an urban, county teaching emergency department. Participants were 30 patients with isolated head trauma. Each underwent a standardized intubation protocol including esmolol or lidocaine, both at 2 mg/kg. Results: Esmolol was used in 16 patients and lidocaine in 14. Mechanisms of injury included 12 assaults, 6 motor vehicle collisions, 6 falls, 4 auto-vs-pedestrian crashes, and 2 bicycle incidents. Mean ethanol level was 0.116 ± 0.133 SD (range 0-0.482). Mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7.9 ± 4.0 SD. Cranial computed tomography (CT) hemorrhagic findings included 9 subdural/epidural hematomas, 6 cortex hemorrhages, and 2 multi-hemorrhages. Eleven patients received surgical intervention: 9 patients received a craniotomy, and 2 a ventricular catheter. The 2-minute time interval around intubation was used to assess each drug's efficacy. The mean difference change between groups for heart rate was 4.0 beats/min (95% CI = -17.7 to 9.7 beats/min), for systolic blood pressure was 1.3 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.8 to 30.4 mm Hg), and for diastolic blood pressure was 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.1 to 21.9 mm Hg). The power of this study was 90% to detect a 20-beat/min difference in heart rate, a 35-mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure, and a 20-mm Hg difference in diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Esmolol and lidocaine have similar efficacies to attenuate moderate hemodynamic response to intubation of patients with isolated head trauma.

AB  - Summary Background Opioid use is epidemic in cirrhosis, which could precipitate hepatic encephalopathy (HE) potentially through gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Aim To define the effect of opioids on readmissions and on gut microbiota composition and functionality. Methods Cohort 1 had 200 cirrhotic in-patients (with/without opioid use) followed prospectively through the index hospitalisation and 6 months post discharge. Readmissions (HE-related/unrelated) were compared between patients discharged on opioids compared to the rest, including using a multi-variable analysis. Cohort 2 consisted of 72 cirrhotics on chronic opioids who were age/model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and prior HE-balanced with 72 cirrhotics not on opioids. Stool microbiota composition (multi-tagged sequencing), predicted functionality (PiCRUST), endotoxemia and systemic inflammation (IL-6, IL-17) were compared. Results Cohort 1: Chronic opioid use was statistically similar between those admitted with/without HE, and was judged to be an HE precipitant in <5% of cases during the index hospitalisation. Of the 144 patients alive at 6 months, 82 were readmitted. The opioid users had a significantly higher all cause (69% vs. 48%, P = 0.008), but not HE-related readmissions (30% vs. 41%, P = 0.30). On regression, opioid therapy and female gender were predictive of readmission independent of MELD score and previous HE. Cohort 2: Significant dysbiosis was noted in the opioid cohort, especially in HE+opioid patients with lower autochthonous taxa and Bacteroidaceae relative abundance. PiCRUST showed highest aromatic amino acid and endotoxin production in opioid users. Opioid users also had higher endotoxemia and IL-6 but not IL-17. Conclusion Chronic opioid use in cirrhosis is associated with increased endotoxemia, dysbiosis and all-cause readmissions.

AB  - Abstract Techniques for selective isolation, labeling, stimulation, and destruction of ameboid microglia allow study of some fundamental questions in neuroimmunology. Examination of surface morphology, proliferative capacity, and cytochemistry suggests that microglia are a class of brain mononuclear phagocytes distinct from blood monocytes, spleen macrophages, or resident peritoneal macrophages. Morover, cultured ameboid microglia isolated from newborn brain can be induced to grow thin cytoplasmic projectios several hundred microns in length; these process-bearing cells resemble a differentiated form of microglia found in adult brain. Ameboid microglia may contribute to brain inflammation by engulfing debris, by releasing cytotoxins, by killing neighboring cells, and by secreting astroglial growth factors. Importantly, ameboid microglia are closely tied to a network of immunomodulators that include colony-stimulating factors and Interluekin-1. The presence of activated microglia during normal embryogenesis and at sites of penetrating brain injury suggests that these cells serve as important effectors linking the immune system with growth and repqir of the CNS.

AB  - Aim Blunt injuries to visceral organs have the potential to lead to delayed pseudoaneurysm formation or organ rupture, but current trauma and surgical guidelines do not recommend repetitive imaging. This study examined the incidence and timing of delayed undesirable events and established advisable timing for follow-up imaging and appropriate observational admission. Methods Patients with blunt splenic (S), liver (L), or kidney (K) injury treated with non-operative management (NOM) in our institution were included and retrospectively reviewed. Results From January 2013 to January 2017, 57 patients were admitted with documented blunt visceral organ injuries and 22 patients were excluded. Of 35 patients (L, 10; S, 17; K, 6; L  S  S, 9; K, 1) patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization. Delayed undesirable events occurred in four patients: three patients with splenic pseudoaneurysm on hospital day 6?7 and one patient with splenic delayed rupture on hospital day 7. The second follow-up computed tomography scan carried out 1?2 days after admission did not show any significant findings that could help predict undesirable results of delayed events. The patients with delayed events had longer continuous abdominal pain than that of event-free patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions Undesirable delayed events were recognized on follow-up computed tomography scans in 11.4% of NOM patients at hospital day 6?7 and tended to be associated with high-grade splenic injuries and continuous symptoms. Repetitive screening of these patients 6?7 days after injury might be warranted because of the potential risk of delayed events.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounting for 80% of head injury diagnoses, recognition of individuals at risk of cognitive dysfunction remains a challenge in the acute setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential role for computerised cognitive testing as part of a complete ED head injury assessment. Methods mTBI patients (n =?36) who incurred a head injury within 24?h of presentation to the ED were compared to trauma controls (n = 20) and healthy controls (n =?20) on tests assessing reaction time, speed and attention, episodic memory, working memory and executive functioning. Testing occurred during their visit to the ED at a mean of 12?h post-injury for mTBI and 9.4?h for trauma controls. These tasks were part of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery iPad application. Healthy controls were tested in both a quiet environment and the ED to investigate the potential effects of noise and distraction on neurocognitive function. Results Reaction time was significantly slower in the mTBI group compared to trauma patients (P =?0.015) and healthy controls (P =?0.011), and deficits were also seen in working memory compared to healthy controls (P?≤?0.001) and in executive functioning (P =?0.021 and P <?0.001) compared to trauma and healthy controls. Performances in the control group did not differ between testing environments. Conclusion Computerised neurocognitive testing in the ED is feasible and can be utilised to detect deficits in cognitive performance in the mTBI population as part of a routine head injury assessment.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the correlation between dental injuries and the pattern of maxillofacial fractures. The correlation with age, gender, trauma mechanism and type of maxillofacial fracture was also investigated. Materials and methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 1131 patients with facial fractures were registered. Of these, 473 presented with associated dental trauma. The information and data collected and analyzed included: age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of facial fracture, type of dental injury, and the relationship between dental injury and facial fracture. Results Dental injury was sustained by 473 patients (41.8%), with a total of 2215 injured teeth. Of the 2215 injured teeth, 1191 (53.8%) were in the maxilla and 1024 (46.2%) in the mandible. Fall from a height had the highest risk of dental injuries (OR = 4.145, P = 0.002). The central incisor was the most injured tooth for both the maxilla (388, 36.2%) and mandible (284, 27.7%). The most common type of dental injury was avulsion (1070, 47.4%). More anterior teeth in the maxilla were of crown fracture, avulsion, and intrusion than that in the mandible, whereas more anterior teeth in the mandible were of subluxation and concussion than that in the maxilla. Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (OR = 2.817, P < 0.001), only 0.236-fold risk in patients who sustained only mandible angle fracture (P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence of dental trauma is significantly related to the pattern and position of the maxillofacial fractures.

AB  - Abstract Aim Over the past several decades, there has been a growing research interest in the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This review aims to summarize evidence in support of this relationship, to discuss biological mechanisms that might explain it, and to explore the translational impact by examining evidence from trials of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of schizophrenia. Methods This narrative review of the literature summarizes evidence from observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and to discuss associated implications for treatment. Results Epidemiological evidence and animal models support a hypothesis of maternal immune activation during pregnancy, which increases the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. Several biomarker studies have found associations between classical pro-inflammatory cytokines and schizophrenia. The precise biological mechanisms by which inflammatory processes might contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain unclear, but likely include the actions of microglia and the complement system. Importantly, several trials provide evidence that certain anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents show beneficial effects in the treatment of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is a need for further precision-focused basic science and translational research. Conclusions Increasing our understanding of the role of inflammation in schizophrenia will enable novel opportunities for therapeutic and preventative interventions that are informed by the underlying pathogenesis of this complex disorder.
