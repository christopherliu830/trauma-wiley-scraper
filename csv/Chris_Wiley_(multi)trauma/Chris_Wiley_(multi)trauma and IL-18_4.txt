AB  - Summary Inflammation is an overall protective response and can be defined as a cellular and non specific immune response to irritation, injury, or infection leading to the local accumulation of leukocytes and fluid. In intensive farming conditions, fish are usually transported, sorted, vaccinated and subjected to stressful handling procedures which may potentially lead to local inflammation and affect the integrity of the spine. The present mini-review aims to introduce the reader in the field of spinal deformities in salmon, propose inflammation as a risk factor for spinal deformities and emphasize the need for conducting further research in the area having an integrated and multidisciplinary perspective.

AB  - Summary Mental illness exerts a major burden on human health, yet evidence-based treatments are rudimentary due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathologies. Clinical studies point to roles for the immune system in psychiatric diseases, while basic science has revealed that the brain has an active and multi-cellular resident immune system that interacts with peripheral immunity and impacts behavior. In this perspective, we highlight evidence of immune involvement in human psychiatric disease and review data from animal models that link immune signaling to neuronal function and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework for linking advances in basic neuroimmunology to their potential relevance for psychiatric diseases, based on the subtypes of immune responses defined in peripheral tissues. Our goal is to identify novel areas of focus for future basic and translational studies that may reveal the potential of the immune system for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses

AB  - Abstract Models of sepsis have been instructive in understanding the sequence of events in animals and, to an extent, in humans with sepsis. Events developing early in sepsis suggest that a hyperinflammatory state exists, accompanied by a buildup of oxidants in tissues reflective of a redox imbalance. Development of immunosuppression and degraded innate and adaptive immune responses are well-established complications of sepsis. In addition, there is robust activation of the complement system, which contributes to the harmful effects of sepsis. These events appear to be associated with development of multiorgan failure. The relevance of animal models of sepsis to human sepsis and the failure of human clinical trials are discussed, together with suggestions as to how clinical trial design might be improved.

AB  - This chapter presents a brief summary of the key pathways involved in the process of inflammation; of natural products as the source of compounds/drugs with anti-inflammatory activity for use in the treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune, and other immune-mediated diseases. It describes the mechanisms of induction and amplification of the key inflammatory events. Anti-inflammatory drugs, including these derived from natural products, combat inflammation by targeting one or many of the pathways. The different pathways discussed in the chapter are inflammation triggered by innate immune responses; inflammation triggered by adaptive immune responses; and cell signalling pathways involved in inflammation. Most natural products that have been used for medicinal purposes for their anti-inflammatory activity have originated from plants, terrestrial microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria, and marine animals. Technological advances have significantly improved the efficacy of isolation and purification of natural compounds from a crude extract of a natural product.

AB  - Mammals harbor a complex gut-associated microbiota, comprising bacteria that provide immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits to the host, and contribute to their well-being. However, dysregulation of the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, along with the associated mucosal immune response have a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, among others. In addition, outside the gut lumen, bacteria from microbiota are the causative agent of peritoneal inflammation, abdominal sepsis and systemic sepsis. Critical care interventions during sepsis by antibiotics induce dysbiosis and present acute and long-term poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss immunomodulatory effects of the microbial molecules and products, highlighting the role of Bacteroides fragilis, a human commensal with ambiguous interactions with the host. Moreover, we also address the impact of antibiotic treatment in sepsis outcome and discuss new insights for microbiota modulation.

AB  - Purpose In clinical conditions trauma is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of multiple organ failure after trauma Experimental design To have a detailed understanding of the neutrophil activation at primary stages after trauma, neutrophils are isolated from control and surgical trauma rats in this study. Extracted proteins are analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results A total of 2924 rat neutrophil proteins are identified in our analysis, of which 393 are found differentially regulated between control and trauma groups. By using functional pathways analysis of the 190 proteins up-regulated in surgical trauma, we found proteins related to transcription initiation and protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, among the 203 proteins down-regulated in surgical trauma we found enrichment for proteins of the immune response, proteasome degradation and actin cytoskeleton. Overall, enzyme prediction analysis revealed that regulated enzymes are directly involved in neutrophil apoptosis, directional migration and chemotaxis. Our observations are then confirmed by in silico protein?protein interaction analysis. Conclusions and clinical relevance Collectively, our results reveal that neutrophils drastically regulate their biochemical pathways after the early stages of surgical trauma, showing lower activity. This implies higher susceptibility of the trauma patients to infection and bystander tissues damage.

AB  - Abstract Hemopoiesis-stimulating activity of various recombinant human colony-stimulating factors (rhCSFs) has been studied in four different preclinical animal models. The CSFs used were erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CSF, granulocyte (G) CSF, interleukin (IL) 3, IL-1?, and mast cell growth factor (MGF) or stem cell factor (SCF). Emphasis was placed on effects induced by combination treatment with varied pairs of the factors. Dogs and primates were chosen because of evidence of efficacy from earlier studies with the single recombinant human factors alone. The animal models chosen were: 1) isovolemic hemodilution to a hematocrit of 10% (or 20%) of dogs, splenectomized at least three months before start of the study. Additionally, the animals had been primed with Epo (or Epo plus IL-3) on three days daily or five days every other day before hemodilution. 2) Total body irradiation (TBI) of dogs (2.4 Gy) followed by daily treatment with IL-1? (d1-7) plus Epo administered daily over three weeks. 3) TBI of rhesus monkeys (4.5 Gy) and daily treatment with IL-3 and GM-CSF over three weeks. 4) Treatment of healthy normal cynomolgus monkeys with various factor combinations over about two or three weeks. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Priming with Epo before blood loss (withdrawal) allows a strikingly enhanced recovery of hematocrit and other hematological parameters. Further evaluation of the role of concomitantly applied CSFs (e.g., IL-3, GM-CSF or G-CSF) on the restoration of immune functions would be desirable. 2) Single CSFs and preferentially factor combinations are valuable agents to reduce irradiation injury and to enhance recovery from bone marrow hypoplasia. 3) Treatment of healthy animals with selected CSF combinations results in a stronger hemopoietic stimulation than with single factors alone. Some particular combinations even stimulate platelet production, e.g., IL-3/GM-CSF, GM-CSF/Epo or G-CSF/IL-3. The results obtained indicate that stimulatory responses of hemopoiesis in normal animals cannot always be compared with the effects seen in compromised animals. It is assumed that the preclinical data obtained in compromised animals may perhaps more realistically reflect what is eventually to be expected in future clinical studies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - Midkine (MK) is a pleiotropic growth factor prominently expressed during embryogenesis but down-regulated to neglible levels in healthy adults. Many published studies have demonstrated striking MK overexpression compared with healthy controls in various pathologies, including ischaemia, inflammation, autoimmunity and, most notably, in many cancers. MK expression is detectable in biopsies of diseased, but not healthy, tissues. Significantly, because it is a soluble cytokine, elevated MK is readily apparent in the blood and other body fluids such as urine and CSF, making MK a relatively convenient, accessible, non-invasive and inexpensive biomarker for population screening and early disease detection. The first diagnostic tests that quantify MK are just now receiving regulatory clearance and entering the clinic. This review examines the current state of knowledge pertaining to MK as a biomarker and highlights promising indications and clinical settings where measuring MK could make a difference to patient treatment. I also raise outstanding questions about reported variants of MK as well as MK's bio-distribution in vivo. Answering these questions in future studies will enhance our understanding of the significance of measured MK levels in both patients and healthy subjects, and may reveal further opportunities for measuring MK to diagnose disease. MK has already proven to be a biomarker that can significantly improve detection, management and treatment of cancer, and there is significant promise for developing further MK-based diagnostics in the future.

AB  - Summary: There is compelling evidence that epithelial cells (ECs) at mucosal surfaces, beyond their role in creating a physical barrier, are integral components of innate and adaptive immunity. The capacity of these cells to license the functions of specific immune cell populations in the airway and gastrointestinal tract offers the prospect of novel therapeutic strategies to target multiple inflammatory diseases in which barrier immunity is dysregulated. In this review, we discuss the critical functions of EC-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 in the development and regulation of T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine-dependent immune responses. We first highlight recent data that have provided new insights into the factors that control expression of this triad of cytokines and their receptors. In addition, we review their proinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions in models of mucosal infection and inflammation. Lastly, we discuss new findings indicating that despite their diverse structural features and differential expression of their receptors, TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 cross-regulate one another and share overlapping properties that influence Th2 cytokine-dependent responses at mucosal sites.
