AB  - Structured Abstract Authors ? Segal GR, Schiffman PH, Tuncay OC Objective ? To elucidate possible treatment-related etiological factors ? such as, duration of treatment and apical displacement ? for external root resorption. Design ? Meta-analysis of the available English-language literature. Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria ? Papers with a sample size >10, fixed appliances, pre- and post-operative radiographs, and apical displacement recorded were included. History of trauma, prior root resorption and endodontic treatment were excluded. Appropriateness of these selections was tested with a ?funnel plot? analysis. Outcome Measure ? Correlations between root resorption, apical displacement, and treatment duration. Results ? Mean apical root resorption was strongly correlated with total apical displacement (r?=?0.822) and treatment duration (r?=?0.852). Conclusion ? The treatment-related causes of root resorption appear to be the total distance the apex had moved and the time it took.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Obesity during pregnancy is associated with meta-inflammation and an increased likelihood of clinical complications. Surgery results in intense, acute inflammatory responses in any individual. Because obese individuals exhibit constitutive inflammatory responses and high rates of Caesarian section, it is important to understand the impact of surgery in such populations. Whether more pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and/or counterbalancing changes in anti-inflammatory immune modulators occurs is unknown. Here we investigated innate immune capacity in vivo and in vitro in non-obese, term-pregnant controls versus healthy, term-pregnant obese women (Class II, BMI 35?40). Methods Systemic in vivo induction of eleven pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and acute phase proteins was assessed in plasma immediately prior to and again following Caesarian section surgery. Independently, innate immune capacity was examined by stimulating freshly isolated PBMC in vitro with a panel of defined PRR-ligands for TLR4, TLR8, TLR3, and RLR 24?h post-surgery. Results The kinetics and magnitude of the in vivo inflammatory responses examined were indistinguishable in the two populations across the broad range of biomarkers examined, despite the fact that obese women had higher baseline inflammatory status. Deliberate in vitro stimulation with a range of PRR ligands also elicited pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses that were indistinguishable between control and obese mothers. Conclusions Acute in vivo innate immune responses to C-section, as well as subsequent in vitro stimulation with a panel of microbial mimics, are not detectably altered in Class II obese women. The data argue that while Class II obesity is undesirable, it has minimal impact on the in vivo inflammatory response, or innate immunomodulatory capacity, in women selecting C-section.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purposes of this study were to investigate the occurrence and patterns of dental trauma in patients with single mandibular fracture and to evaluate the relationships between dental injury and fracture site of mandible. Materials and Methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 869 patients with mandibular fractures were registered. Only the patients with single mandibular fracture were included. The information and data collected included age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of mandibular fracture, and type of dental injury. Results Single mandibular fractures were sustained in 294 (33.8%) patients. Of these, 43.5% (128 patients) presented with associated dental injuries (509 injured teeth). The patients' male/female ratio was 2.46:1 (91 males and 37 females). Patients in 30?39 year age group possessed the highest risk of suffering dental trauma (odds ratio = 2.004, P = 0.014). Road traffic accidents were the most common mechanism of injury (54, 42.2%). Lower-anterior teeth were more often injured in patients with symphysis fracture (P < 0.001), and patients with condylar fracture more frequently sustained upper-posterior teeth injury (P < 0.001). Lower-posterior teeth injury was mostly found in patients with mandibular body fracture (P < 0.001) or angle fracture (P < 0.001). Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (odds ratio = 3.283, P < 0.001), and the risk was only 0.193-fold in patients who sustained only mandible angle fractures (odds ratio = 0.193, P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence and type of dental injury were significantly related to the fracture site of mandible.

AB  - Abstract Aim: This series of case reports evaluated the impact of adhesive crown?root fragment reattachment in periodontally healthy teeth suffering from crown?root fractures on various parameters of periodontal health over a time course of 2 years. Material and Methods: A total of 20 teeth with crown?root fractures in 18 periodontally healthy subjects were evaluated. After open-flap access, crown?root fragments were adhesively reattached to the root stub. In all cases, the vertical difference between the alveolar bone crest and the fracture line was 1?mm, i.e. violating the biological width. Subsequently, clinical attachment level (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP) and gingival index (GI) scores were recorded at 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively for the restored teeth as well as plaque index (PlI) and periodontal screening index (PSI) values for the whole dentition. Results: Two years after therapy, recorded CAL, PPD, BoP, GI, PlI and PSI scores revealed healthy periodontal conditions in 18 out of 20 treated teeth. Two teeth had suffered again from fragment fracture due to new traumata. Conclusions: Adhesive fragment reattachment in periodontally healthy teeth affected by crown?root fractures had no detrimental impact on periodontal health over a time course of 2 years.

AB  - Abstract While current injury criteria for the automotive industry are based on bone fracture, the majority of knee injuries suffered in collisions each year do not involve fracture of bone. Instead, clinical studies of traumatic joint injury often document early pain and development of chronic diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Previous studies suggest chronic disease can be initiated by cell death that occurs in articular cartilage during mechanical trauma to the joint. In the current investigation early necrosis of chondrocytes was investigated after blunt trauma to chondral explants. A non-ionic surfactant (P188) was explored as a potential tool for early intervention into the disease process, as this surfactant has been shown to repair damaged membranes in other cell lines. Three groups of adult bovine chondral explants were equilibrated for 48 h in culture media. Two groups were then loaded to 25 MPa in unconfined compression. Half the specimens in each group were incubated in media supplemented with 8 mg/ml P188 immediately after loading, while the other half was returned to standard media. At 1 and 24 h the percentages of live and dead cells in compressed and control groups were determined with a cell viability stain. At 1 h post-trauma, P188 incubated specimens had a significantly increased percentage of live cells in the superficial zone versus the no-P188 group. At 24 h the percentages of live cells in all three zones of the P188-treated explants were significantly greater than in the no treatment group. This study showed that P188 surfactant could help restore the integrity of cell membranes in cartilage damaged by blunt mechanical trauma. With the ability of P188 to ?save? chondrocytes from early necrotic death using in vitro chondral explants, its role in prevention of a post-traumatic osteo-arthritis in a diarthrodial joint should be further explored using in vivo animal models. ? 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.

AB  - Abstract Objective There is some speculation that an intact distal sphincter complex is of decisive importance for continence, although the external anal sphincter (EAS) is considered to be a single functional and anatomical entity. On trans-labial ultrasound (TLUS), the caudal slice at the level of the subcutaneous EAS is currently omitted from the diagnostic algorithm due to the prevalence of artefact at that level. Hence, we aim to determine the predictive value of assessment of the subcutaneous EAS for anal incontinence. Methods We analysed datasets of 463 women seen at our urogynaecological service in 2015. All underwent a standardized questionnaire including a St Mark's incontinence score (SMIS), clinical examination and 4D TLUS. Slices 1 to 7 were assessed and rated positive for a defect if the defect angle was >=30-degrees. Results While there was a highly significant association between all measures of anal incontinence (AI) and significant EAS trauma in slice 7, addition of the 7th slice to the existing 6-slice model did not improve the predictive value for AI. Conclusion As inclusion of the subcutaneous slice of the EAS on the TLUS does not seem to improve the predictive value of AI, the current methodology for EAS trauma on tomographic ultrasound can remain unchanged.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.

AB  - Background: Although nutrition therapy is favorably considered as an assistant therapeutic measure in critical illness, little data evaluate its role in gastrointestinal fistula patients with severe sepsis after an open abdomen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of early nutrition therapy in that population. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent open abdomen management for gastrointestinal fistula and severe sepsis from January 2001 to June 2009. Nutrition therapy, fistula, abdominal closure, and demographics were noted. Succus entericus reinfusion (SER) was performed for high-output volume or multiple fistulae. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether enteral nutrition (EN) was initiated within 14 days after admission. Delivery route of nutrients, mortality, complications, and time to abdominal closure were compared among groups. Results: Eighty-two patients were included. Fifty-six (68.3%) patients survived to discharge. Forty-one (50%) patients received SER. EN was initiated within 14 days in 36 patients, with a mean initiation time at 8.3 ± 3.4 days; 46 patients did not start any EN within 14 days (29.9 ± 20.9 days). The mean age, BMI, APACHE II score, and fistula characteristics were similar between groups. The abdominal closure was accomplished more rapidly in patients fed within 14 days (142.8 vs 184.5 days, P = .017), with decreased mortality (11.1% vs 47.8%, P < .001). Conclusions: Nutrition therapy plays an important role in the management of gastrointestinal fistula with severe sepsis. Early EN could be successfully delivered for that population, with improved mortality risk.

In the clinic, the treatment options for advanced HCC include surgery, radiotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, and so forth. In recent years, molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy have also made great progress, bringing new hope to patients with advanced HCC. In this study, therapeutic advances, current dilemma, and future directions of advanced HCC are reviewed, which might serve as a summary for clinicians and may stimulate future research.

AB  - Abstract These studies demonstrate that murine hippocampal slice cultures possess neural-immune elements that show responses parallel to comparable in vivo models of neural-immune activation. Using immunocytochemical techniques, this study characterized the phenotypes of specific glial elements and the expression of the cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1?), in the hippocampal dentate gyrus over a period of 10 days in vitro (DIV). Preparation of organotypic slice cultures of neonatal mouse hippocampus produced cellular damage including axotomy of afferent fibers within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This form of lesion-induced injury caused activation of neural-immune elements in the slice cultures. Staining with the microglial specific, biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia B4-isolectin revealed reactive microglia were most prevalent at 2 DIV and decreased in number from 4 to 10 DIV, whereas the initial population of resting microglia at 2 DIV increased approximately four-fold from 4 to 10 DIV. The presence of a round IL-1?-like immunophenotype closely paralleled the temporal and spatial distribution of the reactive form of microglia observed in the dentate gyrus. In addition, between 4 and 10 DIV, some IL-1?-like immunoreactive cells exhibited a stellate-like morphology with numerous branching processes, similar to resting microglia. At 2 DIV, astrocytes showed minimal labeling with antibodies directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), while from 4 to 10 DIV, a dramatic hypertrophic astrocytic response occurred, resulting in a gliotic scar forming over the entire dentate gyrus. We conclude that neural-immune activation in the hippocampal organotypic slice culture preparation closely parallels similar responses observed in vivo and thus slice cultures represent an excellent model for further studies of neural-immune interactions resulting from lesion-induced injury in the central nervous system.

AB  - Abstract??? Background/Aim:? There is little epidemiological research regarding dental trauma in Australia. Previous research has largely focused on specific sub-populations with data not necessarily applicable to a general rural Australian population. Studies from other countries have presented variable data and the relevance of their findings to the Australian setting is questionable. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, causes and presentation of dental trauma in a large rural centre in Australia. Materials and methods:? A retrospective analysis was performed of the dental records of 323 consecutive patients who had attended a private general dental practice in Bunbury, Western Australia following an injury to their teeth and/or mouths during the period from May 2000 to December 2005 (inclusive). Injuries were classified using the Andreasen system (1994). Data analysis was carried out using spss software and Chi-Square tests were performed with the level of significance set at 5%. Results:? There were 528 teeth injured and eight patients had only soft tissue injuries. Males (68.1%) significantly outnumbered females (31.9%) and the ages ranged from 10?months to 78?years. The highest number of injuries occurred in children and adolescents, specifically the 0- to 4-year age group followed by the 5- to 9-year age and 10- to 14-year age groups. Trauma was most frequently the result of falls, accidents while playing and participating in sports activities. Conclusions:? The maxillary central incisors were the most commonly injured teeth in both the primary and permanent dentitions. Uncomplicated crown fractures were the most common injury followed by luxations and subluxations. No significant differences in frequency were reported for the different days of the week, the different months or seasons of the year. Only one-third of the patients presented for dental treatment within 24?h of the injury while the remainder delayed seeking treatment for varying times up to 1?year.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if phenytoin protein binding and metabolism were altered in prepubescent pediatric patients within the first 10 days following severe, acute traumatic brain injury. Patients (n = 10) received phenytoin loading doses (15?20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance regimen (7 mg/kg/day) initiated within 12 hours of the loading dose. Phenytoin serum concentrations were measured serially on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 at 1, 6, and 12 hours. Time-invariant and time-variant Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetic models were fit to the unbound phenytoin concentration-time data (ADAPT II?). Albumin concentrations significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001) and were predictive of the phenytoin binding ratio (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.0001). The time-variant model provided a superior fit of the data in 7 patients with no difference between models in 3 patients. Rapid inhibition of metabolism (Vmaxbaseline = 2.82 ± 2.35 mg/kg/day) was observed initially following injury. This was followed by induction of metabolism as reflected by a Vmaxinduced of 20.79 ± 13.71 mg/kg/day, which was approximately twofold higher than reported values for nonstressed children. Children with severe, acute neurotrauma were found to have markedly altered protein binding and phenytoin metabolism.
