AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if phenytoin protein binding and metabolism were altered in prepubescent pediatric patients within the first 10 days following severe, acute traumatic brain injury. Patients (n = 10) received phenytoin loading doses (15?20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance regimen (7 mg/kg/day) initiated within 12 hours of the loading dose. Phenytoin serum concentrations were measured serially on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 at 1, 6, and 12 hours. Time-invariant and time-variant Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetic models were fit to the unbound phenytoin concentration-time data (ADAPT II?). Albumin concentrations significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001) and were predictive of the phenytoin binding ratio (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.0001). The time-variant model provided a superior fit of the data in 7 patients with no difference between models in 3 patients. Rapid inhibition of metabolism (Vmaxbaseline = 2.82 ± 2.35 mg/kg/day) was observed initially following injury. This was followed by induction of metabolism as reflected by a Vmaxinduced of 20.79 ± 13.71 mg/kg/day, which was approximately twofold higher than reported values for nonstressed children. Children with severe, acute neurotrauma were found to have markedly altered protein binding and phenytoin metabolism.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the incidence of spinal fractures and their outcomes in the elderly who fall from low-levels in a suburban county. Design Retrospective county-wide trauma registry review from 2004 to 2013. Setting Suburban county with regionalized trauma care consisting of 11 hospitals. Participants Adult trauma patients aged ≥65 years who were admitted after falling from <3 feet. Measurements Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Results Spinal fractures occurred in 18% of 4,202 older adult patients admitted following trauma over this 10-year time period, in the following distribution: 43% cervical spine, 5.7% thoracic, 4.9% lumbar spine, 36% sacrococcygeal, and 9.6% multiple spinal regions. As compared to non-spinal fracture patients, more spinal fracture patients went to acute/subacute rehabilitation (47% vs 34%, P < .001) and fewer were discharged home (21% vs 35%, P < .001). In-hospital mortality rate in spinal and non-spinal fracture patients was similar (8.5% vs 9.3%, P = .5). Conclusion Low-level falls often resulted in a spinal fracture at a variety of levels. Vigilance in evaluation of the entire spine in this population is suggested.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether a range of cytokines were detectable in the seminal plasma and urine of men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and nonspecific urethritis (NSU), and whether cytokine levels correlated with symptom severity in CP/CPPS. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 87 men participated, 33 with CP/CPPS, 31 with NSU, and 23 controls. Interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were measured in seminal plasma and first pass urine, and the results were correlated with scores for pain, urinary symptoms and quality-of-life impact using a validated symptom index, the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). RESULTS Seminal plasma levels of IL-8 were higher in men with CP/CPPS and NSU than in controls (P?<?0.001), and the levels correlated with NIH-CPSI symptom scores in men with CP/CPPS. There were no significant differences in urinary IL-8 levels in the three groups, and no significant differences in levels of the other cytokines in either semen or urine. CONCLUSION Semen IL-8 levels correlate with subjective symptoms in men with CP/CPPS. IL-8 might contribute to the pathophysiology of CP/CPPS and NSU, and elevated levels might be a useful marker of the condition.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the potential utility of cytokine and arachidonic acid metabolite levels in ED patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as a predictor of progression to severe sepsis. Methods: A prospective, observational study of test performance was performed using convenience samples of adult control subjects and admitted patients. The latter patients were identified in the ED as having signs of SIRS. Levels of cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites measured from specimens obtained in the ED were compared between groups and associated with the progression of sepsis within 24 hours in the SIRS patients. Results: There were 30 control patients and 29 SIRS patients. There were 8 SIRS subjects who progressed to severe sepsis within 24 hours using the following criteria (hypotension, n = 5; hypoperfusion, n = 1; and organ dysfunction, n = 2). Of the 21 SIRS subjects who did not progress to severe sepsis, 11 had resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours. There were no significant differences in mean mediator levels between the SIRS patients who progressed to severe sepsis and those who did not. Of the 11 patients with resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours, the mean interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was significantly lower than that for the patients who did not recover or who progressed at 24 hours (n = 18); 65.4 ± 49.1 vs 230 ±112 pg/mL, p = 0.001). Six of 15 subjects with IL-6 >150 pg/mL progressed to severe sepsis (p = NS). Using threshold values based on the range of levels for normals, the sensitivity of an abnormal marker for the development of severe sepsis within 24 hours varied from 50% to 87%, while the specificity varied from 11% to 84%. Conclusion: While mean levels were significantly elevated when compared with those of normal control subjects, they had limited ability to predict the subset of patients likely to progress to severe sepsis. However, initial low levels of cytokines may have exclusionary prognostic value. Prospective validation of the latter finding is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Background We aim to study the level of inflammatory cytokines in aqueous of post-vitrectomy eyes. Methods Aqueous samples were obtained from post-vitrectomy eyes that underwent cataract surgery. Samples from age-related cataract patients were also collected as controls. The concentrations of cytokines were measured by array-based multiplex sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system and microparticle-based multiplex cytokine assay. Results Eighteen post-vitrectomy eyes from 18 patients were included; all received one vitrectomy with gas injection for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The mean interval between vitrectomy and cataract surgery was 22.33?months (range 6 to 80). Primary results show that in post-vitrectomy eyes the levels of many cytokines, such as B-lymphocyte chemo-attractant, I-309, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, were higher than control. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were significantly elevated in post-vitrectomy eyes, even after the subjects were divided by their refractive state. Conclusions The concentrations of some cytokines were increased in the anterior chambers of post-vitrectomy eyes even a long time after vitreous surgery. This surge in post-operative cytokines might cause changing in the micro-environment of the anterior, and this might contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma or fasten the development of cataract in these eyes.

AB  - Abstract Retrospective studies of the relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and colorectal cancer recurrence are reviewed. Perioperative blood transfusion was associated with preoperative anemia, operations for rectal carcinoma, presence of tumor in the right colon, prolonged procedures, and copious blood loss. Control for variables related to blood transfusion and potentially affecting disease recurrence?blood loss, duration of surgery, and magnitude of the procedure?was notably absent from the majority of studies. None of the negative studies had sufficient numbers of both transfused and untransfused patients to reject the hypothesis that blood transfusion is associated with cancer recurrence with statistical validity. No concensus emerged regarding the significance of blood transfusion for the patient with colorectal cancer, and no recommendations concerning the use of blood are justified on the basis of these studies.

AB  - The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxfylline are associated with a number of clinical benefits. These include reduction in mortality in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants or suffer peritonitis. In infants with sepsis, a reduction in mortality has also been associated with pentoxyfylline administration. The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxyfylline, as well as its bronchodilator, diuretic and respiratory muscle stimulant effects suggest it may have a useful role in BPD. Interim analysis of a prophylactic trial suggests pentoxyfylline may reduce treatment requirements after the neonatal period and that, in established BPD, pentoxyfylline and dexamethasone may be of similar efficacy.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis The murine model has been used extensively to model and study human deafness. Technical difficulty in the surgical approach due to the small size of the tympanic bulla and a robust stapedial artery has limited its application for studies of cochlear implantation and electrical stimulation. We describe a minimally traumatic, stapedial artery?sparing approach to the round window that may be used to access the mouse cochlea for acute or chronic studies of implantation and stimulation. Study Design Animal model. Methods Fifteen C57BL6J mice were used to validate this approach. Auditory brainstem response threshold and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were obtained preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively to determine hearing preservation results. Results The approach provided excellent exposure for round-window implantation. Substantial hearing was preserved in all animals with a mean postimplantation auditory brainstem response threshold increase of 27.8 dB. Otoacoustic emissions were lost in subjects with the largest threshold shifts. Conclusions Residual hearing after cochlear implantation is a determinant of success both with standard cochlear implant electrodes and with electrodes designed to optimize hearing preservation. Here, we have preserved usable hearing after implantation of C57BL6J mice, an endogenous model of human presbycusia. The murine model may become a powerful tool to assay the effects of cochlear intervention in different genetic backgrounds. Laryngoscope, 123:E109?E115, 2013

AB  - Aim Cumulative adverse childhood experiences have long-term consequences and may manifest within and influence health, educational and psychosocial domains. The Princess Margaret Hospital Refugee Health Service (RHS) undertakes multidisciplinary screening of refugee children <16?years, allowing standardised identification of negative childhood experiences. Addition of the extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in 2014 aimed to augment psychological assessment of this cohort. Methods An audit of prospectively collected standardised RHS proformas, health records and initial and 6-month follow-up SDQs for new patients aged 2?16 years between August 2014 and January 2016 was undertaken. Wider refugee adverse childhood experiences (R-ACE) were also captured. Results Initial SDQ data were obtained from 204 patients (mean age 9.2 ± SD 4.4?years) with 143 follow-up SDQs available. One third (37.3%) had at least one psychological symptom identified based on initial screening proforma. Multiple R-ACE were disclosed with 126 of 201 (62.7%) experiencing ≥3. African ethnicity, age >10?years, separation anxiety on initial proforma and no formal parental education were associated with higher R-ACE. Initial SDQ results varied with age/ethnicity; however, peer problem scores were consistently elevated. Total difficulty SDQ scores did not capture psychopathology at expected frequencies. Improvement in follow-up SDQ results were appreciated for children aged 4?10 years. Most patients (80.2%) disclosed improvement in health status following RHS involvement. Conclusions Refugee children have complex backgrounds with exposure to multiple traumatic events. Comprehensive standardised health and psychological screening is recommended to target intervention. Further validation of culturally age-appropriate mental health screening tools in this diverse population is required.

AB  - Background Postoperative inflammation is a common consequence of surgery and the ensuing stress response. Local anesthetics have anti-inflammatory properties. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if LA administrated intraperitoneally perioperatively might inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines. Methods This was a, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrial.gov reg no: NCT02256228) in patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. Patients were randomized to receive: intraperitoneal ropivacaine (Group IPLA) or saline (Group P) perioperatively. Except for study drug, patients were treated similarly. At the end of surgery, a multi-port catheter was inserted intraperitoneally, and ropivacaine 2 mg/mL or 0.9% saline, 10 mL was injected intermittently every other hour during 72 hours postoperatively. Systemic expression of cytokines and plasma ropivacaine were determined before and 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. Stress response was measured by serum glucose, cortisol, and insulin. Results Forty patients were recruited, 20 in each group. There was no statistical significant difference in systemic cytokine between the groups at any time point. Serum cortisol was significantly lower in the IPLA group at 6 hours, median 103 nmol/L (IQR 53-250) compared to placebo, median 440 nmol/L (IQR 115-885), P = 0.023. Serum glucose and insulin were similar between the groups. Total and free serum concentrations of ropivacaine were well below toxic concentrations. Conclusion In this small study, perioperative intraperitoneal ropivacaine did not reduce the systemic inflammatory response associated with major abdominal surgery. Total and free ropivacaine concentrations were below known toxic concentrations in humans.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2009) 109, 911?922. Abstract Adrenal chromaffin cells synthesize and secrete catecholamines and neuropeptides that may regulate hormonal and paracrine signaling in stress and also during inflammation. The aim of our work was to study the role of the cytokine interleukin-1? (IL-1?) on catecholamine release and synthesis from primary cell cultures of human adrenal chromaffin cells. The effect of IL-1? on neuropeptide Y (NPY) release and the intracellular pathways involved in catecholamine release evoked by IL-1? and NPY were also investigated. We observed that IL-1? increases the release of NPY, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EP) from human chromaffin cells. Moreover, the immunoneutralization of released NPY inhibits catecholamine release evoked by IL-1?. Moreover, IL-1? regulates catecholamine synthesis as the inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase decreases IL-1?-evoked catecholamine release and the cytokine induces tyrosine hydroxylase Ser40 phosphorylation. Moreover, IL-1? induces catecholamine release by a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent mechanism, and by nitric oxide synthase activation. Furthermore, MAPK, protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and nitric oxide (NO) production are involved in catecholamine release evoked by NPY. Using human chromaffin cells, our data suggest that IL-1?, NPY, and nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to a regulatory loop between the immune and the adrenal systems, and this is relevant in pathological conditions such as infection, trauma, stress, or in hypertension.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

AB  - Summary. Objectives.? The aims of the present study were to investigate the type and prevalence of dental emergencies presenting at a teaching hospital paediatric emergency clinic in Trinidad, and to describe the socio-demographic factors related to the use of the service. Design and methods. ? The authors used a prospective study of consecutive dental patients presenting to a paediatric emergency clinic. Data recorded included type of presenting emergency and socio-demographic variables. Results.? Data were available for 309 participants; 47% were male and 53% female. The average age of the participants was 8·66 years (SD = 3·75 years; range = 1?16 years). Seventy-three per cent of the participants? parents were involved in manual work or unemployed, and 21% were in nonmanual/professional employment; the occupation was not known in 6% of cases. Caries-related problems accounted for 74% of emergencies. Dental trauma mostly affected the upper permanent incisor teeth, with concussion, subluxation and intrusion being the most common injuries. Conclusion.? Dental emergencies presenting to this university-based clinic were predominantly related to caries and trauma. The service was more frequently utilized by children in the mixed dentition stage, children from lower socioeconomic groups and those living in the local area. The frequency of caries-related problems indicates the need for more community-based preventive strategies, including encouraging greater attendance for routine dental care and dental health education. Strategies for oral health promotion should also be developed to prevent dental trauma.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a diverse pathologic process, defined as the formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and complex clinical condition involving proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide toxicity that produces a predictable pattern of progressive injury entailing neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination at the site of impact. The involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in exacerbation of SCI pathology is well documented. We have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor; LP) treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Immunohistochemical detection and real-time PCR analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1? (IL-1?) after SCI. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was detected 24 hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ED1-positive inflammatory infiltrates, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by 1 week after SCI relative to control. LP treatment attenuated the SCI-induced iNOS, TNFα, and IL-1? expression. LP also provided protection against SCI-induced tissue necrosis, neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, rats treated with LP scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI (19.13 ± 0.53) than did untreated rats (9.04 ± 1.22). This study therefore reports the beneficial effect of atorvastatin for the treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
