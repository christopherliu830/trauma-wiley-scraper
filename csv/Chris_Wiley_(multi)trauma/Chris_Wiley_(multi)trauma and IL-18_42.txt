AB  - Abstract This review covers the molecular mechanisms involved in hair cell and hearing losses which can result from trauma generated during the process of cochlear implantation and the contributions of both the intrinsic and extrinsic cell death signaling pathways in producing these trauma/inflammation induced losses. Application of soft surgical techniques to conserve hearing and protect auditory sensory cells during the process of cochlear implantation surgery and insertion of the electrode array during the process of cochlear implantation are reviewed and discussed. The role of drug therapy and mode of drug delivery for the conservation of a cochlear implant patient's residual hearing is presented and discussed. Anat Rec, 2012. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and complex clinical condition involving proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide toxicity that produces a predictable pattern of progressive injury entailing neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination at the site of impact. The involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in exacerbation of SCI pathology is well documented. We have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor; LP) treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Immunohistochemical detection and real-time PCR analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1? (IL-1?) after SCI. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was detected 24 hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ED1-positive inflammatory infiltrates, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by 1 week after SCI relative to control. LP treatment attenuated the SCI-induced iNOS, TNFα, and IL-1? expression. LP also provided protection against SCI-induced tissue necrosis, neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, rats treated with LP scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI (19.13 ± 0.53) than did untreated rats (9.04 ± 1.22). This study therefore reports the beneficial effect of atorvastatin for the treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary. Objectives.? The aims of the present study were to investigate the type and prevalence of dental emergencies presenting at a teaching hospital paediatric emergency clinic in Trinidad, and to describe the socio-demographic factors related to the use of the service. Design and methods. ? The authors used a prospective study of consecutive dental patients presenting to a paediatric emergency clinic. Data recorded included type of presenting emergency and socio-demographic variables. Results.? Data were available for 309 participants; 47% were male and 53% female. The average age of the participants was 8·66 years (SD = 3·75 years; range = 1?16 years). Seventy-three per cent of the participants? parents were involved in manual work or unemployed, and 21% were in nonmanual/professional employment; the occupation was not known in 6% of cases. Caries-related problems accounted for 74% of emergencies. Dental trauma mostly affected the upper permanent incisor teeth, with concussion, subluxation and intrusion being the most common injuries. Conclusion.? Dental emergencies presenting to this university-based clinic were predominantly related to caries and trauma. The service was more frequently utilized by children in the mixed dentition stage, children from lower socioeconomic groups and those living in the local area. The frequency of caries-related problems indicates the need for more community-based preventive strategies, including encouraging greater attendance for routine dental care and dental health education. Strategies for oral health promotion should also be developed to prevent dental trauma.

In addition, the number of new adult candidates on the waiting list increased 51% since 2004. The number of adult heart transplant survivors continued to increase, and in 2015, 29,172 recipients were living with heart transplants. Patient mortality following transplant has declined. The number of pediatric candidates and transplants performed also increased. New listings for pediatric heart transplants increased from 451 in 2004 to 644 in 2015. The number of pediatric heart transplants performed each year increased from 297 in 2004 to 460 in 2015. Among pediatric patients who underwent transplant in 2014, death occurred in 7.2% at 6 months and 9.6% at 1 year.

AB  - Abstract Background This study compares diamond burs and curettes by clinical, microbiological, biochemical and scanning electron microscopic parameters and treatment time data in the non-surgical periodontal treatment of patients with chronic periodontitis. Methods Two quadrants of each of the 12 patients received root planing with diamond burs, whereas the other two quadrants were treated with curettes. Clinical periodontal measurements were recorded at baseline and then 1, 3 and 6 months after completion of non-surgical periodontal treatment. Subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained at baseline and 1-month control. Twenty-one hopeless teeth received root planing with diamond burs or curettes or no treatment and then extracted for microscopic evaluations. Results Clinical periodontal parameters improved similarly with both treatment modalities. Microbiological analyses revealed similar findings for the bacterial load (16S gene copy numbers) and ratio of each bacterium to the total bacterial count at baseline and 1-month control. Cytokine levels in the gingival crevicular fluid samples exhibited differences between the two treatments. Scanning electron microscopic analyses indicated that diamond burs were better in terms of calculus removal and loss of tooth substance indices but roughness index values were better for curettes. Conclusions Diamond burs provide findings comparable with curettes in root planing.

AB  - Abstract To investigate ageing-associated changes in cellular immunity, we recruited three groups of healthy subjects based on SENIEUR protocol criteria. In addition, 10 subjects were randomly selected from each group to isolate their T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells; T cell proliferation after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. There were no marked differences in the absolute numbers of peripheral blood T cells, NK cells or B cells among the three groups (P?>?0.05). Also, no significant differences were noted in the numbers of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, or the CD4+/CD8+ ratios (P?>?0.05). After PHA stimulation, T cell proliferation was markedly increased, with the highest level in group C and the lowest level in group A (P?<?0.05). Cytokine-induced killer tumouricidal activities were also dramatically increased, with the highest activity in group C and the lowest activity in group A (P?<?0.05). Our findings suggest that the number of immune cells remains unchanged with advanced age. However, there is a trend for decreased cellular immunity with an increase in age.

AB  - Abstract Research suggests that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to attrit from longitudinal trauma studies than non-Hispanic Whites. Yet, little is known about how the loss of minority participants influences longitudinal findings as well as internal and external validity of study findings. Thus, the present study examined the effects of race/ethnicity on attrition in a longitudinal trauma study of women (minority = 223, non-Hispanic White or majority = 459) exposed to a campus shooting. Survival analyses were used to compare the attrition rates of minority participants to majority participants and assess the extent to which race/ethnicity, among other variables, predicted attrition. Minority participants were more likely to attrit than majority participants, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69, 95% CI [0.48, 0.99], even after adjusting for study variables. A main effect was also found for age, HR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.12]. Race/ethnicity did not interact with other study variables to influence attrition. The findings underscored the importance of assessing the effects of attrition on longitudinal findings and external validity.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation is usually the pathological consequence of skin trauma. And hypertrophic scars (HSs) frequently occur in people after being injured deeply. HSs are unusually considered as the result of tissue contraction and excessive extracellular matrix component deposition. Myofibroblasts, as the effector cells, mainly differentiated from fibroblasts, play the crucial role in the pathophysiology of HSs. A number of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of HS occurrence. Currently, with in-depth exploration and clinical research of HSs, various creative and effective treatments budded. In here, we summarize the progress in the molecular mechanism of HSs, and review the available biotherapeutic methods for their pathophysiological characteristics. Additionally, we further prospected that the comprehensive therapy may be more suitable for HS treatment.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of splenectomy on cellular immunity. We studied the cellular phenotype and type 1 [interferon-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and type 2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine-producing peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 22 healthy adults who had undergone post-traumatic splenectomy about 1 to 35 years ago. Splenectomy resulted in a long-term reduction of the percentage of CD4+CD45RA+ cells and a late increase of the percentage and absolute numbers of T-cell receptor ?/δ cells. Stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in normal IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells, indicating that the naïve cells were not anergic. Splenectomy also resulted in long-term priming of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. During the first 8 years, both type 1 and type 2 CD4+ T cells were primed to varying degrees. About 8 years later, the percentage of primed type 2 CD4+ T cells subsided, but that of type 1 CD4+ T cells, although decreased, remained detectable over a longer period. Priming of CD8+ T cells persisted throughout the study period. The long-term priming of type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which may result in partial impairment of T-cell functions, may explain reported defects of immune responses to recall antigens in splenectomized individuals. In addition, changes in the profile of primed CD4+ T cells with time may be clinically relevant to relapses in autoimmune thrombocytopenia after splenectomy.

AB  - Abstract Of all patients in a hospital environment, trauma patients may be particularly at risk for developing (device-related) pressure ulcers (PUs), because of their traumatic injuries, immobility, and exposure to immobilizing and medical devices. Studies on device-related PUs are scarce. With this study, the incidence and characteristics of PUs and the proportion of PUs that are related to devices in adult trauma patients with suspected spinal injury were described. From January?December 2013, 254 trauma patients were visited every 2 days for skin assessment. The overall incidence of PUs was 28·3% (n = 72/254 patients). The incidence of device-related PUs was 20·1% (n = 51), and 13% (n = 33) developed solely device-related PUs. We observed 145 PUs in total of which 60·7% were related to devices (88/145). Device-related PUs were detected 16 different locations on the front and back of the body. These results show that the incidence of PUs and the proportion of device-related PUs is very high in trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract??? Background/Aims:? The stability of immobilization devices varies from flexible to rigid, depending on the trauma. We evaluated the rigidity of various commonly used splints in vitro Material and Methods:? An acrylic resin model was used. The central incisors simulated injured teeth, with increased vertical and horizontal mobility. The lateral incisors and canines stimulated uninjured teeth. Tooth mobility was measured with the Periotest? device. Vertical and horizontal measurements were made before and after splinting, and the difference between values was defined as the splint effect. We evaluated 4 composite splints, 3 wire-composite splints, a titanium trauma splint, a titanium ring splint, a bracket splint, and 2 Schuchardt splints Results:? For all injured teeth and all splints, there was a significant splint effect for the vertical and horizontal dimensions (P?<?0.05). For injured teeth, the composite splints produced the largest changes in vertical tooth mobility; wire-composite splints 1 and 2, using orthodontic wires, produced the smallest vertical splint effects. For uninjured teeth, the Schuchardt 1 splint and the bracket splint produced the largest splint effects; wire-composite splints 1 and 2 produced only a slight change in tooth mobility. Composite splints 2 and 3 produced the largest horizontal splint effects for injured teeth, and the 4 composite splints produced the largest horizontal splint effects for uninjured teeth. The most horizontally flexible splints were the titanium trauma splint and wire-composite splints 1 and 2. Conclusions:? According to the current guidelines and within the limits of an in vitro study, it can be stated that flexible or semirigid splints such as the titanium trauma splint and wire-composite splints 1 and 2 are appropriate for splinting teeth with dislocation injuries and root fractures, whereas rigid splints such as wire-composite splint 3 and the titanium ring splint can be used to treat alveolar process fractures.

AB  - Abstract Garlic has a long history to be used for medicine and food purposes. Black garlic, the fermented product of fresh garlic, is considered with better biological activities, such as antioxidant activity, and is developed as an increasingly popular functional food. Polysaccharides are the major components of fresh and black garlic, and immunomodulatory activity is one major pharmacological effect of polysaccharides. Therefore, chemical characteristics and immunomodulatory effects of polysaccharides from fresh and black garlic are investigated and compared in vitro for the 1st time, in order to reveal their molecular and pharmacological differences. It is demonstrated that the molecular weights of polysaccharides from the 2 sources and molar ratios of monosaccharides after acid hydrolysis are greatly variant. The effects of polysaccharides from 2 sources on RAW 264.7 macrophages functions, including promotion of phagocytosis, release of NO, and expressions of several immune-related cytokines (including interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma), were different from each other. The results indicated that fresh garlic polysaccharide exhibited stronger immunomodulatory activities than that of black garlic. Moreover, it is revealed that fructan might be the bioactive component in garlic and it is indicated that during the fermentation treatment, fructan constituents of garlic has degraded, and basically no immunomodulatory effect can be found in black garlic polysaccharides.

AB  - Background The anterolateral thigh flap is a workhorse reconstructive flap. Versatility in design is a key strength but perforator anatomy can be variable. Inability to locate perforators prompts consideration of contralateral thigh exploration. However, such exploration would be futile if the absence of perforators proves symmetrical. This study assesses the symmetry of anterolateral thigh flap vasculature using computed tomography angiography (CTA). Methods A retrospective analysis of 20 bilateral thigh CTAs was performed. Each limb was assessed for number, course, location and size of perforators. Only vessels >0.5 mm in size at origin were included. Location was standardized between patients using perforator distance/thigh length ratio. Results were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results In each thigh, the average number of perforators was 3.58 and average perforator distance/thigh length ratio was 0.358?± 0.08. Between both limbs of the same patient, the mean difference in number of perforators was 0.55 (P = 0.002), and difference in average perforator size was 0.3 mm (P < 0.001). Average perforator location differed by a mean of 3% of thigh length (P < 0.001) between thighs. Conclusion While average vessel size and location appear similar, there does not appear to be symmetry in the number of perforators. Surgical exploration of the contralateral thigh in an absence of perforators should be considered. In patients where abnormal anatomy is expected, mapping with CTA could be considered to reduce morbidity associated with unsuccessful surgical exploration and dissection.

Here we describe a new in vitro model in which reproducible levels of injury are delivered by a punch device that produces 28 parallel cuts in individual wells of 96-well microplates. Cell loss is measured by LDH assay or quantitative fluorometric assay for ethidium homodimer staining. Glial cultures show cell death restricted to the initial injury site, whereas neuronal/glial cultures demonstrate substantial spread of cell loss over time. We used this model to examine the role of pH and NMDA receptors in delayed post-traumatic injury. NMDA receptor blockade by dizocilpine (MK-801) or treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against NMDAR1 was neuroprotective. Decreased cell death was observed under acidic conditions whereas increased extracellular pH was associated with increased, MK-801 sensitive cell loss. Advantages of our model include: reproducible trauma induction; rapid measurements of cell injury; and use of 96-well microplates which reduce time and cost. This model appears to be well-suited for the study of selected mechanisms of post-traumatic neuronal injury as well as for screening potential neuroprotective agents. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Abstract:? In the last ten years both analysts and neuroscientists have begun to challenge the analytic world to explore the analytic view of the mind in relation to knowledge emerging from the field of neuroscience. I find that ?in many ways it is Jung's understanding of the mind, the human condition, and the self, that is most compatible with the insights that are emerging from neuroscience today? (Wilkinson 2004, p. 84). In this paper I consider the insights that neuroscience has to offer us as we seek to work with those patients whose early experience has diminished their capacity to be ?in mind? and with it their capacity for reflective self-function, whose defences are dissociative, whose need has been to keep unbearable experience at bay, out of mind. I look first at dissociationist theory and its development, then focus on the insights to be gained from neuroscience with regard to early trauma and its effect on the encoding and recall of memory. Finally, I turn to the nature of cure and argue that hemispheric integration is the key to undoing dissociation and the prelude to individuation.
