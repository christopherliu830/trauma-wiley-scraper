AB  - Abstract:? In the last ten years both analysts and neuroscientists have begun to challenge the analytic world to explore the analytic view of the mind in relation to knowledge emerging from the field of neuroscience. I find that ?in many ways it is Jung's understanding of the mind, the human condition, and the self, that is most compatible with the insights that are emerging from neuroscience today? (Wilkinson 2004, p. 84). In this paper I consider the insights that neuroscience has to offer us as we seek to work with those patients whose early experience has diminished their capacity to be ?in mind? and with it their capacity for reflective self-function, whose defences are dissociative, whose need has been to keep unbearable experience at bay, out of mind. I look first at dissociationist theory and its development, then focus on the insights to be gained from neuroscience with regard to early trauma and its effect on the encoding and recall of memory. Finally, I turn to the nature of cure and argue that hemispheric integration is the key to undoing dissociation and the prelude to individuation.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric surgery. Emergent surgical airways in children carry a higher risk of complications compared with adults. These include injury to the airway, tube misplacement or dislodgment, and longer-term risks of subglottic stenosis. A cuffed tube in the trachea is the only ?definitive? airway, although temporary airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway or combined esophageal/tracheal tubes can provide initial airway control and oxygenation/ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. Younger children have a higher incidence of higher level cervical spine injuries. Burn-related injuries are much less common, but are a cause of significant morbidity and often lifelong disability. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population are parenteral nutrition supplementation, central venous catheter, deep sedation, and neuromuscular blockade.

AB  - Abstract Aims Functional asymmetry of pelvic floor innervation has been shown to exist in healthy subjects, and has been proposed to be a predictor of increased risk for fecal incontinence in case of trauma. However, this remains to be shown for different clinical conditions such as traumatic childbirth. Methods A conventional surface EMG system was used to assess the innervation of the external anal sphincter. A symmetry index was used to define the relative EMG amplitude asymmetry of the external anal sphincter between 0 (symmetric) and 1 (asymmetric). Three cohorts were studied: 40 nulliparous women in the third trimester (Study 1), 15 primiparous women within 6 months following vaginal delivery without clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (Study 2), and 50 women after childbirth-related third or fourth degree perineal tear 6?12 months postpartum (Study 3). Furthermore, all women underwent conventional anorectal manometry. Results Sixteen or forty nulliparous women reported signs of fecal incontinence; however, relative asymmetry was not correlated to symptom severity (P?=?0.345), and not to manometric measures (Study 1). In Study 2, Women who had suffered clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (P?=?0.07) tended to have a stronger association between incontinence and asymmetry. In Study 3, 19/50 women reported moderate to severe incontinence. Asymmetry and symptom severity were significantly correlated (P?<?0.001). Patients with incontinence had a significantly higher asymmetry score than their continent counterparts. Conclusion Functional asymmetry of anal sphincter innervation is significantly associated with incontinence symptoms, but only after childbirth-related sphincter injuries and therefore, should be regarded as an additional risk factor.

AB  - Abstract Background Patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy remain at increased risk for developing febrile neutropenia (FN). For this heterogeneous population, a biomarker based risk stratification of FN patients may be a useful clinical tool. We hypothesized that serum biomarkers during initial presentation of an FN event could be predictive of subsequent clinical outcome. Procedure Eighty-nine FN events from 36 non-consecutive subjects were analyzed. ?High-risk? FN criteria included prolonged hospitalization (≥7 days), admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or a microbiology confirmed bacteremia. Patients with ?low risk? FN had none of the above. Biomarkers measured during the first 2 days of FN hospitalization were analyzed and correlated with respective clinical outcome. Results Of the 89 FN events, 44 (49%) fulfilled pre-defined high-risk criteria and 45 (51%) were low-risk. Procalcitonin level (>0.11?ng/ml) was found to be associated with the high-risk FN outcome with sensitivity of 97%. With an increase in log scale by 1, the odds of being high-risk FN increased twofold. Hs-CRP >100?mg/L had sensitivity of 88% in predicting high-risk FN. The odds of a high-risk FN event increased by approximately 1.8-fold with an increase in the log scale of hs-CRP by 1 (10-fold). In univariate analysis, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were statistically significant and associated with high-risk FN. However, no statistically significant difference was found for IL-1α, sIL-2Ra, IL-3, or TNF-α. Conclusions Biomarkers with appropriate critical threshold values may be a useful clinical tool for appropriate risk stratification of children with FN.

AB  - Background The anterolateral thigh flap is a workhorse reconstructive flap. Versatility in design is a key strength but perforator anatomy can be variable. Inability to locate perforators prompts consideration of contralateral thigh exploration. However, such exploration would be futile if the absence of perforators proves symmetrical. This study assesses the symmetry of anterolateral thigh flap vasculature using computed tomography angiography (CTA). Methods A retrospective analysis of 20 bilateral thigh CTAs was performed. Each limb was assessed for number, course, location and size of perforators. Only vessels >0.5 mm in size at origin were included. Location was standardized between patients using perforator distance/thigh length ratio. Results were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results In each thigh, the average number of perforators was 3.58 and average perforator distance/thigh length ratio was 0.358?± 0.08. Between both limbs of the same patient, the mean difference in number of perforators was 0.55 (P = 0.002), and difference in average perforator size was 0.3 mm (P < 0.001). Average perforator location differed by a mean of 3% of thigh length (P < 0.001) between thighs. Conclusion While average vessel size and location appear similar, there does not appear to be symmetry in the number of perforators. Surgical exploration of the contralateral thigh in an absence of perforators should be considered. In patients where abnormal anatomy is expected, mapping with CTA could be considered to reduce morbidity associated with unsuccessful surgical exploration and dissection.

Cohen G, Campbell PM, Rossouw PE, Buschang PH Purpose??? To experimentally determine the effects of increased surgical trauma on the rates of tooth movement and apical root resorption. Two surgical techniques for rapid protraction of multi-rooted teeth in foxhound dogs immediately following premolar extraction were compared. Methods??? Split-mouth design to randomly assign two surgical techniques [periodontal ligament distraction (RAP side) and a modified form of dentoalveolar distraction (RAP+ side)] to the maxillary quadrants. First premolars were extracted, and second premolars were protracted 0.5?mm per day for 15?days using a custom made jack-screw distractor. Serial caliper and radiographic measurements were performed to quantify tooth movements and apical root resorption. Results??? Both techniques demonstrated significant movement of the crown and apex. The second premolar crowns were protracted significantly more on the RAP+ side (2.9?mm) than on the RAP (1.8?mm) side. The premolars on both sides demonstrated significant tipping (4.3 and 3.9 degrees for the RAP+ and RAP sides, respectively). The distal root apex showed almost twice as much apical root resorption than the mesial root apex, but resorption was limited (<0.16?mm) and not statistically different between sides. Conclusions??? Increased surgical trauma increased the rate and, ultimately, the amount of tooth movement. The heavy forces used to protract the teeth produced statistically, but not clinically, significant apical root resorption on the mesial and distal roots of the maxillary second premolars.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.

AB  - Summary Both vitiligo and alopecia areata (AA) are associated together, associated with other autoimmune diseases, and autoimmunity is one of the important theories in their etiology. Nail changes are a known association with AA, thus we hypothesized that nail changes can be found in vitiligo patients. On revising the literature, only two types of nail changes were described in association with vitiligo. Our aim was to study the frequency and types of nail changes among vitiligo patients in comparison with normal healthy volunteers. This multi-centric study was carried on 91 patients with vitiligo, as well as 91 normal healthy control subjects who were age- and sex-matched. Nails were examined for changes in nail plates as regards striations, texture, curvature, dystrophy, and pigmentation. The presence or absence of the thumb lunula was also reported. Nail changes were observed in 62 patients (68.1%) and 46 (50.5%) control subjects with a statistically significant difference (P = 0.016). Longitudinal ridging and absent lunula were significantly higher in patients than in the controls (P = 0.001 and 0.037, respectively). Other reported nail abnormalities in the current study included punctate leukonychia, pitting, flag sign, and Terry's nails. Awareness of this association will widen the clinician's perspective to carefully examine the nail changes in vitiligo patients and conversely examine patients with nail changes for vitiligo.

AB  - Abstract Concern about the use of nanomaterials has increased significantly in recent years due to potentially hazardous impacts on human health. Mast cells are critical for innate and adaptive immune responses, often modulating allergic and pathogenic conditions. Mast cells are well known to act in response to danger signals through a variety of receptors and pathways including IL-33 and the IL-1-like receptor ST2. Here, the involvement of mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis in pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) exposure are examined. Toxicological effects of MWCNTs are observed only in mice with a sufficient population of mast cells and are not observed when mast cells are absent or incapable of responding to IL-33. Our findings establish for the first time that mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis orchestrates adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to an engineered nanomaterial, giving insight into a previously unknown mechanism of toxicity. This novel mechanism of toxicity could be used for assessing the safety of engineered nanomaterials and provides a realistic therapeutic target for potential nanoparticle induced toxicities.

AB  - Objectives Research indicates that constructs relevant to social rank predict a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including mental defeat, alienation, and shame. However, no studies have yet explored a social rank view explicitly. Design This was a community-based study carried out online. Analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal over 6 months. Methods Participants were recruited online for a cross-sectional study (Study 1, n = 194) and a 6-month longitudinal study (Study 2, n = 81). Measures included self-report measures of PTSD symptoms (the Post-Traumatic Diagnostic Scale) and social rank (including measures of unfavourable social comparison, social defeat, and internal/external entrapment). Results Cross-sectional analysis showed that social defeat, but not other aspects of social rank, was independently predictive of a diagnosis of PTSD. Longitudinal analysis showed that greater social defeat at baseline predicted less improvement in PTSD symptoms, whereas greater reduction in social defeat over the 6-month follow-up predicted greater improvement in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions In addition to the implications for understanding the role of social (rather than individual mental) defeat in the aetiology of PTSD, interventions could usefully incorporate methods that either increase social status or else minimize the impact of low status (e.g., through the use of compassion-focused approaches). Practitioner points Clinical implications Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) status is related to social defeat independently of demographic characteristics and features of the trauma. Reduction in PTSD symptoms over 6 months is predicted by reduction in social defeat. The evidence supports the use of interventions that increase self-perceived status or minimize the impact of low status (such as compassion-focused approaches). Cautions or limitations Participants were recruited online and may not be representative of clinical samples. Measures, including diagnostic tools, were self-report rather than interview- or observation based. With only two time points in the longitudinal study, direction of causality cannot be determined.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the influence of sampling methods on culture results and selection of antimicrobials for treating infected wounds in dogs. Design Prospective study from January to July 2016. Setting Three private multispecialty referral centers. Animals Fifty-two client-owned dogs with infected wounds. Interventions Each wound was sampled for culture by 3 methods: swabbing prior to preparation (dirty swabs), swabbing after debridement and sterile lavage (clean swabs), and biopsy. Bacterial species and phenotypes were compared. Three clinicians unaware of patient, wound, and sampling information selected antimicrobial drugs based on culture and sensitivity reports. Antimicrobials were divided into class I, II, or III based on established guidelines. The number, highest class of antimicrobial chosen, and inter-investigator agreement were examined. Measurements and Main Results Identical populations of bacteria were isolated for all 3 sampling techniques in only 31% of wounds. Significantly fewer bacterial species were isolated from biopsy samples (1.87 bacterial species per wound ± 1.14) than from clean swab samples (2.29 ± 1.18; P = 0.009) but not dirty swab samples (2.29 ± 1.29; P = 0.06). The recovery frequency for gram-positive bacteria was lower for biopsy compared to either swabbing technique (P = 0.001 for both comparisons). No difference was observed between clean and dirty swabbing techniques for any parameter examined. Sampling technique did not affect the proportion of wounds with anaerobic, gram-negative, or multi-drug resistant bacteria. The number (P = 0.28) and highest class of antimicrobial (P = 0.9) selected per wound did not differ between the 3 sampling techniques (P = 0.28). Clinician agreement was 83?90% depending on sampling technique. Conclusion Although there were some differences in bacteria isolated from biopsy samples compared to swab samples from infected wounds, technique did not influence the number and highest class of antimicrobial selected by clinicians. Wound debridement prior to sampling by swabbing did not alter the number or type of bacteria isolated, nor the number or the highest class of antimicrobial selected by clinicians.

AB  - We sought to determine the international experience with the quadripolar diaphragm pacer system and to test two hypotheses: the incidence of pacer complications would be (1) increased among pediatric as compared to adult patients; and (2) highest among active pediatric patients with idiopathic congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Data were collected via a questionnaire coupled with the Atrotech Registry data for a total of 64 patients (35 children and 29 adults) from 14 countries. Thoracic implantation of electrodes and bilateral pacer use each occurred in 94% of all subjects. Tetraplegic (vs pediatric CCHS) patients were more typically paced 24 hours/day (P = 0.001). Pacing duration averaged 2.0 ± 1.0 years among children and 2.2 ± 1.1 years among adults. Infections occurred among 2.9% of surgical procedures, all in pediatric CCHS patients (vs pediatric tetraplegic patients, P = 0.01). The incidence of mechanical trauma was 3.8%, without significant differences among patient groups. The incidence of presumed electrode and receiver failure were 3.1% and 5.9%, respectively, with internal component failure greater among pediatric CCHS than pediatric tetraplegic patients (P < 0.01). Intermittent or absent function of 0?4 electrode combinations occurred among 19% of all patients, with increased frequency among pediatric CCHS than pediatric tetraplegic patients (P < 0.03). Complication- free successful pacing occurred in 60% of pediatric and 52% of adult patients. In all, 94 % of the pediatric and 86% of the adult patients paced successfully after the necessary intervention. Although pacer complications were not increased among pediatric as compared to adult patients, the incidence of complications was highest among the active pediatric patients with CCHS. Longitudinal study of these patients will provide invaluable information for modification and improvement of the quadripolar system.

AB  - Summary We conducted a multicentre study of 1844 patients from 42 Spanish intensive care units, and analysed the clinical characteristics of brain death, the use of ancillary testing, and the clinical decisions taken after the diagnosis of brain death. The main cause of brain death was intracerebral haemorrhage (769/1844, 42%), followed by traumatic brain injury (343/1844, 19%) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (257/1844, 14%). The diagnosis of brain death was made rapidly (50% in the first 24 h). Of those patients who went on to die, the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was ≤ 8/15 in 1146/1261 (91%) of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, traumatic brain injury or anoxic encephalopathy; the Hunt and Hess Scale was 4?5 in 207/251 (83%) of patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage; and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was ≥ 15 in 114/129 (89%) of patients with strokes. Brain death was diagnosed exclusively by clinical examination in 92/1844 (5%) of cases. Electroencephalography was the most frequently used ancillary test (1303/1752, 70.7%), followed by transcranial Doppler (652/1752, 37%). Organ donation took place in 70% of patients (1291/1844), with medical unsuitability (267/553, 48%) and family refusal (244/553, 13%) the main reasons for loss of potential donors. All life-sustaining measures were withdrawn in 413/553 of non-donors (75%).

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the causes of cardiac tamponade in children undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Method Patients who presented with other complaints but were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade based on clinical and echocardiographic findings between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Electrocardiography, telecardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Pericardiocentesis was performed percutaneously under continuous blood pressure and rhythm monitoring with echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Pericardial fluid was analyzed on hemography and biochemistry. Results Fourteen patients (six boys, eight girls; median age, 7 years) underwent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. At presentation, 78% had dyspnea, 56% chest pain, and 49% fever. All had cardiomegaly, and their cardiothoracic index was 0.56?0.72. Also, all patients had sinus tachycardia; 78%, low QRS voltage; 70%, ST-T changes; and 50% QRS alternans. On echocardiography the widest diameter of pericardial effusion was between 12?mm and 36?mm depth around the heart. The pericardial fluid was purulent in one, serohemorrhagic in seven, serofibrinous in two, and serous in four cases. Pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful in two patients, who underwent open surgical drainage, with no complications. Based on pericardial fluid characteristics and additional tests, cardiac tamponade was caused by an infection in five patients, hypothyroidism in two, familial Mediterranean fever in two, malignancy in one, acute rheumatic fever in one, collagen tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) in one, catheter placement-associated damage in one, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in one patient. Conclusion Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in children have varied causes, and early treatment is life saving.

AB  - Abstract Although transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been indicated for patients with high surgical risk, indications for or against the procedure become more difficult as vascular access becomes more proximal and/or invasive in order to accommodate patients with even higher risks. We compared preoperative factors including the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS) score with postoperative survival in 195 patients undergoing TAVI during 2.5 years (January 2010 to June 2012), when vascular access routes were developed from iliofemoral (IL/Fm access, n?=?149), axillo-clavicular, apical, and direct aortic approaches (alternative access, n?=?46). Logistic regression analyses showed that alternative access was associated with reduced 30-day survival (P?=?0.024), while high surgical risk (>15% in both EuroSCORE and STS score) was associated with reduced 1-year survival (P?=?0.046). Thus, patients treated via IL/Fm access had acceptable outcome regardless of preoperative risk levels while patients with low surgical risk (<15%) had favorable outcome irrespective of access route. Since the remaining patients with combined risk factors, high preoperative risk level (>15%) requiring alternative access, had a prohibitive risk in our experience, they might have been considered untreatable or not amenable even to TAVI and offered medical or alternative managements.

AB  - Abstract LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein with the ability to bind and transfer LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as cell wall compounds of other pathogenic bacteria. This soluble pattern-recognition molecule is present in high concentrations in serum and represents an important defense mechanism of the host. Regulation of the hepatic acute-phase response and its termination are important mechanisms for limiting systemic inflammatory activity of the host organism. We show here that TGF-?1, in a dose-dependent fashion, is able to inhibit LBP transcript accumulation and LBP protein synthesis induced by IL-6, IL-1? and dexamethasone in hepatoma cell lines. These data were confirmed employing primary human hepatocytes, where TGF-?1 also inhibited LBP protein synthesis. We identified and analyzed several Smad-binding sites (Smads are major regulatory elements of TGF-?1) within the LBP promoter, and found that one of them was active. We furthermore identified an AP-1-binding site clearly conferring inhibitory effects of TGF-?1 towards LBP promoter activity, shown by gel shift and promoter mutagenesis experiments. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel intervention strategies for the acute-phase response, sepsis, and septic shock.
