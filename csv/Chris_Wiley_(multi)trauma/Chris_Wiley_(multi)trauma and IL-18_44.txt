AB  - Abstract LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein with the ability to bind and transfer LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as cell wall compounds of other pathogenic bacteria. This soluble pattern-recognition molecule is present in high concentrations in serum and represents an important defense mechanism of the host. Regulation of the hepatic acute-phase response and its termination are important mechanisms for limiting systemic inflammatory activity of the host organism. We show here that TGF-?1, in a dose-dependent fashion, is able to inhibit LBP transcript accumulation and LBP protein synthesis induced by IL-6, IL-1? and dexamethasone in hepatoma cell lines. These data were confirmed employing primary human hepatocytes, where TGF-?1 also inhibited LBP protein synthesis. We identified and analyzed several Smad-binding sites (Smads are major regulatory elements of TGF-?1) within the LBP promoter, and found that one of them was active. We furthermore identified an AP-1-binding site clearly conferring inhibitory effects of TGF-?1 towards LBP promoter activity, shown by gel shift and promoter mutagenesis experiments. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel intervention strategies for the acute-phase response, sepsis, and septic shock.

AB  - Background and Objectives This study challenges the currently accepted treatment parameters of waiting 1 year following burn injury to treat the resultant scarring. It assesses the impact of treating burn and trauma wounds at less than 3 months of injury on scar formation, providing a new temporal paradigm to patients in the prevention and minimization of scar formation. Study Design/Materials and Methods This randomized clinical trial included 19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute burn injuries less than 3 months from injury. The treatment areas underwent three fractional ablative CO2 laser treatments at 8-week intervals. The primary outcomes were improvement in the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and photography. Secondary outcomes were optical coherence tomography (OCT), treatment time, immediate post-treatment response, and histology. Results Upon blinded evaluation, 100% of treatment areas were correctly identified when compared with control. MSS scores before and after treatment were totaled with an averaged sum of 13.33 per scar at baseline to 8.39 after treatment, a 63% average improvement versus control (P?<?0.001). Histology and OCT demonstrated a re-organization of the underlying skin structure. The average treatment time was 18?minutes. Immediate post-treatment responses were limited to mild-to-moderate erythema. Conclusions Early intervention with ablative fractional laser on acute traumatic wounds resulted in significant decrease of scar formation compared with untreated areas on the same wounds, providing an impactful new time course to treat severe burn and trauma injuries.

AB  - SUMMARY Glutamine is the most abundant amino-acid in the extra- and intracellular compartments of the human body, which accounts for over 50% of its free amino-acid content. Utilization of glutamine peptides is explicitly useful, resulting in a decrease in the number of postoperative infectious complications, period of hospitalization, and therapeutic costs. This article aims to study the effects of glutamine on systemic inflammatory response, morbidity, and mortality after esophagectomy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial was used. Following sealed-envelope block randomization, the patients were divided into two groups. Members of the glutamine group (group G) received glutamine (Dipeptiven, Fresenius) as continuous infusion for 6 hours at 0.5?g/kg for 3 days prior to, and 7 days following surgery; while patients of the control group were given placebo. We examined 30 patients in group G, and 25 patients as controls. In both patient groups, the levels of total protein, albumin, pre-albumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin, transferring-saturation, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lymphocte, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum lactate were determined prior to surgery (t0), directly after surgery (tu), following surgery on day 1 (t1), day 2 (t2), and day 7 (t7). For statistical analysis Mann?Whitney U test and chi-square test were used. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, male/female ratio, and SAPS II scores. Intensive care unit morbidity and mortality was similar in both groups (group G: 24 survivors/6 nonsurvivors; Control: 17 survivors/8 nonsurvivors; P= 0.607). Daily Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score did not differ significantly between the two groups. The observed inflammatory markers followed the pattern we described without significant difference. Based on our study, the glutamine supplementation that we used had no influence on morbidity, mortality, or postoperative inflammatory response after esophagectomy.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the emergence of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy as a treatment for high-grade, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Comparisons with various intravesical chemotherapeutic regimens have consistently demonstrated BCG complete response rates of 55?65% for papillary Ta or T1 tumors and 70?75% for carcinoma in situ (CIS). The innate immune system is utilized by BCG, specifically the T-helper (Th)-1 cytokine pathway. The results of large, randomized trials have confirmed the importance of three-week BCG maintenance in intermediate- and high-risk patients and suggest that the use of BCG may improve both cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival. Patients may be refractory or resistant to treatment, or experience intolerance due to side effects; therefore, newer treatments involving other cytokines are being developed and utilized.

AB  - Objective To compare indicators of systemic inflammatory response in the second trimester in women who developed pre-eclampsia with normal pregnancies. Design Prospective nested case control study derived from a cohort of 2190 pregnant women. Blood samples were obtained at 18 weeks of gestation. The following inflammatory parameters were measured: tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, IL-10, microCRP and tissue factor (TF). Setting Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Oslo, and Department of Medical Genetics, Ullevål University Hospital and Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aker University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Sample The cases were 71 women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia. The controls were 71 healthy, pregnant women matched for age, parity and first trimester body mass index (BMI). Methods Venous blood was drawn from fasting subjects into 5 mL test tubes containing EDTA. Samples were analysed for inflammatory parameters : IL-1-?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, PAI-1, TF (ELISA-technique) and CRP (latex-enhanced immunonephelometric assay), strictly according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Main outcome measures The matched case and control subjects were compared by the paired two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. All P values were two-tailed and P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results We found no differences in plasma concentrations of PAI-1, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, microCRP, TNF-α or TF at 18 weeks of gestation between women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia and matched control women. Conclusion In contrast to findings from women with overt pre-eclampsia, the present study indicates that there are no indications of intensified systemic inflammatory response at 18 weeks of gestation in women who later develop pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Abstract Effective host defense against bacterial invasion is characterized by the vigorous recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, which is dependent on the coordinated expression of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In this review, we present evidence indicating that both C-X-C and C-C chemokines are integral components of antibacterial host defense. Specifically, in vitro studies indicate that C-X-C chemokines [interleukin-8 (IL-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)] and the C-C chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α) augment the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and alveolar macrophages, respectively, to phagocytose and kill Escherichia coli. In addition, the intratracheal instillation of Klebsiella pneumoniae in CD-I mice results in time-dependent production of MIP-2 and MIP-1α, and the inhibition of MIP-2 bioactivity in vivo results in decreases in lung PMN influx, impaired bacterial clearance, and early mortality. Finally, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is also expressed within the lung during the evolution of Klebsiella pneumonia, and neutralization of IL-10 in vivo results in enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production, bacterial clearance, and increases in both short- and long-term survival. In conclusion, our studies indicate that specific chemokines are important mediators of leukocyte recruitment and/or activation in bacterial pneumonia and that the expression of these chemokines is regulated by endogenously produced IL-10.

AB  - Summary Adhesion molecules appear to play a pivotal role in tissue damage secondary to the inflammatory process. Besides neutrophiland endothelial-bound adhesion molecules, soluble forms have been detected in the circulating blood. They seem to be good markers of endothelial damage, but they may also have other biological functions. Plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules (sELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and granule membrane protein 140 (sGMP-140) were serially measured over 5 days by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 45 consecutive trauma patients. These received, by random allocation, only either hydroxyethylstarch solution 10% (mean molecular weight 200 000 daltons) (n = 15) or human albumin 20% (n = 15) for volume therapy. Another 15 patients without defined volume therapy received pentoxifylline continuously (1.2mg.kg-1.h-1). Measurements were carried out on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (baseline) and during the next 5 days. At baseline, plasma concentrations of all adhesion molecules were similar in all groups. In the hydroxyethyl starch group, sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) reaching normal values during the study period whereas the mean (SD) values increased in the pentoxifylline group (sELAM-1: 71.1 (16.7) to 91.6 (17.8) ng.ml-1) and the albumin group (sICAM-1: 400 (81) to 749 (101) ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sVCAM-1 increased outside the normal range only in the human albumin group (to 760 ± 69 ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sGMP-140 plasma concentration increased only in those receiving albumin (432 (85) to 550 (93) ng.ml-1) and this was significantly different to the other groups (p < 0.05). None of the other haemodynamic or laboratory factors could be correlated with plasma concentrations of the adhesion molecules. We conclude that colume therapy with hydroxyethyl starch resulted in a decrease in circulating adhesion molecules in our trauma patients. In contrast, volume therapy with albumin did not exert this effect. Continuous infusion of pentoxifylline did not have a beneficial modulating action on circulating adhesion molecules.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence?4 What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? The exact incidence of splenic injury during laparoscopic urologic procedures is not known; however, it is an uncommon occurrence. Also, the optimal treatment algorithm is not well delineated and the efficacy of successfully treating minor injuries to the spleen without resorting to splenectomy is not well described in the urologic literature. This study outlines the rate of splenic injury during a variety of laparoscopic urologic procedures and we outline a treatment algorithm that has been successfully employed in the management of these patients, which in all cases, did not lead to splenectomy. An important point is also that multiple adjunctive hemostatic measures should be used when a splenic injury is recognized and that a thorough search should ensue when suspicion of an occult splenic injury exists, as an unrecognized splenic injury may lead to severe post operative haemorrhagic complications. OBJECTIVE ??To evaluate incidence, risk factors for, and management of intraoperative splenic injury in our laparoscopic patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS ??All patients undergoing laparoscopic urological upper tract procedures at two institutions between January 2001 and April 2006 and January 2000 and December 2008, respectively, were retrospectively examined for complications. ??From these patients, those with intraoperative splenic injuries were selected and examined. ??Possible factors predisposing patients to splenic injury were evaluated and the management plan for each patient was analysed to identify optimal treatment efficacy. RESULTS ??Of 2620 patients undergoing upper tract urological laparoscopic surgery, 14 patients (0.5%) sustained splenic injury and underwent left-sided surgery, 13 via a transperitoneal approach. ??In 12 of the 14 patients, the splenic injury was recognized intraoperatively and all were effectively managed laparoscopically with a combination of argon beam coagulation, biological haemostatic agent FloSealTM (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA), and bio-absorbable Surgicel? (Johnson and Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA); none of these patients required splenectomy or developed any postoperative complications. ??In two patients, the splenic injury was not recognized intraoperatively; both patients presented with delayed haemorrhage necessitating open splenectomy in each instance. CONCLUSIONS ??Splenic injuries are uncommon during laparoscopic urological surgery, but when a significant splenic injury occurs, it can be effectively managed laparoscopically, using conservative measures, without need for splenectomy. ??If the splenic injury is not recognized intraoperatively, delayed haemorrhage is likely to occur necessitating emergent re-exploration and splenectomy. ??Prompt and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of splenic injury is critical for achieving a good outcome.

AB  - ABSTRACT Myofibroblasts (MFs), a contractile subset of fibroblasts, play a pivotal role in physiological wound healing and in the development of many fibroconnective disorders. The complex cytokine network regulating the function of MFs in joint stiffness is still poorly understood. In this in vitro study, we investigated the effect of the cytokine Interferon-gamma (IFN-?) on MFs isolated from human joint capsules. MFs were cultivated either in the presence of increasing concentrations of IFN-? alone or in combination with IFN-? neutralizing antibodies. Cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and mRNA gene expression of the MF markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I were analyzed in MF cultures. Contraction potential was analyzed in an established collagen gel contraction assay simulating the extracellular matrix. Using immunofluorescence staining, we could verify that MFs express IFN-?-receptor (R)-1 on their membrane. IFN-? decreased MF viability and significantly elevated the apoptosis rate in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-? down-regulated α-SMA and collagen type I mRNA expression which was associated with a diminished MF mediated contraction of the gel matrices. These effects were suppressed by simultaneous treatment of cells with a neutralizing IFN-? antibody. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the cytokine IFN-? is a crucial component of the regulatory network of capsule MFs. IFN-? notably influences the ability of MFs to contract collagen matrices by suppressing α-SMA gene expression. IFN-? is toxic for MFs in high concentrations and may negatively regulate the number of pro-fibrotic MFs during the healing process via induction of cell apoptosis. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract: Liver transplantation (LTx) in children currently offers long-term survival rates of more than 80%. Many causes for Tx failure have been identified. However, the incidence and impact of multi-organ system failure (MOSF) are, to date, unknown. Therefore, in this study the role of MOSF after LTx in children was investigated with regard to outcome. The data of 114 children (53 girls, 61 boys; median age 4.3?yr) after first LTx were evaluated retrospectively. The definition of MOSF, as used by Wilkinson et al. [Crit Care Med 1986: 14: 271?274], was modified with regard to age-adjusted values. The influence of MOSF on patient survival was investigated by Kaplan?Meier analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Thirty-one of 114 children with orthotopic LTx developed MOSF (involving two or more organs). In total, 18 children died (15.8%) during the hospitalization; 16 of these had MOSF. Mortality related to two-organ failure was 29.4% (n?=?5), to three-organ failure 78% (n?=?7), and to four-organ failure 80% (n?=?4). The highest mortality rates were observed in children with central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular failure, leading to a decreased probability of survival of 0.40 (p <?0.0001). Multi-variate analysis showed that CNS and cardiovascular failure were the most important risk factors for survival (p <?0.0001 and 0.056, respectively). Respiratory and renal failure, in univariate analysis, were significant contributors to poor survival, but had no statistically significant influence on outcome in multivariate analysis. Bone marrow insufficiency was found to have no influence on survival in either analysis. In multivariate analysis, the risk of development of MOSF was significantly increased by high numbers of transfused units of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), the absence of rejection episodes, or a high bilirubin level prior to Tx. Hence, MOSF is a major factor contributing to the death of children early after LTx. CNS and cardiovascular failure carried the highest risk for a poor outcome. Other risk factors associated with the development of MOSF were: numbers of transfused units of FFP, absence of rejection episodes, and a high pre-Tx bilirubin level.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of an Er:YAG laser to that of scaling and root planing for non-surgical periodontal treatment. Methods: Twenty patients with moderate to advanced periodontal destruction were treated under local anesthesia and the quadrants were randomly allocated in a split-mouth design to either Er:YAG laser using an energy level of 160 mJ/pulse and 10 Hz or scaling and root planing (SRP) using hand instruments. Clinical assessments of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL) were made prior to and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at each appointment and analyzed using darkfield microscopy for the presence of cocci, non-motile rods, motile rods, and spirochetes. Differences in clinical parameters and prevalence of bacterial species were analyzed using the paired t-test. Results: The PI remained nearly unchanged while a significant reduction of the GI occurred in both groups after 6 months (P ≤0.001, P ≤0.001, respectively). The mean value of BOP decreased in the laser group from 56% at baseline to 13% after 6 months (P ≤0.001) and in the SRP group from 52% at baseline to 23% after 6 months (P ≤0.001). The mean value of the PD decreased in the laser group from 4.9 ± 0.7 mm at baseline to 2.9 ± 0.6 mm after 6 months (P ≤0.001) and in the SRP group from 5.0 ± 0.6 mm at baseline to 3.4 ± 0.7 mm after 6 months (P ≤0.001). The mean value of the CAL decreased in the laser group from 6.3 ± 1.1 mm at baseline to 4.4 ± 1.0 mm after 6 months (P ≤0.001) and in the SRP group from 6.5 ± 1.0 mm at baseline to 5.5 ± 1.0 after 6 months (P ≤0.001). The reduction of the BOP score and the CAL improvement was significantly higher in the laser group than in the SRP group (P ≤0.05, P ≤0.001, respectively). Both groups showed a significant increase of cocci and non-motile rods and a decrease in the amount of motile rods and spirochetes. Conclusions: An Er:YAG laser may represent a suitable alternative for non-surgical periodontal treatment. J Periodontol 2001;72:361-367.

AB  - Abstract Quality indicators can be defined as ?specific and measurable elements of practice that can be used to assess the quality of care?. Surgical blood loss is one of the most significant perioperative predictors of patient outcome. Blood loss is a modifiable quality indicator for oncologic cancer surgery. Surgical oncologists need to alter their surgical technique to promote bloodless surgery and decrease the variability in reported blood loss and rates of blood transfusion. J. Surg.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated 1) trauma symptom changes following the implementation of a life skills intervention; 2) the relationship between demographic characteristics, cognitive functioning, life skill knowledge and changes in trauma symptoms; and 3) predictive factors of trauma symptoms during housing transitions. Participants (N?=?72) enrolled in intervention modules to increase residential stability (room and self-care, money management, nutrition management or safe community participation), completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, ACLS-2000 and a Practical Skills Test at baseline, post-intervention and 3 and 6 months later to examine differences in trauma symptoms and treatment outcomes. Trauma symptoms were highest at baseline and decreased significantly for most participants over time. For a subgroup of females experiencing abuse and individuals who were homeless less than 1 year, there was an increase in symptoms at 3 months post-intervention (highest rate of housing transition). This small convenience sample represents a limited geographic area. Replication of the study with larger groups for generalization, and further investigation into the specific impact of symptoms on function were recommended for future research.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of NHL has increased dramatically since at least the 1950s, and during this timeframe there has been a major increase in the use of blood transfusions, invasive surgical procedures and anesthesia, all of which can impact immune function. We evaluated these factors with NHL risk in a population-based study of 759 cases and 589 frequency-matched controls. Risk factor data were collected during in-person interviews. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for the matching factors. History of transfusion was associated with a 26% higher risk of NHL (95% CI 0.91?1.73), and the elevated risk was specific to transfusions first given 5?29 years before the reference date (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.08?2.62) and transfusions given for a medical condition (OR = 2.09; 95% CI 1.03?4.26). The total number of surgeries and dental procedures (OR = 1.53 for 26+ surgeries compared to 0?6; 95% CI 1.02?2.29) and to a lesser extent the total number of exposures to general or local/regional anesthesia (OR = 1.35 for 24+ times compared to 0?6; 95% CI 0.91?2.02) were positively associated with risk of NHL. Inclusion of transfusion and surgery or transfusion and anesthesia in the same model did not attenuate these associations. All results were broadly consistent for both DLBCL and follicular subtypes. Blood transfusions were associated with NHL risk, but appear to be a marker for underlying medical conditions. Multiple surgical procedures and/or repeated administration of anesthesia have not been previously reported to be associated with risk of NHL and these exposures warrant further evaluation.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:? The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in heart transplantation is to maximize safety and efficacy while minimizing morbidity and mortality. We now have numerous drug combinations, but few have been compared with each other. Aim:? To compare various immunosuppressive regimens assessing morbidity and mortality at one yr. Methods:? A total of 351 patients transplanted between 1989 and 2005 were included and grouped by immunosuppressive regimen into group 1 (n?=?52): Muronomab (OKT3) 10?d, cyclosporine (CSA), azathioprine (AZA), steroids; group 2 (n?=?193): OKT3 seven d, CSA, AZA, steroids; group 3 (n?=?22): OKT3 seven d, CSA, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids; and group 4 (n?=?84): interleukin-2 antagonists (IL-2), CSA, MMF, steroids. Results:? The incidence of acute graft failure and treated rejection was similar between groups (17% and 78% respectively). We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of infections (p?<?0.001), renal dysfunction (p?=?0.011) and in diabetes mellitus (p?=?0.023). There were no differences in survival at 30?d (97%), but differences were found at one yr (p?=?0.011). The multivariate analysis showed a strong association between mortality and infection (p?=?0.001) and between survival and the group 4 regimen (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? There are differences in survival at one yr of heart transplant patients depending on the immunosuppressive regimen used. The best combination was induction with IL-2 antagonists, followed by CSA, MMF and steroids.

AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
