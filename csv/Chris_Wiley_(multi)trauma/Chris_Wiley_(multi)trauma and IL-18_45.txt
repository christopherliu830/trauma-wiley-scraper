AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence?4 What?s known on the subject? and What does the study add? The exact incidence of splenic injury during laparoscopic urologic procedures is not known; however, it is an uncommon occurrence. Also, the optimal treatment algorithm is not well delineated and the efficacy of successfully treating minor injuries to the spleen without resorting to splenectomy is not well described in the urologic literature. This study outlines the rate of splenic injury during a variety of laparoscopic urologic procedures and we outline a treatment algorithm that has been successfully employed in the management of these patients, which in all cases, did not lead to splenectomy. An important point is also that multiple adjunctive hemostatic measures should be used when a splenic injury is recognized and that a thorough search should ensue when suspicion of an occult splenic injury exists, as an unrecognized splenic injury may lead to severe post operative haemorrhagic complications. OBJECTIVE ??To evaluate incidence, risk factors for, and management of intraoperative splenic injury in our laparoscopic patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS ??All patients undergoing laparoscopic urological upper tract procedures at two institutions between January 2001 and April 2006 and January 2000 and December 2008, respectively, were retrospectively examined for complications. ??From these patients, those with intraoperative splenic injuries were selected and examined. ??Possible factors predisposing patients to splenic injury were evaluated and the management plan for each patient was analysed to identify optimal treatment efficacy. RESULTS ??Of 2620 patients undergoing upper tract urological laparoscopic surgery, 14 patients (0.5%) sustained splenic injury and underwent left-sided surgery, 13 via a transperitoneal approach. ??In 12 of the 14 patients, the splenic injury was recognized intraoperatively and all were effectively managed laparoscopically with a combination of argon beam coagulation, biological haemostatic agent FloSealTM (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA), and bio-absorbable Surgicel? (Johnson and Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA); none of these patients required splenectomy or developed any postoperative complications. ??In two patients, the splenic injury was not recognized intraoperatively; both patients presented with delayed haemorrhage necessitating open splenectomy in each instance. CONCLUSIONS ??Splenic injuries are uncommon during laparoscopic urological surgery, but when a significant splenic injury occurs, it can be effectively managed laparoscopically, using conservative measures, without need for splenectomy. ??If the splenic injury is not recognized intraoperatively, delayed haemorrhage is likely to occur necessitating emergent re-exploration and splenectomy. ??Prompt and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of splenic injury is critical for achieving a good outcome.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of NHL has increased dramatically since at least the 1950s, and during this timeframe there has been a major increase in the use of blood transfusions, invasive surgical procedures and anesthesia, all of which can impact immune function. We evaluated these factors with NHL risk in a population-based study of 759 cases and 589 frequency-matched controls. Risk factor data were collected during in-person interviews. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for the matching factors. History of transfusion was associated with a 26% higher risk of NHL (95% CI 0.91?1.73), and the elevated risk was specific to transfusions first given 5?29 years before the reference date (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.08?2.62) and transfusions given for a medical condition (OR = 2.09; 95% CI 1.03?4.26). The total number of surgeries and dental procedures (OR = 1.53 for 26+ surgeries compared to 0?6; 95% CI 1.02?2.29) and to a lesser extent the total number of exposures to general or local/regional anesthesia (OR = 1.35 for 24+ times compared to 0?6; 95% CI 0.91?2.02) were positively associated with risk of NHL. Inclusion of transfusion and surgery or transfusion and anesthesia in the same model did not attenuate these associations. All results were broadly consistent for both DLBCL and follicular subtypes. Blood transfusions were associated with NHL risk, but appear to be a marker for underlying medical conditions. Multiple surgical procedures and/or repeated administration of anesthesia have not been previously reported to be associated with risk of NHL and these exposures warrant further evaluation.

AB  - Murder of a loved one typically has a tremendous impact on the family as a whole and on individual members. While it is true people often react in very similar ways following such a traumatic loss, they do not necessarily grieve in the same way or at the same time. Additionally, the murder may have a detrimental effect on the stability, developmental tasks, communication patterns, and role functioning of the family. This paper explores some of the many issues and challenges families must face in the aftermath of a murder.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:? The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in heart transplantation is to maximize safety and efficacy while minimizing morbidity and mortality. We now have numerous drug combinations, but few have been compared with each other. Aim:? To compare various immunosuppressive regimens assessing morbidity and mortality at one yr. Methods:? A total of 351 patients transplanted between 1989 and 2005 were included and grouped by immunosuppressive regimen into group 1 (n?=?52): Muronomab (OKT3) 10?d, cyclosporine (CSA), azathioprine (AZA), steroids; group 2 (n?=?193): OKT3 seven d, CSA, AZA, steroids; group 3 (n?=?22): OKT3 seven d, CSA, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids; and group 4 (n?=?84): interleukin-2 antagonists (IL-2), CSA, MMF, steroids. Results:? The incidence of acute graft failure and treated rejection was similar between groups (17% and 78% respectively). We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of infections (p?<?0.001), renal dysfunction (p?=?0.011) and in diabetes mellitus (p?=?0.023). There were no differences in survival at 30?d (97%), but differences were found at one yr (p?=?0.011). The multivariate analysis showed a strong association between mortality and infection (p?=?0.001) and between survival and the group 4 regimen (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? There are differences in survival at one yr of heart transplant patients depending on the immunosuppressive regimen used. The best combination was induction with IL-2 antagonists, followed by CSA, MMF and steroids.

AB  - Abstract Objective Since the initial description of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in the early 1900s, classification of this disease has been in flux. The goal of this manuscript is to review the existing literature and to revisit definitions and diagnostic criteria for AgP. Study analysis An extensive literature search was performed that included databases from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Of 4930 articles reviewed, 4737 were eliminated. Criteria for elimination included; age > 30 years old, abstracts, review articles, absence of controls, fewer than; a) 200 subjects for genetic studies, and b) 20 subjects for other studies. Studies satisfying the entrance criteria were included in tables developed for AgP (localized and generalized), in areas related to epidemiology, microbial, host and genetic analyses. The highest rank was given to studies that were; a) case controlled or cohort, b) assessed at more than one time-point, c) assessed for more than one factor (microbial or host), and at multiple sites. Results Epidemiologic studies provided insight into ethnic and societal factors affecting AgP. DNA analysis of microbes showed some consistency but significant variability. Host factor analysis was less consistent. Many genetic studies were conducted but few had either sufficient power or looked at multiple genes in AgP. Conclusions Conflicting data resulted for several reasons; 1) the classification was too broad, 2) the disease (AgP) was not studied from its inception, at differing time points (temporal), and at different locations (topographic). New technologic advances coupled with a more delimiting definition of disease will allow for genetic, host and microbial factor analyses in an unbiased manner. As such we predict that progress can be made in identifying a robust group of genetic, host, and microbial risk-markers associated with periodontal disease that can improve diagnostic capability in disease associated with juveniles, adolescents, and post-adolescent individuals.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adversity early in life can disrupt the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes and increase risk for negative health outcomes. The interplay between these axes and the environment is complex, and understanding needs to be advanced by the investigation of the multiple hormonal relationships underlying these processes. The current study examined basal hormonal associations between morning levels of cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone in a cohort of adolescents (mean age 15.56 years). The moderating influence of childhood adversity was also examined, as indexed by self-reported trauma (at mean age 14.91), and observed maternal aggressive parenting (at mean age 12.41). Between-person regressions revealed significant associations between hormones that were moderated by both measures of adversity. In females, all hormones positively covaried, but also interacted with adversity, such that positive covariation was typically only present when levels of trauma and/or aggressive parenting were low. In males, hormonal associations and interactions were less evident; however, interactions were detected for cortisol-testosterone ? positively covarying at high levels of aggressive parenting but negatively covarying at low levels ? and DHEA-cortisol ? similarly positively covarying at high levels of parental aggression. These results demonstrate associations between adrenal and gonadal hormones and the moderating role of adversity, which is likely driven by feedback mechanisms, or cross-talk, between the axes. These findings suggest that hormonal changes may be the pathway through which early life adversity alters physiology and increases health risks, but does so differentially in the sexes; however further study is necessary to establish causation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience. Methods Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24 months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) subscores respectively. Results In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P?<?0.001, cluster size?>?20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group and three CAPS subscores. Discussion These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.

AB  - ABSTRACT A mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal content injection (CCI) was developed with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the mechanism of sepsis. This model has a similar survival pattern to the conventional model with the added benefits of ability to vary the severity of sepsis and greater consistency. Administration of 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT) to inhibit indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in mice with CCI-induced sepsis increased the survival rate and tended to up-regulate IL-10/IL-12 serum concentrations. The effectiveness of 1-MT was confirmed by increases in IL-10 over IL-12 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) treated with LPS and 1-MT and a superior survival rate 24 hr after injection of these double treated BMDCs in the CCI-induced sepsis model. Therefore, CCI is both a useful and reliable technique for investigating polymicrobial sepsis. The present findings using this newly developed model suggest that inhibition of IDO alleviates the severity of polymicrobial sepsis and modulates the immune response even in cases of severe systemic septic inflammation.

Those with self-reported chronic headache within the last month and/or year were invited to an interview and examination by a neurological resident. The criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) were applied. The questionnaire response rate was 71%, and the participation rate of the interview was 74%. Of the 633 participants, 298 had a secondary chronic headache. The 1-year prevalence of secondary chronic headache was 2.14%, i.e. chronic posttraumatic headache 0.21%, chronic headache attributed to whiplash injury 0.17%, post-craniotomy headache 0.02%, medication-overuse headache (MOH) 1.72%, cervicogenic headache 0.17%, headache attributed to chronic rhinosinusitis 0.33% and miscellaneous headaches 0.04%. The majority of those with ICHD-II-defined secondary chronic headache had MOH, while about one-third had other secondary headaches often in combination with MOH.

AB  - Abstract Behcet?s disease (BD) is thought to be caused by multiple genetic, environmental and immunological factors, one of the most prominent being the strong association with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-Bw51, an HLA-Bw4-associated allele. We examined the presence/absence of 14 killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their ligands in 134 Turkish individuals with BD and compared the results with those of 154 ethnically matched controls. Although KIR3DL1 with its ligand (HLA-Bw4) was significantly increased in the patients with BD (P?=?0.0003), this no longer applied when the patients and controls were categorised by HLA-Bw51 status. Thus, no association was identified between presence or absence of any of the 14 KIR genes studied and BD. In addition, we did not find any associations of KIR with various manifestations of the disease nor with gender or age of onset.

AB  - Background Exacerbation of cutaneous wound infections and delayed wound closure are frequent complications seen in alcohol exposed subjects who sustain injuries. We previously reported that acute alcohol exposure alters the early dermal inflammatory phase of wound healing and also several parameters of the proliferative wound healing phase in wounds from ethanol (EtOH)-treated mice for several days or weeks after EtOH exposure. Hence, it is likely that the cumulative defects arising in the early phases of the wound healing process directly contribute to the increased complications observed in intoxicated patients at the time of injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal EtOH (2.2 g/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) EtOH using our episodic binge EtOH exposure protocol (3 days EtOH, 4 days off, 3 days EtOH) to yield a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 300 mg/dl at the time of wounding. Mice were subjected to six 3 mm full-thickness dorsal wounds and immediately treated topically with 10 ?l of sterile saline (control) or diluted Staphylococcus aureus corresponding to 1 ? 104 CFU/wound. Wounds were harvested at 24 hours post injury to evaluate wound area, neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, and the protein levels of cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1?, and IL-10, and chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and MIP-1α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC). The abundance and localization of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and the kallikrein epidermal proteases (KLK5 and KLK7) were also determined. Results Compared to control mice, EtOH-treated mice exhibited delayed wound closure, decreased macrophage accumulation, and impaired production of MIP-1α. Furthermore, skin from EtOH-treated mice demonstrated a reduction in the abundance of epidermal CRAMP and KLK7. Conclusions These findings suggest that EtOH exposure hinders several distinct components of the innate immune response, including phagocyte recruitment and chemokine/cytokine and AMP production. Together, these effects likely contribute to delayed wound closure and enhanced infection severity observed in intoxicated patients.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Dental trauma in school populations has a high frequency and school teachers are often close to the place where such injuries occur. However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia. Materials and Methods A multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management. Results The response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers? education level. Conclusions The knowledge of school teachers in Colombia about emergency dental trauma management is inadequate. The findings strongly suggest a need for an education strategy with the involvement of the government, dentistry schools and private organizations.

AB  - Abstract The complexity of providing adequate care after radiation exposure has drawn increasing attention. While most therapeutic development has focused on improving survival at lethal radiation doses, acute hematopoietic syndrome (AHS) occurs at substantially lower exposures. Thus, it is likely that a large proportion of such a radiation-exposed population will manifest AHS of variable degree and that the medical and socioeconomic costs of AHS will accrue. Here, we examined the potential of rBPI21 (opebacan), used without supportive care, to accelerate hematopoietic recovery after radiation where expected survival was substantial (42%-75%) at 30 days. rBPI21 administration was associated with accelerated recovery of hematopoietic precursors and normal marrow cellularity, with increases in megakaryocyte numbers particularly marked. This translated into attaining normal trilineage peripheral blood counts 2-3 weeks earlier than controls. Elevations of hematopoietic growth factors observed in plasma and the marrow microenvironment suggest the mechanism is likely multifactorial and not confined to known endotoxin-neutralizing and cytokine downmodulating activities of rBPI21. These observations deserve further exploration in radiation models and other settings where inadequate hematopoiesis is a prominent feature. These experiments also model the potential of therapeutics to limit the allocation of scarce resources after catastrophic exposures as an endpoint independent of lethality mitigation.

AB  - Summary Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) remains an important medical challenge worldwide, contributing to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. Prompt and appropriate management is essential if we are to improve outcomes and reduce substandard care that may result in adverse consequences. This review describes the current understanding of the pathophysiological aspects of MOH together with the principles of transfusion and haemostatic therapy, with emphasis on a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. We also highlight the current lack of evidence available from randomized controlled trials to inform best practice and the need to prioritize research in this key clinical area.
