AB  - The hydrolytic stability of composite repairs is a desirable property. In the present study, the composite repair microtensile bond strength, failure mode distribution, and nanoleakage occurrence before and after thermocycling were evaluated. Standardized, 1-month-old composite substrates were roughened, cleaned, and randomly assigned to seven groups according to the intermediate agent applied. Resin-based, silane-based, and combined silane/adhesive coupling agents were investigated. The same resin composite as the substrate was used for repair. For each group, repaired samples were wet stored for 24?h (37°C) or thermocycled (5,000 cycles, 5?55°C). Failure mode and silver nitrate penetration were examined by stereomicroscopy. Intermediate agent, experimental condition, and their interaction were significant factors. Hydrophobic flowable composites resulted in statistically higher repair strengths, lower occurrence of adhesive failures, and good quality interfacial coupling without any silver uptake in both conditions. Light-curing, hydrophilic resin monomer-based intermediate agents, although not affected by thermocycling, showed a more pronounced silver penetration. The composite repair strength of a self-curing silane/adhesive agent was significantly affected by thermal stresses, despite the absence of silver uptake. A prehydrolized silane agent recorded the lowest repair strength, with minimal or no evidence of interfacial silver impregnation after thermocycling. In conclusion, flowability and hydrophobic nature can be considered important properties when selecting intermediate agents for composite repair.

AB  - Abstract: Background. Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after living lobar lung transplantation (LT). Low levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on peripheral blood monocytes, have been demonstrated to correlate with risk of infection in surgical, trauma, and adult transplant patients. In addition, interleukin (IL)-10 has been shown to be a negative regulator of HLA-DR expression. This study investigates whether HLA-DR expression and serum IL-10 levels correlate with the development of pneumonia after pediatric LT. Methods. Thirteen LT recipients were prospectively monitored with blood samples obtained pre-LT (baseline) and post-LT weeks 1?4. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HLA-DR on CD14+ monocytes was measured by flow cytometry. IL-10 levels were determined by ELISA from frozen serum collected at the same time points as monocyte HLA-DR expression. Correlates of pneumonia were abstracted from the medical record. Results. Monocyte HLA-DR expression declined in 11 of 13 patients in the first week post-LT. Two patients without an initial decline and four others whose HLA-DR expression recovered by week 2 post-LT, did not develop pneumonia or other infection or rejection. Pneumonia was observed in seven patients, six of whom failed to recover their monocyte HLA-DR expression by 2 weeks post-LT. Six of seven patients with pneumonia recovered, and one patient died of aspergillosis. During weeks 1?4, a statistically significant difference was seen in the profile of mean monocyte HLA-DR expression levels, analyzed as percent of baseline, between the patients with and without pneumonia (P=0.002). The greatest difference between groups over time was seen from post-LT weeks 1?2 (P=0.003). In addition, when comparing the values at each week, a significant difference was seen between the two groups at post-LT week 2 (P=0.006) and week 4 (P=0.05). Analysis of IL-10 concentrations revealed that the overall difference between the groups (patients with and without pneumonia) was statistically significant (P=0.014), with a paradoxical positive correlation between HLA-DR expression at post-LT week 4 and IL-10 concentrations. Conclusions. Persistent low monocyte HLA-DR expression was associated with the risk of post-LT pneumonia in these patients. This measurement may be useful for monitoring risk of infection and stratifying patients into higher and lower risk groups. Increased IL-10 levels may be protective for infection in this group of patients. At present it is unknown whether the predictive power of HLA-DR expression is indicative of a global defect in monocytic function or a specific abnormality.

AB  - Summary Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) remains an important medical challenge worldwide, contributing to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. Prompt and appropriate management is essential if we are to improve outcomes and reduce substandard care that may result in adverse consequences. This review describes the current understanding of the pathophysiological aspects of MOH together with the principles of transfusion and haemostatic therapy, with emphasis on a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. We also highlight the current lack of evidence available from randomized controlled trials to inform best practice and the need to prioritize research in this key clinical area.

AB  - Abstract: steopetrosis is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by lack of osteoclast function. Osteopetrosis is found spontaneously in most mammalian species and many transgenic animals have been created, but so far no animal model has been found that genetically corresponds to human malignant autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. The only curative treatment for malignant osteopetrosis is bone marrow transplantation. A review of the literature and preliminary data from IBMTR shows that infants transplanted with marrow from an HLA-identical sibling or unrelated volunteer donor have an actuarian five-year survival with a functioning graft of 50?70%, while those transplanted with a T-cell-depleted mismatched marrow have a very poor survival of only about 10%.

The present ?viewpoint? article will discuss how the prothrombotic state in HF may be perpetuated by a chronic inflammatory state that is maladaptive. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that thrombogenesis and endothelial (dys)function can be intimately linked to inflammation in HF.

AB  - Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) represent a spectrum of diseases characterized by extensive rapidly progressive necrosis that may involve the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia or muscle. Their progress is extremely fast, leading often to sepsis and septic shock that ends up in multiple organ failure with abrupt and high mortality. A variety of classification systems have been developed based on parameters such as anatomic location of the disease or microbiology. There are a number of factors that predispose to the spread of these soft tissue infections, such as delays in recognition, immune suppression, diabetes mellitus and advanced age. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics tends to mask the severity of the underlying infection, modulates the clinical presentation, and even delays hospital admission. The most important factor affecting outcome in NSTI is early diagnosis and aggressive radical surgical treatment. The medical records of 13 patients who had been treated for NSTI from 1996 to 2005 were reviewed, retrospectively. There were eight men (61.5%) and five (38.5%) women. Mean age was 56?years (range 27?73). Seven cases of infection involved the perineal region (54%), two the lower limb, one the upper limb and three the abdominal wall/trunk. The most common associated comorbidity was diabetes mellitus in five patients (38.5%). A single organism was identified in two (15%) and multiple organisms in 11 (85%) patients. Necrotizing aponeurositis Type I was the most common of the polymicrobial necrotizing infections. Overall survival was 85%, and the mean hospital stay for survivors was 35 days (range 17?92).

AB  - Background and purpose:? Interleukin-1beta (IL-1?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are involved in inflammatory responses during large vessel occlusion in animal models. The aim of this study was to investigate the intrathecal levels of cytokines in patients with acute small infarcts. Methods:? Forty patients with acute minor stroke and 32 non-stroke patients (including 29 age- and gender-matched subjects) who received operations with spinal anesthesia were studied prospectively and underwent measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-1? and IL-6 levels. Results:? After an age- and gender-matched analysis of 58 patients (29 pairs), the mean intrathecal levels of IL-1? were 0.80?pg/ml in patients with small infarcts and 0.59?pg/ml in non-stroke patients (P?<?0.0001). In addition, the mean CSF levels of IL-6 were 21.54?pg/ml and 7.52?pg/ml in the stroke and control groups, respectively (P?=?0.38). These results were consistent with the data without matching. The CSF levels of IL-1? in the 40 stroke patients were significantly higher than in the 32 non-stroke controls (P?<?0.0001). Conclusions:? The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1?, but not IL-6, remained elevated in the CSF of patients in the acute stage of small infarcts.

AB  - The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is anendotoxin-binding neutrophil leukocyte-granule protein withantibacterial and anti-endotoxin properties. A recombinant form of BPI(rBPI21) has been developed and is being tested as atherapeutic agent to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections andexposure to Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. BPI is also a targetantigen of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). BPI-ANCAare present in cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis,and primary sclerosing cholangitis; presence of BPI-ANCA appearsassociated with a higher inflammatory disease activity and greaterorgan damage. BPI-ANCA as well as ANCA directed at otherneutrophil-granule proteins may exacerbate inflammation by nonspecificeffects of extracellular and cell-associated immune complexes. BPI-ANCAmay further worsen inflammation by reducing the ability of BPI topromote clearance of Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial-associatedendotoxin.

AB  - Introduction: Much attention has been given to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws, concomitant with a history of bisphosphonate usage, particularly regarding inciting dental procedures. This report describes a case of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the hard palate after the harvesting of a subepithelial connective tissue (CT) graft for treatment of gingival recession (GR) in the mandible. Case Presentation: A 60-year-old female sought periodontal therapy for GR. Her medical history revealed the use of alendronate for osteopenia, hypothyroidism, sulfa allergy, and >18 regimens of steroid formulations (oral, inhaled, and topical) for various upper respiratory and dermatologic disorders. The hard palate was selected as the donor site for the subepithelial CT graft. At a 4-month postoperative evaluation, osteonecrosis was evident in the palatal site. Successful clinical outcome was achieved after conservative debridement, antibiotics, and use of chlorhexidine gluconate. Conclusions: It is advised that a patient's medical history include current and past intake of bisphosphonates and comorbidities that could predispose to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws. Attempts should be instituted to achieve primary wound closure of the donor site in patients who have taken bisphosphonates. Postoperative follow-up of the donor site of CT grafts should continue for at least 6 months for surveillance of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis.

AB  - BackgroundSampling the dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) allows the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dermatological drugs to be studied directly at their site of action. Dermal open-flow microperfusion (dOFM) is a recently developed technique that can provide minimally invasive, continuous, membrane-free (thus unfiltered) access to the dermal ISF. Herein, we evaluate the clinical applicability and reliability of novel wearable dOFM devices in a clinical setting. Methods Physicians inserted 141 membrane-free dOFM probes into the dermis of 17 healthy and psoriatic volunteers and sampled dermal ISF for 25 h by using wearable push-pull pumps. The tolerability, applicability, reproducibility, and reliability of multiple insertions and 25 h continuous sampling was assessed by pain scoring, physician feedback, ultrasound probe depth measurements, and 25 h-drift and variability of the sodium relative recovery. Results Insertion pain was moderate and decreased with each additional probe. Probe insertion was precise, although slightly deeper in lesional skin. The wearable push-pull pump enabled uninterrupted ISF sampling over 25 h with low variability. The relative recovery was drift-free and highly reproducible. Conclusion dOFM sampling devices are tolerable and reliable for prolonged continuous dermal sampling in a multiprobe clinical setting. These devices should enable the study of a wide range of drugs and their biomarkers in the skin.

Sepsis-induced changes in signalling cascades -? Divergent effects on phagocytic cells during sepsis -? Harmful effects of C5a and C5a receptors in experimental sepsis ?? Future directions Sepsis in human beings is a major problem involving many individuals and with a high death rate. Except for a single drug (recombinant activated protein C) that has been approved for treatment of septic patients, supportive measures represent the main clinical approach. There are many models of experimental sepsis, mostly in rodents. A commonly used model is cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, robust activation of complement occurs together with up-regulation of C5a receptors (C5aR, C5L2) in a variety of different organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart). In septic human beings there is abundant evidence for complement activation. Interception of C5a or its receptors in the CLP model greatly improves survival in septic rodents. There is compelling evidence that CLP causes an intense pro-inflammatory state and that C5a interaction with its receptors can be linked to apoptosis of the lymphoid system and cells of the adrenal medulla, loss of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils, consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac dysfunction. These findings may have implications for therapeutic interventions in human beings with sepsis.

AB  - Objectives To compare respiratory function, swallowing and voice quality of bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis (BAVFP) patients undergoing laser and diathermy-assisted posterior cordotomy. Design Prospective study. Setting Tertiary academic hospital. Participants Thirty patients were included in the study (groups 1 and 2, 15 patients each). Mean age was 53 ± 14.27 years with a range of 31-78 years (12 [40%] males, 18 [60%] females). Main outcome measures Sufficient airway, complications, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), voice quality VAS, fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, NHR, amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ) and pitch perturbation quotient (PPQ) scores. Results A sufficient laryngeal airway was achieved in all patients. Six patients (20%) developed postoperative granulation tissue (2 in group 1 and 4 in group 2). There was a statistically significant improvement in FEV1, FEV1/FVC and PEF measurements at the postoperative sixth month compared to preoperative measurements in both of the groups (P < .05). Preoperative median voice quality VAS scores in groups 1 and 2 were 8 (IQR = 1) and 8 (IQR = 3), respectively. Postoperative sixth-month voice quality VAS scores in groups 1 and 2 were 6 (IQR = 1) and 6 (IQR = 0), respectively. Postoperative VAS scores were significantly lower in both groups (P < .05). The postoperative changes in fundamental frequency, NHR, jitter, shimmer, APQ and PPQ were not statistically significant in both of the groups (P > .05). Conclusions Laser and diathermy-assisted posterior cordotomy are both minimally invasive, effective techniques with a long-term sufficient laryngeal airway. Despite lower quality of voice VAS scores, objective acoustic outcomes were not significantly lower in both of the groups.

AB  - ABSTRACT Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of affective disorders in children. To investigate the mechanisms by which prenatal trauma and/or maternal PTSD affect brain development and behavior we established a mouse model of prenatal traumatic (PT) experience based on the application of an electric foot shock to C57Bl/6N female mice on the gestational day 12 during their pregnancy. The model is based on a previously validated animal model of PTSD. We found high anxiety levels and poor maternal care along with reduced serum prolactin and increased corticosterone levels in dams following maternal trauma (MT). PT-pups were born smaller and stayed smaller throughout their life. We show increased time and frequency of ultrasonic calls in PT-pups when separated from the mothers on the postnatal day (PND) 9. Cross-fostering experiments reveal lower anxiety levels in PT pups raised by healthy mothers as compared to trauma-naive pups raised by MT-dams. Importantly, the combination of prenatal trauma and being raised by a traumatized mother leads to: (1) the highest corticosterone levels in pups, (2) longest USV-call time and (3) highest anxiety levels in comparison to other experimental groups. Our data indicates a distinct change in maternal care following MT which is possibly associated with trauma-induced decrease in prolactin levels. Furthermore, we show that maternal behavior is crucial for the development of the offspring anxiety and specific aspects in maternal care overwrite to a significant extend the effects of in utero and postnatal environment. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by deterioration in kidney function resulting in multisystem abnormalities. Much of the morbidity and mortality associated with AKI result from a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This study described herein is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter US study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Selective Cytopheretic Device (SCD) treatment on AKI requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the ICU. The study enrolled 35 subjects. The mean age was 56.3?±?15. With regard to race, 71.4% of the subjects were Caucasian, 22.9% were Black, and 5.7% were Hispanic. Average SOFA score was 11.3?±?3.6. Death from any cause at Day 60 was 31.4%. Renal recovery, defined as dialysis independence, was observed in all of the surviving subjects at Day 60. The results of this pilot study indicate the potential for a substantial improvement in patient outcomes over standard of care therapy, which is associated with a greater than 50% 60-day mortality in the literature. The SCD warrants further study in scientifically sound, pivotal trial to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

AB  - ABSTRACT This prospective study assessed in-hospital mortality from diabetic foot ulcer in relation to the demographic, clinical and laboratory features at presentation. Forty-two patients admitted with diabetic foot ulcer were followed up from admission till discharge from hospital. Those who survived or died were compared for any differences in demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation. The mean age and duration of diabetes for the 42 patients were 56.1 ± 1.9 years and 8.3 ± 1.1 years, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate amongst the 42 subjects was 40.5%. Ulcer grade 4, leucocytosis and anaemia were more prevalent in those who demised in comparison with survivors.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess current surgical techniques for scala tympani cochlear implantation among North American surgeons. Material: A survey was distributed to all cochlear implant surgeons participating in the 2006 William House Cochlear Implant Study Group in Toronto, Canada. Participants were asked to anonymously identify their routine surgical practices. Images of trans-facial recess approaches to the round window and cochlear promontory were used in a multiple-choice fashion to assess the surgeon's typical exposure and cochleostomy location. Returned questionnaires were electronically processed and evaluated. Results: Fifty-five (75%) of 73 returned surveys had adequate data validity and availability. Landmark identification and preferred cochleostomy locations varied greatly. About 20% of surgeons selected cochleostomy locations superior to the round window membrane. Cochleostomy size and location appeared to be influenced by surgical experience and whether or not the round window overhang was drilled off. Conclusion: This survey clearly documents marked variations in surgical techniques for scala tympani cochlear implantation. Future studies should more clearly define the surgical anatomy of this region for appropriate placement of a scala tympani cochleostomy. These findings may ultimately have an impact on hearing and neural preservation cochlear implant surgeries.
