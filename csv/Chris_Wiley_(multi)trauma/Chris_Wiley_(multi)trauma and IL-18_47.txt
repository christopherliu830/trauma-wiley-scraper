AB  - Summary Objective? IGFs and IGF binding proteins in the circulation are subject to modulation by a number of catabolic states including inflammation, trauma and surgery. We sought to determine the impact of laparoscopy on the IGF system in patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. Design? The components of the IGF system, cortisol, glucose and insulin concentration in both the serum and urine of patients were compared to those from a healthy group of subjects. An additional comparison was made between pre- and post-laparoscopically assisted patients. Patients? Thirty patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and 81 matched controls were included in the study. Measurements? Radioimmunoassays were used to determine the IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin and cortisol concentrations. The concentration of IGFBP-3 was measured using an immunoradiometric assay. The GOD-PAP method was used to determine the glucose concentration. Gel filtration chromatography was performed to calculate the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio. The amount of sialic acid in IGFBP-3 was determined by affinity chromatography. The presence of IGFBPs in serum was determined by both immunoblotting and ligandblotting. Results? The concentrations of circulating IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were significantly reduced in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. No further reductions were observed post-laparoscopy. Immunoblotting and ligandblotting demonstrated a decreased amount of IGFBP-3 in both pre- and post-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. Increased levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-1 were observed in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects, but laparoscopy did not cause further elevation. No alteration in the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio was witnessed between any of the study groups. A significant increase in the sialic acid content of IGFBP-3 was seen in both patient groups when compared to healthy subjects. The level of urinary cortisol was significantly increased in post-operative patients, whereas the urinary IGF-I concentration was decreased compared to healthy subjects. Conclusions? Our results indicate that acute cholecystitis causes several significant changes in the circulating IGF system. Laparoscopy, however, does not aggravate such changes, but elevates urinary cortisol.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background: Mechanical properties of bones are greatly influenced by percentages of organic and mineral constituents. Nevertheless, information about mineralization level on a microscopic scale and collagen fiber organization in peri-implant bone after immediate loading is scarce. Purpose: The aim of this work was to analyze and compare the degree of mineralization and collagen fiber orientation in alveolar bone (AB) and peri-implant bone of immediately loaded (IL) and unloaded (NL) implants. Materials and Methods: A total of 25 dental implants of 3.8?mm in diameter and 11 mm in length were used in the present study. In five minipigs, three premolars and the first molar were removed from the left side of the mandible. Three months later, five implants for each animal were inserted. Four implants were loaded immediately with a fixed restoration, while one implant was left unloaded. After a 4-month healing period, all implants were retrieved. Circularly polarized light and scanning electron microscope with backscattered electron imaging were used to analyze both peri-implant and AB retrieved 5?mm from the implant. Results: The bone/implant contact ratio (BIC %) was 77.8?±?5.9% for the IL implants and 78.0?±?5.8% for the NL implants; the difference was not statistically significant (p?=?0.554). In the peri-implant bone, the area related to transverse collagen fibers was 112,453?±?4,605 pixels for IL implants and 87,256?±?2,428 pixels for NL implants. In the AB, the area related to transverse collagen fibers was 172,340?±?3,892 pixels. The difference between groups was statistically significant (p?<?.001). The degree of mineralization of peri-implant bone was 137?±?19 gray level for IL implants and 115?±?24 gray level for NL implants, while in the AB, the degree of mineralization was 125?±?26 gray level. This difference was statistically significant (p?<?.001). Conclusion: In this study, it was found that IL and NL implants showed the same degree of osseointegration. The bone matrix around IL implants had a higher quantity of transverse collagen fibers and presented a higher level of mineralization.

AB  - Abstract Vitiligo is a complex disorder in which autoimmune destruction of melanocytes results in white patches of skin and overlying hair. Over the past several years, extensive genetic studies have outlined a biological framework of vitiligo pathobiology that underscores its relationship to other autoimmune diseases. This biological framework offers insight into both vitiligo pathogenesis and perhaps avenues towards more effective approaches to treatment and even disease prevention.

AB  - Frequently used experimental models of sepsis include cecal ligation and puncture, ascending colon stent peritonitis, and the i.p. or i.v. injection of bacteria or bacterial products (such as LPS). Many of these models mimic the pathophysiology of human sepsis. However, identification of mediators in animals, the blockade of which has been protective, has not translated into clinical efficacy in septic humans. We describe the shortcomings of the animal models and reasons why effective therapy for human sepsis cannot be derived readily from promising findings in animal sepsis.

AB  - Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (immune TRALI) is now recognized as the most common cause of transfusion-associated major morbidity and death in the Western world. Among the implicated leucocyte antibodies, these ones directed against the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) class II, human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA)-3a and HLA-A2 antigens are frequently associated with severe (artificial ventilation required) and fatal cases. There is accumulating evidence that preventive measures such as transfusion of plasma-rich blood components from male donors or from donors tested negative for leucocyte antibodies are effective in the reduction of severe and fatal immune TRALI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury is the predominant risk factor for post-traumatic osteoarthritis development (PTOA). Several non-invasive mouse models mimicking human PTOA investigate molecular mechanisms of disease development; none have characterized the inflammatory response to this acute traumatic injury. Our aim was to characterize the early inflammatory phase and later degenerative component in our in vivo non-invasive murine model of PTOA induced by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Right knees of 12-week-old C57Bl6 mice were placed in flexion at a 30° offset position and subjected to a single compressive load (12N, 1.4?mm/s) to induce ACL rupture with no obvious damage to surrounding tissues. Tissue was harvested 4?h post-injury and on days 3, 14, and 21; contralateral left knees served as controls. Histological, immunohistochemical, and gene analyzes were performed to evaluate inflammatory and degenerative changes. Immunohistochemistry revealed time-dependent expression of mature (F4/80 positive) and inflammatory (CD11b positive) macrophage populations within the sub-synovial infiltrate, developing osteophytes, and inflammation surrounding the ACL in response to injury. Up-regulation of genes encoding acute pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17, and the matrix degrading enzymes, ADAMTS-4 and MMP3 was detected in femoral cartilage, concomitant with extensive cartilage damage and bone remodelling over 21-days post-injury. Our non-invasive model describes pathologically distinct phases of the disease, increasing our understanding of inflammatory episodes, the tissues/cells producing inflammatory mediators and the early molecular changes in the joint, thereby defining the early phenotype of PTOA. This knowledge will guide appropriate interventions to delay or arrest disease progression following joint injury. ? 2018 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the cardiovascular and thoracic surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be indicated for extreme cases in patients with massive anterior mediastinal masses, but resection of this mass without prior tissue diagnosis would not be an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Cardiopulmonary bypass is rarely necessary for management of lung injury. The requirement for high-dose anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass would present prohibitive risk and would likely be associated with a dismal neurological outcome. All patients undergoing intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treatment must be assessed with frequent neurovascular examinations. Benign etiologies include superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis, mediastinal fibrosis, and complications of intravascular devices and catheters. Several operative techniques have been described for damage control of thoracotomy to control hemorrhage and decrease operative time and transfusion requirements, as well as improving survival.

AB  - Abstract Despite medical and surgical advances in treatment of intestinal failure, intestine transplant still plays an important role. However, the number of new patients added to the intestine transplant waiting list has decreased over the past decade, reaching a low of 135 in 2018. The number of intestine donors also decreased, reaching a low of 106 in 2018, and the number of intestine transplants performed declined to its lowest level, 104, of which 59% were intestine-liver transplants. Graft failure has plateaued over the past decade. Patient survival for transplants in 2011-2013 varied by age and transplant type. Patient survival was lowest for adult intestine-liver recipients (1-and 5-year survival 66.7% and 49.1%, respectively) and highest for pediatric intestine recipients (1-and 5-year survival 89.1% and 76.4%, respectively).

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Abstract Background? Oral terbinafine and oral itraconazole are two of the most common agents used for the treatment of toenail dermatophyte onychomycosis. Despite the fact that diabetic patients are more likely to have onychomycosis than normal individuals are, there is little research into the efficacy of standard oral regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole for onychomycosis in the diabetic population. Study design? We present a prospective, randomized, single-blind, parallel group, comparator-controlled, multi-centre study designed to assess the efficacy of the pulse itraconazole (200 mg twice daily, 1 week on, 3 weeks off, for 12 weeks) vs. continuous terbinafine (250 mg once daily for 12 weeks) oral therapies in the treatment of dermatophyte toenail distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) in the diabetic population. Efficacy parameters? Primary efficacy measures included mycological cure rate (negative KOH and culture) and effective cure (mycological cure plus nail plate involvement of 10% or less) at Week 48. Results? At Week 48, mycological cure was attained by 88.2% (30 of 34) and 79.3% (23 of 29) of patients in the itraconazole and terbinafine groups, respectively (P not significant). Effective cure (mycological cure with ≤ 10% of nail plate involvement) was attained by 52.9% (18 of 34) of the itraconazole group and 51.7% (15 of 29) of the terbinafine group (P not significant). Three itraconazole patients experienced side effects in the form of gastrointestinal problems. There were no serious adverse events and no interactions with concomitant medications recorded. Discussion? Both continuous terbinafine and itraconazole pulse therapy are effective and safe in the management of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis in people with diabetes.

AB  - Summary Over the past 12?years, the United Kingdom Defence Medical Services have evolved an integrated ?damage control resuscitation ? damage control surgery? sequence for the management of patients sustaining complex injuries. During 2009, over 3200?units of blood products were administered as massive transfusions to severely injured UK personnel. An important part of the approach to traumatic bleeding is the early, empirical use of predefined ratios of blood and clotting products. As soon as control of bleeding is achieved, current practice is to switch towards a tailored transfusion, based on clinical and laboratory assessments, including point-of-care coagulation testing. A key goal is to provide resuscitation seamlessly throughout surgery, so that patients leave the operating room with their normal physiology restored. This article outlines the current management of haemorrhage and coagulation employed in Afghanistan from the point of wounding to transfer back to the National Health Service.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the clinical course of a dog presented with peliosis hepatis and hemoperitoneum in concert with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Case summary: A 7.75-year-old spayed female Shetland Sheepdog presented with clinical signs consistent with hypovolemia, hemoperitoneum, and a history of bright green stool 3 days before the onset of clinical signs. Initial packed cell volume/total solids were consistent with acute hemorrhage. A coagulation profile showed prolongation in activated clotting time and prolongation of both prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time, suggesting abnormal coagulation. Abdominal hemorrhage persisted in the face of normalization of the hemodynamic status and coagulation profile, and treatment with Vitamin K1. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple patchy hypoechoic areas throughout the caudate liver lobe. An exploratory laparotomy was performed 24 hours after presentation and revealed the caudate liver lobe as the source of the hemorrhage. Histopathologic examination of a specimen of the liver was consistent with peliosis hepatis. Toxicologic testing identified diphacinone levels in the blood consistent with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and within 48 hours the dog was discharged. The dog returned to full function and a hepatic ultrasound performed 15 months postoperatively showed no significant abnormalities. New or unique information provided: Exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides may be associated with the development of peliosis hepatis in dogs.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Background The objective of this study was to evaluate our new protocol for performing non-operative management for selected unstable patients under hypotensive resuscitation using improved diagnostic imaging techniques. Methods This retrospective study included 77 consecutive patients with blunt liver injury. They were divided into two groups: those treated before and those treated after the revision. Under the new protocol, we attempted to manage the patients non-operatively, usually with angioembolization, including those whose shock improved with fluid resuscitation and continuous loading, permitting the maintenance of a target systolic blood pressure of 80?mmHg. The outcomes of the two groups were evaluated and compared. Results While comparing the groups, although there was no change in the liver-related morbidity and mortality rates, the urgent and overall laparotomy rates and transfusion requirements in 24?h significantly decreased after the protocol revision. While comparing the subgroups of high-grade injury (AAST Grades 3?5), the overall laparotomy rates and transfusion requirements in 24?h significantly decreased after the protocol revision. Conclusions All the selected unstable patients were successfully managed non-operatively after the protocol revision. The decrease in laparotomy rates and transfusion requirements confirmed the feasibility of our new protocol for these selected patients.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? To determine how prepared for dental practice graduates from the integrated problem-based learning (PBL) dental undergraduate curriculum at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) perceive themselves to be and to identify factors associated with self-perceived preparedness. Materials and methods:? A postal questionnaire was sent to five cohorts of dentists who had graduated from HKU?s integrated PBL curriculum between 2004 and 2008. Using a 4-point Likert scale, the questionnaire assessed the self-perceived level of preparedness in 59 competencies grouped in nine domains. Responses were dichotomised into ?poorly prepared? and ?well prepared?. Results:? The response rate was 66% (159/241). The mean proportion (±?standard deviation) of respondents indicating well-preparedness was 72.0?±?15.1% overall, and for each domain was as follows: general patient management, 93.1?±?12.1%; practice management, 81.0?±?22.2%; periodontology and dental public health, 73.5?±?19.3%; conservative dentistry, 92.5?±?13.1%; oral rehabilitation, 62.8?±?24.0%; orthodontics, 23.0?±?32.9%; managing children and special-needs patients, 64.8?±?28.9%; oral and maxillofacial surgery, 52.2?±?25.2%; and drug and emergency management, 84.7?±?22.6%. The odds of self-perceived well-preparedness were increased for cohorts graduating in 2004 and 2005 and graduates working in a non-solo dental practice. Conclusions:? Dental graduates of HKU?s integrated PBL curriculum felt well prepared for the most fundamental aspects of dental practice. However, apparent deficiencies of training in orthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery will need to be addressed by continuing education, postgraduate training and planning for the new 6-year undergraduate curriculum in 2012.

AB  - Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is of obvious relevance in situations where there is an interruption of blood supply to the gut, as in vascular surgery, or in the construction of free intestinal grafts. It is now appreciated that IRI also underlies the gut dysfunction that occurs in early shock, sepsis, and trauma. The events that occur during IRI are complex. However, recent advances in cellular biology have started to unravel these underlying processes. The aim of this review is to provide an outline of current knowledge on the mechanisms and consequences of IRI. Initially, IRI appears to be mediated by reactive oxygen metabolites and, at a later stage, by the priming and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury can diminish the barrier function of the gut, and can promote an increase in the leakage of molecules (intestinal permeability) or the passage of microbes across the wall of the bowel (bacterial trans-location). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury to the gut can result in the generation of molecules that may also harm distant tissues.
