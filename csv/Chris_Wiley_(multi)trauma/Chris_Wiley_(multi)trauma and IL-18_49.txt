AB  - Summary The term epidermolysis bullosa (EB) includes a group of rare genodermatoses characterized by mutational impairment of the structural and functional integrity of intraepidermal adhesion and dermoepidermal anchorage. Clinically, these disorders are marked by increased skin fragility as well as characteristic mechanically inducible blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. Extracutaneous manifestations and their complications in other epithelialized organs render EB a multi-system disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cornerstones of a dynamically changing healthcare structure include precise and early diagnosis; coordinated, multidisciplinary, individually adjusted patient care at specialized centers; optimized symptomatic therapies; and access to research-based, potentially curative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT ??The mean catalytic activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes (HLM) of Japanese origin were found to be lower than the corresponding mean values of Caucasian HLM, but the distribution patterns of data in these studies were not well addressed. ??Interindividual variations in metabolic activities of Chinese HLM samples were reported for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but little is known about the difference in CYP activities between Chinese and Caucasian HLM samples. ??The vast majority of the preceding studies were based on the measurement of metabolite formation rates at a certain fixed substrate concentration, rather than enzyme kinetic analyses. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS ??Significant differences in metabolic capability were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 with the median values lower for the Chinese HLM samples vs. the Caucasian samples, which were associated with differences in Michaelis constant or maximum velocity. ??Despite negligible differences in metabolic capability for CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A, Michaelis constant of CYP2B6 appeared to have a significant ethnic difference. AIM The most common causes of variability in drug response include differences in drug metabolism, especially when the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved. The current study was conducted to assess the differences in CYP activities in human liver microsomes (HLM) of Chinese or Caucasian origin. METHODS The metabolic capabilities of CYP enzymes in 30 Chinese liver microsomal samples were compared with those of 30 Caucasian samples utilizing enzyme kinetics. Phenacetin O-deethylation, coumarin 7-hydroxylation, bupropion hydroxylation, amodiaquine N-desethylation, diclofenac 4?-hydroxylation (S)-mephenytoin 4?-hydroxylation, dextromethorphan O-demethylation, chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation and midazolam 1?-hydroxylation/testosterone 6?-hydroxylation were used as probes for activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A, respectively. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the differences. RESULTS The samples of the two ethnic groups were not significantly different in cytochrome-b5 concentrations but were significantly different in total CYP concentrations and NADPH-P450 reductase activity (P < 0.05). Significant ethnic differences in intrinsic clearance were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1; the median values of the Chinese group were 54, 58, 26, and 35% of the corresponding values of the Caucasian group, respectively. These differences were associated with differences in Michaelis constant or maximum velocity. Despite negligible difference in intrinsic clearance, the Michaelis constant of CYP2B6 appeared to have a significant ethnic difference. No ethnic difference was observed for CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A. CONCLUSIONS These data extend our knowledge on the ethnic differences in CYP enzymes and will have implications for drug discovery and drug therapy for patients from different ethnic origins.

AB  - Abstract A socio-dental survey was carried out to determine the level of dental disease and treatment requirement among elderly people attending a Community Care Centre. A screening programme involving 293 elderly people demonstrated a normative need of 82% and a felt need of 53%. Seventy-six per cent would have benefited from dental care. Many individuals who both needed and wanted dental care were not receiving it because they were discouraged from doing so predominantly because of poor mobility. It is recommended, therefore, that dentists be included in multi-disciplinary teams caring for elderly people so that they can be screened and given the opportunity to obtain dental care

AB  - A number of studies in patients and monkeys have suggested that intravenous infusion of lipids can be utilized as a major source of calories during sepsis and/or trauma. Others, however, have observed that lipid calories were not as effective as glucose calories in sparing body protein in severely septic and/or burned patients. In trying to resolve this controversy, a parenteral nutrition model was utilized during pneumococcal sepsis in the rhesus monkey. Earlier studies indicated that when monkeys were infused with 0.55 grams amino acid nitrogen and 13 kilocalories per kilogram per day, they lost approximately 13% of their body protein as a result of the clinical illness associated with pneumococcal sepsis. Addition of 85 kilocalories per kilogram per day of either dextrose or lipid emulsion (Intralipid) effectively prevented this infection-related loss of body protein. The present study was designed to determine whether the elevated plasma insulin concentrations associated with glucose infusions are necessary for protein sparing or would interfere with utilization of lipid calories. In this study, septic and control monkeys were infused with a hypocaloric amino acid-dextrose solution to which was added lipid emulsion. If septic monkeys were totally maintained on a hypocaloric infusion of amino acids and 32 kilocalories per kilogram per day from dextrose, they lost 6.8 ± 1.0% of their body protein over the 6-day experimental period. Addition of lipid calories (55 kilocalories per kilogram per day) to this mixture resulted in a gain of 1.1 ± 0.7% of body protein. In both experimental groups plasma insulin was approximately 100 to 200 microunits per milliliter, which resulted in a marked inhibition of ketogenesis and lipolysis. Despite elevated plasma insulin, the septic monkey appeared able to utilize the fatty acids from the infused lipid effectively as a calorie source to spare body protein. Since lipid emulsion contains approximately 13% glycerol calories, septic monkeys were infused with a hypocaloric amino acid-dextrose solution and an amount of glycerol calories equivalent to that found in Intralipid. Under these conditions, the loss of body protein was very similar to that seen when the hypocaloric amino acid-dextrose solution alone was infused in the septic monkey. Thus, the protein-sparing effects of the lipid emulsion are not related to its glycerol content.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.

AB  - Summary Analgesia, usually provided by opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIAs), can be enhanced by other classes of medication that have a different primary role but with a pharmacological mechanism of action that supports their analgesic actions. Adjunct analgesic methods/medications added to standard opioid and NSAIA analgesia has gained popularity in veterinary medicine; however, there are few veterinary clinical trials assessing efficacy. Adjunctive analgesics are frequently used in combination with other analgesics to confer a synergistic effect in a multi-modal regimen or to facilitate lower drug dosages to reduce adverse effects. Drugs currently used as adjuncts are Lidocaine systemically, Alpha2-adrenergic agonists, Gabapentin, Amitriptyline and Amantadine. This chapter discusses tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Corticosteroids inhibit cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2) gene expression, which is upregulated in inflammatory states, reduces aberrant firing originating from nerve injury and reduces inflammation at the site of injury.

AB  - Abstract Objective Pain medicine still lacks mechanism-specific biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment, and defective top-down modulation is an important factor in the pathophysiology of chronic pain conditions. Using modern analytical tools and advanced multivariate statistical analysis, the aim of this study was to revisit two classical potential biomarkers of pro- and anti-nociception in humans (substance P and beta-endorphin), focusing particularly on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Design Cross-sectional, comparative, observational study. Subjects Patients with chronic, post-traumatic and/or post-surgical, neuropathic pain refractory to conventional treatment (N?=?15) and healthy controls (N?=?19) were included. Methods Samples were taken from CSF and blood, and levels of substance P and beta-endorphin were investigated using a Luminex technology kit. Results We found low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF of neuropathic pain patients (66?±?11?pcg/mL) compared with healthy controls (115?±?14?pcg/mL) (P?=?0.017). Substance P levels in the CSF did not differ (20?±?2?pcg/mL, 26?±?2, P?=?0.08). However, our multivariate data analysis showed that belonging to the patient group was associated with low levels of both substances in the CSF. A higher correlation between the levels of beta-endorphin and substance P in CSF was found in healthy controls than in patients (rs?=?0.725, P?<?0.001 vs rs?=?0.574, P?=?0.032). Conclusions Patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to trauma or surgery had low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF. We speculate that this could indicate a defective top-down modulation of pain in chronic neuropathic pain. Our results also illustrate the importance of taking a system-wide, multivariate approach when searching for biomarkers.

AB  - Background Studies in different animal models and plasma analyses in humans suggest that members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family may be involved in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF). Accordingly, we have examined IL-6-related cytokines in chronic CHF in humans by analysing gene and protein expression in myocardium derived from patients with end-stage heart failure and donor hearts. Methods Gene expression of cytokines/receptors of the IL-6 family was documented in myocardial samples using cDNA array hybridization and RNase protection assays. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-6 and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) in myocardial tissues. Results Myocardial gene activity was documented for the majority of IL-6 family cytokines and their receptors. Immunohistochemical analysis localized IL-6, LIF and their common receptor subunit gp130 to myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. LIF mRNA levels were enhanced in the left ventricles of CHF patients relative to the left ventricles of donor hearts (patients 4·6?±?4·7 vs. donors 0·3?±?0·3, P?<?0·005). Myocardial IL-6 and gp130 mRNA levels were not statistically different between patients and donors, but in contrast to LIF mRNA expression in heart explants, gp130 mRNA levels were significantly higher in left atrium compared with left ventricle in both patients and donors. Conclusions Both mRNA and proteins of gp130 and its ligands IL-6 and LIF are expressed in both nonfailing and failing human myocardium. The elevated LIF mRNA levels in left ventricles from patients with end-stage heart failure suggest a role for LIF in the pathogenesis of CHF.

AB  - Summary Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is the anatomic loss of intestine. This can be congenital in origin via intestinal atresia, or acquired via massive enterectomy or multiple resections for a variety of vascular and non-vascular reasons. Some patients will be able to retain their nutritional autonomy, while others will require varying degrees and duration of specialized nutritional support because of intestinal failure. Treatment of these patients revolves around the correction and prevention of macro- and micronutrient deficiencies, and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance via control of dietary and other enteral as well as parenteral intake, and control of fluid losses. Individualized and tailored nutritional management for patients with SBS helps to optimize intestinal absorption, leading to nutritional independence such that a patient can resume as normal a lifestyle as possible. Complications may develop however, from either SBS or its therapy. Some of these may be life-threatening and will lead to the need for isolated intestine, intestine/liver, or multivisceral transplantation. Otherwise, surgical management includes anastomosis of residual colon to residual small intestine in order to utilize carbohydrate salvage for enhanced nutrient and fluid assimilation, and intestinal tapering procedures for dilated, nonfunctional intestinal segments.

AB  - Superficial bladder cancer includes tumors confined to the mucosa and lamina propria. They may be papillary or sessile. Tumors confined to the mucosa include papillomas, papillary carcinomas, or carcinoma in situ. Therapy must be individualized for each patient taking into consideration the histologic type, cytologic grade, location, number, prior history, and presence of atypia or carcinoma in situ in other areas of the bladder. Although the five-year survival rates are good (62?88 percent), the 48?70 percent incidence of subsequent tumors requires constant surveillance. This high incidence is primarily due to the multifocal origin of urothelial tumors, but implantation of tumor cells following local resection may be a contributing factor. Current efforts to reduce this recurrence rate emphasize intravesical chemotherapy. Thio-tepa and epodyl are effective in eradicating one-third of tumors when used for definitive therapy. Most studies demonstrate a reduction in the recurrence rate when they are initiated following endoscopic resection of all visible tumor. A number of other drugs are being investigated for both definitive and prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy. Surgical procedures consist of transurethral resection, transvesical radium implantation, segmental cystectomy, and cystoprostatectomy. Each procedure has its own indications, and the surgeon must be discriminating in their use.

AB  - Abstract Background There is a need for an ideal indicator of surgery in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Several markers have been analysed, but the search still continues as none have proven effective. This study aimed to analyse and compare the predictive value of plasma procalcitonin (PCT) strip test in patients presenting with acute abdomen and identify a useful cut-off value to differentiate patients that would benefit with surgery from those that require conservative management. Methods A prospective study was conducted in the department of general surgery from June 2012 to June 2013. Plasma PCT was estimated by the semi-quantitative strip test. The levels of plasma PCT and other routinely used markers of inflammation were analysed and compared. Results Of the total of 58 patients, 44 patients (76%) were men with a mean age of 45 years. Forty patients required emergency surgical intervention. A plasma PCT value of >0.5?ng/mL at admission was 80% sensitive and 100% specific for predicting need for antibiotics in patients with acute abdomen that were managed conservatively. The mean plasma PCT value in the patients undergoing surgery (5.0?10.0?ng/mL) was significantly more than in those managed conservatively (0.5?2.0?ng/mL). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves a cut-off for plasma PCT of >5.0?ng/mL was 75% sensitive and 100% specific for considering surgical intervention in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Conclusions Plasma PCT (value?>5?ng/mL) could be used as an adjunct to clinical examination to predict requirement of surgery in patients presenting with acute abdomen.

PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Background: Multi-item scales for monitoring alcohol withdrawal reactions have been used since the 1970s, and since 1985 we have used a modified version of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) in our general hospitals. This study was conducted to determine whether a shorter version of the scale would prove easier to use without loss of accuracy. Methods: A simultaneous ?crossover? clinical audit using two hospitals. The shortened scale was developed from the existing one, and had 10 items as opposed to the previous 18. The patients were followed throughout their course and the incidences of complication, the frequency of sedation, the delay in initiating monitoring and the ease of use were recorded. Results: There were 106 patients managed with the old scale and 96 with the new. The rate of complication was not different, being 16% in patients managed using the old scale and 14.5% using the new scale; the rates of sedation were 49 and 48%, respectively. Patients managed with the new scale had a shorter course with a median duration of 27.6?h compared with 40?h. The time from admission to first recording of a score was 5.4?h for the new scale and 4.8?h for the old, which is not a significant difference. Both scores were used according to instructions, but staff reported that the shortened scale was easier to use. Conclusions: We conclude that a shortened form of the CIWA alcohol withdrawal scale works as well as the original and is simple to use.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of supplemental arginine with nutritional support in the presence of sepsis, eighty-eight gastrostomized female Hartley guinea pigs were implanted with osmotic pumps effusing an Eschericia coli/Staphylococcus aureus mixture. Animals were randomized and infused for two weeks with isocaloric and isovolumetric diets containing 0%, 2%, 4%, or 6% supplemental arginine as arginine hydrochloride. Survival was 12/22 (54%) in 0%, 9/22 (41%) in 2% and 4%, and 2/22 (9%) in 6%. Analysis by chi-square test of independence was significant (p = 0.0141) with 6% survival lower than the others. Median survival was 11 days in 0%, 8 days in 2% and 6%, and 9 days in 4%. Median survival was longer in 0% than in 2% or 6% (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA: p = 0.02). Nitrogen balance was significantly lower in 6% compared to 0% on days 2 through 10, and lower than 2% and 4% on days 6 and 9. Nitrogen balance was higher in 0% than in 2% on days 4, 6, 10, and 13. Serum albumin and C3 were lower in all experimental groups than normal controls (ANOVA: p = 0.01). Comparison of liver, spleen, adrenals, gastrocnemius, and carcass weights, cell-mediated immunity as determined by contact sensitivity to DNFB, and transferrin showed no significant differences. There was a positive dose-response effect seen amongst the experimental groups for the amino acids arginine, ornithine, and citrulline in relation to the amount of supplemental arginine. This study suggests that dietary arginine supplementation does not enhance survival in a guinea pig model of established peritonitis. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 14:237?244, 1990)

AB  - Abstract Aim and objective? To evaluate the validity of study outcomes of published papers that report the effects of clinical pathways (CP). Method? Systematic review based on two search strategies, including searching Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Psychinfo and Picarta from 1995 till 2005 and ISI Web of KnowledgeSM. We included randomized controlled or quasi-experimental studies evaluating the efficacy of clinical pathway application. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies included randomization, power analysis, selection bias, validity of outcome indicators, appropriateness of statistical tests, direct (matching) and indirect (statistical) control for confounders. Outcomes included length of stay, costs, readmission rate and complications. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the selected papers and recorded the findings with an evaluation tool developed from a set of items for quality assessment derived from the Cochrane Library and other publications. Results? The study sample comprised of 115 publications. A total of 91.3% of the studies comprised of retrospective studies and 8.7% were randomized controlled studies. Using a quality-scoring assessment tool, 33% of the papers were classified as of good quality, whereas 67% were classified as of low quality. Of the studies, 10.4% controlled for confounding by matching and 59.1% adopted parametric statistical tests without testing variables on normal distribution. Differences in outcomes were not always statistically tested. Conclusion? Readers should be cautious when interpreting the results of clinical pathway evaluation studies because of the confounding factors and sources of contamination affecting the evidence-based validity of the outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a condition that can develop in about half of the patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of lower limbs. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in the early phases of DVT and their correlation with the onset of PTS. Patients were enrolled after the first episode of DVT and were followed up for 1, 4, 8, 12 and 18 months. At each visit, blood sample was collected to evaluate plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1,-2,-3,-7,-8 and -9 MMP inhibitors, TIMP-1,-2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Analysis included 201 patients [86 males (42·79%) and 115 females (57·21%); average age 56 ± 7 years]. Of the 201 patients, 47 (23·38%; 21 males, 26 females) developed PTS during the follow-up period. The control group was made up of 60 individuals without DVT (22 males and 38 females). High plasma levels of MMPs, NGAL and cytokines were recorded during the acute phase after DVT. Moreover, patients with PTS showed higher levels of MMP-1 and MMP-8 with respect to patients without PTS. There is a close relationship between DVT, the individual risk of PTS and specific biomarkers such as MMPs and other related molecules, which may help guide prevention and therapy based on the patient's individual risk profile, and has to be studied in future.
