AB  - Abstract Fever is a cardinal symptom of infectious or inflammatory insults, but it can also arise from noninfectious causes. The fever-inducing agent that has been used most frequently in experimental studies designed to characterize the physiological, immunological and neuroendocrine processes and to identify the neuronal circuits that underlie the manifestation of the febrile response is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our knowledge of the mechanisms of fever production and lysis is largely based on this model. Fever is usually initiated in the periphery of the challenged host by the immediate activation of the innate immune system by LPS, specifically of the complement (C) cascade and Toll-like receptors. The first results in the immediate generation of the C component C5a and the subsequent rapid production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The second, occurring after some delay, induces the further production of PGE2 by induction of its synthesizing enzymes and transcription and translation of proinflammatory cytokines. The Kupffer cells (Kc) of the liver seem to be essential for these initial processes. The subsequent transfer of the pyrogenic message from the periphery to the brain is achieved by neuronal and humoral mechanisms. These pathways subserve the genesis of early (neuronal signals) and late (humoral signals) phases of the characteristically biphasic febrile response to LPS. During the course of fever, counterinflammatory factors, ?endogenous antipyretics,? are elaborated peripherally and centrally to limit fever in strength and duration. The multiple interacting pro- and antipyretic signals and their mechanistic effects that underlie endotoxic fever are the subjects of this review. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Objective? To investigate the development of gingival hyperplasia in dogs after renal transplantation and administration of microemulsified cyclosporine A (MCsA). Study Design? Experimental study. Animals? Healthy adult mongrel dogs (n=5). Methods? As part of study on renal transplantation, dogs administered MCsA (20?mg/kg/day), azathioprine, and prednisolone to prevent graft rejection were monitored for development of gingival changes. Prednisolone was discontinued after 3 months. MCsA dose was adjusted to maintain whole blood trough concentration of 400?700?ng/mL. Gingival change was evaluated by weekly examination and photodocumentation, and gingival biopsy for histopathology was performed at 28 weeks. Results? One dog was lost because of acute graft rejection. Gingival hyperplasia developed in 3 of 4 dogs. The earliest gingival changes occurred in the interdental papillae at 20 weeks after transplantation. On histopathology, the underlying connective tissue was thickened and contained increase numbers of fibroblasts and inflammatory infiltrates. Conclusions? Long-term immunosuppression with an MCsA-based treatment likely induces substantial gingival hyperplasia when therapeutic, immunosuppressive blood levels of MCsA were maintained for 32 weeks. Clinical Relevance? MCsA is used for immune-mediated diseases and preventing rejection after transplant in dogs. MCsA blood levels, and gingival hyperplasia should be monitored by routine examination of the interdental papilla in dogs administered MCsA for long periods.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current knowledge of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and describes emerging markers of inflammation in CVD. It examines whether individuals identified on the basis of elevated serum high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP) benefit from clinical intervention. The chapter reviews existing guidelines relating to hs-CRP and highlights limitations in the use of hs-CRP in risk assessment. It evaluates the prognostic value of other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, serum amyloid A, albumin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, circulating immune complexes, heat-shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), paraoxonase-1, and myeloperoxidase in CVD. The chapter reviews the influence of chronic inflammatory disease and infectious burden on CVD, and discusses relevant data regarding pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory effects in CVD. It evaluates the influence of dietary patterns, wholegrains, dietary fat, antioxidants, phytochemicals, plant sterols, alcohol, micronutrients, physical activity, genetics, and family history on inflammatory markers associated with CVD.

AB  - Abstract The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors are soluble proteins produced by leukocytes and other cell types, which act as chemical communicators between cells and tissues within the body. These proteins mediate a number of functions, ranging from effects on cell growth, differentiation, survival, and a number of effector activities. The main purpose of this unit is to provide an easy-to-use reference summarizing some of the current information on well-established cytokine, growth factore, and chemokine ligands. The information provided is confined largely to alternative names, protein properties, genetic chracteristics, chromosomal localization, cellular expression patters, cellular-tissue targets, stimuli regulating expression, functional properties, expression analysis, and clinical utility.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate extended release (XR) in the treatment of Korean subjects with acute schizophrenia. Methods This was an 8-week, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate XR at a daily dose of 400?800?mg. Changes in total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week?8 were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine XR. Additionally, the Clinical Global Impression scale and the Montgomery?Åsberg Depression Rating Scale were administered. Results The mean change in PANSS total scores was ?26.8, and the mean PANSS total score at the endpoint was significantly lower than that at baseline. The mean PANSS positive score, negative score, and general score showed statistically significant reductions at the end of the study. Statistically significant changes were also observed in Clinical Global Impression-Severity and Montgomery?Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. The most common treatment-related adverse events in the group receiving quetiapine XR were sedation (10.6%) and constipation (9.6%). Conclusions In this study of Korean patients with acute schizophrenia, quetiapine XR showed clinical efficacy and relatively good tolerability. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background and objectives The aim of this study was to assess cellular and peritoneal immune responses after radical laparoscopic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods Peripheral heparinized plasma and plain serum tube samples were collected preoperatively, and at 2 hr, 1 day, and 4 days postoperatively for analysis o; white blood cells, total lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-suppressor lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A. Twenty-four hours peritoneal fluid collection was performed on days 1 and 4 for TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 analysis. Results No statistical differences were observed between the two groups with respect to immunocompetent cell counts. The serum levels of plasma CRP and SAA gradually increased significantly with time in both groups, but these temporal increases were lower in the LADG group (CRP; P?=?0.03, SAA; P?=?0.01). Peritoneal TNF-α levels in the CODG group at 4 days postoperatively were significantly higher than at day 1, but remained almost unchanged in the LADG group, and this difference was significant (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Because of its association with reduced peritoneal immune activity, laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer may require careful consideration in practice. Additional, larger prospective multicenter trials are required before a consensus can be reached. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:54?59. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Use of photostimulation including low-level light emitting diode (LED) therapy has broadened greatly in recent years because it is compact, portable, and easy to use. Here, the effects of photostimulation by LED (610 nm) therapy on ischemic brain damage was investigated in mice in which treatment started after a stroke in a clinically relevant setting. The mice underwent LED therapy (20 min) twice a day for 3 days, commencing at 4 hours post-ischemia. LED therapy group generated a significantly smaller infarct size and improvements in neurological function based on neurologic test score. LED therapy profoundly reduced neuroinflammatory responses including neutrophil infiltration and microglia activation in the ischemic cortex. LED therapy also decreased cell death and attenuated the NLRP3 inflammasome, in accordance with down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1? and IL-18 in the ischemic brain. Moreover, the mice with post-ischemic LED therapy showed suppressed TLR-2 levels, MAPK signaling and NF-kB activation. These findings suggest that by suppressing the inflammasome, LED therapy can attenuate neuroinflammatory responses and tissue damage following ischemic stroke. Therapeutic interventions targeting the inflammasome via photostimulation with LED may be a novel approach to ameliorate brain injury following ischemic stroke. Effect of post-ischemic low-level light emitting diode therapy (LED-T) on infarct reduction was mediated by inflammasome suppression.
