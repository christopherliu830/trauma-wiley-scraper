AB  - Abstract Background IL-1? is a primary mediator of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and it may lead to shock septic. Our aim was to analyse whether IL-1B rs16944 polymorphism is associated with the onset of septic shock and death after major surgery. Materials and methods We performed a case?control study on 467 patients who underwent major cardiac or abdominal surgery. Of them, 205 patients developed septic shock (cases, SS group) and 262 patients developed SIRS (controls, SIRS group). The primary outcome variables were the development of septic shock and death within 90 days after diagnosis of septic shock. The IL-1B rs16944 polymorphism was genotyped by Sequenom's MassARRAY platform. The association analysis was performed under a recessive genetic model (AA vs. GG/GC). Results The frequency of septic shock was higher in patients with IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype than in patients with IL-1B rs16944 GG/AG genotype when all patients were taken into account (63·6% vs. 41·8%; P = 0·006), cardiac surgery (52·2% vs. 33·3%; P = 0·072) and abdominal surgery (76·2% vs. 50·2%; P = 0·023). However, the IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype was only associated with higher likelihood of septic shock in the analysis of all population [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2·26 (95%CI = 1·03; 4·97; P = 0·042], but not when it was stratified by cardiac surgery (P = 0·175) or abdominal surgery (P = 0·467). Similarly, IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype was also associated with higher likelihood of septic shock-related death in all population [aOR = 2·67 (95%CI = 1·07; 4·97); P = 0·035]. Conclusions IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype seems to be related to the onset of septic shock and death in patients who underwent major surgery.

AB  - Abstract Aim and objective? To evaluate the validity of study outcomes of published papers that report the effects of clinical pathways (CP). Method? Systematic review based on two search strategies, including searching Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Psychinfo and Picarta from 1995 till 2005 and ISI Web of KnowledgeSM. We included randomized controlled or quasi-experimental studies evaluating the efficacy of clinical pathway application. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies included randomization, power analysis, selection bias, validity of outcome indicators, appropriateness of statistical tests, direct (matching) and indirect (statistical) control for confounders. Outcomes included length of stay, costs, readmission rate and complications. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the selected papers and recorded the findings with an evaluation tool developed from a set of items for quality assessment derived from the Cochrane Library and other publications. Results? The study sample comprised of 115 publications. A total of 91.3% of the studies comprised of retrospective studies and 8.7% were randomized controlled studies. Using a quality-scoring assessment tool, 33% of the papers were classified as of good quality, whereas 67% were classified as of low quality. Of the studies, 10.4% controlled for confounding by matching and 59.1% adopted parametric statistical tests without testing variables on normal distribution. Differences in outcomes were not always statistically tested. Conclusion? Readers should be cautious when interpreting the results of clinical pathway evaluation studies because of the confounding factors and sources of contamination affecting the evidence-based validity of the outcomes.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the accuracy and safety of a combined 3D printed guide template (combined template) to assist iliosacral (IS) screw placement for sacral fracture and dislocation. Methods A total of 37 patients, 24 men and 13 women, age from 22 to 68?years old, diagnosed with a sacral fracture and dislocation were involved in this study for retrospective analysis from January 2016 to February 2018. There were 19 patients in the template group (42 screws) and 18 patients in the conventional group (31 screws). In the combined template group, IS screw placement was assisted by a combined 3D printed template; in the conventional group, the IS screws were placed freehand under fluoroscopy. The accuracy of the IS screw placement was evaluated by comparing the screw angle and the location of the screw entry point between the actual and the simulated screw in the combined template group. The safety of the IS screw placement was evaluated by comparing the quality of the reduction, the grading of the screws, the operation time, and radiation exposure times between groups. Results A total of 73 pedicle screws were placed in 37 patients: 42 screws (30 S1, 12 S2) in the combined template group and 31 screws (23 S1, 8 S2) in the conventional group. In the conventional group, 1?patient developed symptoms of L5 nerve stimulation. In the combined template group, the average operative time of each screw was 25.01?±?2.90 min, with average radiation exposure times of 12.05?±?4.00. In the conventional group, the average operative time of each screw was 46.24?±?9.59 min, with an average radiation exposure time of 56.10?±?6.75. There were significant differences in operation and radiation exposure times between groups. The rate of screw perforation was lower in the combined template group (2 of 42 screws, 0 at grade III and 2 at grade II) than in the conventional group (5 of 38 screws, 2 at grade III and 3 at grade III). In the combined template group, the mean distance between the entry points of the actual and simulated screws was 1.4?±?0.9?mm, with a mean angle of deviation of 2.1°?±?1.6°. All patients were followed up once every 3?months and were followed for 3 to 12?months. Conclusion Using the combined template to assist with the insertion of IS screws delivered good accuracy, less fluoroscopy and shorter operation time, and avoided neurovascular injury as a result of screw malposition.

AB  - Abstract:? Two distinct approaches are being explored in red blood cell substitute (RCS) development: hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers (PFBOCs). HBOCs are based on intra- and/or intermolecularly ?engineered? human or animal hemoglobins (Hbs), optimized for O2 delivery and longer intravascular circulation. Some are currently being evaluated in Phase II/III clinical studies. PFBOCs are aqueous emulsions of perfluorocarbon derivatives that dissolve relatively large amounts of O2. A PFBOC based on a 60% (wt/vol) emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide has been evaluated in Phase II/III clinical trials. Although current PFBOC products generally require patients to breathe O2 enriched air, they render certain advantages since they are totally synthetic. This article provides a short review of the basic principles, approaches, and current status of RCS development. Results of preclinical and clinical studies including recent Phase II/III clinical studies are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Men and women appear to exhibit different susceptibilities to sepsis and possibly divergent outcomes. However, the effect of sex and gender in critical illness outcomes is still controversial and the underlying mechanisms appear to be complex. Objectives We aimed to systematically review and synthesize evidence on the influence of sex on outcomes in critically ill adult patients with sepsis, as reported in published studies specifically including investigation of the effect of sex among their aims. Primary outcome measures include in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU. Search strategy The review was based on focused literature searches (CINAHL, PUBMED, EMBASE and COCHRANE). Methodological quality was assessed through the STROBE checklist and the Cochrane Tool for Bias in Cohort Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA. Published observational studies addressing outcomes of sepsis among their primary aims and having included gender comparisons among primary outcomes in critically ill adult patients were included. Results A total of eight eligible studies were included. With the exception of mortality, it was not possible to perform meta-analysis for other outcomes. Included studies reported data on 25,619 patients with sepsis (14?309 male/11?310 female). There is a paucity of well-designed studies addressing the effect of sex on mortality among patients with sepsis, and absence of studies addressing the effects of sex on multiple organ dysfunction of non-infectious origin. There was significant heterogeneity among study estimates (p?=?0·001; I2=78·1%). Conclusions Although results of data syntheses appear to point towards a small disadvantage for survival among women, our results suggest that data on the impact of sex on sepsis outcomes remain equivocal. Implications for future research include approaches to adjustment for confounders and prospective designs. Relevance to clinical practice Clarifying sex-related differences in sepsis, if any, is crucial for informing evidence-based care.

AB  - Objectives Rhinoplasty is commonly performed in children with congenital anomalies and resultant nasal deformity causing airway obstruction. Little is known regarding patient factors or perioperative sequelae. We define demographic characteristics and perioperative complications for children undergoing rhinoplasty within a large national cohort. Study Design Retrospective cohort study of children aged?≤?18 years undergoing rhinoplasty utilizing data from the 2012 to 2015 American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric public use file. Methods All children who underwent rhinoplasty were identified. Postoperative complications were defined as 30-day postoperative infection, unplanned readmission and reoperation, and death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of complications. Subgroup analysis was performed based on child age (age?<?5 years vs. 5?13 years vs.?≥?14 years). Results Of 1,378 children undergoing rhinoplasty, 21(1.52%) children experienced complications, with the most common being unplanned readmission. Younger children were more likely to experience complications (3.79% aged?<?5 years vs. 0.66% aged?≥?14 years; P?=?0.001). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we observed a 61% decreased odds of complication with each age group (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.19, 0.77; P?=?0.007). Younger children were more likely to be male (56.2% male aged?<?5 years vs. 46.6% male aged?≥?14 years; P?=?0.011), have developmental delay (11.7% aged?<?5 years vs. 3.65% aged?≥?14 years; P?<?0.001), and have craniofacial abnormalities (73.2% aged?<?5 years vs. 42.1% aged?≥?14 years; P?<?0.001). Conclusion Children undergoing rhinoplasty experience few major complications, with the most common being unplanned readmission. Younger children are at greater risk and are more likely to be male with craniofacial abnormalities. Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 129:494?499, 2019

AB  - Abstract Title.? Disaster preparedness among Hong Kong nurses Aim.? This paper is a report of a survey to explore Hong Kong nurses? disaster preparedness. Background.? Increasingly frequent global disasters are posing threats to human health and life. The World Health Organization has called for countries to have detailed plans at all levels in order to be prepared for disasters that may arise. Method.? A questionnaire was distributed to convenience samples of practising Registered Nurses studying in Master?s degree programmes at a Hong Kong university in 2007. Results.? Of a possible 174, 164 questionnaires were returned (Response rate 94%). Almost all nurses (97·6%) considered the government health department to be the organization most involved in disastrous situations. The majority (84·8%) were aware of the existence of a protocol on disaster management at their workplace. About one-third would respond in accordance with protocol (38·4%) or rely on directions from their immediate supervisors (34·8%) if a disaster occurred. Almost all the nurses (97%) considered themselves not adequately prepared for disasters. They recognized that a protocol for disaster management (85·4%) and training and drills for disasters (both 84·1%) are useful tools. Conclusion.? Nurses in Hong Kong are not adequately prepared for disasters, but are aware of the need for such preparation. Disaster management training should be included in the basic education of nurses.

AB  - Abstract Locked intramedullary nailing and external fixation are alternatives for the stabilization of tibial shaft fractures. The goal of this study was to determine to what extent the mechanical conditions at the fracture site influence the healing process after unreamed tibial nailing compared to external fixation. A standardized tibial diastasis was stabilized with either a locked unreamed tibial nail or a monolateral fixator in a sheep model. Interfragmentary movements and ground reaction parameters were monitored in vivo throughout the healing period. After sacrifice, the tibiae were examined mechanically and histologically. Bending angles and axial torsion at the fracture site were larger in the nail group within the first five weeks post-operatively. Unlike the fixator group, the operated limb in the nail group did not return to full weight bearing during the treatment period. Mechanical and histomorphometrical observations showed significantly inferior bone healing in the nail group compared to the fixator group. In this study, unreamed nailing of a tibial diastasis did not provide rotational stability of the osteosynthesis and resulted in a significant delay in bone healing. ? 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The exact pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar and keloid formation is still unknown and a good therapy to prevent or treat these scars is lacking. Because immunological processes seem to be important in excessive scar formation, immunological cells and parameters were studied in a standardized breast reduction wound-healing model in the present study. Standardized scar samples were taken from infra-mammary breast reduction scars, 3 and 12 months following surgery. The samples were investigated for their number of mast cells, Langerhans cells, T-lymphocytes, and macrophages, and the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and counter-regulating interferon-gamma (?-IFN), in relation to the scar's clinical appearance?normal or hypertrophic. In this study, hypertrophic scar formation was significantly associated with an increased number of epidermal Langerhans cells (p = 0.0001) and significantly (p < 0.05) increased expression of epidermal IL-4. No relationship was found between mast cell, T-lymphocyte and macrophage numbers or ?-IFN staining and the formation of normal or hypertrophic scars. These results, combined with previous observation of abnormal keratinocyte behaviour in this context, indicate that the epidermal immune barrier plays an important role in the development of hypertrophic scars.

AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.
