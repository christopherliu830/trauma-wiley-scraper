Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.

AB  - Abstract Background Distinct gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) consistent with increased sympathetic nervous system activity have been described in different populations under chronic stress. Neuroinflammatory brain changes, possibly related to the migration of primed monocytes to the brain, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a stress-sensitive gastrointestinal disorder associated with altered brain-gut interactions and increased sympathetic/vagal tone and anxiety. Reports about immune alterations in IBS are conflicting. This pilot study aimed to test how PBMC gene expression inflammatory profiles are correlated with altered brain signatures in the salience system. Methods Sixteen IBS and 16 healthy controls (HCs) completed resting state MRI scans. Gene expression profiles in PBMCs were assessed using human transcriptome array-2. Bioinformatic analyses determined differential expression of PBMCs between IBS and HCs. Partial least squares, a multivariate analysis technique, was used to identify disease correlations between PBMC gene expression profiles and functional activity in the brain's salience network. Key Results Regions of the salience network, including the mid cingulate cortex, and mid and superior temporal gyrus were positively correlated with several pro-inflammatory genes (interleukin 6, APOL2) in IBS, but negatively correlated with several anti-inflammatory genes (KRT8, APOA4) in HCs. Conclusions & Inferences Based on rodent studies, one may speculate that chronically activated stress signaling pathways in IBS maintain a pro-inflammatory state in the periphery. Alternatively, primed monocytes may migrate to the brain during stress, inducing regional neuroinflammatory changes in salience regions involved in the modulation of visceral sensitivity.

AB  - Abstract Aims and objectives:? The study aimed to evaluate the predictive validity and accuracy of a new pressure ulcer risk assessment scale in two Indonesia intensive care units (ICUs). Background:? Several risk assessment scales have been designed to identify patients at risk of developing pressure ulcers in ICU. However, the relative weight of each variable that contributes to pressure ulcer development in these scales is not described to enable designing of a risk assessment scale. Currently, the risk factors contributing to pressure ulcer development include interface pressure, body temperature and cigarette smoking. Design:? A prospective cohort study was conducted in two ICUs in Pontianak, Indonesia. Methods:? A total of 253 patients were recruited to the study from both hospitals. Data collection included new risk assessment scale [i.e. the Suriadi and Sanada (S.S.) scale] scoring, demographic, pressure ulcer severity scores (based on the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel) and skin condition measures. Using the S.S. scale, trained data collectors scored patients once and assessed the body temperature daily until patients were discharged. Additionally, daily data were also collected in relation to the patient?s skin condition and stage of pressure ulcer. Results:? Out of the 253 patients, 72 (28·4%) developed pressure ulcers. In ICU A, the incidence was 27%; pressure ulcers developed into stage I (41·7%), stage II (45·8%), stage III (10·4%) and stage IV (2·1%). In ICU B, the incidence was 31·6%; the development of pressure ulcers was 48% in stage I and 52% in stage II. Using the predictive validity test, the S.S. scale balanced sensitivity (81%) and specificity (83%) at a cut-off score of 4. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0·888 (confidence interval: 0·84?0·93). Conclusion:? The S.S. scale was found to be a valid risk assessment tool to identify the patients at risk of developing pressure ulcers in Indonesia ICU.

Explosions in the understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms which lead to type 2 diabetes have recently been elucidated. In particular, the central role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the unfolding protein response (UPR) in insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has recently been discovered. We hypothesize that ER stress and UPR are not only central for type 2 diabetes but also for stress-induced diabetes. We review here the evidence that post-burn insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia have pathophysiologic mechanisms in common with type 2 diabetes. These recent discoveries not only highlight the importance of ER stress in the post-burn patient recovery, but furthermore enable new models to study fundamental and interventional aspects of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Biomarker analysis and proteomic discovery in pediatric sickle cell disease has the potential to lead to important discoveries and improve care. The aim of this review article is to describe proteomic and biomarker articles involving neurological and developmental complications in this population. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant research publications. Articles were selected for children under the age of 21 years with the most common subtypes of sickle cell disease. Included articles focused on growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor), intra and extracellular brain proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (interleukin-1?, l-selectin, thrombospondin-1, erythrocyte, and platelet-derived microparticles). Positive findings include increases in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor and platelet-derived growth factor with elevated transcranial Dopplers velocities, increases in platelet-derived growth factor isoform AA with overt stroke, and increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein with acute brain injury. These promising potential neuro-biomarkers provide insight into pathophysiologic processes and clinical events, but their clinical utility is yet to be established. Additional proteomics research is needed, including broad-based proteomic discovery of plasma constituents and blood cell proteins, as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid components, before, during and after neurological and developmental complications.

AB  - Abstract Aim The study purpose is to explore adolescent and adult women's experiences, perceptions, beliefs, knowledge and behaviours related to bladder health across the life course using a socioecological perspective. Lower urinary tract symptoms affect between 20?40% of young adult to middle-aged women, with symptoms increasing in incidence and severity with aging. There is limited evidence to address bladder health promotion and prevention of dysfunction. This first study of the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium is designed to address gaps in existing qualitative research in this area. Design This focus group study will be implemented across seven geographically diverse United States research centres using a semi-structured focus group guide informed by a conceptual framework based on the socioecological model. Methods The study was approved in July 2017. A total of 44 focus groups composed of 6?8 participants representing six different age categories (ranging from 11 to over 65 years) will be completed. We aim to recruit participants with diverse demographic and personal characteristics including race, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, urban/rural residence, physical/health conditions, and urinary symptom experience. Six of the focus groups will be conducted in Spanish and translated into English. Focus group transcripts will undergo content analysis and data interpretation to identify and classify themes and articulate emerging themes. Discussion This foundational qualitative study seeks to develop an evidence base to inform future research on bladder health promotion in adolescent and adult women. Impact This study has the potential to provide new insights and understanding into adolescent and adult women's lived experience of bladder health, the experience of lower urinary symptoms and knowledge and beliefs across the life course.

AB  - The inflammatory reflex is a neurophysiological mechanism that regulates the immune system. The efferent branch of the reflex the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which inhibits inflammation by suppressing cytokine synthesis via release of acetylcholine in organs of the reticuloendothelial system, including the spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Acetylcholine binds to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed by macrophages and other cytokine-producing cells. Receptor-ligand engagement suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and prevents tissue damage. Herein is a review of some of the experimental studies that define the inflammatory reflex and its anatomic and physiologic components.

AB  - Background/purpose: Epidermal injury is common but the accuracy of visual methods is significantly impacted by the inherent skin pigmentation. We examined imaging and fluorescence techniques to quantify tissue injury as a function of skin color. Methods: Epidermal and mucosal scratches were created in 20 light- (L* 68.2±2.3) and 20 dark-skinned (L* 46.4±5.2) females. Injured and uninjured sites were treated with toluidine blue (TB), fluorescein (FL) and a TB/FL mixture and photographed under conditions of white and fluorescent light. Area and intensity parameters were determined. Results: Injured sites with TB and TB/FL had higher areas than the control for both light and dark subjects (anova, P<0.05). The intensity of the injured TB site was higher than the control for light skin only. The areas of injured sites with FL and TB/FL were higher than the control for both groups as were the intensities of the injured sites with FL. The findings were similar for the lip skin. Conclusions: Application of TB and FL contrasts under white and fluorescent light can be used to quantify tissue injuries for L* values >35 and is a promising approach for the quantitation across a range of skin pigmentation.

AB  - Modern medical practices allow patients to survive acute insults and be sustained by machinery and medicines for extended periods of time. We define chronic critical illness as a later stage of prolonged critical illness that requires tracheotomy. These patients have persistent elevations of inflammatory cytokines, diminished hypothalamic?pituitary function, hypercatabolism, immobilization, and malnutrition. The measurement of bone turnover markers reveals markedly enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption that is uncoupled from osteoblastic bone formation. We review the mechanisms by which these factors contribute to the metabolic bone disease of chronic critical illness and suggest potential therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive transfusion (MTP) protocol design is hindered by lack of accurate assessment of coagulation. Rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) provides point-of-care (POC) analysis of clot formation. We designed a prospective study to test the hypothesis that integrating TEG into our MTP would facilitate goal-directed therapy and provide equivalent outcomes compared to conventional coagulation testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thiry-four patients who received more than 6 units of red blood cells (RBCs)/6 hours who were admitted to our Level 1 trauma center after r-TEG implementation (TEG) were compared to 34 patients admitted prior to TEG implementation (Pre-TEG). Data are presented as mean?±?SEM. RESULTS: Emergency department pre-TEG versus TEG shock, and coagulation indices, were not different: systolic blood pressure (94?mmHg vs.101?mmHg), temperature (35.3°C vs. 35.9°C), pH (7.16 vs. 7.11), base deficit (?13.0 vs. ?14.7), lactate (6.5 vs. 8.1), international normalized ratio (INR; 1.59 vs. 1.83), and partial thromboplastin time (48.3 vs. 57.9). Although not significant, patients with Injury Severity Score range 26 to 35 were more frequent in the pre-TEG group. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)?:?RBCs, platelets?:?RBCs, and cryoprecipitate (cryo)?:?RBC ratios were not significantly different at 6 or 12 hours. INR at 6 hours did not discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors (p?=?0.10), whereas r-TEG ?G? value was significantly associated with survival (p?=?0.03), as was the maximum rate of thrombin generation (MRTG; mm/min) and total thrombin generation (TG; area under the curve) (p?=?0.03 for both). Patients with MRTG of more than 9.2 received significantly less components of RBCs, FFP, and cryo (p?=?0.048, p?=?0.03, and p?=?0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Goal-directed resuscitation via r-TEG appears useful for management of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Further experience with POC monitoring could result in more efficient management leading to a reduction of transfusion requirements.

AB  - Abstract??? Background: The clinical and radiographic success of two types of white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as apical barriers in non-vital immature permanent incisors in children was investigated. Materials and methods: Following an initial dressing with calcium hydroxide, MTA apical barriers were placed in 22 non-vital traumatized, permanent incisors with open apices in 21 children (mean age 10?years). Teeth were alternately assigned to either white MTA ProRoot? or white MTA Angelus groups and treated by two operators. Clinical and radiographic reviews took place at baseline, 3?months and every 6?months thereafter. Two other calibrated, blinded examiners evaluated all radiographs. Examiner agreement was assessed using Kappa?Cohen tests. Results were analysed using Fisher?s exact tests and repeated measures anova. Results: The mean follow-up time was 23.4?months. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical or radiographic outcomes between the two groups. The overall clinical success and relative radiographic success rate was 95.5%. Statistically significant reduction in periapical pathosis was shown over time in both groups (P?<?0.05). A significant relationship was identified between non-divergent apical anatomy and ideal positioning of the MTA plug in all teeth (P?=?0.04). Interestingly, coronal discolouration was observed in 22.7% of teeth following white MTA placement. Conclusions: Apical barrier placement using both white MTA ProRoot? and white MTA Angelus after an initial calcium hydroxide dressing showed similar favourable clinical and radiographic outcomes.

AB  - Summary Mice injected with endotoxin develop endotoxaemia and endotoxin-induced death, accompanied by the oxidative burst and overproduction of inflammatory mediators. Lactoferrin, an iron binding protein, provides a natural feedback mechanism to control the development of such metabolic imbalance and protects against deleterious effects of endotoxin. We investigated the effects of intraperitoneal administration of human lactoferrin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and nitric oxide (NO) in vivo. Lactoferrin was administered as a prophylactic, concurrent or therapeutic event relative to endotoxic shock by intravenous injection of LPS. Inflammatory mediators were measured in serum at 2, 6 and 18 h post-shock induction. Administration of lactoferrin 1 h before LPS resulted in a rather uniform inhibition of all mediators; TNF by 82%, IL-6 by 43%, IL-10 by 47% at 2 h following LPS injection,and reduction in NO (80%) at 6 h post-shock. Prophylactic administration of lactoferrin at 18 h prior to LPS injection resulted in similar decreases in TNF-α (95%) and in NO (62%), but no statistical reduction in IL-6 or IL-10. Similarly, when lactoferrin was administered as a therapeutic post-induction of endotoxic shock, significant reductions were apparent in TNF-α and NO in serum, but no significant effect was seen on IL-6 and IL-10. These results suggest that the mechanism of action for lactoferrin contains a component for differential regulation of cellular immune responses during in vivo models of sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To describe a severe case of bacterial sepsis and disseminated candidiasis in a previously healthy dog. Case Summary ? Fungal sepsis was identified in a 2-year-old dog following intestinal dehiscence 4 days after abdominal surgery. Septic peritonitis was identified at admission and evidence of dehiscence at the previous enterotomy site was found during an exploratory laparotomy. Both gram-positive cocci and Candida albicans were cultured from the abdominal cavity. Candida sp. was also subsequently cultured from a central venous catheter. Euthanasia was performed due to failure to respond to therapy. Fungal organisms, morphologically consistent with Candida spp., were found in the lungs and kidney on postmortem histopathologic examination indicating disseminated candidiasis. New or Unique Information Provided ? Candida peritonitis is a well-recognized entity in humans and contributes to morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Abdominal surgery, intestinal perforation, presence of central venous catheters, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics are all considered to be suspected risk factors. This report describes the first known case of systemic candidiasis occurring secondary to Candida peritonitis and bacterial sepsis in a critically ill dog.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? The incidence of Peyronie's disease (PD) in the general population is believed to be as high as 20%. However, most of the data concerning the prevalence of PD have been obtained from Caucasian populations. Aim.? The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of PD in Asia and among men undergoing hemodialysis and discuss the pathophysiology of PD. Methods.? A total of 1,090 men who received a routine health check at our hospital (control group) as well as 130 male patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled. The diagnosis of PD was based on a palpable penile plaque. Main Outcome Measures.? Hemodialysis patients were asked about their sexual activity and completed the International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaires. The differences between patients' and hemodialysis-associated factors, comorbidities, and medications were statistically assessed for patients with and without PD. Results.? The prevalence of PD was significantly increased among hemodialysis patients (12 patients: 9.2%) relative the control group (six men: 0.6%) (P?<?0.0001, odds ratio: 18.4). In both groups, the plaques were primarily allocated dorsally. In the hemodialysis patients with PD, the frequency of masturbation (P?<?0.05) and the incidence of moderate or severe erectile dysfunction (P?<?0.01) were significantly higher than those among hemodialysis patients without PD. In comparison with patients without PD, the number of acetate dialysate users was significantly higher among patients with PD (P?<?0.05), and none of the PD patients used angiotensin-related antihypertensive drugs (P?<?0.05). Conclusions.? The prevalence of PD in healthy Japanese men is low (0.6%), which suggests the existence of racial differences in the prevalence of PD. Moreover, these results indicate that hemodialysis increases the incidence of PD. The differences in the characteristics between male hemodialysis patients with and without PD provide new insights into the pathophysiology and therapeutic window of PD.

AB  - Abstract In this study, the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rd (GS Rd) were evaluated in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Rats in SCI groups received a T8 laminectomy and a spinal contusion injury. GS Rd 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally 1 hr before the surgery and once daily for 14 days. Dexamethasone 1 mg/kg was administered as a positive control. Locomotor function was evaluated using the BBB score system. H&E staining and Nissl staining were performed to observe the histological changes in the spinal cord. The levels of MDA and GSH and the activity of SOD were assessed to reflect the oxidative stress state. The production of TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-1 was assessed using ELISA kits to examine the inflammatory responses in the spinal cord. TUNEL staining was used to detect the cell apoptosis in the spinal cord. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and MAPK proteins. The results demonstrated that GS Rd 25 and 50 mg/kg significantly improved the locomotor function of rats after SCI, reduced tissue injury and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord. Mechanically, GS Rd decreased MDA level, increased GSH level and SOD activity, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented cell apoptosis. The effects were equivalent to those of dexamethasone. In addition, GS Rd effectively inhibited the activation of MAPK signalling pathway induced by SCI, which might be involved in the protective effects of GS Rd against SCI. In conclusion, GS Rd attenuates SCI-induced secondary injury through reversing the redox-state imbalance, inhibiting the inflammatory response and apoptosis in the spinal cord tissue.
