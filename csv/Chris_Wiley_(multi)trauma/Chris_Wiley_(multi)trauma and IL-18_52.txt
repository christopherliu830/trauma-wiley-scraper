AB  - Abstract Altered inflammation in the early stage has long been assumed to affect subsequent steps of the repair process that could influence proper wound healing and remodeling. However, the lack of explicit experimental data makes the connection between dysregulated wound inflammation and poor wound healing elusive. To bridge this gap, we used the established rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model for studying the causal effect of dysregulated inflammation. We induced an exacerbated and prolonged inflammatory state in these wounds with the combination of trauma-related stimulators of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and damage-associated molecular patterns from a dermal homogenate. In stimulated wounds, a heightened and lengthened inflammation was observed based on quantitative measurements of IL-6 expression, tissue polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Along with the high level of inflammation, wound healing parameters (epithelial gap and others) at postoperative day 7 and 16 were significantly altered in stimulated wounds compared to unstimulated controls. By postoperative day 35, scar elevation of stimulated wounds was higher than that of control wounds (scar elevation index: 1.90 vs. 1.39, p?<?0.01). Moreover, treatment of these inflamed wounds with Indomethacin (at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.4%) reduced scar elevation but with adverse effects of delayed wound closure and increased cartilage hypertrophy. In summary, successful establishment of this inflamed wound model provides a platform to understand these detrimental aspects of unchecked inflammation and to further test agents that can modulate local inflammation to improve wound outcomes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? The incidence of Peyronie's disease (PD) in the general population is believed to be as high as 20%. However, most of the data concerning the prevalence of PD have been obtained from Caucasian populations. Aim.? The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of PD in Asia and among men undergoing hemodialysis and discuss the pathophysiology of PD. Methods.? A total of 1,090 men who received a routine health check at our hospital (control group) as well as 130 male patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled. The diagnosis of PD was based on a palpable penile plaque. Main Outcome Measures.? Hemodialysis patients were asked about their sexual activity and completed the International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaires. The differences between patients' and hemodialysis-associated factors, comorbidities, and medications were statistically assessed for patients with and without PD. Results.? The prevalence of PD was significantly increased among hemodialysis patients (12 patients: 9.2%) relative the control group (six men: 0.6%) (P?<?0.0001, odds ratio: 18.4). In both groups, the plaques were primarily allocated dorsally. In the hemodialysis patients with PD, the frequency of masturbation (P?<?0.05) and the incidence of moderate or severe erectile dysfunction (P?<?0.01) were significantly higher than those among hemodialysis patients without PD. In comparison with patients without PD, the number of acetate dialysate users was significantly higher among patients with PD (P?<?0.05), and none of the PD patients used angiotensin-related antihypertensive drugs (P?<?0.05). Conclusions.? The prevalence of PD in healthy Japanese men is low (0.6%), which suggests the existence of racial differences in the prevalence of PD. Moreover, these results indicate that hemodialysis increases the incidence of PD. The differences in the characteristics between male hemodialysis patients with and without PD provide new insights into the pathophysiology and therapeutic window of PD.

AB  - Abstract In this study, the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rd (GS Rd) were evaluated in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Rats in SCI groups received a T8 laminectomy and a spinal contusion injury. GS Rd 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally 1 hr before the surgery and once daily for 14 days. Dexamethasone 1 mg/kg was administered as a positive control. Locomotor function was evaluated using the BBB score system. H&E staining and Nissl staining were performed to observe the histological changes in the spinal cord. The levels of MDA and GSH and the activity of SOD were assessed to reflect the oxidative stress state. The production of TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-1 was assessed using ELISA kits to examine the inflammatory responses in the spinal cord. TUNEL staining was used to detect the cell apoptosis in the spinal cord. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and MAPK proteins. The results demonstrated that GS Rd 25 and 50 mg/kg significantly improved the locomotor function of rats after SCI, reduced tissue injury and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord. Mechanically, GS Rd decreased MDA level, increased GSH level and SOD activity, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented cell apoptosis. The effects were equivalent to those of dexamethasone. In addition, GS Rd effectively inhibited the activation of MAPK signalling pathway induced by SCI, which might be involved in the protective effects of GS Rd against SCI. In conclusion, GS Rd attenuates SCI-induced secondary injury through reversing the redox-state imbalance, inhibiting the inflammatory response and apoptosis in the spinal cord tissue.

AB  - Rationale Many recent studies suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system play a protective role in the impairment of vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cell. Aims The study aims to determine whether tissue kallikrein is efficacy for preventing the long-term in-stent restenosis after stenting of symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery M1 segment. Design This is a Phase II, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. In line with SAMMPRIS stenting indications, patients (n?=?90) with the symptomatic the middle cerebral artery M1 segment stenosis ≥70% and successfully treated with stent will be enrolled. Eligible patients will be randomized using computer generated numbers, and allocated to receive tissue kallikrein treatment or not. Patients in tissue kallikrein treatment group will be prescribed with intravenous infusion of tissue kallikrein (0·15 PNAU/d, dissolved in 100?ml saline) for 7 days after stenting and then oral administration of pancreatic kallikrein enteric-coated tablet (240?U, 3/d) to the end of study. As the foundation treatment, all the enrolled patients will receive aspirin (100?mg/d), clopidogrel (75?mg/d), and atorvastatin (20?mg/d) for the first 6 months and continue with the combination of aspirin and atorvastatin at the previous dosage. Study outcomes Patients will be evaluated at 1, 6 and 12 months after stenting. The primary outcomes are the in-stent restenosis rate, new stroke or aggravation of the previous ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the severe stenotic artery. Secondary outcomes include stroke of other artery territories, myocardial infarction and vascular death. Modification of stroke knowledge, exercise and diet habit, smoking cessation and available laboratory data will also be recorded. Conclusion As our pilot study, tissue kallikrein would be expected to prevent the long-term in-stent restenosis after stenting of the symptomatic middle cerebral artery dramatically.

AB  - Background: We investigated the incidence and severity of post-injury morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)-treated trauma patients. We also identified risk factors in the early phase after injury that predicted the later development of complications. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study design was used. One hundred and sixty-four adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24?h were included during a 21-month period. The incidence and severity of morbidity such as multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), severe sepsis and 30-day post-injury mortality were calculated and risk factors were analyzed with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The median age was 40 years, the injury severity score was 24, the new injury severity score was 29, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 15, sequential organ failure assessment maximum was 7 and ICU length of stay was 3.1 days. The incidences of post-injury MOF were 40.2%, ALI 25.6%, severe sepsis 31.1% and 30-day mortality 10.4%. The independent risk factors differed to some extent between the outcome parameters. Age, severity of injury, significant head injury and massive transfusion were independent risk factors for several outcome parameters. Positive blood alcohol was only a predictor of MOF, whereas prolonged rescue time only predicted death. Unexpectedly, injury severity was not an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions: Although the incidence of morbidity was considerable, mortality was relatively low. Early post-injury risk factors that predicted later development of complications differed between morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Summary A shortage of size-matched organs and tissues is the key factor limiting transplantation in children. Empirical data on procurement from pediatric donors is sparse. This study investigated donor identification, parental consent, and effectuation rates, as well as adherence to the national protocol. A national retrospective cohort study was conducted in all eight Dutch pediatric intensive care units. Records of deceased children were analyzed by an independent donation officer. Seventy-four (11%) of 683 deceased children were found to be suitable for organ donation and 132 (19%) for tissue donation. Sixty-two (84%) potential organ donors had been correctly identified; the parental consent and effectuation rate was 42%. Sixty-three (48%) potential tissue donors had been correctly identified; the parental consent and effectuation rate was 27%. Correct identification increased with age (logistic regression, organs: P?=?.024; tissues: P?=?.011). Although an overall identification rate of 84% of potential organ donors may seem acceptable, the variation observed suggests room for improvement, as does the overall low rate of identification of pediatric tissue donors. Efforts to address the shortage of organs and tissues for transplantation in children should focus on identifying potential donors and on the reasons why parents do not consent.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The consequence of excessive liver resection is the inexorable development of progressive liver failure characterised by the typical stigmata associated with this condition, including worsening coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinaemia and encephalopathy. The focus of this review will be to investigate factors contributing to hepatocyte loss and impaired regeneration. Methods A literature search was undertaken of Pubmed and related search engines, examining for articles relating to hepatic failure following major hepatectomy. Results In spite of improvements in adjuvant chemotherapy and increasing surgical confidence and expertise, the parameters determining how much liver can be resected have remained largely unchanged. A number of preoperative, intraoperative and post-operative factors all contribute to the likelihood of liver failure after surgery. Conclusions Given the magnitude of the surgery, mortality and morbidity rates are extremely good. Careful patient selection and preservation of an obligate volume of remnant liver is essential. Modifiable causes of hepatic failure include avoidance of sepsis, drainage of cholestasis with restoration of enteric bile salts and judicious use of portal triad inflow occlusion intra-operatively. Avoidance of post-operative sepsis is most likely to be achieved by patient selection, meticulous intra-operative technique and post-operative care. Modulation of portal vein pressures post-operatively may further help reduce the risk of liver failure.

AB  - Abstract Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2-CDG) is the most common congenital disorder of N-glycosylation and is caused by a deficient PMM2 activity. The clinical presentation and the onset of PMM2-CDG vary among affected individuals ranging from a severe antenatal presentation with multisystem involvement to mild adulthood presentation limited to minor neurological involvement. Management of affected patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, a systematic review of the literature on PMM2-CDG was conducted by a group of international experts in different aspects of CDG. Our managment guidelines were initiated based on the available evidence-based data and experts' opinions. This guideline mainly addresses the clinical evaluation of each system/organ involved in PMM2-CDG, and the recommended management approach. It is the first systematic review of current practices in PMM2-CDG and the first guidelines aiming at establishing a practical approach to the recognition, diagnosis and management of PMM2-CDG patients.

AB  - Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of acute hypoxic respiratory failure in pregnancy. This chapter discusses the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of ARDS in pregnant patients. Ware and Matthay described the pathophysiology of ARDS. Alveolar and/or capillary endothelial injury is the predominant mechanism in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Tocolytic-induced pulmonary edema (TPE) is an important cause of ARDS. Risk factors for TPE are multiple gestation, infection, and corticosteroid therapy. Management of TPE includes stopping the drug, diuresis, and supportive care. The management of ARDS in pregnancy is complicated. It requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both maternal and fetal aspects of care. There are no formal studies on the use of high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) in pregnancy, but the pregnant patient in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with baseline raised respiratory drive, fits the phenotype of the patient who might benefit from early use of HFOT.

AB  - Abstract Infection remains the Achilles heel of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. However, an optimal antimicrobial surgical infection prophylaxis (SIP) regimen has not been established. This study evaluated the efficacy of a single-drug SIP compared to a multi-drug SIP on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing continuous-flow LVAD (CF-LVAD) and pulsatile LVAD (P-LVAD) implantation. An electronic search was performed to identify studies in the English literature on SIP regimens in patients undergoing LVAD implantation. Identified articles were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen articles with 1,311 (CF-LVAD: 888; P-LVAD: 423) patients were analyzed. Overall, 501 (38.0%) patients received single-drug SIP, whereas 810 (62.0%) received multi-drug SIP. Time to infection was comparable between groups. There was no significant difference in overall incidence of LVAD-specific infections [single-drug: 18.7% vs. multi-drug: 24.8%, P = 0.49] including driveline infections [single-drug: 14.1% vs. multi-drug: 20.8%, P = 0.37]. Compared to single-drug SIP, patients who received multi-drug SIP had a significantly lower survival rate [single-drug: 90.0% vs. multi-drug: 76.0%, P = 0.01] and infection-free survival rate [single-drug: 88.4% vs. multi-drug: 77.3%, P = 0.04] at 90 days. However, there were no significant differences in 1-year survival and 1-year infection-free survival between groups. No survival differences were observed in the CF-LVAD subset as well. This study demonstrated no additional advantage of a multi-drug compared to a single-drug regimen for SIP. Although there was a modest advantage in early survival among CF-LVAD and P-LVAD patients who received single-drug SIP, there were no significant differences in the 1-year survival and 1-year infection-free survival.

The eligible children with ALI were assigned to either probiotic treatment or an identical placebo for 10 days. Serum ghrelin, SP-A(surfactant protein-A), TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations were assessed at baseline and at the end of trial. Meanwhile, pulmonary function test and echocardiography were examined, then VPEF (volume to peak tidal expiratory flow), TPEF/TE (the ratio of time taken to reach peak expiratory flow to total expiratory time), MAP (mean arterial pressure), and PAP (pulmonary artery pressure) were recorded. Results Eighty participants fulfilled the study requirements with 40 children for each group. The groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. Serum SP-A, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in the probiotic group were 212.6?±?52.9?ng/mL, 401.9?±?56.4?pg/mL, and 245.1?±?55.1?pg/mL on day 10, respectively, significantly lower levels compared to the control group where the same parameters were 248.2?±?57?ng/mL, 449.4?±?60.1?pg/mL, and 308.3?±?92.2?pg/mL (P?<?0.01). However, ghrelin concentrations were elevated in the intervention group (P?<?0.05). On measurement of pulmonary function, the probiotic group demonstrated a VPEF of 26.1?±?4.2?mL and TPEF/TE of 29.1?±?4.7%, which were higher than the control group (24.7?±?4.3?mL and 26.9?±?4.7%, respectively) (P?<?0.05). MAP and PAP also improved in the probiotic group (P?<?0.05). Furthermore, ghrelin, SP-A, TNF-α, IL-6, and PAP were negatively correlated. Positive correlations were found between ghrelin, TPEF/TE, and MAP. There were no probiotic-associated adverse events during the observation. Conclusion Probiotics administrated to children with ALI alleviates the inflammation of lungs, improves pulmonary function and circulation by ghrelin.

AB  - There is increasing uncertainty over the potential benefits and harms of volume expansion in paediatric and adult critical care settings. In addition, there are increasing numbers of reports of adverse effects and association with RBC transfusions in neonates, including transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis. Preterm infants <28 weeks? gestation in particular are likely more vulnerable to volume shifts and changes in blood pressure due to their unique physiology. This review paper will provide an overview of the current evidence base supporting the use of RBC transfusion thresholds and the use of fluid bolus therapy in neonates. We will argue that enhanced data collection and collaborations through neonatal networks, development of international consensus definitions of transfusion adverse effects and associations, as well as haemodynamic compromise in neonates, are needed to further advance research in these areas.

AB  - Abstract??? It is important that mouthguards have an adequate thickness of material if they are to be effective in the prevention of trauma. The aim of this study was to quantify dimensional changes that occur on thermoforming ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sheets used in the construction of mouthguards. Fourteen batches of 3?mm thick sheet EVA were thermoformed over dental models under a number of common processing conditions including, model height, inclination, shape and model temperature, model position on thermoforming platform, plasticizing time and evacuation method. Thickness of thermoformed material was determined at anterior and posterior sites and measurements were compared to determine the magnitude and patterns of stretching collectively and within each processing condition. Overall, sheets of 3-mm EVA stretched by 52% during the thermoforming conditions tested. Incisal/cuspal sites were found to be significantly thinner when compared with all other locations measured. A number of thermoforming conditions were demonstrated to have a significant effect on the degree to which the EVA material stretched. For the combination of materials and equipment tested in this study, current thermoforming practices may cause excessive thinning of EVA in critical areas including incisal edges and cusp tips, thereby reducing the protective effect for professionally made mouthguards. To optimize protection in vulnerable areas, it is important that clinicians distinguish between EVA sheet thickness and the cross-sectional dimensions achieved in the finished mouthguards. They need to be specific in their prescription of the thickness of material they require especially in critical areas.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.
