AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background:? Pre-treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs of the statin family may exert protective effects in patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage but their effects are not clear in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Methods:? We recruited patients admitted to our University Hospital with an acute ICH and analysed pre-admission demographic variables, pre-morbid therapy, clinical and radiological prognostic markers and outcome variables including 90-day modified Rankin score and NIH stroke scale score (NIHSS). Results:? We recruited 399 patients with ICH of which 101 (25%) were using statins. Statin users more often had vascular risk factors, had significantly lower haematoma volumes (P?=?0.04) and had lower mortality rates compared with non-users (45.6% vs. 56.1%; P?=?0.11). However, statin treatment did not have a statistically significant impact on mortality or functional outcome on multiple logistic regression analysis. Conclusions:? Treatment with statins prior to ICH failed to show a significant impact on outcome in this analysis despite lower haematoma volumes.

AB  - Objective To compare surgical trauma, perioperative pain, surgical time, and complication rate in mares undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy by natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopy. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Healthy mares (n = 12). Methods Ovariectomy was performed with a vessel-sealing device by transvaginal NOTES (n = 6) using a flexible endoscope and specialized instruments or by bilateral flank laparoscopy (n = 6). Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) play a crucial role in dental pulp inflammation. Pannexin 3 (Panx3), a member of Panxs (Pannexins), has been recently found to be involved in inflammation. However, the mechanism of Panx3 in human dental pulp inflammation remains unclear. In this study, the role of Panx3 in inflammatory response was firstly explored, and its potential mechanism was proposed. Immunohistochemical staining showed that Panx3 levels were diminished in inflamed human and rat dental pulp tissues. In vitro, Panx3 expression was significantly down-regulated in HDPCs following a TNF-α challenge in a concentration-dependent way, which reached the lowest level at 10 ng/ml of TNF-α. Such decrease could be reversed by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Unlike MG132, BAY 11-7082, a NF-?B inhibitor, even reinforced the inhibitory effect of TNF-α. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to investigate the role of Panx3 in inflammatory response of HDPCs. TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-6, were significantly lessened when Panx3 was overexpressed in HDPCs. Conversely, Panx3 knockdown exacerbated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, Western blot, dual-luciferase reporter assay, immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR and ELISA results showed that Panx3 participated in dental pulp inflammation in a NF-?B-dependent manner. These findings suggested that Panx3 has a defensive role in dental pulp inflammation, serving as a potential target to be exploited for the intervention of human dental pulp inflammation.

AB  - Brain inflammation has been implicated in the development of brain edema and secondary brain damage in ischemia and trauma. Adhesion molecules, cytokines and leukocyte chemoattractants released/presented at the site of blood-brain barrier (BBB) play an important role in mobilizing peripheral inflammatory cells into the brain. Cerebral endothelial cells (CEC) are actively engaged in processes of microvascular stasis and leukocyte infiltration by producing a plethora of pro-inflammatory mediators. When challenged by external stimuli including cytokines and hypoxia, CEC have been shown to release/express various products of arachidonic acid cascade with both vasoactive and pro-inflammatory properties, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These metabolites induce platelet and neutrophil activation and adhesion, changes in local cerebral blood flow and blood rheology, and increases in BBB permeability. Ischemic CEC have also been shown to express and release bioactive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-I?, IL-8 and MCP-1. Many of these mediators and ischemia in vitro and in vivo have been shown to up-regulate the expression of both selectin and Ig-families of adhesion molecules in CEC and to facilitate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration into the brain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a pivotal role of CEC in initiating and regulating inflammatory responses in cerebral ischemia. Summary Inflammatory genes/mediators are involved in molecular/biochemical cascades determining stroke outcome. Cerebral endothelial cells, targeted by inflammatory mediators produced in ischemic brain, undergo pro-inflammatory activation by expressing/secreting various inflammatory mediators, thus becoming a source of inflammation themselves. A unique position of the cerebral endothelial cells at the interface between blood and brain establishes their role as principal regulators of peripheral inflammatory cell recruitment into the brain during stroke. Cerebral endothelial cells also exhibit ability to regulate vasomotor responses of brain microcirculation and the permeability of the BBB, both important components of inflammation. Therefore, approaches to attenuate consequences of stroke must take into consideration cerebral endothelial cells as an easily accessible target to interfere with the ischemic brain inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Despite improvements in medical and surgical treatment of intestinal failure, intestine transplant continues to play an important role. In 2017, 109 intestine transplants were performed, 62 in adults and 47 in children, reflecting the changed age distribution over the past decade of candidates waitlisted for intestine and intestine-liver transplant from largely pediatric to increasing proportions of adults. In 2017, 56.0% of candidates on the intestine list at any time during the year were aged younger than 18 years, with a decrease over time in those aged younger than 6 years and an increase in those aged 6-17 years. Adults accounted for 44.0% of candidates on the list at any time during the year, with an increase since 2013 in those aged 18-34 years and a decrease in those aged 35 years or older. By age, the pretransplant mortality rate was highest for adult candidates at 7.9 per 100 waitlist-years and lowest for pediatric candidates at 3.7 per 100 waitlist-years. Patient survival varied by age and type of transplant, and was lowest for adult intestine-liver recipients (1- and 5-year survival 66.7% and 42.6%, respectively) and highest for pediatric intestine recipients (1- and 5-year survival 86.2% and 75.4%, respectively).

AB  - Abstract Aims To evaluate a deep oropharyngeal suction intervention (NO-ASPIRATE) in intubated patients on microaspiration, ventilator-associated events and clinical outcomes. Design Prospective, two-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Methods The study was conducted between 2014 - 2017 in 513 participants enroled within 24 hr of intubation and randomized into NO-ASPIRATE or usual care groups. Standard oral care was provided to all participants every 4 hr and deep oropharyngeal suctioning was added to the NO-ASPIRATE group. Oral and tracheal specimens were obtained to quantify α-amylase as an aspiration biomarker. Results Data were analysed for 410 study completers enrolled at least 36 hr: NO-ASPIRATE (N = 206) and usual care (N = 204). Percent of tracheal specimens positive for α-amylase, mean tracheal α-amylase levels over time and ventilator-associated events were not different between groups. The NO-ASPIRATE group had a shorter hospital length of stay and a subgroup with moderate aspiration at baseline had significantly lower α-amylase levels across time. Conclusion Hospital length of stay was shorter in the NO-ASPIRATE group and a subgroup of intervention participants had lower α-amylase across time. Delivery of standardized oral care to all participants may have been an intervention itself and possibly associated with the lack of significant findings for most outcomes. Impact This trial compared usual care to oral care with a deep suctioning intervention on microaspiration and ventilator-associated events, as this has not been systematically studied. Further research on the usefulness of α-amylase as an aspiration biomarker and the role of oral suctioning, especially for certain populations, is indicated.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence, distribution, and features of alveolar dehiscences and fenestrations in modern American skulls and correlate their presence with occlusal attrition, root prominence, and alveolar bone thickness. Methods: A representative sample of 146 dentate modern American skulls from a collection at the National Museum of Natural History were examined. Results: The skulls were from subjects ranging in age from 17 to 87 years old (mean 49.1 years). The mean number of teeth per skull was 22.7 and the mean number of either dehiscence or fenestration defects per skull was 3.0. Of the 3,315 individual teeth examined, 4.1% (135) had dehiscences and 9.0% (298) had fenestrations. A dehiscence was present in 40.4% of the skulls, and a fenestration was present in 61.6% of skulls. Mandibular canines were most often affected by dehiscences (12.9%), while maxillary first molars were most often affected by fenestrations (37.0%). Sixty-seven percent of dehiscences were found in the mandible, and 58% of fenestrations were found in the maxilla. Conclusions: The presence of dehiscences and fenestrations were positively correlated with thin alveolar bone and negatively correlated with occlusal attrition. African-American males and Caucasian females were significantly more likely to have dehiscences, while African-American females were significantly more likely to have fenestrations.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Severity prediction is difficult early in the course of acute pancreatitis. Markers of pancreatic injury, or inflammatory activation are candidate markers of severity. The aim of the present study was to assess predictive abilities of carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide (CAPAP-B) and soluble l-selectin (sL-selectin) using samples collected on admission to hospital. Methods:? Patients with acute pancreatitis and disease (acute abdomen) and normal controls were studied. Samples were collected at admission and daily for 5?days. There were significant differences between mild and severe pancreatitis in urinary and plasma CAPAP-B on admission, C-reactive protein on day 3 and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II scores. Prediction of severity with CAPAP-B on admission was as good as with APACHE-II score after 48?h. Carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide was not raised in disease controls. By contrast, sL-selectin was lowered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and in disease controls. There was no difference between mild and severe pancreatitis. Conclusion:? Urinary CAPAP-B, a marker of acinar injury, can be used to predict severity of acute pancreatitis at the time of admission to hospital, but sL-selectin has no value in this regard. The extent of acinar injury may be a more important early marker of severity than markers of inflammatory activation.

AB  - Background:? Pancreatic necrosectomy for necrotizing pancreatitis is a formidable operation. There are limited data from the Indian subcontinent regarding outcome and recent trends in management. Methods:? Patients undergoing pancreatic necrosectomy over a 12-year period were identified from a prospective database. Data regarding the hospital course, complications and outcome were extracted by case file review. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. An attempt was made to identify trends in management and outcome over the study period. Results:? One hundred and eighteen patients underwent necrosectomy. The median age was 39.5?years (interquartile range, 32?46). Median Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score at admission was 8 (interquartile range, 6?10). Thirty-nine patients (33%) had organ failure at admission. Patients underwent surgery a median of 23?days (interquartile range, 14?34) after onset of illness. There was high incidence of loco-regional complications (68/118, 58%) and organ failure (88/118, 75%) in the postoperative period. The mortality rate was 38%. There was an increase in the median onset to surgery interval (17 vs 25.5?days; P?=?0.001), increased use of percutaneous interventions (20 vs 36%; P?=?0.05) and decreased mortality (47 vs 29%; P?=?0.052) in the later half of the study period. Conclusion:? Pancreatic necrosectomy continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in India. A trend towards increased use of percutaneous interventions and delayed surgery is evident.

AB  - Background and purpose:? Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is the most common and life-threatening form of status epilepticus (SE). The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features of CSE in western China. Methods:? Convulsive status epilepticus patients hospitalized from January 1996 to October 2007 were prospectively observed. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of prognosis. Results:? The average age of CSE patients (n?=?220) was 37.5?years (SD 20.31), 50% of the patients had a history of epilepsy. The primary cause of CSE was central nervous system infection (32.7%), followed by discontinuation or reduction of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; 15.5%). The median duration of CSE was 5?h and median duration of seizures before treatment was 2?h; both were longer in rural patients than in urban patients (P?<?0.05). The fatality rate on discharge was 15.9%. Logistic regression analysis showed the duration of CSE [odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03?1.07], a history of epilepsy (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14?0.89), and respiratory depression (OR 5.96, 95% CI 2.49?14.24) were independent predictors of CSE prognosis. Discussion:? Central nervous system infection and AEDs withdrawal in epilepsy patients were the most important causes of CSE. There is a large gap between antiepileptic therapy in China and European Status Epilepticus guidelines.

AB  - Abstract Introduction of human plasma protein genes into the mouse genome to produce transgenic mice furnishes an in vivo model for correlating chromosomal DNA sequences with developmental and tissue-specific expression. The liver produces an array of plasma proteins that circulate throughout the body contributing to homeostasis. Non-hepatic tissue sites of synthesis have been identified where a local provision of plasma proteins in needed. Analysis of expression of human plasma protein genes in ageing transgenic mice appears especialy promising in identifying DNA sequences that respond to environmental adversities such as inflammatory factors, hormonal changes and metal toxicity. The results indicate that human genes encoding and controlling liver plasma proteins serve as useful models for studying genetic regulation in the background of development and ageing.
