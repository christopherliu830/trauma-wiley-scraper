AB  - ABSTRACT Background: The use of osteotome for vertical bone augmentation and localized sinus elevation with minimal surgical trauma represents a suitable procedure to increase the vertical dimension of available bone for implant placement. Purpose: The aim of this study was to report clinical and radiographic results of localized management of sinus floor (LMSF) in fresh molar sockets at 13-year follow-up. Materials and Methods: Fifty-three patients, needing one or two maxillary molar extraction, were enrolled in this study. LMFS procedure was performed and 68 implants were positioned. A presurgical distance from the alveolar crest to the floor of the maxillary sinus and the amount of new radiopacity between the sinus floor and alveolar crest were measured from the mesial and distal surfaces of each dental implant surface. Results: After a mean follow-up period of 9.76?±?5.27 years (ranged from 4 to 17 years) a survival rate of 100% was reported. Mean bone height at temporary prosthesis placement was 7.99?±?1.16?mm. They were stable over time, reporting a mean value of 8.01?±?1.46?mm at 13-year follow-up. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that LMSF procedure in fresh molar sockets allowed to expand the dimensions of resorbed posterior maxillary alveolar bone both vertically and horizontally with a success rate of 100% of implant osseointegration over time.

AB  - Summary Herpes simplex virus (HSV) represents a smart pathogen, which displays both lytic and latent modes of interaction with its natural human host. In order to be optimally equipped for immune evasion and to reply to any attacks of the host during reactivation, HSV has developed a multitude of cleverly devised defence strategies. Dendritic cells (DC) as antigen-presenting cells located at the border zones of the body and the environment have been shown to play a crucial role as one of the first cells interacting with HSV beside epithelial cells, on one hand, and as important controllers of the viral spreading on the other hand. Here, we provide a research update about the interaction of HSV with DC and summarize the latest proceedings in this field.

AB  - Abstract:? The cornea epithelium responds to injury by synthesizing several cytokines, growth factors, and tissue remodeling molecules. Proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the inflammation that follows corneal epithelial injury and cytokine-mediated processes play a significant role in corneal epithelial wound healing. Poorly regulated corneal inflammatory reactions that occur after injury can retard healing. In turn, persistent corneal epithelial defects and inflammation may lead to ocular morbidity and permanent visual loss. Therefore, treatments with agents that enhance corneal reepithelialization and regulate the inflammatory response without the deleterious side effects of currently used agents, such as corticosteroids, would result in improved clinical outcome and would represent a major advance in the field. Evidence is mounting to support the idea that thymosin ?-4 (T?-4) has multiple, seemingly diverse, cellular functions. In the cornea, as in other tissues, T?-4 promotes cell migration and wound healing, has anti-inflammatory properties, and suppresses apoptosis. Prior studies from our laboratory have demonstrated the potent wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects of T?-4 in numerous models of corneal injury. Recently, we demonstrated that T?-4 suppresses the activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa b (NF-?B) in TNF-α-stimulated cells. TNF-α initiates cell signaling pathways that converge on the activation of NF-?B, thus both are known mediators of the inflammatory process. These results have important clinical implications for the potential role of T?-4 as a corneal anti-inflammatory and wound-healing agent.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the volume of in-stent neointimal proliferation, assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), at 6-month follow-up after implantation of a coronary Carbofilm?-coated stent (Tecnic Carbostent?, Sorin Biomedica Cardio, Saluggia, Italy) versus a conventional 316 L stent (Rx Multi-Link Penta, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Background: Many trials suggest that stent characteristics and coating could be important determinants of restenosis. Methods: From October 2004 to May 2005, 63 patients were randomized to Tecnic (T, n = 30) or Penta (P, n = 33). The primary end-point was in-stent volume of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) measured by IVUS at 6 months. The secondary end-points included binary restenosis, minimal luminal diameter (MLD), target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Results: There were no significant differences between T and P as to mean age, male gender, clinical status, complexity of the lesion, lesion length, reference vessel diameter before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), MLD pre-PCI, and stent-to-artery ratio. However, MLD poststenting was greater in P group than T group (2.81 ± 0.45 mm vs. 2.49 ± 0.33 mm, P < 0.002). At 6 months, angiographic late lumen loss (0.61 ± 0.51 mm vs. 0.92 ± 0.61 mm, P < 0.043), in-stent obstruction (25.86 ± 16.48% vs. 38.33 ± 19.56%, P = 0.021), and in-stent late loss volume (31.62 ± 29.75 mm3 vs. 57.28 ± 37.16 mm3, P = 0.016) were significantly lower in T group than in P group. Conclusion: Penta stent appears to offer a better deployment and a larger MLD post-PCI than Carbofilm-coated stent. However, a thicker NIH was observed on Penta stent at 6-month follow-up, when compared to Tecnic.

AB  - Abstract Objective The provision of ?adequate analgesia? (which reduces the pain score by ≥2 and to <4 [0?10 scale]) is significantly associated with high levels of satisfaction with pain management among adult patients. We aimed to determine the variables (including ?adequate analgesia?) associated with parent satisfaction with their child's pain management. Methods We undertook an observational, pilot study in a mixed, metropolitan ED. Patients aged 4?16 years with a triage pain score of ≥4 were enrolled. Data included demographics, presenting complaint, pain scores every 30 min, analgesia administered, time to first analgesia, provision of nurse-initiated analgesia (NIA), and ?adequate analgesia?, and parent satisfaction 48-h post-discharge (6 point scale: very unsatisfied ? very satisfied). Results Complete data were collected on 185 patients: mean (SD) age 10.4 (3.6)?years, weight 41.9 (17.8)?kg; 93 (50.3%) were male. One hundred and ten (59.4%) parents were very satisfied with their child's pain management. Children of very satisfied parents had shorter times to analgesia than those who did not (median [interquartile range] 14 (33) vs 33 (46) min, respectively, P?=?0.003). Parents whose children received NIA or ?adequate analgesia? were more often very satisfied than those whose children did not. However, the differences were not significant (difference in proportions: 13.2% [95% CI ?1.9, 28.3], P?=?0.07 and 10.2% [95% CI ?5.02, 25.34], P?=?0.16, respectively). Conclusion Short times to analgesia are associated with parent satisfaction. There were non-significant trends towards high levels of satisfaction following the provision of NIA and ?adequate analgesia?. These findings will inform a well-powered study to confirm this association.

AB  - Summary In vivo and in vitro studies in the cellular and molecular signaling activations on adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided new insights into their potential clinical applications, particularly for tissue repair and regeneration. This review focuses on these advances, specifically in the context of characterizing MSCs and self-renewal for tissue repair and recovery after diseases. MSCs have been extensively characterized and demonstrated mitigation and therapy on different diseases in human clinical cases and experimental animal models. MSC-based technologies for treating diseases alone or in combination with adjuvants are foreseeable. Current challenges in MSC therapy are the need to overcome cell purity, bioengineering difficulties for tissue structures, optimization of MSC administration protocols, termination of MSC activation after repair and regeneration accomplished, and safety of long-term presence of MSCs in the body.

AB  - Summary: Tissue damage occurs often in the life of mammals and is usually repaired. Dying cells are swiftly phagocytosed, but before disappearing, they alert surrounding cells to activate homeostatic programs. They release signals that recruit inflammatory cells to the site of injury, promote cell migration and cell division to replace dead cells, and activate the immune system in anticipation of microbial invasion. Many of these events involve high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a nuclear protein that is released passively when necrotic cells lose the integrity of their membranes. HMGB1 behaves as a trigger of inflammation, attracting inflammatory cells, and of tissue repair, recruiting stem cells and promoting their proliferation. Moreover, HMGB1 activates dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes their functional maturation and their response to lymph node chemokines. Activated leukocytes actively secrete HMGB1 in the microenvironment. Thus, HMGB1 acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and sustains long-term repair and defense programs. DCs secrete HMGB1 several hours after contact with the first maturation stimulus; HMGB1 secretion is critical for their ability to reach the lymph nodes, to sustain the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, to prevent their activation-dependent apoptosis, and to promote their polarization towards a T-helper 1 phenotype. These immune responses will also be directed against self-antigens that DCs process at the time of injury and can lead to autoimmunity.

AB  - Abstract Aims? To (i) determine the prevalence of persistent dento-alveolar pain following nonsurgical and/or surgical endodontic treatment conducted in a teaching dental hospital and (ii) identify the risk factors associated with persistent pain after apparently successful root canal treatment. Study design? A total of 175 patients/teeth were reviewed 12?59?months following treatment. The patients were examined clinically and radiographically and a detailed pain history obtained. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between potential risk factors and persistent pain after successful endodontic treatment. Results? The prevalence of persistent pain after successful root canal treatment was 12% (21/175). Treatment success was determined by the absence of clinical and radiographic signs of dental disease. The factors that were significantly (P?<?0.05) associated with persistent pain following endodontic treatment were: ?duration of preoperative pain? [odds ratio (OR)?=?8.6], ?preoperative pain from the tooth? (OR?=?7.8), ?preoperative tenderness to percussion? (OR?=?7.8), ?previous chronic pain problems? (OR?=?4.5), ?gender? (OR?=?4.5) and ?history of painful treatment in the orofacial region? (OR?=?3.8). ?Type of treatment received (surgical or nonsurgical treatment)? showed borderline significance at the 10% level. Conclusions? The presence and duration of preoperative pain from the tooth site, lasting at least 3?months, a positive history of previous chronic pain experience or painful treatment in the orofacial region, and female gender were important risk factors associated with persistent pain after successful endodontic treatment.

AB  - Background: Hyper-immunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome is a complex immune deficiency characterized by chronic eczematous dermatitis, recurrent staphylococcal infections, pneumatoceles, reduced neutrophil chemotaxis, and variably impaired T cell function. Although decreased interferon-? (IFN-?) production in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome is pointed out and known as a cause of reduced neutrophil chemotaxis, precise mechanism of their inadequate production of IFN-? remains unknown. To elucidate the pathogenesis of the defective production of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome, we assessed the in vitro production and secretion of IFN-? by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Methods: Chemotaxis of neutrophils, mRNA levels of several cytokines, intracellular production and extracellular secretion of IFN-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 by PBMCs from three patients with hyper-IgE syndrome were determined. Results: The transcription of IFN-? mRNA and the production of its protein molecules progressed normally. However, selective insufficiency in the secretion of IFN-? molecules was found in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome.Confocal laser scanning microscopy clearly demonstrated the accumulation of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Conclusion: We demonstrated that there was a selective insufficiency in the secretion of IFN-? in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. We hope that this fact would offer a new paradigm for understanding this disease.

AB  - Abstract To explore the hypothesis that alterations in cellular membrane lipids are present at the stage of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) (i.e., cognitively normal at death, but with AD neuropathology), we performed targeted shotgun lipidomics of lipid extracts from post-mortem brains of subjects with pre-clinical AD. We found sulfatide levels were significantly lower in subjects with pre-clinical AD compared to those without AD neuropathology. We also found that the level of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid was marginally lower at this stage of AD, whereas changes of the ceramide levels were undetectable with the available samples. These results indicate that cellular membrane defects are present at the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis and also suggest that sulfatide loss is among the earliest events of AD development, while alterations in the levels of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid and ceramide occur relatively later in disease.

Methods Study dogs were classified into non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis groups and blood was drawn on Day 1 of the patient's hospitalisation for measurement of serum homocysteine, folate and cobalamin concentrations. Homocysteine concentration was measured in 51 clinically healthy dogs to serve as the control group. Results A statistically significant difference was found between the homocysteine concentrations of the healthy group when compared to non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis groups. Homocysteine values were not correlated with folate, cobalamin or APPLEfast severity scores. Homocysteine concentrations were significantly lower in sick dogs when compared to the control group, which is dissimilar to the human population. Clinical Significance The clinical significance of homocysteine changes in critically ill dogs is currently unknown.

In animal models TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? mediate organ damage, low blood pressure and fatality, whereas IL-6 is involved in infection-related manifestations, like the production of acute-phase protein and fever, and IL-8 is chemotactic to granulocytes. TNF and IL-1 increase expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and influence a number of components of the haemostatic system in favour of coagulation. The presence of cytokines in the circulation is characterized by sequential releases of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6/IL-8; however, many variations of this pattern exist during human infection. In experiments as well as in human infection TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-? have been detected, and levels of TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 have been found to be associated with the severity of the disease. Collectively, TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? emerge as mediators of systemic infection and septic shock whereas IL-6 and IL-8 are related to other manifestations of infection. Counteracting molecules like sTNFR are released after somewhat of a delay following TNF and IL-1Ra is released concomitantly with IL-1. Probably these factors modulate the cytokine effect although their true potency in natural infection has yet to be clarified. In granulocytopenic infections TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 can be detected in scrum, and levels of TNF and IL-6 are even higher than in the normal situation in experimental animals. Antibodies to TNF inhibit bacteria-induced fatality in granulocytopenic mice. Altogether, few data related to the granulocytopenic situation are available. However, it is reasonable to believe that the altered development of granulocytopenic infections is due to changes in the cellular constitution and not to changes in cytokine production.
