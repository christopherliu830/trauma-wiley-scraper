AB  - Objectives To determine whether proinflammatory biomarkers are associated with frailty assessed according to functional status, mobility, mental health, and falls over 24 months. Design Secondary analysis of a 2-year double-blind clinical trial for osteoporosis. Setting Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Participants Women aged 65 and older with osteoporosis in long-term care (LTC) (N = 178). Measurements Baseline serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and soluble receptors (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its two receptors (TNFα-R1 and TNFα-R2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), IL-10), functional status assessed according to activities of daily living, the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test, gait speed, cognitive status, mental health, and falls. Results At baseline, older age was moderately associated with higher serum concentrations of hs-CRP (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.22), TNFα-R1 (r = 0.36), TNFα-R2 (r = 0.34), and IL-10 (r = 0.16) (all P < .05). Frail participants had significantly higher hs-CRP, TNFα-R1, TNFα-R2, IL-6, and IL-6-sR levels (all P < .05) than those nonfrail participants. Higher baseline hs-CRP and IL-6 levels were associated with worse physical performance and gait speed at 12 months independent of age, zoledronic acid use, and comorbidity (|r| = 0.25?0.30; all P < .05). Inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with incident falls. Conclusions Higher proinflammatory biomarker levels are associated with frailty and poorer function and mobility in older women residing in LTC facilities.

AB  - Abstract The cecum contains a high concentration of microbes, which are a combination of Gram-negative and Gram-positive flora. These bacteria range from anaerobic to facultative aerobic to aerobic organisms. In the procedure described in this unit, the ligation of the cecum produces a source of ischemic tissue as well as polymicrobial infection. This combination of ischemic/necrotic tissue and microbial infection distinguishes this multifactorial model from a number of other bacterial sepsis models, including but not limited to: bacteremia secondary to intravenous or intraperitoneal administration; fecal administration or intraperitoneal administration of fecal or bacterial plugs; colonic stents; and bacterial abscess formation.

Fungal hyphae (KOH and Calcofluor) were seen on direct microscopy of lung biopsy sample and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. C. globosum isolated on culture clinched the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary infection by Chaetomium spp. A positive galactomannan of serum and BAL was repeatedly seen and was utilised for follow-up and as prognostic marker in patient management. The patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B followed by voriconazole. All the Chaetomium infections reported till date since 1980 are reviewed. Chaetomium spp. with its unique ecology has a hidden clinical potential to cause invasive mould infections.

AB  - Summary Sepsis is characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection that is associated with high morbidity and mortality despite optimal care. Invariant natural killer T (iNK?T) cells are potent regulatory lymphocytes that can produce pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus shaping the course and nature of immune responses; however, little is known about their role in sepsis. We demonstrate here that patients with sepsis/severe sepsis have significantly elevated proportions of iNK?T cells in their peripheral blood (as a percentage of their circulating T cells) compared to non-septic patients. We therefore investigated the role of iNK?T cells in a mouse model of intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). Our data show that iNK?T cells are pathogenic in IAS, and that T helper type 2 (Th2) polarization of iNK?T cells using the synthetic glycolipid OCH significantly reduces mortality from IAS. This reduction in mortality is associated with the systemic elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 and reduction of several proinflammatory cytokines within the spleen, notably interleukin (IL)-17. Finally, we show that treatment of sepsis with OCH in mice is accompanied by significantly reduced apoptosis of splenic T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, but not natural killer cells. We propose that modulation of iNK?T cell responses towards a Th2 phenotype may be an effective therapeutic strategy in early sepsis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Vascular calcification has played a vital role in increasing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) estimated by plain lateral abdominal radiography in MHD patients. Methods Lateral abdominal radiography was used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS). The serum level of fibroblast growth factor-23 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were divided into two groups: no or minor calcification group (AACS <?5) and moderate to severe calcification group (AACS ≥?5). All patients were followed up to death or the end of the study (30 November 2016). Results A total of 114 patients were enrolled in this study, including 64 males (56.1%), and the mean age was 57.42?±?13.48?years. Seventy-six patients (66.7%) exhibited AAC. Independent predictors for moderate to severe calcification were older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.02?1.10), P = 0.003), longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.01 (1.00?1.02), P = 0.039), presence of smoking (OR 3.01 (1.18?7.70), P = 0.021) and higher Log fibroblast growth factor-23 serum levels (OR 2.83 (1.01?7.94), P = 0.048). During a median follow-up of 6.0 (5.6, 6.1) years, 22 patients (19.3%) died of all-cause death, and 17 cases (14.9%) died of CVD. Kaplan?Meier survival curves showed that patients in the moderate to severe calcification group had significantly higher all-cause (28.3 vs 11.5%, P = 0.028) and CVD mortality (22.6 vs 8.2%, P = 0.035) than that in the no or minor calcification group. A multivariate Cox regression showed that AACS (hazard ratio 1.08 (1.01?1.15), P = 0.022) was an independent predictor of CVD mortality. Compared with the no or minor calcification group, the risk of CVD mortality was increased by a factor of 3.14 in patients in the moderate to severe calcification group (hazard ratio 3.14 (1.04?9.44), P = 0.042). Conclusion Our data suggest that AAC is prevalent in MHD patients and could provide potential predictive information for CVD mortality. Plain lateral abdominal radiography, which is simple and cheap and involves lower radiation, might represent an appropriate screening method for evaluating vascular calcification in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract ?? Background:?Non-setting calcium hydroxide (Ultracal XS?) is recommended by the International Association of Dental Traumatology as the initial medicament following avulsion and replantation for mature teeth. There is experimental evidence to suggest Ledermix?, placed as an alternative inter-visit dressing may improve periodontal healing. Aim:?This study investigated, using a multi-centre randomized controlled trial, the effect of two root canal medicaments, Ledermix? and Ultracal XS?, on periodontal healing of avulsed and replanted teeth. Material and methods:?Children were recruited if they fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Treatment followed a standardized protocol. Assessment of periodontal healing or ankylosis was made clinically and radiographically by an experienced, ?blinded?, clinician at 12?months. Results:?Over 200 patients were assessed for eligibility at five centres. Twenty-nine patients were eligible for inclusion. Final analysis involved 22 patients with 27 teeth. Ankylosis was detected in four of the 12 teeth in the Ledermix? group and nine of 15 in the Ultracal XS? group. No significant difference between medicaments was found in the proportion of teeth or patients showing periodontal healing. Discussion:?There was no significant difference in periodontal healing between the two medicaments at either a tooth or patient level. The numbers recruited fell short of an estimated power calculation. For patients meeting the inclusion criteria and completing the trial, periodontal healing was seen in 52% of teeth at the 12-month assessment between both groups. The only factor found to significantly influence the periodontal outcome was dry time.

AB  - Abstract In hospitalized patients, lipid emulsions are an integral part of balanced parenteral nutrition. Traditionally, a single lipid source, soybean oil, has been given to patients and was usually regarded as just a source of energy and to prevent essential fatty-acid deficiency. However, mixtures of different lipid emulsions have now become widely available, including mixtures of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Fish oil is high in the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is a growing body of evidence that these ?-3 fatty acids can exert beneficial immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and inflammation-resolution effects across a wide range of patient groups including surgical, cancer, and critically ill patients. At least in part, these effects are realized via potent specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). Moreover, parenteral nutrition including ?-3 fatty acids can result in additional clinical benefits over the use of standard lipid emulsions, such as reductions in infection rates and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Clinical and experimental evidence is reviewed regarding lipid emulsion use in a variety of hospitalized patient groups, including surgical, critically ill, sepsis, trauma, and acute pancreatitis patients. Practical aspects of lipid emulsion use in critically ill patients are also considered, such as how to determine and fulfill energy expenditure, how and when to consider parenteral nutrition, duration of infusion, and safety monitoring.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Ischemia-reperfusion injury impacts early liver graft function. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) as early as at reperfusion has shown to predict in-hospital complications, but its impact on vascular complications and long-term outcomes is not ascertained. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on all consecutive patients transplanted during a 6-year period to define significant early systemic inflammatory response (ESIR). The main end-point was 3-year graft survival. Significant ESIR was defined according to IL-6 level at reperfusion on an exploratory set of 121 patients and validated on an independent cohort (n = 153). Results Significant ESIR was defined as IL-6 at reperfusion >1000 ng/mL in the exploratory cohort. Three-year graft and overall survival were lower in patients with ESIR in the determination set (P = 0.001 and 0.045, respectively). This was confirmed in the validation set (P = 0.045 and 0.027). In patients with high cytolysis, IL-6 identified patients at risk for arterial thrombosis. The main determinants for IL-6 level were intragraft lactate level, cold ischemia time, and anhepatic phase duration (P = 0.005). IL-6 level independently predicted graft survival (P = 0.0003). Conclusions IL-6 at reperfusion is a valid biomarker to predict long-term survival. Furthermore, it helps the interpretation of cytolysis in the prediction of early vascular complications.

Five alternative conceptual models were compared. A model with four correlated factors reflecting symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal provided the best fit to these data. The avoidance and emotional numbing clusters demonstrated distinct associations with depression symptoms, providing some evidence of the construct validity of the four-factor solution.

AB  - PGRN and its derived engineered protein, Atsttrin, were reported to antagonize TNFα and protect against inflammatory arthritis [Tang, W. et al. (2011) The growth factor progranulin binds to TNF receptors and is therapeutic against inflammatory arthritis in mice. Science 332 (6028) 478?484]. Here we found that PGRN level was also significantly elevated in skin inflammation. PGRN?/? mice exhibited more severe inflammation following induction of oxazolone (OXA). In contrast, recombinant Atsttrin protein effectively attenuated inflammation in mice dermatitis model. In addition, the protective role of PGRN and Atsttrin in dermatitis was probably due to their inhibition on NF-?B signaling. Collectively, PGRN, especially its derived engineered protein, Atsttrin, may represent a potential molecular target for prevention and treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.

AB  - Endothelial activation is pivotal in the development and escalation of sepsis. Central to endothelial activation is the endothelial up-regulation of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) including E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and PECAM-1. Shed CAMs are also found in circulating soluble forms (sCAMs). We investigated whether sCAMs can be used as biomarkers for the differentiation between septic and non-septic patients. Furthermore, we investigated lymphocyte and monocyte expression of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) ligands for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, respectively. Twenty-one septic and 15 critically ill non-septic patients were included. All patients had an APACHE II score above 13 at ICU admission. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as controls. Flow cytometry was used to estimate levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sPECAM-1, and the cellular expression of CD11a and CD49d. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1 and sPECAM-1 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls at admission and during the observation period. Lymphocyte and monocyte expression of CD11a and CD49d was suppressed or unaltered in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sPECAM-1 were able to discriminate between septic and non-septic patients, indicating that sCAMs may be potential diagnostic biomarkers of sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is a troublesome problem and a major concern for the patients. This study examined whether nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression in alveolar type I pneumocytes was associated with the clinical manifestations of PSP patients including disease recurrence. Eighty-eight PSP patients who were managed with needlescopic video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (NVATS) were included in this study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was assessed to determine Nrf2 expression in resected lung tissues and the results were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics by the chi-square or the Fisher's exact test. The prognostic value of Nrf2 for overall recurrence was evaluated by univariate and multivariable Cox regression model. The expression of Nrf2 was observed in type I pneumocytes of lung tissues from PSP patients by IHC. We found that low Nrf2 expression in PSP patients, especially in young (age?≤?20, p?=?0.033) and body mass index (BMI) ≥18?kg/m2 (p?=?0.019) groups, was significantly correlated with PSP recurrence. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, high Nrf2 expression was a significant protective factor for overall recurrence in PSP patients (univariate: p?=?0.026; multivariate: p?=?0.004). The expression level of Nrf2 in alveolar type I pneumocytes was a potential factor involved in PSP recurrence. Our findings suggest that elevated Nrf2 expression in PSP patients may be a promising way for reducing PSP recurrence.

AB  - Summary We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the analgesic efficacy of pre-operative stellate ganglion block on postoperative pain relief after upper limb orthopaedic surgery. Patients were administered a 3-ml injection during ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block; 15 patients received lidocaine 2% and 15 patients received 0.9% saline. Following the block, all patients received standardised general anaesthesia. Postoperative analgesia included regular intravenous diclofenac, paracetamol and patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol for 24 h. Patients were observed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery for tramadol consumption, cardiovascular variables and visual analogue scale pain scores at rest and on movement. The mean (SD) hourly tramadol consumption was significantly reduced in the lidocaine group compared with the saline group at 4 h (8.0 (10.1) mg vs 28.0 (12.6) mg, respectively; p = 0.001), 6 h (5.3 (10.8) mg vs 17.3 (12.7) mg, respectively; p = 0.013) and 8 h (5.3 (11.8) mg vs 21.3 (9.1) mg, respectively; p = 0.001). The cumulative 24-h tramadol consumption was 97.3 (16.6) mg in the lidocaine group and 150.6 (26.0) mg in the saline group (p = 0.001). There were significant differences in the pain visual analogue scale at rest at two time points; at 4 h the median (IQR [range]) visual analogue scale scores were 4 (4?6 [2?8]) in the lidocaine group and 5 (4?6 [2?7]) in the saline group (p = 0.03), and at 6 h visual analogue scale scores were 3 (3?4 [3?6]) and 4 (4?6 [2?7]), respectively (p = 0.04). Pain visual analogue scale on movement was lower in the lidocaine group at all time intervals compared with the saline group, but this did not reach statistical significance. The present study has demonstrated a postoperative tramadol-sparing and analgesic effect of pre-operative stellate ganglion block in patients undergoing upper limb orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia.
