AB  - Abstract Background We hypothesized that children treated in adult intensive care units (ICUs) might be at increased risk of hospital-acquired infection. Therefore, we compared the incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii infection in children treated in pediatric ICU (PICU) and in those treated in adult ICUs. Methods Patients aged <18 years admitted to PICU or adult ICUs between March 2009 and June 2017 were enrolled. We retrospectively investigated A. baumannii isolates and calculated A. baumannii incidence during ICU admission. Cox regression was used to identify possible risk factors for A. baumannii infection. Results Eight hundred thirty ICU cases were included; 508 were treated in PICU (PICU group) and 322 in adult ICUs (adult-ICU group). A. baumannii was isolated 19 (3.7%) and 23 (7.1%) times in the PICU and adult-ICU groups, respectively. Incidence densities for A. baumannii acquisition in PICU and adult-ICU groups were 1.63 and 5.62 per 1,000 ICU-days, respectively. In the Cox regression model, the hazard ratio (HR) for A. baumannii acquisition associated with treatment in PICU was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.61; P=0.001). In multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and sex, treatment in PICU remained significantly associated with a reduced risk of A. baumannii infection (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20-0.76). Conclusion Pediatric patients treated in PICU had a lower rate and incidence density of A. baumannii nosocomial infection than those treated in adult ICUs, suggesting that PICU provides better infection control for children than adult ICUs.

AB  - Summary We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the analgesic efficacy of pre-operative stellate ganglion block on postoperative pain relief after upper limb orthopaedic surgery. Patients were administered a 3-ml injection during ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block; 15 patients received lidocaine 2% and 15 patients received 0.9% saline. Following the block, all patients received standardised general anaesthesia. Postoperative analgesia included regular intravenous diclofenac, paracetamol and patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol for 24 h. Patients were observed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery for tramadol consumption, cardiovascular variables and visual analogue scale pain scores at rest and on movement. The mean (SD) hourly tramadol consumption was significantly reduced in the lidocaine group compared with the saline group at 4 h (8.0 (10.1) mg vs 28.0 (12.6) mg, respectively; p = 0.001), 6 h (5.3 (10.8) mg vs 17.3 (12.7) mg, respectively; p = 0.013) and 8 h (5.3 (11.8) mg vs 21.3 (9.1) mg, respectively; p = 0.001). The cumulative 24-h tramadol consumption was 97.3 (16.6) mg in the lidocaine group and 150.6 (26.0) mg in the saline group (p = 0.001). There were significant differences in the pain visual analogue scale at rest at two time points; at 4 h the median (IQR [range]) visual analogue scale scores were 4 (4?6 [2?8]) in the lidocaine group and 5 (4?6 [2?7]) in the saline group (p = 0.03), and at 6 h visual analogue scale scores were 3 (3?4 [3?6]) and 4 (4?6 [2?7]), respectively (p = 0.04). Pain visual analogue scale on movement was lower in the lidocaine group at all time intervals compared with the saline group, but this did not reach statistical significance. The present study has demonstrated a postoperative tramadol-sparing and analgesic effect of pre-operative stellate ganglion block in patients undergoing upper limb orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is the umbrella term for a group of rare inherited skin fragility disorders caused by mutations in at least 20 different genes. There is no cure for any of the subtypes of EB resulting from different mutations, and current therapy only focuses on the management of wounds and pain. Novel effective therapeutic approaches are therefore urgently required. Strategies include gene-, protein- and cell-based therapies. This review discusses molecular procedures currently under investigation at the EB House Austria, a designated Centre of Expertise implemented in the European Reference Network for Rare and Undiagnosed Skin Diseases. Current clinical research activities at the EB House Austria include newly developed candidate substances that have emerged out of our translational research initiatives as well as already commercially available medications that are applied in off-licensed indications. Squamous cell carcinoma is the major cause of death in severe forms of EB. We are evaluating immunotherapy using an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody as a palliative treatment option for locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin unresponsive to previous systemic therapy. In addition, we are evaluating topical calcipotriol and topical diacerein as potential agents to improve the healing of skin wounds in EBS patients. Finally, the review will highlight the recent advancements of gene therapy development for EB.

AB  - Abstract Background. Peritoneal adhesion is a common complication following abdominal surgery. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, it still presents a problem for the patients and surgeons. In the present study, we investigated the effects of octenidindihydro-chloride ? phenoxyethanol (OCP) on peritoneal adhesions. Method. Rats were divided into four groups: Group 1 (saline), Group 2 (peritonitis plus saline), Group 3 (OCP), and Group 4 (peritonitis plus OCP). Peritonitis was induced in the rats of Groups 2 and 4. The abdominal cavities of the rats in Groups 1 and 2 were washed with saline, while those of the rats in Groups 3 and 4 were irrigated with 1:10 OCP solution. Adhesion and fibrotic scores were determined by re-laparotomy after 21 days. Results. The adhesion scores in Groups 1 (saline), 2 (peritonitis plus saline), 3 (OCP) and 4 (peritonitis plus OCP) were 3.30±0.94, 5.25±1.03, 1.12±0.83 and 0.28±0.48, respectively. Statistical analysis of adhesion scores revealed significant differences between groups, except between Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.265). Statistical analyses of grades of histopathological signs showed that Group 1 differed from Groups 2 and 4 (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, respectively); Group 2 differed from Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, differences between Group 3 and Groups 1 and 4 were not significant (p = 0.06, p = 0.08, respectively). Conclusion. OCP decreased the peritoneal adhesion formation macroscopically and microscopically in the presence or absence of peritonitis. Peritoneal defects due to trauma are to be left open and OCP diluted 1:1 should not be used intraperitoneally.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis is increasingly applied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). However, there are a few long-term survival data of the inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) over 10 years. Aim.? To determine the long-term mechanical reliability of AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis in patients with ED. Methods.? A total of 438 consecutive patients with ED received implantation of an AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis at our institution from January 1991 to April 2009. In 397 patients (90.7%), the medical records were available and current status of penile prosthesis could be obtained by a direct telephone interview. The overall and mechanical survival rates of penile prosthesis were evaluated using Kaplan?Meier method. Main Outcome Measures.? Assessing the mechanical and overall survival rates of the AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis using Kaplan?Meier analysis, and looking for clinical factors related to survival of the CX/CXM using log-rank test. Results.? Mean age of 397 patients was 63.1 years (range, 24-93) and follow-up duration was 113 months (range 1-219). Eighty-two patients (20.6%) experienced mechanical failure at a median follow-up of 82 months. Mechanical survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 97.6%, 93.2% and 78.2% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. 12 patients (3.0%) experienced nonmechanical failure including infections, tissue erosion resulting in cylinder protrusion at the meatus and chronic discomfort. Overall survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 95.0%, 91.0% and 75.5% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. Patients with neurogenic cause for ED showed lower median overall survival of penile prosthesis compared with patients with non-neurogenic cause. Patient age, obesity, and diabetes mellitus had no association with overall survival of penile prosthesis after implantation. Conclusions.? The AMS 700CX/CXM could be accepted and applied in more patients as a reliable treatment alternative of ED. Kim DS, Yang KM, Chung HJ, Choi HM, Choi YD, and Choi HK. AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis has high mechanical reliability at long-term follow-up. J Sex Med 2010;7:2602?2607.

AB  - Summary Inherited coagulation disorders constitute a broad spectrum of coagulation factor deficiencies that include X-linked factor (F)VIII or FIX deficiency that causes haemophilia, and autosomal recessive disorders producing heterogeneous deficiencies in fibrinogen (FI), prothrombin (FII), FV, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII and combined FV+FVIII. Significant advances in treatments for patients with congenital haemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) and B (FIX deficiency) over the last two decades have resulted from improvements in the production, availability and patient access to factor replacement products. Translation of advances in biotechnology, namely recombinant protein technology, targeted protein modifications to improve function and potentially reduce immunogenicity, and advanced formulations to optimize bioavailability and sustain activity offer promisingly new treatments for haemophilia as well as recessively inherited bleeding disorders in patients who otherwise have few therapeutic options. Though a theoretical risk remains for blood-borne viral infections with pooled plasma-derived products, this concern has diminished with breakthroughs in purification and viral inactivation methods. Development of inhibitory antibodies is still the most daunting problem for patients with inherited bleeding disorders, complicating treatment approaches to control and prevent bleeding, and posing risks for allergic and anaphylactic reactions in susceptible patients. The objectives of this review are to (i) highlight emerging advances in hemostatic therapies that are bioengineered to improve pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability, sustain functional activity, and possibly eliminate immunogenicity of recombinant factor proteins; and (ii) present an overview of key clinical trials of novel factor products currently in the development pipeline.

AB  - Objective Follow-up data of patients with spinal metastatic tumors were analyzed to investigate the effect of separation surgery combined with SBRT on clinical outcomes. Methods The clinical data of 52 patients with spinal metastatic tumors admitted to our hospital from January 2015 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 24 males and 28 females, aged 25?77?years, with an average of 56.7 ±?7.4?years. The separation surgery of all patients was successfully completed and followed up. Frankel neurological function grading, Karnofsky?performance scores, VAS scores, Epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) grading and muscle strength grading were used to assess the patients? condition. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Log?rank test were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% feasible interval for patients with different ages, genders, and treatments. The multivariate Cox regression model was used to calculate the risk value HR and the 95% feasible interval in patients undergoing only separation surgery or separation surgery combined with SBRT. Results After separation surgery, 46 patients had pain relief (88.5%), and the average VAS score decreased to 2.17 ±?0.52 points, which was significantly improved compared with preoperative score (P <?0.01). Muscle strength grading decreased in seven cases, showed no change in two cases, and recovered in 19 cases. Postoperative Frankel neurological function grading and Karnofsky?performance scores were also significantly improved compared with preoperative scores (P <?0.01). The patients who accepted separation surgery were followed up for 9?47 months (26.3 ±?18.1 months), and 15 patients died due to the deterioration of the primary tumor. Thirteen patients received SBRT after surgery, including 12 cases of pain relief. The average VAS score of these 13 patients decreased to 1.64±0.41 points, which was significantly improved compared with preoperative and postoperative (P <?0.01), and muscle strength recovered in eight cases. Frankel neurological function grading and Karnofsky performance scores of these patients were also significantly improved compared with preoperative and postoperative Frankel neurological function grading and Karnofsky performance scores (P <?0.01). The patients who accepted separation surgery combined with SBRT were followed up for 11?38 months (mean 22.5 ±?10.2 months), and five cases died of primary tumor. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that separation surgery combined with SBRT was an independent predictor of overall survival rate (OS). Conclusions Separation surgery combined with SBRT is an effective way to treat spinal metastatic tumors as it not only has smaller surgical trauma, but can also significantly relieve pain, improve nerve function, and relieve spinal cord compression.

AB  - Abstract Organ availability and acceptability limit pediatric HTx. What characteristics define an unacceptable or high-risk pediatric donor remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to characterize a large cohort of pediatric donors and determine the donor risk factors, including cumulative risk, that affect recipient survival. Data from the PHTS, a prospective multicenter study, were used to examine the impact of donor factors on the outcomes of patients listed <18 yr of age who received a HTx between 1993 and 2009. Donor data were available for 3149 of 3156 HTx (99.8%). Donor cause of death, need for inotropes, or CPR did not affect survival outcomes (p = 0.05). Ischemic time also did not have an impact on overall recipient survival; however, longer ischemic times negatively impacted one-yr post-transplant survival (p < 0.0001). There was no impact of cumulative risk factors on survival (p = 0.8). Although used in a minority of cases, hormonal therapy in the donor positively impacted survival (p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, the only donor factor associated with decreased survival was smaller donor BSA, the other factors being related to the recipient characteristics. When analyzed by recipient age, there were no donor-related factors that affected survival for those who received a transplant at <6 months of age. Longer ischemic time (p < 0.0001) and greater age difference between the recipient and donor (p = 0.0098) were donor-related factors impacting early-phase survival for recipients who received a graft at ≥10 yr of age. Factors perceived to define a marginal or high-risk pediatric heart donor including inotrope use, CPR and donor cause of death may have less impact on outcomes than previously thought. Longer ischemic times did impact one yr, but not overall survival, and this impact was much greater with older donors. Parameters for accepting a donor heart can potentially be expanded, especially in the infant age group, but strong consideration should always be given to the interaction between ischemic time and donor age.

AB  - Abstract An adhesive yet easily removable burn wound dressing represents a breakthrough in second-degree burn wound care. Current second-degree burn wound dressings absorb wound exudate, reduce bacterial infections, and maintain a moist environment for healing, but are surgically or mechanically debrided from the wound, causing additional trauma to the newly formed tissues. We have developed an on-demand dissolvable dendritic thioester hydrogel burn dressing for second-degree burn care. The hydrogel is composed of a lysine-based dendron and a PEG-based crosslinker, which are synthesized in high yields. The hydrogel burn dressing covers the wound and acts as a barrier to bacterial infection in an in vivo second-degree burn wound model. A unique feature of the hydrogel is its capability to be dissolved on-demand, via a thiol?thioester exchange reaction, allowing for a facile burn dressing removal.

AB  - Abstract In this retrospective study, we report the epidemiological characteristics of all poisoning deaths in Epirus, Greece, from 1998 to 2010; we present the toxicological findings and the statistical evaluation of the results. This is the first detailed scientific report on all the officially certified poisoning deaths concerning part of the Greek population. A total of 126 poisoning fatalities were recorded, 67 of them being mono-intoxications (53.2%). The cause of poisoning was as follows: drugs of abuse (60%); carbon monoxide (19.8%); pesticides (9.5%); corrosives (4.8%); pharmaceuticals (4.8%); and spider bite (0.8%). The most frequently detected poisonous substances were as follows: heroin (65 cases), ethanol (55), benzodiazepines (42), carbon monoxide (25), cocaine (17), cannabinoids (17) and pesticides (12). Increasing tendency in poisoning death rates was recorded, due to an increase in accidental poisoning deaths attributed mainly to drugs of abuse (total, accidental, and drugs-of-abuse poisoning death rates per 100,000 inhabitants per year were 1.87, 1.19, and 0.79, respectively, in the period 1998?2002 and 3.97, 3.41, and 2.55, respectively, in the period 2007?2010).

AB  - ABSTRACT Genetic factors and childhood adverse experiences contribute to the vulnerability to alcohol dependence. However, empirical data on the interplay between specific genes and adverse experiences are few. The COMT Val158Met and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A genotypes have been suggested to affect both stress sensitivity and the risk for alcohol dependence. This study tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in COMT Val158Met and DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A interacts with childhood adverse experiences to predict alcohol dependence. Male abstinent alcohol-dependent patients (n?=?110) and age-matched healthy male controls (n?=?99) were genotyped for the COMT Val158Met and the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A genotypes. Childhood adverse events were measured using three self-report questionnaires. Alcohol dependence severity, age of onset and duration of alcohol dependence were analyzed as secondary outcome measures. Statistical analysis involved logistic regression analysis and analysis of variance. Alcohol-dependent patients reported increased childhood adversity. The interaction between childhood adversity and the COMT Val158Met genotype added significantly to the prediction model. This gene?environment interaction was confirmed in the analysis of the secondary outcome measures, i.e. alcohol dependence severity, age of onset and duration of alcohol dependence. The DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A genotype was not related to alcohol dependence, nor did it interact with childhood adversity in predicting alcohol dependence. This study provides evidence for a gene?environment interaction in alcohol dependence, in which an individual's sensitivity to childhood adverse experience is moderated by the COMT genotype. Exposed carriers of a low-activity Met allele have a higher risk to develop severe alcohol dependence than individuals homozygous for the Val allele.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: Resuscitation studies of hypertonic saline using controlled and uncontrolled hemorrhage models yield conflicting results with regard to efficacy. These disparate results reflect the use of models and resuscitation regimens that are not comparable between studies. This study evaluated the effects of comparable and clinically relevant resuscitation regimens of 7.5% sodium chloride/6% dextran 70 (HSD) and 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) in a near-fatal uncontrolled hemorrhage model. Methods: Thirty-six swine (14.2 to 21.4 kg) with 4-mm aortic tears were bled to a pulse pressure of 5 mm Hg (40-45 mL/kg). The animals were resuscitated with either NS or HSD administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates. Group II (n = 12) was resuscitated with 80 mL/kg of NS at a rate of 4 mL/kg/min. Group III (n = 12) received 9.6 mL/kg of HSD at a rate of 0.48 mL/kg/min. In both groups, crystalloid resuscitation was followed by shed blood infusion (30 mL/kg) at a rate of 2 mL/kg/min. Group I (controls; n = 12) were not resuscitated. Results: One-hour mortality was significantly greater in group I (92%) as compared with group II (33%) and group III (33%) (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.004). Intraperitoneal hemorrhage was significantly greater in group II (34 ± 20 mL/kg) and group III (31 ± 13 mL/kg) as compared with group I (5 ± 2 mL/kg) (ANOVA; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters between groups II and III. Conclusion: In this model of severe uncontrolled hemorrhage, resuscitation with HSD or NS, administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates, had similar effects on mortality, hemodynamic parameters, and hemorrhage from the injury site.

AB  - Summary Critically ill patients display a state of immunosuppression that has been attributed in part to decreased plasma arginine concentrations. However, we and other authors have failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of L-arginine supplementation. We hypothesize that, in these critically ill patients, these low plasma arginine levels may be secondary to the presence of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSC), which express arginase known to convert arginine into nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. Indeed, in a series of 28 non-surgical critically ill patients, we showed a dramatic increase in gMDSC compared to healthy subjects (P?=?0·0002). A significant inverse correlation was observed between arginine levels and gMDSC (P?=?0·01). As expected, gMDSC expressed arginase preferentially in these patients. Patients with high gMDSC levels on admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) presented an increased risk of death at day 7 after admission (P?=?0·02). In contrast, neither plasma arginine levels, monocytic MDSC levels nor neutrophil levels were associated with overall survival at day 7. No relationship was found between body mass index (BMI) or simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score or gMDSC levels, eliminating a possible bias concerning the direct prognostic role of these cells. As gMDSC exert their immunosuppressive activity via multiple mechanisms [production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-10, arginase, etc.], it may be more relevant to target these cells, rather than simply supplementing with L-arginine to improve immunosuppression and its clinical consequences observed in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an unusual, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder leading to the loss of motor neurons. After diagnosis, the average lifespan ranges from 3 to 5 years, and death usually results from respiratory failure. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, multiple factors are thought to contribute to the progression of ALS, such as network interactions between genes, environmental exposure, impaired molecular pathways and many others. The neuroprotective properties of neural stem cells (NSCs) and the paracrine signaling of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been examined in multiple pre-clinical trials of ALS with promising results. The data from these initial trials indicate a reduction in the rate of disease progression. The mechanism through which stem cells achieve this reduction is of major interest. Here, we review the to-date pre-clinical and clinical therapeutic approaches employing stem cells, and discuss the most promising ones.

AB  - Background Ulinastatin can prevent the perioperative increase in proinflammatory cytokines for lung resection surgery; however, its impact on early clinical outcomes remains unknown. Methods The study enrolled 108 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were randomly allocated into two groups: ulinastatin (group U) and control (group C). Patients in group U ( n = 52) were continuously intravenously infused with ulinastatin at a rate of 20 000 U/kg/hour for the first hour after anesthesia induction, and then at a rate of 5000 U/kg/hour until the conclusion of surgery. Patients in group C ( n = 56) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome was to record the postoperative pulmonary complications that occurred during hospital stay. Other clinical courses, such as hospital mortality, blood loss, respiratory parameters, postoperative chest drainage, and duration of intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, were also observed and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups in early postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, blood loss, or other perioperative laboratory values, except for the duration of postoperative chest drainage and serum creatinine level. The frequency of pulmonary complications was lower in patients treated with ulinastatin compared with the control (38.46% in group U vs. 48.21% in group C). Conclusion Administration of high-dose ulinastatin during surgery did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, or hospital stay for patients undergoing lung radical thoracotomy. However, a protective trend of ulinastatin was observed.
