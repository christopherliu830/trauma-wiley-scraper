AB  - Background Ulinastatin can prevent the perioperative increase in proinflammatory cytokines for lung resection surgery; however, its impact on early clinical outcomes remains unknown. Methods The study enrolled 108 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were randomly allocated into two groups: ulinastatin (group U) and control (group C). Patients in group U ( n = 52) were continuously intravenously infused with ulinastatin at a rate of 20 000 U/kg/hour for the first hour after anesthesia induction, and then at a rate of 5000 U/kg/hour until the conclusion of surgery. Patients in group C ( n = 56) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary outcome was to record the postoperative pulmonary complications that occurred during hospital stay. Other clinical courses, such as hospital mortality, blood loss, respiratory parameters, postoperative chest drainage, and duration of intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay, were also observed and analyzed. Results There were no significant differences between the two groups in early postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, blood loss, or other perioperative laboratory values, except for the duration of postoperative chest drainage and serum creatinine level. The frequency of pulmonary complications was lower in patients treated with ulinastatin compared with the control (38.46% in group U vs. 48.21% in group C). Conclusion Administration of high-dose ulinastatin during surgery did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, hospital mortality, or hospital stay for patients undergoing lung radical thoracotomy. However, a protective trend of ulinastatin was observed.

AB  - Abstract Hybridization of nanoscale metals and carbon nanotubes into composite nanomaterials has produced some of the best-performing sensors to date. The challenge remains to develop scalable nanofabrication methods that are amenable to the development of sensors with broad sensing ranges. A scalable nanostructured biosensor based on multilayered graphene petal nanosheets (MGPNs), Pt nanoparticles, and a biorecognition element (glucose oxidase) is presented. The combination of zero-dimensional nanoparticles on a two-dimensional support that is arrayed in the third dimension creates a sensor platform with exceptional characteristics. The versatility of the biosensor platform is demonstrated by altering biosensor performance (i.e., sensitivity, detection limit, and linear sensing range) through changing the size, density, and morphology of electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles on the MGPNs. This work enables a robust sensor design that demonstrates exceptional performance with enhanced glucose sensitivity (0.3 µM detection limit, 0.01?50 mM linear sensing range), a long stable shelf-life (>1 month), and a high selectivity over electroactive, interfering species commonly found in human serum samples.

AB  - Multiple pathological processes are responsible for renal transplant loss. Development of effective prophylactic regimens requires that risks associated with different outcomes be assessed when several processes act together. A multistate competing risk model that derived multiple endpoint probabilities without averaging impacts of covariates over different outcomes or overestimating fractions of survivors was used to estimate the influence of 16 factors simultaneously on four failure types (acute rejection, chronic rejection, death with a functioning graft and all other causes combined). We analyzed 12?413 non-Black and 5121 Black patients undergoing primary cadaveric kidney transplantation reported to UNOS during 1994?96. Black recipients generally demonstrated higher rates of failure, but the method provided joint probabilities for each failure type and covariate level. To illustrate, a middle-aged Black recipient had probabilities of 6.5%, 5.9%, 2.6% and 6.6% to experience acute rejection failure, chronic rejection failure, death with a functioning graft and other failures, respectively, within 3?years. The corresponding non-Black's chances were 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.7% and 3.6%. The overall 3-year survival equaled 78.4% [100%-(6.5%?+?5.9%?+?2.6%?+?6.6%)] and 88.3% for Blacks and non-Blacks, respectively. The growing complexity of transplantation will benefit from new analytic approaches that accommodate multiple transitions along diverse paths to eventual graft loss or death.

AB  - Abstract A prospective study of 63 consecutive infants on parenteral nutrition was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of a uniform regimen with minor modifications throughout the project. Routine investigations were carried out to monitor haematological and metabolic complications. Anaemia from repeated blood sampling was frequent. Metabolic complications were infrequent and were usually transitory. Parenteral nutrition per se did not appear to be a cause of jaundice, though histological changes in the liver were found in 12 of the 17 patiènts studied. Lipid profile showed disturbances which appeared to be dose related. Catheter related complications were frequent and occurred irrespective whether the catheter was inserted by the cutdown method or percutaneously. Tissue necrosis and ulceration due to extravasation of parenteral nutrition fluid and localised abscesses were the complications encountered with peripheral vein infusion. The study shows that it is possible to use a simple set of solutions for parenteral nutrition. It also emphasises that routine monitoring is necessary to detect the metabolic disturbances early and catheter related complications can be reduced by careful attention to technique.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence that has accumulated over the past decade strongly supports the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of human epilepsy. Specific inflammatory molecules and pathways have been identified that influence various pathologic outcomes in different experimental models of epilepsy. Most importantly, the same inflammatory pathways have also been found in surgically resected brain tissue from patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. New antiseizure therapies may be derived from these novel potential targets. An essential and crucial question is whether targeting these molecules and pathways may result in anti-ictogenesis, antiepileptogenesis, and/or disease-modification effects. Therefore, preclinical testing in models mimicking relevant aspects of epileptogenesis is needed to guide integrated experimental and clinical trial designs. We discuss the most recent preclinical proof-of-concept studies validating a number of therapeutic approaches against inflammatory mechanisms in animal models that could represent novel avenues for drug development in epilepsy. Finally, we suggest future directions to accelerate preclinical to clinical translation of these recent discoveries.

AB  - Abstract Aim To compare the effectiveness of two-ridge preservation treatments. Materials and Methods Forty subjects with extraction sockets exhibiting substantial buccal dehiscences were enrolled and randomized across 10 standardized centres. Treatments were demineralized allograft plus reconstituted and cross-linked collagen membrane (DFDBA + RECXC) or deproteinized bovine bone mineral with collagen plus native, bilayer collagen membrane (DBBMC + NBCM). Socket dimensions were recorded at baseline and 6 months. Wound closure and soft tissue inflammation were followed post-operatively, and biopsies were retrieved for histomorphometric analysis at 6 months. Results Primary endpoint: at 6 months, extraction socket horizontal measures were significantly greater for DBBMC + NBCM (average 1.76 mm greater, p = 0.0256). Secondary and Exploratory endpoints: (1) lingual and buccal vertical bone changes were not significantly different between the two treatment modalities, (2) histomorphometric % new bone and % new bone + graft were not significantly different, but significantly more graft remnants remained for DBBMC; (3) at 1 month, incision line gaps were significantly greater and more incision lines remained open for DFDBA + RECXC; (4) higher inflammation at 1 week tended to correlate with lower ridge preservation results; and (5) deeper socket morphologies with thinner bony walls correlated with better ridge preservation. Thirty-seven of 40 sites had sufficient ridge dimension for implant placement at 6 months; the remainder were DFDBA + RECXC sites. Conclusion DBBMC + NBCM provided better soft tissue healing and ridge preservation for implant placement. Deeper extraction sockets with higher and more intact bony walls responded more favourably to ridge preservation therapy.

AB  - Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an unusual, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder leading to the loss of motor neurons. After diagnosis, the average lifespan ranges from 3 to 5 years, and death usually results from respiratory failure. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, multiple factors are thought to contribute to the progression of ALS, such as network interactions between genes, environmental exposure, impaired molecular pathways and many others. The neuroprotective properties of neural stem cells (NSCs) and the paracrine signaling of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been examined in multiple pre-clinical trials of ALS with promising results. The data from these initial trials indicate a reduction in the rate of disease progression. The mechanism through which stem cells achieve this reduction is of major interest. Here, we review the to-date pre-clinical and clinical therapeutic approaches employing stem cells, and discuss the most promising ones.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: Resuscitation studies of hypertonic saline using controlled and uncontrolled hemorrhage models yield conflicting results with regard to efficacy. These disparate results reflect the use of models and resuscitation regimens that are not comparable between studies. This study evaluated the effects of comparable and clinically relevant resuscitation regimens of 7.5% sodium chloride/6% dextran 70 (HSD) and 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) in a near-fatal uncontrolled hemorrhage model. Methods: Thirty-six swine (14.2 to 21.4 kg) with 4-mm aortic tears were bled to a pulse pressure of 5 mm Hg (40-45 mL/kg). The animals were resuscitated with either NS or HSD administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates. Group II (n = 12) was resuscitated with 80 mL/kg of NS at a rate of 4 mL/kg/min. Group III (n = 12) received 9.6 mL/kg of HSD at a rate of 0.48 mL/kg/min. In both groups, crystalloid resuscitation was followed by shed blood infusion (30 mL/kg) at a rate of 2 mL/kg/min. Group I (controls; n = 12) were not resuscitated. Results: One-hour mortality was significantly greater in group I (92%) as compared with group II (33%) and group III (33%) (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.004). Intraperitoneal hemorrhage was significantly greater in group II (34 ± 20 mL/kg) and group III (31 ± 13 mL/kg) as compared with group I (5 ± 2 mL/kg) (ANOVA; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters between groups II and III. Conclusion: In this model of severe uncontrolled hemorrhage, resuscitation with HSD or NS, administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates, had similar effects on mortality, hemodynamic parameters, and hemorrhage from the injury site.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.

AB  - Abstract:? Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal disorder characterized by dystrophin absence, courses with chronic inflammation, sarcolemmal damage, and skeletal muscle degeneration. Among the multiple pathogenic mechanisms proposed for DMD, oxidative stress and inflammation are directly involved in the dystrophic process. Unfortunately, there is no current treatment for DMD, and the inflammatory process is an important target for therapies. Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of melatonin, we investigated whether melatonin treatment may reduce the dystrophic process. Ten DMD patients aged 12.8?±?0.98?yr, were treated with melatonin (60?mg at 21:00?hr plus 10?mg at 09:00?hr), and plasma levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitrites (NOx), interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-?, and plasma markers of muscle injury, were determined at 3, 6 and 9?months of treatment. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were used as controls. The results show a significant increase in LPO, NOx, and cytokine levels in plasma of DMD patients compared with controls. Melatonin administration reduced these values to control levels at 3?months of treatment, decreasing further 9?months later. In parallel, melatonin also reduced plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK; 50%), lactate dehydrogenase (28%), aspartate aminotransferase (28%), alanine aminotransferase (20%), and myoglobin (13%). These findings strongly support the conclusion that melatonin administration significantly reduced the hyperoxidative and inflammatory process in DMD patients, reducing the muscle degenerative process.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that extracellular ubiquitin has pleiotropic effects on host defence mechanisms, but its cellular mechanism of action is not yet understood. Using fluorescence and in vivo confocal microscopy, we observed uptake of N-terminal fluorescein-labelled ubiquitin into human PBMC and MonoMac 6 cells. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that extracellular ubiquitin is then rapidly conjugated to a multitude of intracellular proteins. LPS and lipoteichoic acid significantly increased uptake and subsequent conjugation to intracellular proteins dose dependently. This mechanism showed saturation kinetics with a K d value for ubiquitin in the low nanomolar range (<10 nmol/L) and a B max value of 0.14?0.27 ?mol ubiquitin/mg protein. These results suggest that the monocytic ubiquitin system can be targeted with physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular ubiquitin during inflammation. This concept could provide a simple explanation for a multitude of extracellular ubiquitin's actions and open up new strategies to influence ubiquitin-dependent intracellular processes.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of a contemporary amputation series. Methods:? A retrospective audit of 87 cases of major lower limb amputation from January 2000 to December 2002 from the Department of Vascular Surgery, Royal Perth Hospital, was conducted. Results:? The mean age of the study population was 70.1?±?14.3?years; the male?:?female ratio was 3.35:1. Comorbid problems included diabetes (49.4%), smoking (81.6%), hypertension (77.0%), ischaemic heart disease (58.6%), stroke (25.3%), raised creatinine level (34.5%) and chronic airway limitation (25.3%). Preamputation vascular reconstructive procedures were common, 34.5% in a previous admission and 23.0% in the same admission. The main indication was critical limb ischaemia (75.9%) followed by diabetic infection (17.2%). There were 51 below-knee (58.6%), 5 through-knee (5.7%) and 31 above-knee (35.6%.) amputations. The below-knee amputation to above-knee amputation ratio was 1.65:1. The overall wound infection rate was 26.4%; the infection rates for below-knee (29.4%) and above-knee (22.6%) amputation did not differ significantly (P?=?0.58). Revision rates were 17.6% for below-knee, 20% for through-knee and none for above-knee amputations. Twenty patients (23.0%) underwent subsequent contralateral amputation. Thirty-nine patients (44.8%) were selected as suitable for a prosthesis by a rehabilitation physician; 31 (79.5%) used the prosthesis both indoors and outdoors and 6 (15.4%) used it indoors only within 3?months. Cumulative mortality at 30?days, 6?months, 12?months and 24?months was 10.1, 28.7, 43.1 and 51.7%, respectively. Conclusion:? This series agrees with the current published work in finding that patients undergoing major lower limb amputation are older, with a high prevalence of comorbid conditions. Successful prosthesis rehabilitation depends on patient selection and a multidisciplinary approach. Despite a low immediate mortality, the overall long-term results of lower limb amputation remain dismal.

AB  - Abstract Oral mucositis (OM) as a complication of high-dose chemotherapy is frequently occurred in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) settings. Erythropoietin (EPO) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and wound-healing properties and therefore could have an important role in the prevention of OM. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the EPO mouthwash effect on OM incidence and severity in 80 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin disease (HD) or multiple myeloma, undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients received either EPO mouthwash (50?IU/ml, 15?ml four times a day) (n?=?40) or placebo (n?=?40) from the starting day of high-dose chemotherapy until day +14 after transplantation or until the day of discharge from the hospital, whichever occurred first. OM was evaluated daily for 21?days after transplantation or until resolution of OM according to World Health Organization oral toxicity scale. The incidence of OM (grades 1?4) in the EPO mouthwash group and control group was significantly different (27.5% vs 77.5%, p?<?0.001). The mean?±?SD of two other parameters of OM including maximum intensity OM score (0.60?±?1.06 vs 1.67?±?1.27) and average intensity OM score (0.47?±?0.80 vs 1.28?±?0.86) was significantly lower in the intervention group (p?<?0.001). Moreover, the mean?±?SD duration of OM was also significantly shorter among the EPO mouthwash recipients (1.92?±?3.42?days vs 5.42?±?3.86?days, P?<?0.001). Also, the duration of neutropenic fever was significantly shorter in the intervention group (2.12?±?2.42?days vs 3.95?±?4.01?days, p?=?0.016). It is concluded that EPO mouthwash can reduce the incidence and duration of OM. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: More than 100,000 people each year are admitted to U.S. hospitals for severe burn injury. Strikingly, ethanol use prior to injury is apparent in nearly 50% of burn patients, rendering them six times more likely to die from infection than patients not exposed to ethanol. We previously reported that the kinetics and magnitude of neutrophil chemokine production and subsequent accumulation of neutrophils in the lung was dramatically altered when ethanol exposure preceded injury. Here, we tested whether burn injury and ethanol exposure combined, altered susceptibility to infection, neutrophil chemoattractant production, and neutrophil accumulation at the site of the burn wound. Methods: Male B6D2F 1 mice were administered a dose of ethanol designed to achieve 90?100 mg/dl circulating levels and 30 min later subjected to a 15% total body surface area dorsal scald injury. Susceptibility to topically applied Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined. At various times after injury, burn wound and normal tissues were collected for assessments of neutrophil counts, myeloperoxidase quantitation, and neutrophil chemoattractant (KC and MIP-2) production. Results: Ethanol exposure prior to burn injury enhanced susceptibility to infection after burn and was associated with significantly elevated production of KC, but not MIP-2, at the wound site. Despite the enhanced elevation of KC, neutrophil accumulation in the wounds of ethanol exposed, burn injured mice did not differ from those that received burn injury alone. TNFα (a potent activator of neutrophils), however, was found to be significantly elevated in the wounds of mice that received only burn injury, but not in those that received injury in combination with prior ethanol exposure. Conclusion: In the presence of ethanol, neutrophils are adequately recruited to the site of burn injury, but their host defense functions are impaired, perhaps due to the lack of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα.

AB  - ABSTRACT Inflammatory factors secreted by microglia play an important role in focal ischemic stroke. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a known regulator of immune responses, but the role that mTORC1 signaling plays in poststroke neuroinflammation is not clear. To explore the relationship between microglial action in the mTORC1 pathway and the impact on stroke, we administered the mTORC1 inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus to mice. Presumably, disrupting the mTORC1 pathway after focal ischemic stroke should clarify the subsequent activity of microglia. For that purpose, we generated mice deficient in the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) in microglia, whose mTORC1 signaling was blocked, by crossing Raptor loxed (Raptorflox/flox) mice with CX3CR1CreER mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 promoter. mTORC1 blockade reduced lesion size, improved motor function, dramatically decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduced the number of M1 type microglia. Thus, mTORC1 blockade apparently attenuated behavioral deficits and poststroke inflammation after middle cerebral artery occlusion by preventing microglia polarization toward the M1 type.?Li, D., Wang, C., Yao, Y., Chen, L., Liu, G., Zhang, R., Liu, Q., Shi, F.-D., Hao, J. mTORC1 pathway disruption ameliorates brain inflammation following stroke via a shift in microglia phenotype from M1 type to M2 type.
