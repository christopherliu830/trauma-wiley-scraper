AB  - ABSTRACT Inflammatory factors secreted by microglia play an important role in focal ischemic stroke. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a known regulator of immune responses, but the role that mTORC1 signaling plays in poststroke neuroinflammation is not clear. To explore the relationship between microglial action in the mTORC1 pathway and the impact on stroke, we administered the mTORC1 inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus to mice. Presumably, disrupting the mTORC1 pathway after focal ischemic stroke should clarify the subsequent activity of microglia. For that purpose, we generated mice deficient in the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) in microglia, whose mTORC1 signaling was blocked, by crossing Raptor loxed (Raptorflox/flox) mice with CX3CR1CreER mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 promoter. mTORC1 blockade reduced lesion size, improved motor function, dramatically decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduced the number of M1 type microglia. Thus, mTORC1 blockade apparently attenuated behavioral deficits and poststroke inflammation after middle cerebral artery occlusion by preventing microglia polarization toward the M1 type.?Li, D., Wang, C., Yao, Y., Chen, L., Liu, G., Zhang, R., Liu, Q., Shi, F.-D., Hao, J. mTORC1 pathway disruption ameliorates brain inflammation following stroke via a shift in microglia phenotype from M1 type to M2 type.

AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy for hundreds of thousands of people who have severe impairment of gastrointestinal function. Trace elements are a small but very important part of PN that can be overlooked during busy practice. Serious complications can result from trace element deficiencies and toxicities, and this is especially problematic during times of product shortages. Practical information on parenteral trace element use can be gleaned from case reports, some retrospective studies, and very few randomized controlled trials. A general knowledge of trace element metabolism and excretion, deficiency and toxicity symptoms, products, optimal dosages, and strategies for supplementation, restriction, and monitoring will equip practitioners to provide optimal care for their patients who depend on PN.

AB  - Abstract Objective Prosthetic abutment height and peri-implant mucosal thickness are considered factors that influence marginal bone remodeling during biological width establishment around dental implants. However, no clinical studies have evaluated their simultaneous effect on marginal bone loss (MBL). This study analyzes the influence of abutment height on MBL around implants surrounded by both thin and thick mucosa up to 12 months after prosthetic loading. Material and methods Seventy platform-switched implants with internal hex were placed equicrestally in two groups of patients with different vertical mucosal thickness: thin (≤2.0 mm) and thick mucosa (>2.0 mm). After three months of submerged healing, prosthetic abutments with a height of 1 mm (short) or 3 mm (long) were randomly assigned for single crown screwed restoration in both groups. MBL was evaluated on radiographs taken at implant placement (T0), restoration delivery (T1), and after 6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) of loading. Results After 12 months of loading, 66 implants were functioning (two dropouts, two failures), resulting in a 97% survival rate. Compared with T0, mean MBL at T3 ranged between 0.59 and 0.80 mm in short abutment groups and between 0.28 and 0.37 mm in long abutment groups. Differences resulted statistically significant, irrespective of vertical peri-implant mucosal thickness. The MBL pattern over time showed the greatest amount of bone resorption in the first 6 months after loading, particularly around implants with short abutments. Conclusions Platform-switched implants restored with short abutments present greater marginal bone loss than identical implants with long abutments, without significant peri-implant mucosal thickness effects.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a potentially life-threatening dermatological disease involving large areas of skin loss with systemic symptoms. This study evaluated the efficacy of air-fluidised bed therapy for TEN patients. Methods Of 27 people with TEN, 11 used air-fluidised beds (the air-fluidised group) and 16 used standard beds (the control group). Days to complete re-epithelialisation, re-epithelialisation rate, incidence of complications, mortality, pain measured by visual analogue score and the incidence of cutaneous infection were compared in these groups. Results The mean body surface area of involvement was 77.0?±?11.8% and baseline mean severity-of-illness score for TEN (SCORTEN) was 2.81?±?1.08. The re-epithelialisation rate in the air-fluidised group was 100% but was only 56.3% in the control group (P?<?0.05). There was a significant difference in the time taken to complete re-epithelialisation between the air-fluidised group (13 days [95%?CI: 9.0?17.0]) and the control group (21 days [16.5?25.5], P?<?0.05). Furthermore, the incidence of complications was 18% in the air-fluidised group versus 75% in the control group, including fewer cutaneous infections (P?<?0.05). There was a significant reduction in pain among the air-fluidised group compared with the control group (P?<?0.05). There were no deaths in the air-fluidised group while 19% of the control group died. Conclusion Air-fluidised beds can reduce the time to complete re-epithelialisation, relieve pain and increase the re-epithelialisation rate of TEN patients, but there was no significant difference between them in mortality rate in our study.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome on patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A hundred and eighty-eight patients with detailed thyroid hormone levels at diagnosis of DLBCL were enrolled. Low T3 syndrome was defined as a low serum free T3 (FT3) level with low or normal serum free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver-operator characteristic curves and the corresponding areas under the curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of International Prognostic Index (IPI) and low T3 syndrome. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with low T3 syndrome, which was associated with worse PFS and OS in the rituximab era. It was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS, especially for those with IPI 0?2, extranodal sites ≤1 and stage III?IV. Synchronously low FT3 and FT4 had poorer survival outcome compared to only low FT3 and adding criterion of low T3 syndrome improved the prognostic capacity of IPI for predicting PFS and OS in DLBCL. Low T3 syndrome was found to be a strong prognostic predictor in DLBCL.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Peyronie's Disease (PD) has been studied for more than 260 years since Francois de la Peyronie's description in 1743. Based on the current literature, the prevalence of PD seems 3?9% with an average age of onset in the fifth life decade. Much effort has been spent on developing nonsurgical treatment options to cure or at least prevent disease progression. Aim.? The recent examination of drug trials for erectile dysfunction has led us to assess PD trial methodology more closely. Methods.? An Iinternet search on PubMed was performed using MeSH words PD, clinical trials, oral, transdermal, intralesional and shock wave therapy focusing on 26 representing studies published over the last 15 years. Mean Outcome Measures.? A comprehensive review of the current literature on nonsurgical treatment options for PD was conducted to address methodological issues and challenges in PD trials highlighting trial design, patient population, and symptom and sign assessment. Results.? The majority of the reviewed studies are underpowered and the heterogeneity in the methodological approach and patient assessment between the studies is one of the remarkable findings from our review. Studies should use a uniform means of defining the degree and type of penile deformity and a large enough cohort of patients should be studied for adequate study power. An ideally designed PD intervention trial should comprise: (i) a randomized, placebo-controlled design; (ii) with a PD patient set representative of the general PD population; and (iii) a comprehensive symptom and sign assessment before and at the end of treatment which includes an assessment of at least deformity, pain, and sexual function. Conclusion.? A number of challenges exist for the design of PD intervention trials and deciphering the data generated from them. The field would benefit greatly from a consensus statement or guidelines development on the design and conduct of such trials. Müller A, and Mulhall JP.

AB  - Abstract Objective Increased intrathoracic pressures during airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) may compromise systemic venous return resulting in decreased cardiac output and renal perfusion. We sought to study the short-term effect of APRV on blood pressure (BP) and urine output (UO) in children with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Design Retrospective cohort study. Patients All patients with ALI/ARDS who were admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between 1/00 and 06/04, and who were ventilated with APRV (for at least 12?hr) for worsening oxygenation while on conventional ventilation (CV). Measurements and Results Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM III) score, admitting diagnosis, ventilator settings, gas exchange data, heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), blood pressure (BP), UO, and use of other therapies [sedatives, pressors, inotropes, and intravenous fluid (IVF)]. Eleven patients met our inclusion and exclusion criteria with a mean age of 6.2?±?4.8 years (range: 1?15 years), a weight of 35.5?±?29.5?kg (range: 12?90?kg), and a PRISM score of 18.4?±?9.6 (range: 2?36). Within 10?hrs of APRV, patients' mean airway pressure (Paw) increased from 16.1?±?6.6 to 21.1?±?5.5?cm of H2O (P?=?0.04). Despite a higher Paw there were no differences in HR, CVP, BP, UO, IVF and use of other therapies while on CV or APRV (P?>?0.10). Conclusion In children with ALI/ARDS, despite a higher Paw, APRV does not affect BP or UO. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2010; 45:48?54. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, and burns are often associated with altered metabolism characterized by severe catabolism, wasting of the lean body mass, immune dysfunction, and compromised wound healing. Nutrition support is one of the mainstays in the management of these critically ill patients and is aimed at minimizing these complications. The purpose of this article is to compare stress hypermetabolism and starvation metabolism, to review current recommendations for the provision of energy and substrate to the critically ill patient, and to review pertinent literature regarding enteral vs parenteral nutrition. Finally, this article will provide a brief overview of new and future therapies with emphasis on specific substrates and growth factors and the potential for their use in the critically ill patient.

AB  - The essential trace element zinc (Zn) has a large number of physiologic roles, in particular being required for growth and functioning of the immune system. Adaptive mechanisms enable the body to maintain normal total body Zn status over a wide range of intakes, but deficiency can occur because of reduced absorption or increased gastrointestinal losses. Deficiency impairs physiologic processes, leading to clinical consequences that include failure to thrive, skin rash, and impaired wound healing. Mild deficiency that is not clinically overt may still cause nonspecific consequences, such as susceptibility to infection and poor growth. The plasma Zn concentration has poor sensitivity and specificity as a test of deficiency. Consequently, diagnosis of deficiency requires a combination of clinical assessment and biochemical tests. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) are susceptible to Zn deficiency and its consequences. Nutrition support teams should have a strategy for assessing Zn status and optimizing this by appropriate supplementation. Nutrition guidelines recommend generous Zn provision from the start of PN. This review covers the physiology of Zn, the consequences of its deficiency, and the assessment of its status, before discussing its role in PN.

AB  - Summary. Background:?Clotting factor (F) VIII is an independent risk factor for primary and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). The causes for high plasma FVIII levels are not fully understood, but an involvement of genetic factors has been demonstrated. A multifunctional endocytic receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), mediates cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of FVIII and may contribute to variations in FVIII levels. Objective:?We assessed the association of a genetic variation of LRP1 (663C?>?T) with basal FVIII levels and the risk of venous thrombosis in a group of high-risk patients and in healthy controls. Patients and methods:?One hundred and fifty-two patients with a history of recurrent VTE (median age 56?years, 47% women) were compared with 198 age- and sex-matched controls (median age 53?years, 50% women). The LRP1 663C?>?T genotype was analyzed by mutagenic separated polymerase chain reaction assay and heterozygosity was confirmed by sequence analysis. Results:?LRP1 663C?>?T genotype distribution differed significantly between patients (663CC n?=?138, 663CT n?=?14) and controls (663CC n?=?190, 663CT n?=?8; P?=?0.048). In multivariable linear regression analysis including LRP1 663C?>?T, ABO blood group, von Willebrand factor antigen, C-reactive protein and age, LRP1 663CT was independently associated with FVIII activity (P?=?0.02). LRP1 663CT was also associated with increased odds for VTE following adjustment for blood group O, FV Leiden and the prothrombin variation 20210G?>?A in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3?8.5). Conclusions:?According to our data the LRP1 663C?>?T polymorphism influences plasma FVIII levels independently of blood group, C-reactive protein and von Willebrand factor and is significantly associated with the risk of VTE.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study aimed to evaluate in a Belgian population the frequence of mucositis and peri-implantitis in patients with implants of at least 5 years of function. Another outcome was to access implants/patients characteristics as possible risk indicators for peri-implantitis. Material and methods One hundred and three patients (38 males/65 females) with a total of 266 implants were examined. Implants had been inserted in university hospitals as well as in private clinics and the mean time of implants in function was 8.5 years (±3.2). The average patients' age within the population was 62 years (±13.4). General health informations were recorded as well as habits regarding smoking, maintenance visits and oral hygiene. Full mouth clinical parameters (PlI, BoP, PPD) were assessed and radiographs taken to determine the periodontal status and implants diagnosis. Results Prevalences of mucositis and peri-implantitis at the patient's level were respectively 31% and 37%. They were 38% and 23% at the implant's level. Subjects older than 65 years (OR = 1.39) and those with active periodontitis (OR = 1.98) were prone to peri-implantitis. The association was stronger for hepatitis (OR = 2.92) and totally edentulous patients (OR = 5.56). Finally, at the implant's level, a significant correlation was found in the multi-level analyses between rough surfaces, overdentures and peri-implantitis. Conclusion After 8.5 years an important proportion (±60%) of implants presented biological complications. Furthermore, a positive correlation was showed between age, periodontitis, absence of teeth, rough surfaces and peri-implantitis. Consequently, patients with such characteristics should be informed before implant placement and frequently re-called after for maintenance visits.

AB  - Summary. Increasing numbers of children are receiving solid organ transplants namely kidney, liver, heart and lung. Patient survival rates following such transplants are essentially good with much of the success attributable to the development of Cyclosporine A (CyA), an immunosuppressive drug, that minimizes organ rejection. However the gingival overgrowth (GO) associated with the use of CyA is not only disfiguring but in paediatric recipients, may interfere with normal oral development and function. Objective. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge concerning the aetiology, pathogenesis and management of gingival overgrowth. Methods. Literature pertaining to gingival overgrowth is reviewed with particular reference to the paediatric population. Emphasis is placed on summarizing the evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of intervention. Conclusion. CyA undoubtedly causes gingival overgrowth, the effects and levels of which appears to be more severe in younger patients. There is conflicting evidence as to the effectiveness of oral hygiene regimes, antibiotics and surgery in reducing overgrowth. The introduction of an alternative immunosuppressive agent (Tacrolimus) offers potential as it does not appear to cause overgrowth, although research to date is limited by the small sample size of many of the studies. This is an area in which multicentre studies would be of great value.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012; 42 (3): 290?302 Abstract Background and aims? Studies suggest clinical benefits of parenteral fish oil (FO), rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), over soyabean oil (SO), rich in n-6 PUFAs, in patients with pro-inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Because the mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear, the present study explored the effects of intravenous infusion of FO and SO on fatty acid incorporation, immune functions and (anti)oxidant balance in healthy human volunteers. Methods? Saline, a SO emulsion and a FO emulsion were administered for one hour on three consecutive days at a rate of 0·2?g/kg?BW/h to eight subjects in a randomized cross-over design with a 3-week interval between treatments. Plasma phospholipid and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fatty acid compositions, and leucocyte counts and functions were assessed prior to the first infusion (T?=?0, baseline) and 1?day (T?=?4, early effects) and 8?days (T?=?11, late effects) after the third infusion. Results? Fish oil infusion significantly increased n-3 PUFA proportions and decreased n-6 PUFA proportions in plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. There were no differences in immune functions or (anti)oxidant balance between treatments at any time. Conclusions? The present lipid infusion protocol appears to be safe and well tolerated and provides significant incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. In the absence of overt inflammation, no direct effects of FO were observed on immune function or (anti)oxidant balance. This model may be useful to evaluate effects of parenteral lipids in other settings, for example in individuals displaying an inflammatory state.

AB  - Objective: To assess the value of routine bone marrow biopsy (8MB) in adult patients less than 65 years of age with suspected idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Design: Retrospective analysis. Data were collected from hospital medical records and laboratory results. Setting: Large tertiary-level metropolitan teaching hospital, Victoria. Participants: Sixty-six patients who had undergone BMB for investigation of isolated thrombocytopenia between January 1992 and May 1997, according to defined eligibility criteria. Results: Sixty-one of the 66 patients had BMB findings consistent with ITP (ie, normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes and other haemopoietic lineages normal). Three of these patients' biopsies incidentally showed reduced or absent iron stores. In the remaining five patients, BMB in four showed mild hypocellularity and the subsequent course in these patients was consistent with chronic ITP. The fifth patient had neutrophil hypersegmentation and giant band cells on 8MB, the cause of which was unclear. The subsequent course in this patient has also been consistent with chronic ITP. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the routine performance of BMB for the diagnosis of ITP is not useful, provided that a thorough clinical history and physical examination are undertaken and that the blood count and peripheral blood smear show no abnormalities apart from thrombocytopenia.

AB  - Abstract Immunotherapeutic agents are used in treatment of primary immunodeficiencies as well as those immune system aberrations resulting from other diseases. A number of natural and synthetic agents have been discovered that can modulate components of the immune system. Furthermore, cytokines, such as interleukins, and immune cells having specific markers, such as antibodies, continue to be defined, leading to a complex although incomplete picture of immune responses. The immune system and its responses are discussed. Immunomodulators that play a role in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome as well as those used in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune dysfunction, are described. Immunosuppressants used in anticancer therapy and organ transplants are presented.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common congenital bleeding disorder in the USA, affecting 1?3% of the population. Previously characterizing the bleeding symptoms in females with type 1 vWD, we evaluated 42 males with type 1 vWD, mean age 16?years (1?64), of whom 24 (57%) presented with bleeding symptoms. The most common initial symptom was postoperative bleeding (26%). The most common bleeding symptoms ever were epistaxis (53%), bruising (50%), postoperative bleeding (47%), haematomas (29%) and oral bleeding (29%). Of postoperative bleeding, ear/nose/throat (44%), dental (17%) and circumcision bleeding (22%) occurred at a median 10?years of age, despite a previous bleeding or family history in 89%. Complications included anaemia in five (12%), neurological sequelae after subdural haematoma and tonsillectomy in two (5%), transfusion-associated hepatitis C in two (5%) and degenerative joint disease after traumatic haemarthroses in one (2%). The bleeding time (BT) was prolonged in 83%, and the ristocetin cofactor (vW:RCoF) and factor VIII (FVIII:C) decreased in 64% and 43%, respectively. Haemarthroses and haematoma formation were associated with a longer activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P?<?0.05), and anaemia with a lower FVIII:C (P?<?0.05). In 81%, a haemostatic response occurred with 1-8 deamino-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), although, in 13%, surgical intervention was also required to achieve haemostasis. Postoperative bleeding could have been avoided in 89%, if a preoperative past bleeding history or family history had been obtained, and, in at least 94%, if a preoperative BT and APTT had also been performed. The failure to avoid postoperative bleeding and related complications in patients with vWD by taking a personal and family bleeding history constitutes a major public health problem.
