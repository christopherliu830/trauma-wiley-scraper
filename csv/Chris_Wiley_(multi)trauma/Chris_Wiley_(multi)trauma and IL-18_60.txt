AB  - ABSTRACT Kidney transplant provides significant survival, cost, and quality-of-life benefits over dialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease, but the number of kidney transplant candidates on the waiting list continues to grow annually. By the end of 2014, nearly 100,000 adult candidates and 1500 pediatric candidates were waiting for kidney transplant. Not surprisingly, waiting times also continued to increase, along with the number of adult candidates removed from the list due to death or deteriorating medical condition. Death censored graft survival has increased after both living and deceased donor transplants over the past decade in adult recipients. The majority of the trends seen over the past 5 years continued in 2014. However, the new allocation system was implemented in late 2014, providing an opportunity to assess changes in these trends in the coming years.

AB  - Sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, and burns are often associated with altered metabolism characterized by severe catabolism, wasting of the lean body mass, immune dysfunction, and compromised wound healing. Nutrition support is one of the mainstays in the management of these critically ill patients and is aimed at minimizing these complications. The purpose of this article is to compare stress hypermetabolism and starvation metabolism, to review current recommendations for the provision of energy and substrate to the critically ill patient, and to review pertinent literature regarding enteral vs parenteral nutrition. Finally, this article will provide a brief overview of new and future therapies with emphasis on specific substrates and growth factors and the potential for their use in the critically ill patient.

AB  - The essential trace element zinc (Zn) has a large number of physiologic roles, in particular being required for growth and functioning of the immune system. Adaptive mechanisms enable the body to maintain normal total body Zn status over a wide range of intakes, but deficiency can occur because of reduced absorption or increased gastrointestinal losses. Deficiency impairs physiologic processes, leading to clinical consequences that include failure to thrive, skin rash, and impaired wound healing. Mild deficiency that is not clinically overt may still cause nonspecific consequences, such as susceptibility to infection and poor growth. The plasma Zn concentration has poor sensitivity and specificity as a test of deficiency. Consequently, diagnosis of deficiency requires a combination of clinical assessment and biochemical tests. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) are susceptible to Zn deficiency and its consequences. Nutrition support teams should have a strategy for assessing Zn status and optimizing this by appropriate supplementation. Nutrition guidelines recommend generous Zn provision from the start of PN. This review covers the physiology of Zn, the consequences of its deficiency, and the assessment of its status, before discussing its role in PN.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Synechiae are one of the most common unwanted outcomes after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However, there has been scant investigation into the true significance of synechiae formation after ESS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of synechiae formation on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes after ESS in patients with CRS. Study Design Prospective, multi-institutional cohort. Methods Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI) and Chronic Sinusitis Survey (CSS) scores were measured in adult patients before and after undergoing ESS for CRS. Differences in HRQoL were evaluated between those who developed sinonasal synechiae and those who did not, controlling for demographic factors, medical comorbidities, and measures of disease severity at baseline. Results A total of 286 patients underwent ESS, with 55 (19.2%) developing synechiae in the follow-up period. Patients developing synechiae reported significantly less improvement on the RSDI total scores (13.5 vs. 21.4, P?=?0.008), RSDI physical subscores (5.3 vs. 8.3, P?=?0.007), RSDI emotional subscores (2.9 vs. 5.8, P = 0.008), CSS total scores (14.5 vs. 21.2, P = 0.093), and CSS symptom subscores (19.9 vs 30.3, P = 0.069) compared to those who did not develop synechiae postoperatively. These differences persisted even after controlling for baseline differences in disease severity. Conclusions Synechiae of the sinonasal cavity commonly occurs following ESS, particularly in those undergoing revision surgeries. Although both groups improve, the degree of HRQoL improvement appears to be less in those who form postoperative synechiae after surgery compared to those who do not. Level of Evidence 2c.

AB  - Abstract: The authors have retrospectively evaluated the clinical results of mandibular incisors replacement with narrow neck implants (NNI). Thirty-one patients treated consecutively for single or multiple lower incisor replacement with NNI with a mean follow-up of 23 months (range 18?42 months) were included in the study and were divided into three groups: single tooth, multiple unit restoration and restorations on adjacent implants. Survival and success rates and soft tissue parameters such as modified plaque index (mPI), peri-implant probing depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and the papilla index were analyzed. Subjective evaluation was performed by patients and clinicians on visual analogue scales. The implants and prostheses showed a survival rate of 100% and an overall success rate of 94%. The distribution of mPI outcomes showed better results for the single tooth group. BOP was present in four of eight implants (50%) in the adjacent implant group, in one out of 20 implants in the single tooth group (5%) and in one out of 16 implants in the multi unit group (6%). The adjacent implant group showed a statistically significant increase in PPD. The Papilla Index showed a better outcome distribution in single tooth and multi unit groups. Patients' evaluation of treatment outcome was satisfactory in all groups, even though the best esthetic and functional results were found in single tooth and multi unit groups. The professional evaluation showed good outcomes for the single tooth and multi unit groups and statistically significant poorer results in the adjacent implants group. With the limitations of this study, it may be concluded that the replacement of lower incisors with NNI leads to favorable functional and esthetic results in cases of single-tooth or multiple-unit replacement. Worse results are achieved if two adjacent mandibular incisors are replaced with adjacent implants.

AB  - The synthesis of factors that monitor the expression of the Thy-l cell surface component by marker-negative precursor cells requires an intact left cerebral cortex, whereas the activity of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, an immunopotentiator that increases this synthesis, seems to require an intact right neocortex. These results suggest a role for the cerebral cortex in the coordinated interregulation of lymphocyte subclasses. The finding extends previous information suggesting relationships between the central nervous system and the T-cell arm of the immune system.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: The purpose of the present controlled clinical trial was to compare the treatment of advanced periodontal disease with a combination of an Er:YAG laser (KEY II?, KaVo, Germany) and scaling and root planing with hand instruments (SRP) to laser alone. Material and methods: Twenty healthy patients with moderate to advanced periodontal destruction were randomly treated in a split-mouth design with a combination of an Er:YAG laser and SRP (test) or with laser (control) alone. The used energy setting for laser treatment was 160?mJ/pulse at a repetition rate of 10?Hz. Prior to treatment and 3, 6 and 12?months later the following parameters were evaluated by a blinded examiner: Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR) and clinical attachment level (CAL). Subgingival plaque samples were taken at each appointment and analysed using darkfield microscopy for the presence of cocci,-non-motile rods, motile rods and spirochetes. No statistical significant differences in any of the investigated parameters between both groups were observed at baseline. Results: Initially, the plaque index was 1.0?±?0.6 in both groups. At the 3-month examination the plaque scores were markedly reduced and remained low throughout the study. A significant reduction of the GI and BOP occurred in both groups after 3, 6 and 12?months (P?<?0.05, P?<?0.05, respectively). The mean PD decreased in the test group from 5.2?±?0.8?mm at baseline to 3.2?±?0.8?mm after 12?months (P?<?0.05) and in the control group from 5.0?±?0.7?mm at baseline to 3.3?±?0.7?mm after 12?months (P?<?0.05). The mean CAL decreased in the test group from 6.9?±?1.0?mm at baseline to 5.3?±?1.0?mm after 12?months (P?<?0.05) and in the control group from 6.6?±?1.1?mm at baseline to 5.0?±?0.7 after 12?months (P?<?0.05). Both groups showed a significant increase of cocci and-non-motile rods and a decrease in the amount of motile rods and spirochetes. Conclusion: In conclusion, the present results have indicated that: (i) non-surgical periodontal therapy with both an Er:YAG laser?+?SRP and an Er:YAG laser alone may lead to significant improvements in all clinical parameters investigated, and (ii) the combined treatment Er:YAG laser?+?SRP did not seem to additionally improve the outcome of the therapy compared to Er:YAG laser alone.

To evaluate the effect of two soft manual toothbrushes with different filament and brush head designs in relation to gingival abrasion and plaque removing efficacy to the in relation flat trimmed manual reference toothbrush of the American Dental Association (ADA). Methods:? The study had a randomized single use cross-over model (n?=?76) with three sessions whereby all brushes were used by each subject. Subjects were asked to abstain from all oral hygiene procedures for 48?h. They brushed according to split-mouth design. Pre- and post-brushing plaque and gingival abrasion were assessed. Results:? The Sensodyne? Sensitive (SENS) was more abrasive than the ADA (P?<?0.001) while the Oral-B? Sensitive Advantage? (OBSA) was less abrasive than the SENS (P?<?0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the OBSA and the ADA (P?=?0.319). All three brushes showed statistically significant reductions (49?56%) in plaque versus baseline. Compared to the ADA and the SENS, the OBSA had a smaller percentage of plaque removal (56% versus 49%, P?≤?0.001; and 50% versus 52%, P?=?0.028). Conclusions:? The present study which compared two soft toothbrushes showed that the OBSA caused less gingival abrasion compared to the SENS-brush with a marginal loss (2%) of efficacy.

Abstract Because they can recognize and sample inhaled allergens, dendritic cells (DC) have been shown to be responsible for the initiation and maintenance of adaptive Th2 responses in asthma. It is increasingly clear that DC functions are strongly influenced by a crosstalk with neighboring cells like epithelial cells. Whereas the epithelium was initially considered only as a barrier, it is now seen as a central player in controlling the function of lung DCs through release of innate cytokines-promoting Th2 responses. Clinically relevant allergens, as well as known environmental and genetic risk factors for allergy and asthma, often interfere directly or indirectly with the innate immune functions of airway epithelial cells and DC. A better understanding of these interactions might lead to a better prevention and ultimately to new treatments for asthma.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The prevalence of methamphetamine use has risen dramatically in parts of South Africa. Globally, methamphetamine has been linked to intimate partner violence (IPV) and other forms of aggression. The aim of this mixed-methods study was to examine the experiences of physical IPV and its contextual factors among methamphetamine users in an urban community in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods Active methamphetamine users were recruited using respondent driven sampling. All participants (n?=?360) completed structured surveys, and a subset (n?=?30) completed in-depth interviews with discussions of personal IPV experiences. Quantitative data were examined separately by gender, and regression models were used to identify factors that were associated with physical IPV victimisation and perpetration. Qualitative data were analysed to provide contextual understanding. Results In the past 3?months, 47% of women and 31% of men reported being a victim of IPV, and 30% of women and 28% men reported being a perpetrator of IPV. Victimisation and perpetration were highly correlated, and both were significantly associated with histories of other traumas. Although the survey data suggests gender equivalence in IPV, the qualitative data provides a more nuanced context, with female victimisation by male partners being particularly frequent and intense. In narratives, IPV was a product of male aggression while using methamphetamine, norms around sex trading and gender-based attitudes endorsing violence against women. Conclusion Addiction to methamphetamine creates heightened risks of IPV, especially among those with previous traumas. The findings emphasise the importance of identifying and addressing IPV among methamphetamine users in South Africa. [Watt MH, Guidera KE, Hobkirk AL, Skinner D, Meade CS.

AB  - Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an invaluable diagnostic tool, particularly in patients with inadequate transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. In addition, continuous TEE has been used to monitor ventricular and valvular performance in the intensive care unit and the operating room. However, current generation transesophageal probes have limitations in the critical care setting due to their size. Recently, a prototype miniaturized transesophageal probe was developed to overcome these limitations. This probe was used by five medical centers for 194 examinations. A large proportion of these patients were in the intensive care unit (43%), as well as mechanically ventilated (39%). Seventy percent (70%) of the subjects in this study were intubated nasally with the prototype probe, with a success rate of 88.5%. Oral intubation was successful in every case. Subject tolerance was good, and 25% of the patients were intubated for > 1 h. Nasal intubation with the probe was more likely in intensive care patients, ventilated subjects, and patients who were intubated for > 1 hour. TEE with this miniaturized probe is feasible and safe even in multi-instrumented critical care patients. This probe provides adequate diagnostic imaging capabilities and may allow imaging over prolonged periods of time, making it suitable for the serial monitoring of ventricular performance.

AB  - Summary Background and purpose Few reports concerned on recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment in stroke patients with decreased consciousness. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of intravenous rt-PA administration within 4.5 h in stroke patients with decreased consciousness. Methods A total of 136 stroke patients with decreased consciousness, who received or not rt-PA intravenously within 4.5 h after stroke onset from Jiangsu province of China from 2009 to 2012, were reviewed retrospectively. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), intracranial hemorrhage rate, and mortality were used to determine patient outcome when discharged. A 3-month outcome was calculated by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) with score 0 to 1 considered favorable outcome. Results Baseline characteristics of two groups were similar. When discharged, no significant differences were observed regarding NIHSS score (P = 0.994) or GCS score (P = 0.591) between groups. After 3 months, 22.8% patients in rt-PA group had favorable outcome as compared with 7.5% patients in control group (P = 0.014). Treatment with rt-PA did not significantly increase incidence of hemorrhage (P = 0.494) or mortality (P = 0.169). Conclusions Intravenous rt-PA administration within 4.5 h after onset of symptoms benefited stroke patients with abnormal consciousness.

AB  - ABSTRACT Segmental bone loss remains a challenging clinical problem for orthopaedic trauma surgeons. In addition to the missing bone itself, the local tissues (soft tissue, vascular) are often highly traumatized as well, resulting in a less than ideal environment for bone regeneration. As a result, attempts at limb salvage become a highly expensive endeavor, often requiring multiple operations and necessitating the use of every available strategy (autograft, allograft, bone graft substitution, Masquelet, bone transport, etc.) to achieve bony union. A cost-sensitive, functionally appropriate, and volumetrically adequate engineered substitute would be practice-changing for orthopaedic trauma surgeons and these patients with difficult clinical problems. In tissue engineering and bone regeneration fields, numerous research efforts continue to make progress toward new therapeutic interventions for segmental bone loss, including novel biomaterial development as well as cell-based strategies. Despite an ever-evolving literature base of these new therapeutic and engineered options, there remains a disconnect with the clinical practice, with very few translating into clinical use. A symposium entitled ?Building better bone: The weaving of biologic and engineering strategies for managing bone loss,? was presented at the 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society Conference to further explore this engineering-clinical disconnect, by surveying basic, translational, and clinical researchers along with orthopaedic surgeons and proposing ideas for pushing the bar forward in the field of segmental bone loss. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - SUMMARY Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae include pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. All these are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pneumococcus can colonize the nasopharynx, and this can be a prelude to bronchopneumonia and invasion of the vasculature space. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood?brain barrier and entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where the bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The infected host may develop septicaemia and/or meningitis secondary to bronchopneumonia. Also septicaemia is a common precursor of meningitis. The mechanisms surrounding the sequence of infection are unknown, but will be dependent on the properties of both the host and bacterium. Treatment of these diseases with antibiotics leads to clearance of the bacteria from the infected tissues, but the bacteriolytic nature of antibiotics leads to an acute release of bacterial toxins and thus after antibiotic therapy the patients can be left with organ-specific deficits. One of the main toxins released from pneumococci is the membrane pore forming toxin pneumolysin. Here we review the extensive studies on the role of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases.

AB  - Summary Antibodies can cause hyperacute, acute, or chronic rejection of allografts. These different types of rejection involve additional humoral mediators, including complement, coagulation factors, and cytokines, which engage cells of the innate immune system, notably platelets, granulocytes, and monocyte/macrophages. In this chapter we discuss the functional properties of antibodies that influence which humoral and cellular mediators are activated. Then the effects of complement activation and regulation are considered. The mechanisms by which antibodies and complement modulate interactions between innate immune cells and the vascular endothelium are summarized as a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of different types of graft destruction.

AB  - Abstract Hypoattenuating ocular lenses on CT have been described with cataract formation in humans, however published studies are currently lacking regarding this finding in veterinary patients. The purpose of this retrospective and prospective study was to describe the varying CT appearances of the ocular lens in vivo, and investigate the causes for CT density variations in a population of cats and dogs. A total of 102 canine and feline patients with CT of the head acquired at the authors? hospital between May 2011 and March 2019 were included. A bilateral hypoattenuating halo surrounding an isoattenuating to mildly hypoattenuating core was described in the ocular lens center of every cat in which a Philips brand proprietary image construction filter was used. A similar but more varied hypoattenuating region was noted in the lenses of 45.8% of dogs where the same filter was applied, as well as 43.8% of dogs with a second, similar filter. Ophthalmic examination of three live cats and one dog with hypoattenuating lenses demonstrated normal lens translucency, excluding the presence of cataract. The effect of different proprietary filters on lens appearance was also described in three fresh cadavers with normal lenses identified on ophthalmic, macroscopic, and microscopic examination. Etiology of the hypoattenuating areas within the ocular lens was not conclusively determined. Recognition that such a variant may be seen in the absence of cataract is important, in order to prevent misdiagnosis.

AB  - Summary Various aetiopathological mechanisms have been postulated to be at the root of Menière's disease (MD), and some data suggest that there may be also an underlying autoimmune factor. In fact, Menière patients manifest certain characteristics that are typical of autoimmune involvement association of particular human leucocyte antigen haplotypes, the presence of antibodies against internal ear antigens. In this study, we evaluated the association between thyroid autoimmunity and MD in a non-selected group of patients. We recruited 50 consecutive MD patients and two groups as controls: group A, 82 healthy volunteers; and group B, 50 subjects suffering from acute unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy. All subjects were submitted to instrumental assessment of cochlear?vestibular function and analysis of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, anti-TSH receptor antibody (TR-Ab), anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (Tg-Ab) in the blood. The prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis in group B [6/50 (12%); 66·7% TPO-Ab and 33·3% Tg-Ab] was superimposable with the healthy controls [6/82 (7%); 66·7% TPO-Ab and 33·3% Tg-Ab]. In contrast, 38% of the MD patients (P?= 0·0001 versus group A and group B) had significant autoantibody levels (68·4% TPO-Ab; 15·8% TPO-Ab?+?TR-Ab; 10·5% Tg-Ab; 5·2% TPO-Ab?+?Tg-Ab). Furthermore, 14% of the MD patients were hyperthyroid under l-thyroxine therapy, while no dysfunction was seen in the control groups. Overall, our data demonstrate a significant association between MD and thyroid autoimmunity, which suggests that an autoimmune factor is involved in the aetiopathogenesis of this disease. These findings suggest that it should be useful to submit MD patients to multi-disciplinary clinical investigation.
