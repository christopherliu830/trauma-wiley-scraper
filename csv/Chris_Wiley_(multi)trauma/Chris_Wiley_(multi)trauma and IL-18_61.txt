AB  - Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an invaluable diagnostic tool, particularly in patients with inadequate transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. In addition, continuous TEE has been used to monitor ventricular and valvular performance in the intensive care unit and the operating room. However, current generation transesophageal probes have limitations in the critical care setting due to their size. Recently, a prototype miniaturized transesophageal probe was developed to overcome these limitations. This probe was used by five medical centers for 194 examinations. A large proportion of these patients were in the intensive care unit (43%), as well as mechanically ventilated (39%). Seventy percent (70%) of the subjects in this study were intubated nasally with the prototype probe, with a success rate of 88.5%. Oral intubation was successful in every case. Subject tolerance was good, and 25% of the patients were intubated for > 1 h. Nasal intubation with the probe was more likely in intensive care patients, ventilated subjects, and patients who were intubated for > 1 hour. TEE with this miniaturized probe is feasible and safe even in multi-instrumented critical care patients. This probe provides adequate diagnostic imaging capabilities and may allow imaging over prolonged periods of time, making it suitable for the serial monitoring of ventricular performance.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim:? Portal hypertension is the main complication of cirrhosis and it is responsible for its most common complications. Bacterial translocation increases the morbidity and mortality rates in patients with portal hypertension. We aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin and misoprostol on bacterial translocation induced by portal hypertension. Methods:? We established four groups, each containing eight rats. Except for the control and sham groups, the animals in the other groups (treatment groups) received misoprostol or melatonin for 3?days after the first operation. In the sham group, a laparotomy was carried out and only the portal vein was dissected. Calibrated portal vein ligation was carried out in the other groups. All animals were given 1010Escherichia coli by orogastric intubation 12?h before sampling. Seventy-two hours after the first operation, mesenteric lymph node and blood samples were obtained and cultured. Two cc blood samples were obtained for a polymerase chain reaction study. A piece of terminal ileum was also sampled for histopathologic examination. Results:? Mesenteric lymph node and blood cultures of all control animals were positive for microbiological growth, and polymerase chain reaction results were positive in seven of the eight rats. Histopathologically, edema, vasodilatation and inflammatory cell infiltration were found to be less in the other groups in comparison to the control group. The incidence of bacterial translocation was decreased in all treatment groups as compared to the control group. Conclusions:? In this study, bacterial translocation occurred in portal hypertension. Melatonin and misoprostol reduced the incidence of bacterial translocation in portal hypertensive rats.

AB  - SUMMARY Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae include pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. All these are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pneumococcus can colonize the nasopharynx, and this can be a prelude to bronchopneumonia and invasion of the vasculature space. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood?brain barrier and entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where the bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The infected host may develop septicaemia and/or meningitis secondary to bronchopneumonia. Also septicaemia is a common precursor of meningitis. The mechanisms surrounding the sequence of infection are unknown, but will be dependent on the properties of both the host and bacterium. Treatment of these diseases with antibiotics leads to clearance of the bacteria from the infected tissues, but the bacteriolytic nature of antibiotics leads to an acute release of bacterial toxins and thus after antibiotic therapy the patients can be left with organ-specific deficits. One of the main toxins released from pneumococci is the membrane pore forming toxin pneumolysin. Here we review the extensive studies on the role of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases.

AB  - Summary Antibodies can cause hyperacute, acute, or chronic rejection of allografts. These different types of rejection involve additional humoral mediators, including complement, coagulation factors, and cytokines, which engage cells of the innate immune system, notably platelets, granulocytes, and monocyte/macrophages. In this chapter we discuss the functional properties of antibodies that influence which humoral and cellular mediators are activated. Then the effects of complement activation and regulation are considered. The mechanisms by which antibodies and complement modulate interactions between innate immune cells and the vascular endothelium are summarized as a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of different types of graft destruction.

AB  - Summary Background and purpose Few reports concerned on recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment in stroke patients with decreased consciousness. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of intravenous rt-PA administration within 4.5 h in stroke patients with decreased consciousness. Methods A total of 136 stroke patients with decreased consciousness, who received or not rt-PA intravenously within 4.5 h after stroke onset from Jiangsu province of China from 2009 to 2012, were reviewed retrospectively. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), intracranial hemorrhage rate, and mortality were used to determine patient outcome when discharged. A 3-month outcome was calculated by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) with score 0 to 1 considered favorable outcome. Results Baseline characteristics of two groups were similar. When discharged, no significant differences were observed regarding NIHSS score (P = 0.994) or GCS score (P = 0.591) between groups. After 3 months, 22.8% patients in rt-PA group had favorable outcome as compared with 7.5% patients in control group (P = 0.014). Treatment with rt-PA did not significantly increase incidence of hemorrhage (P = 0.494) or mortality (P = 0.169). Conclusions Intravenous rt-PA administration within 4.5 h after onset of symptoms benefited stroke patients with abnormal consciousness.

AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the general health status of asylum seekers and their access to health services. DesignProspective questionnaire survey. SettingA community-based asylum seeker centre in Sydney from March to September 1994, before the Limited Health Care Assistance Scheme had taken effect. ParticipantsForty of 57 eligible asylum seekers from 21 different countries attending English language classes. Main outcome measuresResults on the traumatic events section of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, a postmigratory problem checklist, the COOP Functional Health Assessment charts, the Duke-University of Northern Carolina Health Profile, and a structured interview to assess difficulties in accessing health care in Australia. ResultsMore than 30 of the 40 participants reported exposure to past trauma. Asylum seekers were more impaired in their emotional health than a normative group of patients with minor (P< 0.001) and serious (P< 0.001) medical illnesses, and more impaired in role functioning than those with minor medical illnesses (P<0.001). Twenty or more reported symptoms of nervousness, headache, and/or depression; ConclusionsAlthough a selective sample, the asylum seekers in our study appeared to be suffering substantial levels of emotional and somatic symptoms, yet, for most, access to health care was a major problem. The effectiveness of recent sequential changes to the provisions covering welfare and health care for asylum seekers needs to be closely monitored.

AB  - Abstract Despite improvements in medical and surgical treatment of intestinal failure, intestine transplant continues to play an important role. In 2016, a total of 147 intestine transplants were performed, 80 intestine-without-liver and 67 intestine-liver. Over the past decade, the age distribution of candidates waitlisted for intestine and intestine-liver transplant shifted from primarily pediatric to increasing proportions of adults. In 2016, 58.2% of candidates on the intestine list at any time during the year were aged younger than 18 years, with a decrease over time in those aged younger than 6 years and an increase in those aged 6-17 years. Adults accounted for 41.9% of candidates on the list at any time during the year, with a stable proportion of those aged 18-34 years and a decrease in those aged 35 years or older. By age, pretransplant mortality rate was highest for adult candidates at 11.7 per 100 waitlist years and lowest for children aged younger than 6 years at 2.2 per 100 waitlist years. For intestine transplants with or without a liver in 2009-2011, 1- and 5-year graft survival was 72.0% and 54.1%, respectively, for recipients aged younger than 18 years, and 70.5% and 44.1%, respectively, for recipients aged 18 years or older.

AB  - Development of inhibitors against factor VIII (FVIII), the major complication of haemophilia A treatment today, is influenced by multiple factors. Genetic (F8 mutation, family history, ethnicity, polymorphisms in immune modulating genes) and non-genetic (intensive exposure to FVIII, presence of pro-inflammatory signals as might occur with large bleeds, infections, surgery, or other immune stimulants [e.g. vaccines]) risk factors as well as their complex inter-relationships contribute to the inhibitor risk profile of haemophilia patients, particularly in the previously untreated patient (PUP) population. Studies in PUPs have been fundamental to furthering the understanding of FVIII inhibitor development, as well as discovering previously unappreciated risk factors. The multi-factorial nature of inhibitor development makes it difficult to ascertain the contribution of FVIII products in inhibitor development through individual PUP studies. Sufficiently powered studies of large cohorts may overcome these limitations but interpretations should be conducted cautiously. Proper design and implementation of PUP safety studies will become even more important with the introduction of new molecules, such as extended half-life or human cell-line derived FVIII that propose reduced immunogenicity. Despite these difficulties, carefully performed clinical studies in PUPs may provide important insights into the natural history of the immune response to FVIII and may suggest targets for intervention to reduce immunogenicity.

AB  - Abstract Background. Surgical resection is the most effective therapy for liver cancer. Intraoperative blood loss during liver resection remains a major concern due to association with higher postoperative complications. The InLine radiofrequency ablation device (ILRFA) has achieved promising results in liver surgery with minimal blood loss and no increase of postoperative complications. In this multicentre controlled study, 108 patients undergoing liver resection were investigated. Patients and methods. A total of 108 patients underwent liver resections in 4 medical centres; the prospective sequential cohort study consisted of 54 ILRFA and 54 ultrasonic surgical aspirator transections as the control group. Results. The type of liver resection performed was very similar in both groups. The median number of RFA deployments was 3 (range 1?12) with a median coagulation time of 9 (range 3?36) min. Median blood loss was 165±20 ml (range 5?675) in the ILRFA and 654±83 ml (range 80?3600) in the control group (p<0.001). The median transection time was 27 (2?219) min in the ILRFA group and 35 (5?62) min in controls. Conclusions. Our study indicates that ILRFA device for liver transection is effective in reducing blood loss and is safe. Precoagulation before parenchymal transection appears to be a valid concept in liver surgery. The avoidance of vascular inflow occlusion during parenchymal transection could also be of value.

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2011; 17: 306?311 Abstract Skull-base osteomyelitis (SBO) occurs secondary to invasive bacterial and fungal infection. Distinguishing between fungal and bacterial aetiologies of SBO has significant therapeutic implications. An 18-year (1990?2007) retrospective review of patients with SBO presenting to Westmead Hospital was performed. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collated. Twenty-one patients (median age 58?years) with SBO were identified: ten (48%) had bacterial and 11 (52%) had fungal SBO. Diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic otitis externa (33%) were the most frequent co-morbidities; immunosuppression was present in five cases (24%). Cranial nerve deficits occurred in ten (48%) patients. The commonest pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% bacterial SBO) and a zygomycete (55% fungal SBO). Compared to bacterial SBO, fungal SBO was more frequently associated with underlying chronic sinusitis, sinonasal pain, facial/periorbital swelling and nasal stuffiness or discharge and the absence of purulent ear discharge (all p?<0.05). Bacterial SBO was more frequently associated with deafness, ear pain or ear discharge (all p?<0.05). Median time to presentation was longer in patients with bacterial SBO (26.3?weeks vs. 8.1?weeks, p 0.08). Overall 6-month survival was 88% (14/18 patients). All four deaths occurred in patients with fungal SBO. Immunosuppression was a risk factor for death (p?<0.05). Early diagnostic sampling is recommended in patients at increased risk of fungal SBO to enable optimal antimicrobial and surgical management.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Effective carrier technologies and dosing appear critical for the successful use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This study evaluated radiographically the potential of a purpose-designed titanium porous-oxide implant surface combined with recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) to stimulate alveolar ridge augmentation. Material and methods: Twelve young-adult Labrador dogs were used. Three 10-mm titanium implants per jaw quadrant were placed 5?mm into the alveolar ridge following extraction of the premolar teeth and reduction of alveolar ridge. Six animals received implants coated with rhBMP-2 at 0.75 or 1.5?mg/ml randomized to contralateral jaw quadrants. Another six animals received implants coated with rhBMP-2 at 3?mg/ml or uncoated control using the same split-mouth design. The mucoperiosteal flaps were advanced, adapted, and sutured to submerge the implants. Radiographic registrations were made immediately postsurgery (baseline), and at weeks 4 and 8 (end of study). Results: rhBMP-2-coated implants exhibited robust radiographic bone formation extending to and above the implant platform from week 4 (P<0.01). Some rhBMP-2-coated implants showed voids within the newly formed bone that gradually resolved and/or implant displacement, being severe in two animals receiving implants coated with rhBMP-2 at 3?mg/ml. Controls showed limited, if any, new bone formation at weeks 4 and 8 postsurgery. There were no significant differences among the rhBMP-2 groups in bone gain. Conclusions: The titanium porous-oxide surface serves as an effective carrier for rhBMP-2, showing a clinically significant potential to stimulate local bone formation. With the carrier technology used, therapeutic dosage appears to be in the range of 0.75?1.5?mg/ml.
