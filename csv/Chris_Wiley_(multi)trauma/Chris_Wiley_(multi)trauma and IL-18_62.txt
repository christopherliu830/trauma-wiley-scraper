AB  - Abstract:? The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are critically involved in inflammation and are activated by stress. This suggests that stressful circumstances may affect the chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fifty-six scientific publications of the past 15 years were reviewed to get insight into the possible impact of stressors (grouped in five categories) on the health status and HPA axis and ANS functioning of adult patients with RA. Our findings in this review were: (1) In response to mental and physical effort and applied physiological stressors, patients demonstrate ANS hyporesponsiveness and ?too normal? HPA axis responsiveness considering the elevated immune activity. A premorbid defect, past and current inflammatory activity, past and current stress, and physical deconditioning may explain disturbed physiological responses. (2) After brief naturalistic stressors, self-perceived and clinician's ratings of disease activity are increased; inflammation parameters have been insufficiently examined. (3) Major life events do not univocally affect disease status, but appear able to modify disease activity in a positive or negative way, depending on the nature, duration, and dose of the accompanying physiological stress response. (4) Enduring (e.g., work-related or interpersonal) stressors are associated with perceived health. Because this stressor category mingles with personality variables, the mere observation of a correlation does not prove that chronic stressors provoke health changes, although this might be the case. (5) Not one study rigorously examined the prospective hypothesis that past stressors (e.g., childhood victimization or pre-onset stressful incidents) may trigger RA or aggravate existing RA, which is a realistic belief for some patients.

AB  - The antioxidant effects of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) contribute substantially to the health benefits of this compound. Resveratrol has been shown to be a scavenger of a number of free radicals. However, the direct scavenging activities of resveratrol are relatively poor. The antioxidant properties of resveratrol in vivo are more likely to be attributable to its effect as a gene regulator. Resveratrol inhibits NADPH oxidase-mediated production of ROS by down-regulating the expression and activity of the oxidase. This polyphenolic compound reduces mitochondrial superoxide generation by stimulating mitochondria biogenesis. Resveratrol prevents superoxide production from uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase by up-regulating the tetrahydrobiopterin-synthesizing enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase I. In addition, resveratrol increases the expression of various antioxidant enzymes. Some of the gene-regulating effects of resveratrol are mediated by the histone/protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 or by the nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2. In this review article, we have also summarized the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol observed in clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? The assessment of body composition is an important aspect of the determination of nutritional health. This cross-sectional measurement study aimed to assess the relative validity of a range of field techniques for the measurement of body composition in a sample of older orthopaedic inpatients participating in rehabilitation. Methods:? Assessment of percent fat-free mass of 31 adults, aged 65?years and over, was conducted under fasting conditions by two types of bioelectrical impedance analysis (multi-frequency and single frequency?using manufacturer's pre-programmed prediction equation) and compared with percent fat-free mass estimated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a reference technique. Data from multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis were also used to calculate percent fat-free mass from the prediction equation of Dey et?al. for comparison. Skeletal muscle mass was derived from assessment of corrected arm muscle area and compared with skeletal muscle mass from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to determine the level of agreement between each field technique and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results:? Mean bias and limits of agreement between single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were ?5.7% (?24.0, 12.6), between multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (manufacturer's pre-programmed prediction equation) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were 1.4% (?13.4, 16.1), between multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (Dey et?al. prediction equation) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were ?5.0% (?16.6, 6.6) and between skeletal muscle mass as derived from assessment of corrected arm muscle area and skeletal muscle mass from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis ?0.97?kg (?8.37, 6.43). Conclusion:? None of the methods assessed are clinically acceptable for assessment of body composition in older orthopaedic rehabilitation patients; however, estimation of skeletal muscle mass, as derived from corrected arm muscle area, is likely to be of more use in the clinical setting as there is no requirement for patients to be fasted.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the isoflurane sparing effect and the post-surgical analgesia provided by a brachial plexus block (BPB) in cats undergoing distal thoracic limb surgery. Study design? Prospective randomized blinded clinical study. Animals? Twenty client-owned cats. Methods? Cats were assigned to receive either no BPB (group NB) or a nerve stimulator guided BPB (group BPB) using lidocaine (3.6?mg?kg?1) and bupivacaine (1.2?mg?kg?1). Pre-medication consisted of midazolam and ketamine intravenously (IV). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol IV to effect and maintained with isoflurane delivered in oxygen and a continuous rate infusion of fentanyl (2??g?kg?1?hour?1). End-tidal isoflurane concentration (Fe?ISO) was adjusted every 3?minutes guided by changes in cardiorespiratory parameters and reflexes present, to maintain a stable depth of anaesthesia. Five time points were chosen to record all parameters and compare values between groups. Recovery and post-operative pain assessment were performed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 15 and 45?minutes after extubation and thereafter at hourly intervals until 5?hours after placement of the BPB. Results? No clinically significant differences were seen for heart rate, respiratory rate and non-invasive blood pressure between groups. Mean Fe?ISO was significantly lower in group BPB compared with group NB at all time points. In group NB, all intraoperative measurements of Fe?ISO were significantly higher compared with baseline (3?minutes before start of surgery) measurements. During recovery, VAS scores for group BPB were significantly lower than for group NB. Additional analgesics were needed in all cats within the study period. Conclusion and Clinical relevance? In cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery of the thoracic limb, BPB reduced intra-operative isoflurane requirement and pain during the early post-operative period when compared with procedures without a BPB. BPB is a useful adjunct to anaesthesia in such cases.

AB  - This study addresses a possible link between suicide and casino gambling. Resident suicide rates are analyzed for (a) a 1990 cross-section of 148 U.S. metropolitan areas and (b) before and after the advent of legalized casinos in five U.S. counties. Data are drawn from government and gaming industry sources. In cross-section, metro area suicide is strongly correlated with region, accidental death and homicide rates, age and race composition, and economic vitality, followed by a modest net positive correlation with casino presence. By contrast, the time series analysis yields no evidence of a gambling effect.

Journal of Advanced Nursing66(3), 664?672. Abstract Aim.? This paper is a report of a study conducted to translate the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool? into Arabic and to determine its psychometric properties, including reliability, validity and factorial structure. Background.? Worldwide numbers of natural and man-made disasters have greatly increased in recent years. Since disaster strikes without warning, all healthcare providers, especially nurses, must be prepared with appropriate skills and resources for disaster procedures and management during the three phases of disaster: pre disaster, during disaster and post disaster. Knowledge levels need to be evaluated to plan effective educational programmes. Methods.? The Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool? was translated into Classical Arabic using Beaton?s guideline for translation and validated by experts and a pilot study with 20 Registered Nurses from the target population. Data were collected in 2008 using self-administered questionnaires from 474 (79% return rate) Jordanian Registered Nurses who worked in randomly selected Ministry of Health hospitals and two university hospitals. Results.? Principal component analysis (Promax rotation with Kaiser Normalization procedure, SPSS? version 15) was used to determined construct validity, and three factors explained 64% of the variance: knowledge, skills and post disaster management. Cronbach?s alpha was 0·90, which demonstrated internal consistency. Conclusion.? These results support the reliability and validity of the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool? as a measure of knowledge, skills and post disaster management. It can be used with confidence with an Arabic-speaking nursing population to measure their preparedness for disasters. Based on the results of such studies, effective disaster preparedness programmes could be developed to enhance nurses? disaster preparedness.

AB  - Abstract Homocysteine (HCY) has recently been linked to fragility fractures. Moreover, HCY activates osteoclasts. Little is known about the effect of HCY on activity of human osteoblasts (OBs). We hypothesized that HCY decreases the activity of OBs. Osteoblasts obtained from tra-becular human bone specimens of eight donors were cultured with conditioned medium. Culture medium was adjusted to 0, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 ?M HCY. After 14 days alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, pro-collagen type I N-terminal peptide (PINP) and osteocalcin (OC) secretion in the supernatant were measured. After 20 days the formation of mineralized matrix was analyzed. HCY-stimulated AP activity gradually (100 ?M HCY: 118%, P= 0.006; 500 ?M HCY: 125%, P < 0.001). At 1000 and 2000 ?M HCY the increase of AP activity was reversible (1000 ?M HCY: 106%, P= 0.317; 2000 ?M HCY: 102%, P < 0.737). The PINP secretion was also stimulated by HCY reaching a maximum of 260 ± 154 ?g/l at 500 ?mol/l versus 205 ± 94 ?,g/l in controls. After 20 days of culture the formation of bone matrix was increased at 100 and 500 ?M HCY. OC secretion was not significantly changed. The results of the present study consistently demonstrate a moderate stimulation of primary human OB activity by increasing concentrations of HCY. However, the magnitude of this effect seems to be less pronounced than recent observations on primary human osteoclasts, suggesting a dysbalance between OBs and osteoclasts in favour of osteoclasts

AB  - Abstract Sarcomas arise primarily from mesenchymal structures at any site in the body, even within visceral stroma and neurovascular bundles. Sarcomas have been associated with prior radiation therapy, toxic exposures, and genetic conditions and soft tissue sarcomas have been distinguished from bone sarcomas. For localized soft tissue sarcoma, tumor grade is the most important prognostic variable. Low-grade tumors are generally cured by wide surgical excision, but there is a significant rate of both local recurrence and development of distant metastasis in high-grade lesions. The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma histologic subtypes is generally similar grade-for-grade, with the exception of rhabomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Tumor location strongly influences resectability. Radiation therapy has been used successfully in conjunction with conservative surgery to improve local control rates for soft tissue sarcomas, particularly in extremity lesions. Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy remains unproven for most adult soft tissue sarcomas, but is established in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing's sarcomas.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of an endodontic infection on periodontal probing depth and presence of furcation involvement in periodontally-involved mandibular molars. All first and second mandibular molars in 100 patients were selected if at least one was root-filled or had a possible periapical radiolucency. The sample consisted of patients from a referral population at a periodontal clinic which represented an adult population with a mean age between 50 and 60 years. For mandibular molars with periapical destruction at both roots, mean periodontal probing depth was significantly greater compared to teeth without periapical destruction. Horizontal furcation depths ≥3 mm were significantly more frequent at mandibular molars with periapical destruction. It is suggested that a root canal infection in periodontitis-involved molars may potentiate periodontitis progression by spreading of endodontic pathogens through patent accessory canals and dentinal tubules. In conclusion, an endodontic infection in mandibular molars was found to be associated with additional attachment loss in the furcation area, and may thus be considered to be one of several risk factors influencing the prognosis of molars in periodontitis-prone patients.

AB  - Abstract Inflammation and immunity development are well recognized as responses to tumor treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). To demonstrate that another major host response effector process, acute phase response, may be also induced by this cancer treatment modality, the expression of serum amyloid P component (SAP) acknowledged as a hallmark acute phase reactant in the mouse was investigated following PDT of murine FsaR fibrosarcomas. The results reveal almost 150-fold increase in the expression of SAP gene in the liver of mice bearing tumors treated by Photofrin-mediated PDT, while serum SAP levels increased around 50-fold at the peak interval about 24 hr post PDT. The same tumor treatment induced also the liver gene upregulation and serum levels elevation of another established acute phase reactant, mannose-binding lectin A (MBL-A). Both SAP and MBL-A were found to accumulate in PDT-treated tumors, but this includes local production because their genes in these tumor tissues were upregulated as well. Gene encoding C-reactive protein (CRP) was also upregulated almost 7-fold in the same tumor tissues, suggesting a rare example of CRP participation in host response of the mouse. Interleukin-6 and glucocorticoid hormones were identified as major mediators promoting tumor PDT-induced upregulation of liver SAP gene. Moreover, glucocorticoids were found to act as critical inducers of SAP gene upregulation in PDT-treated tumors. The study definitely proves the occurrence of a strong acute phase response following tumor PDT, and reveals that glucocorticoid hormones released during this development impact the expression of host response-relevant genes in PDT-treated tumors. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We evaluated the impact of transrectal prostate needle biopsy (TPNB) on erectile function and on the prostate and bilateral neurovascular bundles using power Doppler ultrasonography imaging of the prostate. The study consisted of 42 patients who had undergone TPNB. Erectile function was evaluated prior to the biopsy, and in the 3rd month after the biopsy using the first five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Prior to and 3?months after the biopsy, the resistivity index of the prostate parenchyma and both neurovascular bundles was measured. The mean age of the men was 64.2 (47?78) years. Prior to TPNB, 10 (23.8%) patients did not have erectile dysfunction (ED) and 32 (76.2%) patients had ED. The mean IIEF-5 score was 20.8 (range: 2?25) prior to the biopsies, and the mean IIEF-5 score was 17.4 (range: 5?25; p?<?0.001) after 3 months. For patients who were previously potent in the pre-biopsy period, the ED rate was 40% (n?=?4/10) at the 3rd month evaluation. In these patients, all the resistivity index values were significantly decreased. Our results showed that TPNB may lead to an increased risk of ED. The presence of ED in men after TPNB might have an organic basis.

AB  - Summary The purposes of this study were to investigate the position of the mandibular condyle and temporomandibular fossa between the adolescent patients affected by bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) and well-matched controls without any cleft by using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The study sample consisted of 17 patients (7 females and 10 males; mean age, 14.27?±?2.83 years) affected by BCLP and 17 patients (6 females and 11 males; mean age, 14.27?±?2.12 years) as age-and sex-matched control group without any cleft. Using cone-beam computed tomography segmented three-dimensional temporomandibular fossa and mandibular condyle images were reconstructed and angular, linear, and volumetric measurements of the patients in both sides of the groups were examined using Paired and Student's t-tests. Comparison of the sides showed that both sides were found to be similar in BCLP and control groups, except the condylar angulation of the right side was found to be higher compared to that of the left side in both groups (p?<?0.05). Comparison of the groups showed that the patients affected by BCLP and non-cleft patients had similar values for all parameters, except for the condylar angulation in the right side (BCLP group had less angulation compared to controls; p?<?0.05). The condylar volume was found to be slightly less in the BCLP group in both sides compared to the controls (p?>?0.05). The positions of the mandibular condyle and temporomandibular fossa were found to be similar in patients affected by BCLP and control group of without any cleft.
