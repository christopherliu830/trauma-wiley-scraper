AB  - Nutrition support has become widely recognized as an essential component of optimal care for acutely ill patients. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral routes when possible. However, prescribed enteral nutritional regimens are sometimes met with side effects and even complications. These adverse events have been collectively termed ?intolerance,? and forms of intolerance occur in a spectrum from bothersome at least to life threatening when most severe. Here we discuss nutritional access and its maintenance, introduce and define intolerance, and then review the current literature with regard to principal forms of enteral nutrition intolerance.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Health, disease, and immune function are key areas of research in studies of ecology and evolution, but work on free-ranging primates has been inhibited by a lack of direct noninvasive measures of condition. Here, we evaluate the potential usefulness of noninvasive measurement of three biomarkers, the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin, and neopterin, a by-product of macrophage activity. Materials and Methods We took advantage of veterinary checks on captive rhesus (24) and long-tailed (3) macaques at the German Primate Center (DPZ) to analyze serum marker measures, before measuring concentrations in feces and urine, and evaluating relationships between matched serum, urine, and fecal concentrations. In a second study, we monitored excretion of these markers in response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and surgical tissue trauma, undertaken for a separate study. Results We found that each biomarker could be measured in each matrix. Serum and urinary concentrations of neopterin were strongly and significantly correlated, but neither haptoglobin nor CRP concentrations in excreta proxied circulating serum concentrations. Our infection study confirmed that urinary neopterin, in particular, is a reliable marker of viral infection in macaques, but also indicated the potential of urinary and fecal CRP and haptoglobin as indicators of inflammation. Discussion We highlight the potential of noninvasive markers of immune function, especially of urinary neopterin, which correlates strongly with serum neopterin, and is highly responsive to infection.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effect of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) on prevention of urethral stricture recurrence after internal urethrotomy. Patients and methods Of 55 men who were randomly selected, 43 completed the investigation. Of these, 21 patients performed CIC weekly for 1 year following Sachse's operation for urethral stricture and 22 patients formed the control group after the same operation. All had an objective examination for urethral stricture every 2 months after surgery. Results Significantly fewer (P < 0.01) patients developed recurrence of urethral stricture within the first postoperative year in the CIC group (n= 4) compared with the control group (n= 15). No CIC complications were seen, and patients who completed the CIC programme considered the method fully acceptable. Conclusion Weekly CIC is a simple method of reducing the frequency of urethral stricture recurrence after internal urethrotomy.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

AB  - A 16-year-old, neutered male, domestic short hair cat had abdominal distension and systemic hypertension. Radiography, ultrasonography, excretory urography, and renal scintigraphy were performed to establish the diagnosis and implement appropriate treatment. Bilateral perirenal pseudocysts were confirmed surgically and histopathologically. Following bilateral renal capsulectomy, systemic hypertension decreased and global glomerular filtration rate improved to normal limits. Multiple imaging modalities helped establish the diagnosis and guided implementation of appropriate treatment.

AB  - Abstract Aim The purposes of this study were to investigate senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) levels in articular cartilage of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and the relationship with severity of the disease. Methods All the 50 cartilage tissues, including normal (controls) and OA cartilage were ascribed to four groups of normal, mild lesions, moderate lesions and severe lesions on the basis of the modified Mankin score. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the SA-beta-Gal expression in articular cartilage. Results No SA-beta-Gal staining was observed in the normal articular cartilage samples. SA-beta-Gal staining was found in a subset of the chondrocytes close to the lesion site of mild, moderate and severe damaged knee OA cartilage. The percentage of SA-beta-Gal-positive chondrocytes in articular cartilage was 0% in controls, 13.00 ± 5.77% in mild lesions, 31.65 ± 6.91% in moderate lesions and 51.95 ± 6.21% in severe lesions. SA-beta-Gal expression in mild lesions, moderate lesions and severe lesions was higher compared with that of controls (P < 0.0001). SA-beta-Gal expression in moderate lesions and severe lesions were higher with respect to mild lesion samples (P < 0.0001). SA-beta-Gal expression in severe lesions was elevated compared with those of moderate lesions (P < 0.0001). Subsequent analysis showed that articular cartilage SA-beta-Gal levels correlated with severity of disease (Spearman's ? = 0.94, P < 0.0001). Conclusion SA-beta-Gal expression in articular cartilage is associated with progressive knee OA joint damage and is a potential indictor of disease severity.

AB  - Background and purpose:? There are only few small studies assessing potential risk factors, comorbidity, and prognostic factors in adult spontaneous cervicocerebral artery dissection (CAD). Methods:? We conducted a retrospective, hospital-based analysis on the prognostic factors and association of CAD with vascular risk factors in 301 consecutive Finnish patients, diagnosed from 1994 to 2007. Results:? Two thirds of the patients were men (68%). Women were younger than men. Migraine (36% of all patients), especially with visual aura (63% of all migraineurs), and smoking were more common in patients with CAD compared with the general Finnish population. At 3?months, 247 (83%) patients reached a favorable outcome. Occlusion of the dissected artery, internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD), and recent infection in infarction patients were associated with a poorer outcome. ICAD patients had less often brain infarction, but the strokes they had were more severe. Seven (2.3%) patients died during the follow-up (mean 4.0?years, 1186 patient years). Six (2%) patients had verified CAD recurrence. Conclusions:? This study provides evidence for the association of CAD with male sex, and possible association with smoking and migraine. Occlusion of the dissected artery, ICAD, and infection appear to be associated with poorer outcome.

AB  - Summary.? Background:? Increasing the threshold to define a positive D-dimer could reduce unnecessary computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) but might increase rates of a missed PE and missed pneumonia, the most common non-thromboembolic diagnosis seen on CTPA. Objective:? Measure the effect of doubling the standard D-dimer threshold for ?PE unlikely? Revised Geneva (RGS) or Wells? scores on the exclusion rate, frequency and size of a missed PE and missed pneumonia. Methods:? Patients evaluated for a suspected PE with 64-channel CTPA were prospectively enrolled from emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient units of four hospitals. Pretest probability data were collected in real time and the D-dimer was measured in a central laboratory. Criterion standard was CPTA interpretation by two independent radiologists combined with clinical outcome at 30?days. Results:? Of 678 patients enrolled, 126 (19%) were PE+ and 93 (14%) had pneumonia. Use of either Wells??≤?4 or RGS?≤?6 produced similar results. For example, with RGS?≤?6 and standard threshold (<?500?ng?mL?1), D-dimer was negative in 110/678 (16%), and 4/110 were PE+ (posterior probability 3.8%) and 9/110 (8.2%) had pneumonia. With RGS?≤?6 and a threshold <?1000?ng?mL?1, D-dimer was negative in 208/678 (31%) and 11/208 (5.3%) were PE+, but 10/11 missed PEs were subsegmental and none had concomitant DVT. Pneumonia was found in 12/208 (5.4%) with RGS?≤?6 and D-dimer?<?1000?ng?mL?1. Conclusions:? Doubling the threshold for a positive D-dimer with a PE unlikely pretest probability could reduce CTPA scanning with a slightly increased risk of missed isolated subsegmental PE, and no increase in rate of missed pneumonia.

AB  - Nucleic acid detection methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can often detect specific microbial pathogens, virulence markers and antimicrobial resistance genes more rapidly and with greater sensitivity and specificity than culture and conventional identification and susceptibility testing. Multiplex PCR can detect multiple genes in a single assay; this capability will be greatly extended by new techniques such as the DNA chip. However, limitations and pitfalls of nucleic detection methods remain.

AB  - Abstract Tacrolimus is a nonsteroidal alternative to treat noninfectious otitis externa (OE) in people. This 21-day study investigated whether twice daily application (0.2?mL/dose) of sterile olive oil based 0.1% tacrolimus suspension in ears of atopic beagle dogs without OE was associated with adverse local reactions, development of OE, change in otic cytology, vestibular dysfunction, or hearing loss detected by brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER). The study was randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. Twenty-two dogs matched for age and sex were randomized to tacrolimus or vehicle control treatment groups. Two investigators independently evaluated dogs for signs of adverse effects including OE the first 4?days of treatment, then every 3?days. A logistic regression model was fit for each investigator?s clinical scores (SAS, 9.2, 2008). Time (P?=?0.0032) and group (P?=?0.0167) were always significant for OE. Inter-observer reliability of clinical scores was strong, measured using Kappa coefficients and proportion of agreement. All nine exclusions (7/10 control- and 2/12 tacrolimus-treated dogs) were excluded for yeast OE. Inter-observer agreement to exclude was 100%. All dogs not excluded had normal BAER assessments before treatment, weekly during treatment, and after 21?days of treatment. None showed vestibular abnormalities at these times. Tacrolimus blood concentrations (Abbott IMx Tacrolimus II) were below detection limits (3?ng/mL) at baseline and after 21?days of treatment. Results suggest otic application of olive oil based tacrolimus suspension to canine ears with intact tympanic membranes is unlikely to result in hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction but yeast OE is a possible risk.

AB  - Abstract Background? The interaction between the OX40 ligand (OX40L) and OX40 has been suggested to have pathogenetic significance in atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective? The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and relevance of OX40L and OX40 in AD skin. Methods? OX40L and OX40 were stained immunohistochemically on the cryosections of the lesional and non-lesional skin of 17 subjects with moderate-to-severe AD and of 10 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated keratinocytes and cell membrane preparations from PMA-stimulated keratinocytes or LAD-2 mast cells were incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence or absence of blocking monoclonal antibodies to OX40L, CD30L or ICAM-1. Results? We show for the first time that the staining intensity of OX40L and the number of OX40+ cells are significantly greater in the lesional dermis than in the healthy-looking dermis in AD (P?<?0.001 in both comparisons) and also in psoriasis (P?=?0.01 and P?<?0.001 respectively), but neither molecule correlate significantly with the clinical severity of AD. Living keratinocytes and cell membranes from LAD-2 mast cells and keratinocytes increased the PBMC proliferation response. Anti-OX40L antibody inhibited, in a similar fashion as anti-ICAM-1 and anti-CD30L, PBMC proliferation induced by LAD-2 membranes, but stimulated that induced by keratinocytes. Conclusion? Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of OX40 and OX40L in the pathogenesis of AD though they are not specific to AD and in vitro results suggest complex interaction.
