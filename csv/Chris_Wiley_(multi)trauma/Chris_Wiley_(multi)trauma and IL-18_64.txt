AB  - Abstract The intranuclear architectural protein that is termed high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) was recently identified as a potent proinflammatory mediator when present extracellularly. HMGB1 has been demonstrated to be a long-searched-for nuclear danger signal passively released by necrotic, as opposed to apoptotic, cells that will induce inflammation. Furthermore, HMGB1 can also be actively secreted by stimulated macrophages or monocytes in a process requiring acetylation of the molecule, which enables translocation from the nucleus to secretory lysosomes. Subsequenttransport out of the cells depends on a secretion signal mediated by either extracellular lysophophatidyl-choline or ATP. HMGB1 passively released from necrotic cells and HMGB1 actively secreted byinflammatory cells are thus molecularly different. Extracellular HMGB1 acts as a cytokine by signaling via the receptor for advanced glycated end-products and via members of the Toll-like receptor family. The initiated inflammatory responses include the production of multiple cytokines, chemoattraction of certain stem cells, induction of vascular adhesion molecules and impaired function of intestinalepithelial cells. Therapeutic administration of HMGB1 antagonists rescues mice from lethal sepsis, even when initial treatment is delayed for 24?h after the onset of infection, establishing a clinically relevant therapeutic window that is significantly wider than for other known cytokines.

AB  - Summary.? Background:? Increasing the threshold to define a positive D-dimer could reduce unnecessary computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) but might increase rates of a missed PE and missed pneumonia, the most common non-thromboembolic diagnosis seen on CTPA. Objective:? Measure the effect of doubling the standard D-dimer threshold for ?PE unlikely? Revised Geneva (RGS) or Wells? scores on the exclusion rate, frequency and size of a missed PE and missed pneumonia. Methods:? Patients evaluated for a suspected PE with 64-channel CTPA were prospectively enrolled from emergency departments (EDs) and inpatient units of four hospitals. Pretest probability data were collected in real time and the D-dimer was measured in a central laboratory. Criterion standard was CPTA interpretation by two independent radiologists combined with clinical outcome at 30?days. Results:? Of 678 patients enrolled, 126 (19%) were PE+ and 93 (14%) had pneumonia. Use of either Wells??≤?4 or RGS?≤?6 produced similar results. For example, with RGS?≤?6 and standard threshold (<?500?ng?mL?1), D-dimer was negative in 110/678 (16%), and 4/110 were PE+ (posterior probability 3.8%) and 9/110 (8.2%) had pneumonia. With RGS?≤?6 and a threshold <?1000?ng?mL?1, D-dimer was negative in 208/678 (31%) and 11/208 (5.3%) were PE+, but 10/11 missed PEs were subsegmental and none had concomitant DVT. Pneumonia was found in 12/208 (5.4%) with RGS?≤?6 and D-dimer?<?1000?ng?mL?1. Conclusions:? Doubling the threshold for a positive D-dimer with a PE unlikely pretest probability could reduce CTPA scanning with a slightly increased risk of missed isolated subsegmental PE, and no increase in rate of missed pneumonia.

AB  - Abstract Tacrolimus is a nonsteroidal alternative to treat noninfectious otitis externa (OE) in people. This 21-day study investigated whether twice daily application (0.2?mL/dose) of sterile olive oil based 0.1% tacrolimus suspension in ears of atopic beagle dogs without OE was associated with adverse local reactions, development of OE, change in otic cytology, vestibular dysfunction, or hearing loss detected by brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER). The study was randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. Twenty-two dogs matched for age and sex were randomized to tacrolimus or vehicle control treatment groups. Two investigators independently evaluated dogs for signs of adverse effects including OE the first 4?days of treatment, then every 3?days. A logistic regression model was fit for each investigator?s clinical scores (SAS, 9.2, 2008). Time (P?=?0.0032) and group (P?=?0.0167) were always significant for OE. Inter-observer reliability of clinical scores was strong, measured using Kappa coefficients and proportion of agreement. All nine exclusions (7/10 control- and 2/12 tacrolimus-treated dogs) were excluded for yeast OE. Inter-observer agreement to exclude was 100%. All dogs not excluded had normal BAER assessments before treatment, weekly during treatment, and after 21?days of treatment. None showed vestibular abnormalities at these times. Tacrolimus blood concentrations (Abbott IMx Tacrolimus II) were below detection limits (3?ng/mL) at baseline and after 21?days of treatment. Results suggest otic application of olive oil based tacrolimus suspension to canine ears with intact tympanic membranes is unlikely to result in hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction but yeast OE is a possible risk.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) reconstruction at two different slice thicknesses (1?mm, ?high resolution? vs. 5?mm, ?routine?) with respect to the detection of blebs and bullae (BBs) in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Methods Thirty-one patients underwent wedge resection of BBs (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral) for PSP from January 2010 to January 2013. Two observers assessed the presence and locations of BBs independently using high-resolution CT (HRCT) and routine CT reconstruction, and compared the sensitivities of each reconstruction method for BB detection using operative findings as a standard reference. In addition, the number of BBs in each CT image set was recorded and inter-observer agreements were evaluated. Results Sensitivity for the detection of BBs was significantly better for HRCT than routine CT (97.0% vs. 63.6% for observer 1 and 94.0% vs. 57.6% for observer 2, respectively, both P-values?<?0.001). On a per-bleb and a per-bulla basis, inter-observer agreements regarding BBs by HRCT were good and very good (k?=?0.66 and 0.94, respectively) and superior to those determined by routine CT (k?=?0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion Different slice thickness reconstructions influence the diagnostic efficacy of MDCT for the detection of BBs in patients with PSP. High-resolution thin slice CT reconstruction was found to have a significantly greater sensitivity than routine thicker slice thickness reconstruction for the detection of BBs.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the independent associations between measures of adiposity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with clustered cardiometabolic risk in adolescents. Methods 209 adolescents (139 boys), aged 15?17.5 years participated. Participants completed anthropometric measurements [height, weight, waist circumference (WC)] whilst the 20 m fitness test was used to assess CRF. Additional measures included systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, ratio total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin resistance (HOMA), interleukin-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and adiponectin. Results Partial correlations revealed weak to moderate negative associations for body mass index (BMI) and WC with CRF (r = ?0.295 and ?0.292, P < 0.001) and adiponectin (r = ?0.227 and ?0.262, P < 0.05). Weak to moderate positive associations were evident for BMI with CRP, and cardiometabolic risk (r = 0.274, and 0.283, P < 0.05, respectively). Weak to moderate positive associations were apparent for WC with CRP and triglycerides (r = 0.240 and 0.254, P < 0.05), whilst moderate to large associations were evident for WC with clustered cardiometabolic risk (r = 0.317, P < 0.05). Regression analyses revealed that BMI was positively associated with cardiometabolic risk (? = 0.243, P < 0.001). Further analysis whilst additionally controlling for WC and CRF strengthened this association (? = 0.352, P < 0.001). Finally, participants in the least-fit quartile for CRF had significantly poorer cardiometabolic risk scores than those in the other quartiles. Conclusion BMI and not CRF was independently associated with cardiometabolic risk. Reducing BMI appears essential to minimize cardiometabolic risk during adolescence. Am. J. Hum.

AB  - Summary. Refinement of techniques has made available much larger numbers of teeth for studying the response of the exposed pulp in germ-free rats. At shorter time intervals the inflammatory response, in the absence of bacteria, was limited to the presence of scattered cells lying in the debris at the wound surface. Inflammatory infiltration of pulp tissue was not observed, even where large exposures were present. At longer time intervals some pulp necrosis was observed. This was considered to be the result of food packing into the open pulp chambers. The previous observation of a high incidence of dentine bridge formation in germ-free animals was confirmed.

AB  - Abstract Background The tendency to respond with fear and avoidance can be seen as a shared vulnerability contributing to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Although several studies have examined which specific symptoms of PTSD (re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal) are associated with chronic pain, none has considered this association within the framework of fear-avoidance models. Methods Seven hundred fourteen patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain were assessed. Of these, 149 patients were selected for the study based upon the following inclusion criteria: exposure to a traumatic event before the onset of pain (with scores equal to or higher than 8 points on the fear and hopelessness scales of the Stressful Life Event Screening Questionnaire Revised) and scores equal to or higher than 30 on the Davidson Trauma Scale. Results Structural equation modelling was used to test the association between PTSD symptoms and pain outcomes (pain intensity and disability) using the mediating variables considered in the fear-avoidance models. The results show that emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms, but neither re-experiencing nor avoidance, affected pain outcome via anxiety sensitivity (AS), catastrophizing and fear of pain. PTSD symptoms increased the levels of AS, which predisposes to catastrophizing and, in turn, had an effect on the tendency of pain patients to respond with more fear and avoidance. Conclusions This study provides empirical support for the potential role of PTSD symptoms in fear-avoidance models of chronic pain and suggests that AS is a relevant variable in the relationship between both disorders.

AB  - Abstract Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is an important problem that remains undertreated, even by rheumatologists. We present a case of an elderly patient with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed more than 40?years ago, who suffered from recurrent fractures and attendant complications despite a bone mineral density (BMD) score in the osteopenic range and treatment with bisphosphonates. With improved treatment and outcome of lupus, an increasing number of elderly patients who are susceptible to osteoporotic fractures are expected. This case serves to highlight that rheumatic disease patients on steroids should be screened for GIO, as effective treatment and preventive measures are available. Teriparatide is a promising treatment for patients who have failed bisphosphonate treatment or who are at high risk for fracture. We should also bear in mind that BMD scores alone are not indicative of fracture risk, and other tools such as the WHO-FRAX (Fracture risk assessment tool), serum vitamin D3 levels and bone turnover markers should be used where appropriate. Other measures including attention to factors that contribute to falls should also be considered, necessitating a multi-disciplinary approach.

AB  - Abstract Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies among populations in the United States and Western Europe, and one of the leading causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality due to cancer. The early detection of colon cancer is central to the effective treatment of this disease and early detection markers are needed. We have demonstrated that high-resolution two-dimensional gel analysis of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) demonstrated a specific oncological fingerprint of colon cancer. Utilizing this approach, four proteins specific for colon cancer was identified. Additionally, one protein was expressed much more strongly in colon cancer compared to adjacent and normal donor tissue. The amino acid composition of this protein revealed sequence similarity with calreticulin. The multi-functional protein, calreticulin, is normally found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum although some reports have described a nuclear localization of the protein. The aim of this study was to confirm the identity of the protein as calreticulin as well as to evaluate the localization of calreticulin in the nuclear matrix of colon cancer tissue. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Aims Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects women both acutely and chronically after vaginal delivery. Current SUI treatments assume the neuromuscular continence mechanism, comprised of the pudendal nerve (PN) and external urethral sphincter (EUS), is either intact or irreparable. This study investigated the ability of neurotrophin therapy to facilitate recovery of the neuromuscular continence mechanism. Methods Virgin, Sprague Dawley rats received simulated childbirth injury or sham injury and treatment with continuous infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or saline placebo to the site of PN injury. Continence was assessed by leak point pressure (LPP) and EUS electromyography (EMG) 14 and 21 days after injury. Structural recovery was assessed histologically. Molecular assessment of the muscular and neuroregenerative response was determined via measurement of EUS BDNF and PN ?II-tubulin expression respectively, 4, 8, and 12 days after injury. Results Following injury, LPP was significantly reduced with saline compared to either BDNF treatment or sham injury. Similarly, compared to sham injury, resting EUS EMG amplitude and firing rate, as well as amplitude during LPP were significantly reduced with saline but not BDNF treatment. Histology confirmed improved EUS recovery with BDNF treatment. EUS BDNF and PN ?II-tubulin expression demonstrated that BDNF treatment improved the neurogenerative response and may facilitate sphincteric recovery. Conclusions Continuous targeted neurotrophin therapy accelerates continence recovery after simulated childbirth injury likely through stimulating neuroregeneration and facilitating EUS recovery and re-innervation. Neurotrophins or other therapies targeting neuromuscular regeneration may be useful for treating SUI related to failure of the neuromuscular continence mechanism. Neurourol.

Choice of cell types ?? Regulating cellular activities -? Influence of growth factors on chondrogenic differentiation -? Influence of growth factors on matrix deposition -? Supportive effect of biomaterials ?? Interference of inflammation with cartilage repair ?? Tracking of transplanted cells in vivo ?? Conclusion and future directions Abstract Since the first cell therapeutic study to repair articular cartilage defects in the knee in 1994, several clinical studies have been reported. An overview of the results of clinical studies did not conclusively show improvement over conventional methods, mainly because few studies reach level I of evidence for effects on middle or long term. However, these explorative trials have provided valuable information about study design, mechanisms of repair and clinical outcome and have revealed that much is still unknown and further improvements are required. Furthermore, cellular and molecular studies using new technologies such as cell tracking, gene arrays and proteomics have provided more insight in the cell biology and mechanisms of joint surface regeneration. Besides articular cartilage, cartilage of other anatomical locations as well as progenitor cells are now considered as alternative cell sources. Growth Factor research has revealed some information on optimal conditions to support cartilage repair. Thus, there is hope for improvement. In order to obtain more robust and reproducible results, more detailed information is needed on many aspects including the fate of the cells, choice of cell type and culture parameters. As for the clinical aspects, it becomes clear that careful selection of patient groups is an important input parameter that should be optimized for each application. In addition, the study outcome parameters should be improved. Although reduced pain and improved function are, from the patient's perspective, the most important outcomes, there is a need for more structure/tissue-related outcome measures. Ideally, criteria and/or markers to identify patients at risk and responders to treatment are the ultimate goal for these more sophisticated regenerative approaches in joint surface repair in particular, and regenerative medicine in general.

AB  - Abstract? Objective: To assess if coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients with dialysis-dependent end stage renal disease (ESRD) experience greater intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality compared to CABG patients without ESRD. Methods: We conducted a nested case?control study from an 8-year hospitalization cohort in which data were collected prospectively. Inclusion criteria included CABG surgery and age greater than 18 years. Cases were patients with dialysis dependent ESRD (N = 28) and controls were patients without ESRD (N = 84). Cases were matched to controls 1:3 on age, gender, tobacco history, and New York Heart Association Functional Class. The outcomes of interest were mortality, intensive care unit length of stay, total length of hospitalization, time on the ventilator, wound complications, pulmonary complications, neurological complications, gastrointestinal complications, arrhythmia, and intraoperative complications. Using logistic regression we controlled for 13 potential confounding variables. Results: There were no significant differences between the groups with the exception of total length of hospitalization. Patients with dialysis-dependent ESRD had a significantly longer total hospitalization stay (21%) than patients without ESRD. There were no significant differences for the remaining nine outcomes of interest, including perioperative morbidity or mortality. Conclusion: Intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality for CABG were not increased for patients with dialysis-dependent ESRD compared to patients without ESRD. However, patients on dialysis undergoing CABG experienced a greater length of hospitalization than patients undergoing CABG who were not on dialysis.

AB  - Abstract:? Melatonin reportedly exerts beneficial effects to attenuate multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in septic shock. Heatstroke resembles septic shock in many aspects. Thus, this study was performed on the anesthetized rats by using heat exposure to induce heatstroke-associated MODS. We evaluated the effect of melatonin, a versatile molecule synthesized in the pineal gland and in many organs, in heatstroke rats and showed that melatonin (0.2?5.0?mg/kg of body weight, i.v., immediately after the start of heat stress) significantly (i) attenuated hyperthermia, hypotension and hypothalamic ischemia and hypoxia, (ii) reduced plasma index of the toxic oxidizing radicals like nitric oxide metabolites and hydroxyl radicals, (iii) diminished plasma index of hepatic and renal dysfunction like creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase, (iv) attenuated plasma systemic inflammation response molecules like soluble intercellular and lesion molecule-1, E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1?, and IL-6, (v) promoted plasma levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, (vi) reduced an index of infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the lung like myeloperoxidase activity, and (vii) promoted the survival time to fourfold compared with the heatstroke alone group. Thus, melatonin could be a novel agent for the treatment of heatstroke animals or patients in the early stage.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? A decline in sexual activity has been reported as women age. Aim.? To compare, in young adult and middle-aged women, the clitoral volumetric and vascular modifications during the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, and to analyze their relationship with circulating hormones, nitric oxide levels, and with questionnaires on sexuality, relationship, and depression. Methods.? Fifteen young (18?25 years; Group I), and 16 middle-aged (35?45 years; Group II) eumenorrheic women were submitted, on day 14 of their menstrual cycle, to utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, and to color Doppler evaluation of the uterine and dorsal clitoral arteries. On the same day, hormonal parameters and plasma concentrations of nitrites/nitrates were assayed, and the two-factor Italian McCoy female questionnaire and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire were administered. Main Outcomes Measures.? Utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, color Doppler evaluation of the uterine and dorsal clitoral arteries; evaluation of hormonal and nitrites/nitrates plasma concentrations; administration of the two-factor Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire. Results.? The plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and nitrites/nitrates were similar in both groups. Neither the ultrasonographic assessment of the clitoral body volume (0.82?±?0.24?mL vs. 0.73?±?0.26?mL) nor the Doppler analysis of the dorsal clitoral artery [pulsatility index (PI)?=?1.35?±?0.31 vs. PI?=?1.36?±?0.19] evidenced any significant differences in either Group I or Group II. The two-factor Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire gave the same results in Group I and Group II. The relationship between the different parameters evidenced that the NO2?/NO3? circulating levels are inversely correlated with uterine artery (r?=??0.4611; P?=?0.008) and dorsal clitoral artery (r?=??0.331; P?=?0.041) PIs. Furthermore, estradiol resulted inversely correlated with depression (r?=??0.332; P?=?0.045). The two sections (sexuality and partnership) of Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire were positively correlated (r?=?0.849; P?<?0.0001) between each other. Conclusions.? In eumenorrheic young adult and middle-aged women, the periovulatory clitoral anatomic and vascular modifications similarly occur.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study aimed to investigate the levels of 11 oral species in plaque samples and cytokine levels in biofluid samples of patients with idiopathic uveitis (IU) and systemically healthy individuals (H) with or without gingival inflammation. Material  GCF and serum IL-6; salivary IL-17F, and salivary and serum IL-17A/F levels were higher in the IU group than the H group (p < 0.05). However, serum IL-10 and IL-17E levels were higher in the H group than the IU group (p < 0.05). A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, S. oralis, A. naeslundii, and V. dispar counts were higher in IU group compared to H group (p < 0.05). Conclusion Altered local and systemic cytokine profiles are associated with differences in the microbial plaque composition in IU. Anti-inflammatory cytokines; IL-10, IL-17E are reduced in patients with IU and Th-1 and Th-17 driven inflammatory responses in biofluids are altered.

AB  - Background:? Muscle disuse atrophy is observed in patients recovering from trauma and there is an increased risk and severity of injury in patients abusing alcohol (EtOH). However, the interaction of EtOH and disuse on muscle protein balance has not been examined. Therefore, the present study addressed the hypothesis that EtOH accelerates the disuse atrophy and/or impairs the accretion of muscle protein during muscle recovery. Methods:? To address this aim, disuse atrophy was induced in rats by 3?days of unilateral hindlimb immobilization (casting), using the contralateral leg as control, with EtOH or saline being orally gavaged twice, each day during this period. In a separate study, EtOH-treated rats received Velcade to inhibit proteasomal degradation. Finally, in the last study, rats had 1 limb casted for 5?days, the cast removed, and EtOH or saline gavaged twice daily during a 5-day recovery period. Muscle protein metabolism was assessed using surrogate markers of protein synthesis [i.e., phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (BP1) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)] and protein degradation (i.e., mRNA content of the ubiquitin E3 ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1). Results:? Ethanol alone did not decrease muscle weight in the uncasted muscle. However, the loss of mass of immobilized muscle from EtOH-gavaged rats was 80% greater than in the animals not receiving EtOH. This atrophic response was not associated with a change in Akt, 4E-BP1 or S6K1 phosphorylation among groups. In contrast, immobilization alone increased both atrogin-1 and MuRF1 mRNA, and EtOH further increased their expression in immobilized muscle. The proteasome inhibitor Velcade attenuated atrophy produced by EtOH?+?disuse. When administered during the recovery period, EtOH prevented the normal accretion of muscle mass. This EtOH effect was associated with increased atrogin-1 mRNA, a reduction in 4E-BP1 and S6 phosphorylation, and an increased AMP-activated kinase phosphorylation. Conclusions:? Based on the changes in these surrogate markers, our data suggest that EtOH accelerates disuse atrophy by stimulating ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and blunts repletion of muscle protein during recovery from disuse by increasing proteolysis and decreasing protein synthesis.
