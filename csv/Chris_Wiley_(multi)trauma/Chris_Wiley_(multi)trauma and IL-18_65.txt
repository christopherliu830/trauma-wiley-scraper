Effects of inhalable particulate matter on blood coagulation. This issue, pp 662?8. Summary.? Background:?Ambient air pollution is a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, possibly because of alterations in coagulation that influence the arterial circulation. Whether air pollution influences diseases associated with peripheral venous thrombogenesis remains largely unknown. Objectives: To determine the association between air pollution and venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) in a sample of the general population. Methods: A time-series analysis was used to test the association between daily air pollution and VTE hospitalizations in Santiago between 2001 and 2005. Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day of the week and average daily humidex. Results: From a population of 5.4?million, there were, on average, 2.3 admissions for VTE per day. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of hospitalization for venous disease were: 1.07 (1.05, 1.09) for a 58.4?p.p.b. increase in ozone (O3); 1.06 (1.02, 1.09) for a 5.85?p.p.b. increase in sulphur dioxide (SO2); 1.08 (1.03, 1.12) for a 29.25??g/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and 1.05 (1.03, 1.06) for a 20.02??g/m3 increase in particulate matter ≤?2.5??m in mean aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). For pulmonary embolism (PE) results were: 1.10 (1.07, 1.13) for O3; 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) for SO2; 1.07 (1.04, 1.09) for NO2; and 1.05(1.03, 1.06) for PM2.5, respectively. Conclusion: Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis and PE, a disease with a significant fatality rate.

AB  - Abstract In this article, both sodium magnetic resonance (MR) and T1? relaxation mapping aimed at measuring molecular changes in cartilage for the diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis are reviewed. First, an introduction to structure of cartilage, its degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA) and an outline of diagnostic imaging methods in quantifying molecular changes and early diagnostic aspects of cartilage degeneration are described. The sodium MRI section begins with a brief overview of the theory of sodium NMR of biological tissues and is followed by a section on multiple quantum filters that can be used to quantify both bi-exponential relaxation and residual quadrupolar interaction. Specifically, (i) the rationale behind the use of sodium MRI in quantifying proteoglycan (PG) changes, (ii) validation studies using biochemical assays, (iii) studies on human OA specimens, (iv) results on animal models and (v) clinical imaging protocols are reviewed. Results demonstrating the feasibility of quantifying PG in OA patients and comparison with that in healthy subjects are also presented. The section concludes with the discussion of advantages and potential issues with sodium MRI and the impact of new technological advancements (e.g. ultra-high field scanners and parallel imaging methods). In the theory section on T1?, a brief description of (i) principles of measuring T1? relaxation, (ii) pulse sequences for computing T1? relaxation maps, (iii) issues regarding radio frequency power deposition, (iv) mechanisms that contribute to T1? in biological tissues and (v) effects of exchange and dipolar interaction on T1? dispersion are discussed. Correlation of T1? relaxation rate with macromolecular content and biomechanical properties in cartilage specimens subjected to trypsin and cytokine-induced glycosaminoglycan depletion and validation against biochemical assay and histopathology are presented. Experimental T1? data from osteoarthritic specimens, animal models, healthy human subjects and as well from osteoarthritic patients are provided. The current status of T1? relaxation mapping of cartilage and future directions is also discussed. Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background L-arginine (L-Arg) is deficient in sickle cell disease (SSD) during vasoocclusion. We investigated possible causal relationship between L-Arg deficiency and immune dysfunction in SSD in steady-state. Procedure Fifteen patients with SSD in steady-state and 13 controls were studied. Plasma L-Arg levels were measured using liquid chromatography. T cell subsets and CD3zeta (CD3?) chain expression were analyzed using flow cytometry. Lymphocyte proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and production of IL-6 and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) were evaluated with and without L-Arg. Results SSD patients had significantly lower L-Arg levels than controls. CD3 and CD19 cell populations were comparable for both groups, but SSD patients had above normal numbers of natural killer cells (P?=?0.06). Patients and controls exhibited significantly increased lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA after introduction of L-Arg to cultures; response of patients was significantly greater than values for control individuals. Proliferative response to candida in SSD patients was significantly lower than in controls; L-Arg supplementation did not increase this response. L-Arg had no effect on blastogenic response to PPD and candida albicans. No effect was likewise seen in production of IL-6 and IFN-? after addition of L-Arg. CD3? chain expression increased after addition of L-Arg in both groups; differences were insignificant. Conclusion L-Arg levels in steady-state SSD are significantly lower than in controls. L-Arg supplementation enhanced lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA for both controls and patients, but not in response to antigen. There were no significant differences in CD3? chain expression although upregulation of expression occurred after L-Arg supplementation for both groups.

AB  - Summary Nutrition has become more than just the provision of energy substrates, amino acid building blocks, and maintenance of vitamin and mineral concentrations. It is apparent that certain nutrients (antioxidants, fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, arginine, probiotics) and glycemic control exhibit the ability to enhance the immune response to a variety of stressors in critically ill veterinary patients and that their administration may have survival benefit. Acute protein-energy malnutrition predisposes to impaired immune competence; poor wound healing and an increased incidence of dehiscence; an increased incidence of wound infection and systemic sepsis; cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle weakness; and major organ failure and death. In addition, hepatic lipidosis is a common consequence of acute malnutrition in the cat. Enteral feeding should be used any time the intestinal tract (motility, digestion, and absorption) is functional. Enteral nutrition preserves gut epithelial structure and function better than does parenteral nutrition.

AB  - Abstract Background The tendency to respond with fear and avoidance can be seen as a shared vulnerability contributing to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Although several studies have examined which specific symptoms of PTSD (re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal) are associated with chronic pain, none has considered this association within the framework of fear-avoidance models. Methods Seven hundred fourteen patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain were assessed. Of these, 149 patients were selected for the study based upon the following inclusion criteria: exposure to a traumatic event before the onset of pain (with scores equal to or higher than 8 points on the fear and hopelessness scales of the Stressful Life Event Screening Questionnaire Revised) and scores equal to or higher than 30 on the Davidson Trauma Scale. Results Structural equation modelling was used to test the association between PTSD symptoms and pain outcomes (pain intensity and disability) using the mediating variables considered in the fear-avoidance models. The results show that emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms, but neither re-experiencing nor avoidance, affected pain outcome via anxiety sensitivity (AS), catastrophizing and fear of pain. PTSD symptoms increased the levels of AS, which predisposes to catastrophizing and, in turn, had an effect on the tendency of pain patients to respond with more fear and avoidance. Conclusions This study provides empirical support for the potential role of PTSD symptoms in fear-avoidance models of chronic pain and suggests that AS is a relevant variable in the relationship between both disorders.

AB  - Amongst all dental traumas in the permanent dentition, crown fractures account for the largest majority. This review paper will discuss the different levels of fracture, from the most superficial ones only affecting the enamel to the deepest ones with pulp exposure, including crown?root fractures. It will focus on the pulp by evaluating the pulp response to trauma and to the subsequent treatment. An attempt to correlate epidemiological, experimental, histopathological, and clinical studies will be made, so that the clinician can better understand the underlying processes which evolve towards pulp healing or pulp necrosis, thus success or failure. If handled properly, prognosis of the pulp following a traumatic crown fracture is good. In the permanent dentition, success rate ranges between 72% and 100%, the highest success rate corresponding to superficial fractures and the lowest success rate to fractures with pulp exposure.

AB  - Abstract? Turpentine oil treatment (0·2 mL kg?1, s.c.) was used to increase the plasma concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein (0·13 mg mL?1 in control rats) to 1·72 mg mL?1 after 2 days, and allow assessment of its effects on the pharmacokinetics and stereoselective binding of three ?-blockers. Racemates (5 mg kg?1) were administered intravenously to control and turpentine oil-pretreated rats and the plasma concentrations were determined up to 90 min. Stereoselective analysis showed the apparent distribution volume and the area under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) of R-(+)-propranolol to be, respectively, one-quarter and twice those of the S-(?)-enantiomer and differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two were magnified by turpentine oil pretreatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxprenolol enantiomers were essentially similar for the controls but after turpentine oil pretreatment, a higher affinity of the R-(+)-enantiomer for plasma was observed. Acebutolol enantiomers behaved non-stereospecifically throughout. These results were consistent with predictions from the in-vitro stereospecific binding properties of these agents to purified rat α1-acid glycoprotein.

AB  - Summary Background Understanding of the role of vitamin D in health and disease has increased markedly in the past decade, with its involvement extending well beyond traditional roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and musculoskeletal health. This conceptual expansion has been underpinned by identification and exploration of components of this axis including vitamin D-binding protein, key enzymes and receptors in multiple cell types, and a greater recognition of nonclassical autocrine and paracrine effects. Its influence in IBD remains uncertain. Aim To review the role of vitamin D in bone health, immune regulation and cancer prevention in IBD, and to outline practical issues and limitations of its use. Methods An extensive online literature review including PubMed and Medline. Results In patients with IBD, the vitamin D axis provides an important and often underutilised pathway to preserving bone health. Furthermore, an exciting body of clinical and basic science research demonstrates that these pathways may have an integral part to play in regulation of the immune response in IBD, through effects on the intestinal barrier, antigen presenting cells and adaptive T cells. The possibility of chemoprevention requires further study. The optimal target level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with IBD is currently uncertain, as is the best therapeutic modality. Conclusions Study of vitamin D pathways may result in the development of relatively inexpensive therapeutic options to optimise patient outcomes. Further prospective clinical research is required to address efficacy and long-term safety.

AB  - HLA alloimmunization induced by pregnancy, multiple transfusions or transplantation is responsible for some of the serious complications seen in patients receiving blood and blood products. These complications are primarily the result of antibody and antigen triggering an acute immunological reaction, which in some cases can be fatal e.g. TRALI. Some adverse reactions are triggered by HLA antibodies present in the patient whereas others are initiated by antibodies or HLA reactive cells present in the transfused product. The introduction of universal leucodepletion for the prevention of vCJD transmission has resulted in a significant reduction in these reactions by eliminating the main source of alloimmunization, but residual cellular components or platelets are still able to activate the immune system and induce the development of HLA reactive antibodies or T cells. However, the use of more sensitive and specific techniques to detect HLA antibodies and antigens has not only improved the investigation of transfusion reactions and their subsequent diagnosis, but it has also facilitated the implementation of a number of measures such as the use of HLA antibody negative products to further reduce their development.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? A decline in sexual activity has been reported as women age. Aim.? To compare, in young adult and middle-aged women, the clitoral volumetric and vascular modifications during the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, and to analyze their relationship with circulating hormones, nitric oxide levels, and with questionnaires on sexuality, relationship, and depression. Methods.? Fifteen young (18?25 years; Group I), and 16 middle-aged (35?45 years; Group II) eumenorrheic women were submitted, on day 14 of their menstrual cycle, to utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, and to color Doppler evaluation of the uterine and dorsal clitoral arteries. On the same day, hormonal parameters and plasma concentrations of nitrites/nitrates were assayed, and the two-factor Italian McCoy female questionnaire and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire were administered. Main Outcomes Measures.? Utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, color Doppler evaluation of the uterine and dorsal clitoral arteries; evaluation of hormonal and nitrites/nitrates plasma concentrations; administration of the two-factor Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire. Results.? The plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and nitrites/nitrates were similar in both groups. Neither the ultrasonographic assessment of the clitoral body volume (0.82?±?0.24?mL vs. 0.73?±?0.26?mL) nor the Doppler analysis of the dorsal clitoral artery [pulsatility index (PI)?=?1.35?±?0.31 vs. PI?=?1.36?±?0.19] evidenced any significant differences in either Group I or Group II. The two-factor Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire gave the same results in Group I and Group II. The relationship between the different parameters evidenced that the NO2?/NO3? circulating levels are inversely correlated with uterine artery (r?=??0.4611; P?=?0.008) and dorsal clitoral artery (r?=??0.331; P?=?0.041) PIs. Furthermore, estradiol resulted inversely correlated with depression (r?=??0.332; P?=?0.045). The two sections (sexuality and partnership) of Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire were positively correlated (r?=?0.849; P?<?0.0001) between each other. Conclusions.? In eumenorrheic young adult and middle-aged women, the periovulatory clitoral anatomic and vascular modifications similarly occur.

Material  GCF and serum IL-6; salivary IL-17F, and salivary and serum IL-17A/F levels were higher in the IU group than the H group (p < 0.05). However, serum IL-10 and IL-17E levels were higher in the H group than the IU group (p < 0.05). A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, S. oralis, A. naeslundii, and V. dispar counts were higher in IU group compared to H group (p < 0.05). Conclusion Altered local and systemic cytokine profiles are associated with differences in the microbial plaque composition in IU. Anti-inflammatory cytokines; IL-10, IL-17E are reduced in patients with IU and Th-1 and Th-17 driven inflammatory responses in biofluids are altered.

AB  - Abstract The central nervous system injury that can result after radiotherapy has been suggested to involve induced gene expression and cytokine production. We have previously shown that irradiation of primary cultures of rat astrocytes results in the activation of NF?B. To determine whether such an effect also occurs in vivo, NF?B activity was analyzed in the cerebral cortex of the rat brain after whole body irradiation. After a single dose of 15 Gy, NF?B activity was increased by 2 h postirradiation, returning to unirradiated levels by 8 hours. The increase was dose-dependent beginning at 2 Gy and continuing to at least 22.5 Gy. NF?B activity in the irradiated cortex was not accompanied by I?Bα degradation. When 7.5 Gy was delivered 24 h before the 15 Gy, the increase in NF?B activity after 15 Gy was significantly reduced. These results suggest that an initial exposure to radiation induced a refractory period in the brain during which the susceptibility of NF?B to activation by subsequent irradiation was significantly reduced. This period of reduced sensitivity to radiation was also apparent for the induction of the NF?B-regulated cytokines IL-1?, IL-6, and TNFα. Radiat. Oncol.
