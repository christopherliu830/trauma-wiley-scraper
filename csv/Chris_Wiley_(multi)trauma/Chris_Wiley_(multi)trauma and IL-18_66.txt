AB  - Abstract? Turpentine oil treatment (0·2 mL kg?1, s.c.) was used to increase the plasma concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein (0·13 mg mL?1 in control rats) to 1·72 mg mL?1 after 2 days, and allow assessment of its effects on the pharmacokinetics and stereoselective binding of three ?-blockers. Racemates (5 mg kg?1) were administered intravenously to control and turpentine oil-pretreated rats and the plasma concentrations were determined up to 90 min. Stereoselective analysis showed the apparent distribution volume and the area under plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) of R-(+)-propranolol to be, respectively, one-quarter and twice those of the S-(?)-enantiomer and differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two were magnified by turpentine oil pretreatment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxprenolol enantiomers were essentially similar for the controls but after turpentine oil pretreatment, a higher affinity of the R-(+)-enantiomer for plasma was observed. Acebutolol enantiomers behaved non-stereospecifically throughout. These results were consistent with predictions from the in-vitro stereospecific binding properties of these agents to purified rat α1-acid glycoprotein.

Microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by MDA and Checkerboard DNA?DNA hybridization. International Endodontic Journal 44, 225?235, 2011. Abstract Aims? To evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by Checkerboard DNA?DNA hybridization after uniform amplification of DNA in samples by multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Methodology? Forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples; these were MDA-amplified and analysed by Checkerboard DNA?DNA hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. Two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. Results? The mean amount of DNA in the samples prior to amplification was 5.2 (±4.7) ng and 6.1 (±2.3) ?g after MDA. The mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (±4) (range: 3?66) to the nearest whole number. The most prevalent taxa were Prevotella intermedia (96.9%), Neisseria mucosa (65.6%), Prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and Tannerella forsythia (56.2%). Aggregatibacter (Haemophilus) aphrophilus and Helicobacter pylori were not detected. P. intermedia (10%), Prevotella tannerae (7%) and Prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. Conclusion? Root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. Prevotella sp. were commonly found with P. intermedia, Prevotella tannerae and Prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.

AB  - Summary Background Understanding of the role of vitamin D in health and disease has increased markedly in the past decade, with its involvement extending well beyond traditional roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and musculoskeletal health. This conceptual expansion has been underpinned by identification and exploration of components of this axis including vitamin D-binding protein, key enzymes and receptors in multiple cell types, and a greater recognition of nonclassical autocrine and paracrine effects. Its influence in IBD remains uncertain. Aim To review the role of vitamin D in bone health, immune regulation and cancer prevention in IBD, and to outline practical issues and limitations of its use. Methods An extensive online literature review including PubMed and Medline. Results In patients with IBD, the vitamin D axis provides an important and often underutilised pathway to preserving bone health. Furthermore, an exciting body of clinical and basic science research demonstrates that these pathways may have an integral part to play in regulation of the immune response in IBD, through effects on the intestinal barrier, antigen presenting cells and adaptive T cells. The possibility of chemoprevention requires further study. The optimal target level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with IBD is currently uncertain, as is the best therapeutic modality. Conclusions Study of vitamin D pathways may result in the development of relatively inexpensive therapeutic options to optimise patient outcomes. Further prospective clinical research is required to address efficacy and long-term safety.

AB  - Objective To assess the clinical efficacy of TiRobot-assisted percutaneous cannulated screw fixation in the treatment of femoral neck fractures. Methods From September 2015 to July 2017, 26 patients with unilateral femoral neck fractures were treated with TiRobot-assisted percutaneous cannulated screw fixation. The femoral necks were fixed using three cannulated screws with robot assistance applying the following procedure: image acquisition, path planning, and needle and screw placement. The results of the treatment, including operation duration, frequency of fluoroscopy use, implant placement accuracy, intraoperative bleeding, total drilling, surgical complications, fracture healing time, fracture healing rate, and Harris scores at the last follow-up, were recorded and compared with 23 similar patients who underwent conventional manual positioning surgery. Results A total of 147 cannulated screws were placed in all patients. The TiRobot group had shorter operation duration (62.6 ± 8.7 min vs 72.4 ± 10.3 min) and fracture healing time (5.1 ± 2.4 months vs 5.9 ± 2.8 months) than the conventional group (P > 0.05). The robot group had significantly less use of fluoroscopy (26.5 ± 7.4 times vs 51.3 ± 9.4 times), intraoperative bleeding (8.2 ± 5.3 mL vs 36.4 ± 12.5 mL), and total drilling (9.4 ± 4.2 times vs 18.3 ± 9.1 times) than the conventional group (all P < 0.05). The screw parallelism was significantly improved (24.0 ± 0.6 points vs 21.5 ± 1.2 points) and the neck-width coverage (72.0 ± 6.7 mm2 vs 53.8 ± 10.4 mm2) was significantly enlarged compared to the conventional group (P < 0.05). Only three guiding needles were used to penetrate the femoral head during manual insertion in the TiRobot group, which was significantly lower than that in the conventional group (3/78, 3.8% vs 9/69, 13.0%; P < 0.05). Other complications such as wound infection, vascular or nerve injury, screw loosening, and secondary screw displacement, did not occur in the two groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups in fracture healing rate (88.4% vs 82.6%) and Harris scores at the last follow up (88.2 ± 3.6 points vs 87.3 ± 4.7 points; P > 0.05). Conclusion TiRobot-assisted percutaneous cannulated screw fixation of femoral neck fractures is advantageous over conventional surgery with manual positioning due to easier manipulation, more accurate screw insertion, less invasion, and less radiation exposure, suggesting that it is a better method to stabilize femoral neck fractures.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The majority of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma have irresectable disease and require palliation with biliary stenting to alleviate symptoms and prevent biliary sepsis. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have proved ineffective, but recent studies suggest photodynamic therapy (PDT) may improve the outlook for these patients. This prospective clinical cohort study has evaluated the efficacy of radical curative surgery, standard palliative therapy (stent ± chemotherapy) and a novel palliative therapy (stent ± Photofrin-PDT) in 50 consecutive patients treated for hilar cholangiocarcinoma over a 5-year period. Methods:? Between January 2002 and December 2006, 50 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were evaluated for treatment. Ten patients were considered suitable for curative resection (Cohort 1). Forty patients with irresectable disease were stratified into Cohort 2 ? Stent ± chemotherapy (n= 17); and Cohort 3 ? Stent ± PDT (n= 23). Prospective follow-up in all patients and data collected for morbidity, mortality and overall patient survival. Results:? The median age was 68 years [range 44?83]. Positive cytology/histology was obtained in 28/50 (56%). One death in Cohort 1 occurred at 145 days after surgical resection. No treatment related-deaths occurred in Cohort 2 or 3, chemotherapy-induced morbidity in three patients in cohort 2, PDT-induced morbidity in 11 patients in cohort 3. Actual 1-year survival was 80%, 12% and 75% in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Mean survival after resection was 1278 days (median survival not reached). Mean and median survival was 173 and 169 days, respectively, in Cohort 2; and 512 and 425 days in Cohort 3. Patient survival was significantly longer in cohorts 1 and 3 (P < 0.0001; Log rank test). Conclusion:? This prospective clinical cohort study has demonstrated that radical surgery and palliative Photofrin-PDT are associated with an increased survival in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

AB  - Abstract Aims Increased apoptotic activity in pelvic tissues may contribute to development of pelvic floor disorders. We evaluated expression of apoptotic factors (Bcl-2 family) in vaginal tissues from women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and how these factors correlate with severity of prolapse. Methods mRNA and protein expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors in vaginal tissues from subjects and controls were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot. Severity of prolapse was staged using POP-Q criteria. Results Differential expression of Bcl-2 family factors was observed in protein rather than in gene expression. During the secretory phase, the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl) and pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) were upregulated in controls compared to cases (P?<?0.05). The ratios of Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-2/Bad, which determine cellular sensitivity to induction of apoptosis, were higher in controls versus cases. Higher ratios indicate reduced cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. Protein expression of Bax and Bad was higher in women with severe compared to mild prolapse (P?<?0.05). Conclusion Increased expression of Bad, Bax, and decreased ratios of Bcl-2/Bax, Bcl-2/Bad suggest increased apoptotic activity or sensitivity to induction of apoptosis in vaginal tissues of women with POP.

AB  - Summary Imaging, plain and contrast-enhanced, and uroendoscopy is essential to interventional evaluation and treatment of the urinary tract of dog and cat, and are often best used in combination. This chapter explains the indications, procedures, complications, and interpretation of some of the most common imaging studies performed for the urinary tract. Excretory urography (EU) may be performed using traditional radiography, fluoroscopy, or computed tomography (CT). Contraindications of these techniques are related to the use of intravenous injection of iodinated contrast media and the need for sedation or general anesthesia. There are three phases of the excretory urogram: vascular, nephrogram, and pyelogram. Contrast cystography allows for visualization of the urinary bladder, assessment of bladder wall integrity, thickness and contour, and the investigation of intraluminal abnormalities such as cystoliths and masses. The urinary bladder should be evaluated for normal margination, shape, location, and lack of contrast media extravasation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of RBC transfusion to adverse patient outcomes is controversial. There is conflicting clinical data and limited biologic data that provide an underpinning biologic rationale for any adverse impacts from RBC transfusion. This study used in-vitro measures of PMN stimulation to determine the ability of supernatant from RBCs to stimulate allogeneic WBCs and to determine the influence of residual donor WBCs and storage time on the proinflammatory potential of RBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Three types of RBCs were assessed: standard non-WBC-reduced RBCs (S-RBCs), buffy coat-poor RBCs (BCP-RBCs), and prestorage WBC-filtered RBC (LF-RBCs). Supernatant was collected weekly up to Day 42 of storage. PMN priming by supernatant from RBCs was determined by three methods: induction of CD11b expression on PMNs, induction of IL-8 release from PMNs, and the chemotactic effect of supernatant on PMNs. RESULTS: Supernatant from S-RBCs induced the expression of CD11b on PMNs, primed PMNs to release IL-8, and was chemotactic for PMNs. The magnitude of this PMN-priming progressively amplified with storage time. In contrast, supernatant from BCP-RBCs or LF-RBCs did not significantly prime PMNs. The PMN-priming effect of supernatant from RBCs correlated more closely with the level of MNCs in the RBCs than PMN content. CONCLUSION: Supernatant from stored S-RBCs prime unstimulated allogeneic PMNs in vitro. Prestorage buffy-coat WBC reduction was as effective as WBC depletion in abrogating this proinflammatory response elicited by supernatants from RBCs. The clinical consequences, if any, of these findings for transfusion recipients are unknown.

Aims :?To assess the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in South China and its impact on health-related quality of life. Subjects and methods :?A face-to-face interview was carried out in South China to assess the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome. Random clustered sampling of permanent inhabitants aged 18?80?years was carried out under stratification of urban and suburban areas. The impact of irritable bowel syndrome on health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Chinese version of SF-36. Results :?A total of 4178 subjects (1907 male and 2271 female) were interviewed. The adjusted prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in South China is 11.50% according to the Manning criteria and 5.67% according to the Rome II criteria. Factors including history of analgesic use such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (odds ratio 3.83), history of food allergies (odds ratio 2.68), psychological distress (odds ratio 2.18), life events (odds ratio 1.89), history of dysentery (odds ratio 1.63) and negative coping style (odds ratio 1.28) were significantly associated with the presence of irritable bowel syndrome (P?<?0.05). Irritable bowel syndrome was significantly associated with a decrement in health-related quality of life score. Conclusion :?Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder in South China and has a negative impact on health-related quality of life.

AB  - Summary Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for several diseases of the aging brain, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While advancing age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, onset and progression can be strongly influenced by genetics, comorbid conditions, and environmental exposures. Cumulative subconcussive blows, such as those sustained in amateur or professional contact sports, may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite gaps in knowledge, the Committee on Long Term Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of studies, that there was sufficient evidence to support an association between severe TBI and dementia, and a ?suggestive? association between moderate TBI and dementia.

AB  - Between 1980 and 1986 a total of 218 patients with localised prostatic carcinoma received radical pelvic radiotherapy at The Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney. The mean follow-up time was 4.6 years. The five-year actuarial overall survival rate was 63% (death from all causes) and the five-year cancer-specific survival rate was 73% (death from or with prostate cancer). The overall survival was significantly worse with more advanced clinical stage of the disease (P= 0.003) and with poor histological differentiation of the tumour (P=0.001). The five-year actuarial rate for local control of tumour in the pelvis was 84%. Late treatment-related complications (occurring or persisting beyond six months) were mild or moderate and the majority settled with conservative management. Only five patients experienced severe complications (necessitating surgical treatment). Of 42 patients with normal potency documented before radiotherapy who were not subsequently hormonally manipulated 23 (55%) retained potency at two years. These results for definItive radiotherapy for localised prostatic carcinoma indicate good local control with minimal morbidity and compare favourably with other published results.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of manual toothbrushes of the same type with different bristle stiffness concerning plaque removal, gingivitis development, and soft tissue trauma. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, three groups with 40 subjects each used manual toothbrushes with either hard-, medium-, or soft-bristle stiffness. The at-home brushing time was set for 2 minutes, twice a day. Four and 8 weeks after the baseline examination, clinical parameters for plaque removal, gingivitis, and soft tissue damage were recorded again. Recruitment and examinations of the subjects were performed at the Department of Operative and Preventive Dentistry and Endodontics, Heinrich Heine University. A total of 120 volunteers (age range: 18 to 62 years) were recruited and stratified according to sex and age. Primary outcome measures were differences in the Quigley and Hein index (QHI) and papillary bleeding index (PBI) compared to baseline; secondary outcome measures were differences in the modified approximal plaque index (MAPI) and Danser gingival abrasion index. Results: The QHI and MAPI showed lower index scores in subjects who used hard-bristled toothbrushes after 8 weeks (P <0.05 and P <0.001, respectively). In contrast, subjects who used toothbrushes with hard bristles demonstrated more gingival lesions (P <0.01) and higher PBI scores after 4 and 8 weeks (P <0.001) compared to subjects who used soft- or medium-bristled toothbrushes. Conclusion: Manual toothbrushes with hard bristles may better remove plaque, but may also cause more soft tissue trauma compared to brushes with softer bristles.

AB  - Abstract? Our bacterial residents are deadly Janus-faced indwellers that can lead to a sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. Over half of ICU patients suffer from infections and sepsis remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Severe ileus frequently accompanies sepsis setting up an insidious cycle of gut-derived microbial translocation and the copious intestinal production of potent systemic inflammatory mediators. Few therapeutic advances have occurred to prevent/treat the sequelae of sepsis. Here, we selectively review studies on cellular membrane-bound Toll-like receptor (TLR) mechanisms of ileus. Virtually, no data exist on Gram-positive/TLR2 signaling mechanisms of ileus; however, TLR2 is highly inducible by numerous inflammatory mediators and studies using clinically relevant scenarios of Gram-positive sepsis are needed. Specific Gram-negative/TLR4 signaling pathways are being elucidated using a ?reverse engineering? approach, which has revealed that endotoxin-induced ileus is dually mediated by classical leukocyte signaling and by a MyD88-dependent non-bone marrow-derived mechanism, but the specific roles of individual cell populations are still unknown. Like TLR2, little is also know of the role of flagellin/TLR5 signaling in ileus. But, much can be learned by understanding TLR signaling in other systems. Clearly, the use of polymicrobial models provides important clinical relevancy, but the simultaneous activation of virtually all pattern recognition receptors makes it impossible to discretely study specific pathways. We believe that the dissection of individual TLR pathways within the gastrointestinal tract, which can then be intelligently reassembled in a meaningful manner, will provide insight into treatments for sepsis.
