AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of manual toothbrushes of the same type with different bristle stiffness concerning plaque removal, gingivitis development, and soft tissue trauma. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, three groups with 40 subjects each used manual toothbrushes with either hard-, medium-, or soft-bristle stiffness. The at-home brushing time was set for 2 minutes, twice a day. Four and 8 weeks after the baseline examination, clinical parameters for plaque removal, gingivitis, and soft tissue damage were recorded again. Recruitment and examinations of the subjects were performed at the Department of Operative and Preventive Dentistry and Endodontics, Heinrich Heine University. A total of 120 volunteers (age range: 18 to 62 years) were recruited and stratified according to sex and age. Primary outcome measures were differences in the Quigley and Hein index (QHI) and papillary bleeding index (PBI) compared to baseline; secondary outcome measures were differences in the modified approximal plaque index (MAPI) and Danser gingival abrasion index. Results: The QHI and MAPI showed lower index scores in subjects who used hard-bristled toothbrushes after 8 weeks (P <0.05 and P <0.001, respectively). In contrast, subjects who used toothbrushes with hard bristles demonstrated more gingival lesions (P <0.01) and higher PBI scores after 4 and 8 weeks (P <0.001) compared to subjects who used soft- or medium-bristled toothbrushes. Conclusion: Manual toothbrushes with hard bristles may better remove plaque, but may also cause more soft tissue trauma compared to brushes with softer bristles.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Histopathological and immune-histochemical studies were carried out in four cases with multiple lacunes of the central grey matter and in control cases without such lesions. Routine light microscopic techniques were applied on paraffin-embedded material to identify lesions that may represent developing lacunes. In addition, polyclonal antisera to human albumin, IgG, fibrinogen and fibronectin were chosen as markers for extravasated plasma proteins. The brain tissue between lacunes contained several forms of focal injuries which may represent precursors of lacunes. Such lesions included foci of status spongiosus and status cribrosus, regions with dilated extracellular spaces and astrocytic gliosis, and multi-locular cysts. These ?lacune-associated lesions? often included albumin immune-reactivity in extracellular spaces, nerve cell bodies and astrocytes. Less frequently signs of extravasated IgG, fibrinogen and fibronectin were identified. Thus, lacunes of the human brain frequently showed signs of antigenic sites to albumin. The extracellular deposits probably represent extravasated material from the blood. Vasogenic and cytotoxic oedema combined with other factors probably play important roles during the formation of some of the lacunes.

AB  - Abstract Background The practice of induction therapy with either rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG) or interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL-2RA) is common among heart transplant recipients. However, its benefits in the setting of contemporary maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus/mycophenolic acid (TAC/MPA) are unknown. Methods We compared post-transplant mortality among three induction therapy strategies (r-ATG vs IL2-RA vs no induction) in a retrospective cohort analysis of heart transplant recipients maintained on TAC/MPA in the Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) database between the years 2006 and 2015. We used a multivariable model adjusting for clinically important co-morbidities, and a propensity score analysis using the inverse probability weighted (IPW) method in the final analysis. Results In multivariable IPW analysis, r-ATG (HR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.05-1.46, P = 0.01) remained significantly associated with a higher mortality. There was a trend toward having a higher mortality in the IL2-RA (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.00-1.24, P = 0.06) group. Subgroup analyses failed to show a patient survival benefit in using either r-ATG or IL2-RA among any of the subgroups analyzed. Conclusion In this contemporary cohort of heart transplant recipients receiving TAC/MPA, neither r-ATG nor IL2-RA were associated with a survival benefit. On the contrary, adjusted analyses showed a significantly higher mortality in the r-ATG group and a trend toward higher mortality in the IL2-RA group. While caution is needed in interpreting treatment effects in an observational cohort, these data call into question the benefit of induction therapy as a common practice and highlight the need for more studies.

AB  - Abstract We sought to examine prospectively the association of serum homocysteine and the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T gene polymorphism with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We studied these relationships in a nested case?control study of 303 VTE cases and 635 matched controls from a population-based cohort of 21,680 adults from six U.S. communities. The highest quintile of serum homocysteine carried a non-statistically significant adjusted odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI, 0.93?2.58) compared to the lowest quintile in the overall cohort but a significant association among adults aged 45?64 years (OR = 2.05, 95% CI, 1.10?3.83) and an inverse association in those ≥65 years of age. Carriers of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism were not at higher risk for VTE than those with normal genotype (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56?0.98). Our prospective data showed, at most, a weak relationship between homocysteine and VTE risk, with associations larger among younger participants. MTHFR C677T was not a risk factor for VTE. Am. J.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a recently developed smart digital toothbrush monitoring and training system (DTS) in terms of correct brushing motion and grip axis orientation in an at-home environment. Methods: Twenty-one participants (11 test individuals [DTSG] and 10 control individuals [COG]) received instructions on the modified Bass technique (MBT) after their toothbrushing performance was monitored and they received professional tooth cleaning (T0). After 36 hours (T1), without mechanical oral hygiene measures, plaque and gingival indices were recorded, and the brushing technique was reviewed. After randomization, participants individually performed oral hygiene for 6 weeks (T2) with the provided oral hygiene kits. The DTSG group additionally used DTS. During the following 8 weeks (T3), participants used their original brushing devices without any additional interference. Investigators at each visit were masked regarding group identity. Data were statistically evaluated using Mann-Whitney U, Friedman, Wilcoxon, and paired tests and Pearson correlation. Results: At T0, 27.27% of DTSG participants used the MBT correctly (COG, 50%), increasing to 54.55% (COG, 60%) after professional instruction (T1) and further to 90.91% at T2 (COG, 60%) (P <0.001). Plaque scores were reduced in DTSG (P <0.05). At T3, 80% of the DTSG (COG, 40%) totally adopted the MBT (P <0.05). The plaque scores on buccal surfaces of the DTSG showed an additional slight improvement between T2 and T3, in contrast to a decline on oral surfaces (P <0.001). At T2 and T3, the DTSG brushed >120 seconds (COG, 90% and 50%) (P <0.05). Conclusion: Apparently, the tested DTS effectively improves the brushing technique and leads to a prolonged learning effect, including improved oral hygiene.

AB  - Summary Sport is nowadays perceived as beneficial for children with haemophilia, as good muscle strength supports joints and may reduce bleed frequency; by contrast psychological benefits are less known. This study introduces the impact of sport on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical performance in children with haemophilia. A cross-sectional, multi-site, study of boys aged 6?17 years with haemophilia A or B of any severity, current or past inhibitor, which assessed physical performance, sporting activity and HRQoL using age appropriate questionnaires including KINDL, Haemo-QoL and HEP-Test-Q. Eighty-four haemophilic boys (23 mild, 19 moderate, 42 severe) with a mean age of 11.52 years (SD = 3.4) were enrolled from two haemophilia centres in the United Kingdom. 28.4% were overweight/obese according to their BMI/age and had a good orthopaedic status (M = 1.55, SD = 3.3). Boys watching < 1?2 h of TV/PC/day had fewer days lost (M = 3, SD = 3.2) than those with a more sedentary lifestyle (M = 9.40, SD = 7.1) (P < 0.032). 90.5% participated in regular sporting activity; 79.9% at least twice a week. HRQoL in children was generally good, with highest impairments in boys aged 8?12 years. Boys aged 8?16 years reported good physical performance (M = 80.0, SD = 16.0) with highest impairments in the dimensions ?endurance? and ?mobility?. Boys doing sport had a significant better physical performance and HRQoL than boys not doing sport. Sedentary life styles had a negative impact on the subjective physical performance and number of days lost of children. Encouraging haemophilic boys to participate in sport will have a direct impact on their overall HRQoL.

AB  - Comparatively few cases of mycetoma (?Madura foot?) have been reported in Australia, and only one caused by Nocardia brasiliensis. We report two Aboriginal women from remote communities in central Australia who presented with longstanding mycetomas caused by this organism. Difficulties in diagnosis substantially delayed commencement of effective treatment, illustrating the need to consider this condition in chronic suppurative skin infection.

AB  - Abstract One common belief in ophthalmology is that enucleation at an early age will result in bony orbital maldevelopment and facial asymmetry. However, the age range in which enucleation is associated with risk of orbital maldevelopment and the extent of asymmetry remains controversial. In this study, patients who had undergone unilateral enucleation at different ages without orbital implantation were analysed to investigate bony orbital development after enucleation. A total of 87 Chinese adult patients were included. Their bony orbital volume and orbital aditus area were measured using three-dimensional reconstructive models based on patients' computer tomography scans. The ratio of the parameter values of the affected orbit to the unaffected orbit was calculated and described as the orbital symmetry index. The results showed that the bony orbit grew until approximately 18?years old. Enucleation after that age did not affect the orbit, whereas enucleation before that age led to significant orbital maldevelopment. The relative reduction ranged up to 20% in orbital volume and 17% in the orbital aditus area. The extent of orbital maldevelopment was correlated to the age of enucleation. The symmetry index of orbital volume = ?0.0003x2 + 0.0159x + 0.8112 (x = the age of enucleation). The symmetry index of the orbital aditus area = ?0.0002x2 + 0.0119x + 0.8504 (x = the age of enucleation). The regression formulae were used to predict the severity of orbital asymmetry after unilateral enucleation, and evaluate the necessity and efficacy of interventions following enucleation.

In this review, we summarize how FTY720 came from the lab bench to the bedside by examining its structural similarities to natural occuring sphingosine analogues, the mechanism of action, and clinical applicability to not only transplantation but also autoimmune, oncological, and neurobiological fields. FTY720, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) analogue, promotes the survival of human and animal allografts by sequestering T lymphocytes within peripheral lymphoid tissue. The mechanism of sequestration is three-fold:(1) T lymphocytes are driven into peripheral lymph nodes in a chemokine dependent manner by FTY720;(2) FTY720 downregulates sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) on the T lymphocyte surface, rendering it unable to migrate along a S1P gradient; and (3) FTY720 closes stromal gates on the abluminal side of the lymphatic endothelium. Future areas of investigation include developing S1P analogues that have specific agonist binding to S1PRs avoiding side effects seen in non-specific binding.

AB  - Summary Although substance P (SP), a potent proinflammatory peptide, is involved in inflammation and immune responses, the effect of SP on the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 3α[MIP-3α, chemokine C-C ligand 20 (CCL20)] in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells is unknown. Equally enigmatic is the link between SP, the stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and CCL20 production. We investigated whether SP induces the release of chemokine CCL20 from immortalized PDL (IPDL) cells, and further clarify SP-mediated pathways. We also examined the relationship between HO-1 and CCL20 by treating PDL cells with SP. Incubating IPDL cells with SP increased expression of CCL20 mRNA and CCL20 protein in a dose?time-dependent manner. Highly selective p38 and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitors abrogated SP-induced expression of CCL20 in IPDL cells. SP is also responsible for initiating phosphorylation of I?B, degradation of I?B and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-?B. SP induced expression of HO-1 in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and CCL20 reflected similar patterns. The inductive effects of SP on HO-1 and CCL20 were enhanced by HO-1 inducer hemin and the membrane-permeable guanosine 3?,5?-monophosphate (cGMP) analogue 8-bromo-cGMP. Conversely, this pathway was inhibited by the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX) and the selective inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazole(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). We report herein the pathway that connects SP along with other modulators of neuroimmunoregulation to the induction of HO-1 and the inflammatory mediator macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3α/CCL20 in IPDL cells, which play an important role in the development of periodontitis or inflammation during orthodontic tooth movement.
