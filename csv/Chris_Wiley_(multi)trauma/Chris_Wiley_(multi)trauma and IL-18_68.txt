AB  - Background Friction blister research has focused on prevention and treatment approaches rather than exploring the pathophysiology of the friction blister. Increased skin hydration has been purported to be a key risk factor in friction blister development. This study aimed to test the effect of increased skin surface hydration on the risk of friction blister creation. Methods The skin on one foot was hydrated by soaking the foot in water. Intermittent loading was carried out until an observable change of 3°C was evident using infrared thermography. The contra lateral foot acted as a control. Skin hydration and elasticity was measured using electrical capacitance and negative pressure respectively. Results The rate of temperature change of the hydrated group was significantly greater than that of the non-hydrated foot group (P = 0.001) and showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.520) with skin surface hydration. Weak negative correlations were seen between skin elasticity and rate of temperature change in response to load application (r = ?0.166) and skin surface hydration and elasticity at baseline (r = ?0.195). Conclusion In controlled experimental conditions increased skin surface hydration increases the rate of temperature change of the skin in response to load application and consequently increases the risk of blister creation.

AB  - As a result of the limitations of a single nursing diagnosis, NANDA has encouraged the development of ?syndromes.? A study was undertaken using an investigator-developed tool to identify the cluster of defining characteristics, nursing diagnoses and nursing interventions for terminally ill patients, regardless of disease origin. The sample consisted of completed medical records of 15 randomly selected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and 15 randomly selected cancer patients. For all three areas there were commonalities, specifically 10 defining characteristics, seven nursing diagnosis and a 27%?48% agreement on the nursing interventions selected. A clustering of data has been documented to support the establishment of the nursing diagnosis, terminal syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Liver injuries can trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses and as a result, initiate the process of hepatic regeneration and fibrogenesis. Resveratrol (RSV) has multiple health-promoting benefits. This study evaluated the potential protective effects and mechanism of RSV as related to cholestatic liver injury. RSV was given (4?mg/kg/day, i.p.) for either 3 days or 7 days after bile duct ligation (BDL) injury. RSV significantly reduced serum ALT, AST but not T-bil on Day 3. At this early stage of injury, RSV significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and decreased the number of Kupffer cells (CD68+) recruited in the injured liver. RSV decreased hepatic fibrosis and reduced collagen Iα1 and TIMP-1 mRNA on Day 7. At the later stages of injury, RSV increased the number of Ki67+ hepatocytes indicating that RSV promoted hepatocyte proliferation. Additionally, it resulted in decreased expression of 4-hydroxynonenal and increased expression of the hepatocyte growth factor protein and mRNA in the RSV-treated BDL group. Meanwhile, RSV reduced the mortality rate of BDL mice. In conclusion, RSV attenuated inflammation and reduced Kupffer cells activation. RSV decreased fibrosis and promoted hepatocyte regeneration, which increased the survival of BDL mice. RSV was beneficial for the treatment of cholestatic liver injury.

AB  - Summary Purpose:? Patients with recurrent epileptic seizures after the development of psychosis (Psychosis-Epilepsy) have been regarded as belonging to a different clinical entity from those with epilepsy antedating the development of psychosis (Epilepsy-Psychosis). However, clinical characteristics of patients with Psychosis-Epilepsy have not been well described, except for early German studies. We aimed to estimate the reliability of distinction between Psychosis-Epilepsy and Epilepsy-Psychosis by comparing their clinical characteristics. Methods:? Among 312 patients with epilepsy and psychosis enrolled in this multicenter study, 23 patients had Psychosis-Epilepsy and 289 patients had Epilepsy-Psychosis (i.e., interictal psychosis). Demographic (i.e., sex, age at time of evaluation, and intellectual functioning), psychiatric (i.e., age at onset of psychosis, subtype of psychosis, duration of psychotic episode, and a family history of psychosis), and epileptic (i.e., age at onset of epilepsy, subtype of epilepsy, seizure type, and a family history of epilepsy) characteristics of both groups were compared. Key Findings:? Clinical characteristics, either in their psychoses or epilepsies, except for age-related variables, were equivalent between patients with Psychosis-Epilepsy and those with Epilepsy-Psychosis. Time intervals between onset of psychosis and that of epilepsy in the two groups showed a normal distribution curve. Significance:? The presence of many common features and the linear distribution of the time intervals did not fully support that Psychosis-Epilepsy and Epilepsy-Psychosis were two distinctly different entities. Among certain patients who have genetic vulnerabilities to both psychoses and seizures, psychosis may develop either antedating or postdating the development of epilepsy. These findings may suggest a necessary reconceptualization of psychoses in epilepsy.

AB  - Background Hospitalization, surgery and anaesthesia may lead to new-onset maladaptive behaviour, emotional distress and trauma. This pilot study aims to investigate the influence of intraoperatively applied music on post-operative behaviour in children and adolescents. Methods Children with an ASA physical state classification of I or II, aged from 4 to 16 years and scheduled for elective circumcision or inguinal hernia repair under combined general and caudal anaesthesia were included. The children were randomized into two groups. They wore headphones during surgery, and were either exposed to music or not. All involved staff were blinded. Post-operative behaviour was documented by parents on day 7, 14 and 28 after surgery, using a questionnaire adapted from the ?Post Hospitalization Behavioural Questionnaire? (PHBQ). Overall occurrence of at least one item indicating maladaptive behaviour was the primary outcome. Data are presented as median (interquartile range). Results In total, 135 children aged 6.6 (5.3?8.5) years, weighing 22 (19?29) kg, were included, with 112 completed questionnaires returned. Overall occurrence of at least one maladaptive item was lower in the music group, with a significantly lower incidence on day 7 (51% vs. 77% in controls; P < 0.01). Conclusion Intraoperative music application in children undergoing minor surgical procedures may reduce the incidence of post-operative maladaptive behaviour within the first week.

AB  - doi:10.1111/j.1741-2358.2009.00295.x ? Denture stomatitis and its risk indicators in south Brazilian older adults Objective:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate if socio-demographic, behaviour and health variables are risk indicators for denture-related stomatitis in community-dwelling older adults from Carlos Barbosa, Brazil. Materials and methods:? In this cross-sectional study, 872 subjects aged 60?years or more were evaluated. Data collection included dental examinations and questionnaires to assess socio-demographic, behaviour, general and oral health data. All questionnaires and examinations were carried out during 2004. Associations between the independent variables and the outcomes ?prevalence of denture stomatitis? or ?prevalence of granular stomatitis? were adjusted by means of multivariate logistic regressions. Results:? Participants with denture stomatitis were significantly more likely to be females, to display increased amounts of plaque, and significantly less likely to visit the dentist for treatment. Participants with granular stomatitis were significantly more likely to be females and participants with granular stomatitis were significantly more likely to be females, aged 70?years or more and current smokers. In addition, participants with granular stomatitis displayed increased amounts of plaque. Conclusion:? The data presented here confirms the central role of denture biofilm accumulation in denture stomatitis. It also indicates that smoking may increase susceptibility to infection in its most severe form.

AB  - The sequence of events involved in effector focus formation around challenge schistosomula in the lungs of mice vaccinated with radiation-attenuated cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni has been characterized following intravenous administration of lung stage larvae. Histopathological analysis of the lungs of vaccinated animals revealed that infiltrating cells were present around larvae within 24?h. The main increment in cell recruitment occurred between 2 and 4 days, with foci reaching maximal diameter on day 8. No additional infiltration of the airways was detected by bronchoalveolar sampling before day 4 when the maximum number of cells, predominantly lymphocytes, was recovered. In contrast, responses in challenge control animals were relatively slight prior to day 12. IFN? was the major cytokine in airway cultures from vaccinated mice, the greatest increment in production coinciding with peak cell recruitment. A similar pattern of IFN? mRNA expression was observed in whole lung extracts, highlighting the dominance of Th1 responses in the effector mechanism. The slow start to focus formation may be due to the need for antigen, released by the intravascular parasite, to be translocated across the endothelium, processed by accessory cells and presented to the helper T cells which orchestrate the effector mechanism. The delay is of the same order as the period of development which the parasite must undergo in the lung, to facilitate further migration. This similarity in the timing may explain why some larvae are able to avoid the consequences of the pulmonary effector response.

AB  - Background: COX-2 inhibitors have been claimed to have equal analgesic efficacy as non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but this has been disputed in animal experiments. Methods: One hundred thirty-three women scheduled for ambulatory, laparoscopic gynaecological surgery were included in this randomised, double-blind study. Group E received 120?mg etoricoxib orally as premedication. Group K received 30?mg ketorolac i.v. after induction of anaesthesia. General anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Fentanyl 0.5??g/kg i.v. and local wound anaesthesia was administered at the end of surgery. Postoperatively, the patients received fentanyl 0.5??g/kg i.v. if visual analogue scale (VAS) ≥30?mm. Before discharge, Group K received 30?mg ketorolac i.v. Twenty-four hours postoperatively, Group E received 120?mg etoricoxib. Results: The first 4?h postoperatively, Group K required 83±65??g and Group E required 123±91??g fentanyl [mean (SD), P=0.004]. After 30?min VAS in Group K was 31.3±19.7?mm and 43.8±16.9?mm in Group E [mean (SD), P<0.001]. Discharge readiness was significantly shorter in Group K (222±40?min) compared with Group E (244±47?min) [mean (SD), P=0.004]. There were no differences in pain scores or rescue pain medication at 24 or 48?h postoperatively. Less nausea was observed in the 4?24-h period in Group E. Conclusions: Thirty milligram ketorolac i.v. after induction of anaesthesia resulted in significantly less immediate pain and opioid consumption during the first 4?h postoperatively compared with 120?mg etoricoxib preoperatively.

AB  - Summary To consider the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to the pathology of equine joint diseases, 3 autoimmune responses were assayed in sera and synovial fluids. IgM-rheumatoid factor and antibodies to heat shock protein 65 kDa were determined by ELISA; anti-nuclear antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence to whole cell nuclear components. All parameters showed only modest increases, if any and not in a pattern related to disease, although some statistically significant increases were detected. Group analysis showed significantly elevated synovial fluid IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) in horses with OA (P<0.01), traumatised joints (P<0.01) and articular fractured bones (P<0.001). There was no significantly increased IgM-RF in the sera of horses with joint disorders compared to control horses. Significantly raised anti-heat shock protein molecular weight 65 kDa (HSP65) antibodies were only found in the synovial fluids of the horses with traumatised joints (P<0.001). No correlations were found between the synovial fluid and sera levels of IgM-RF or anti-HSP65 antibodies. Synovial fluid anti-HSP65 antibody and IgM-RF levels positively correlated in the OCD (P<0.001), fracture (P<0.01) and synovitis (P<0.05) groups. As antibodies to HSP65 correlated with IgG concentrations in synovial fluids, it is not possible to draw conclusions on HSP roles in joint disease pathogenesis. No serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by immunofluorescence using rat liver and a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) as substrates. Compared with autoimmune responses in human and canine arthropathies, the low levels of autoimmune reactivity detected in this study can only suggest a minor contributory role to joint disease pathology in the horse. These results have 2 important implications. Firstly, other pathogenetic mechanisms should be considered and secondly, autoimmune mechanisms cannot be used to monitor disease progress and therefore should not be targetted for treatment.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a custom-designed 7  T MRI coil and explore its use for upper extremity applications. An RF system composed of a transverse electromagnetic transmit coil and an eight-channel receive-only array was developed for 7  T upper extremity applications. The RF system was characterized and evaluated using scattering parameters and B1+ mapping. Finite difference time domain simulations were performed to evaluate the B1+ field distribution and specific absorption rate for the forearm region of the upper extremity. High-resolution 7  T images were acquired and compared with those at 3 T. The simulation and experimental results show very good B1+ field homogeneity across the forearm. High-resolution images of musculotendinous, osseocartilaginous, and neurovascular structures in the upper extremity are presented with T1 volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination, T2 double-echo steady state, T2* susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion tensor imaging, and time-of-flight sequences. Comparison between 3  T and 7  T is shown. Intricate contextual anatomy can be delineated in synovial, fibrocartilaginous, interosseous, and intraosseous trabecular structures of the forearm, as well as palmar and digital vascular anatomy (including microvascular detail in SWI). Ultra-high-field 7  T imaging holds great potential in improving the sensitivity and specificity of upper extremity imaging, especially in wrist and hand pathology secondary to bone, ligament, nerve, vascular, and other soft or hard tissue etiology.

Abstract Aim: The aim of the study was to assess possible risk indicators for peri-implantitis at different levels of severity using multi-level analyses. Material and Methods: One hundred and nine subjects attended the examination, 69 females and 40 males. Mean time of implants in function was 8.4 years (standard deviation 4.6) (subject level). The participants were examined clinically and radiographically. Information regarding general health and habits was gathered, with special emphasis on smoking, oral hygiene and susceptibility to periodontitis. The relation between possible risk indicators and the following features were assessed:?? Detectable peri-implantitis: detectable radiographic bone loss (>0.4?mm) and inflammation?? Overt peri-implantitis: radiographic peri-implant bone loss 2.0?mm and bleeding on probing /suppuration at pocket probing depth 4?mm. Results: Multi-level statistical analyses identified location in the maxilla as risk indicator for detectable peri-implantitis. Regarding overt peri-implantitis, gender (male) and history of periodontitis were identified as risk indicators. Conclusion: Individuals with a history of periodontitis were prone to peri-implantitis, peri-implant bone loss?≥2.0?mm and overt in the present study. No association was found between smoking and peri-implant disease in the present study population.

AB  - Summary Systemic inflammation can be investigated by changes in expression profiles of neutrophil receptors. Application of this technology for analysis of neutrophil phenotypes in diseased tissues is hampered by the absence of information regarding the modulation of neutrophil phenotypes after extravasation to tissues under non-inflammatory conditions. To fill this gap we measured the expression of neutrophil receptors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, which included both smokers and non-smokers. Blood and BALF neutrophils were identified by CD16bright/CD45dim cells, and triple-stained with antibodies directed against integrins, chemokine- and Fc?-receptors. BALF neutrophils of healthy volunteers showed an activated phenotype characterized by Mac-1 (CD11b)bright, L-selectin (CD62L)dim, intrecellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) (CD54)bright, Fc?RII (CD32)bright, C5a receptor (CD88)bright and CD66bbright. A similar phenotype was observed for BALF neutrophils of patients affected by sarcoidosis. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a modulated expression of C5a receptor (CD88) and ICAM-1 (CD54) in neutrophils of sarcoidosis patients. In conclusion, our data indicate that neutrophils found in the lung exhibit an activated phenotype under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.
