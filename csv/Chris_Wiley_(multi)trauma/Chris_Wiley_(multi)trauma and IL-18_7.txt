AB  - Summary The Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family plays a central role in the generation and regulation of inflammatory responses, in both innate and adaptive immunity. Although the IL-1 molecules are traditionally considered to be classical proinflammatory cytokines, their functions are not restricted to inflammation, and they have also been shown to play a key role in a wide range of additional physiological and pathological functions, including learning modulation, sleep, pregnancy, depression, appetite, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and many others. Since their effect as cytokines and regulators of inflammation is so pleiotropic, any shift of the biological balance between agonistic and antagonistic signals has the potential to cause disease. Here, we consider the genetic influence of interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in the context of susceptibility to human diseases. We review known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-1 genes linked to human diseases, and suggest how exploring biological effects of IL-1 gene cluster polymorphism may lead to new directions in understanding and diagnostic of disease and effective treatment.

AB  - Inflammatory and immune responses play important roles following ischaemic stroke. Inflammatory responses contribute to damage and also contribute to repair. Injury to tissue triggers an immune response. This is initiated through activation of the innate immune system. In stroke there is microglial activation. This is followed by an influx of lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain, triggered by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response contributes to further tissue injury. There is also a systemic immune response to stroke, and there is a degree of immunosuppression that may contribute to the stroke patient's risk of infection. This immunosuppressive response may also be protective, with regulatory lymphocytes producing cytokines and growth factors that are neuroprotective. The specific targets of the immune response after stroke are not known, and the details of the immune and inflammatory responses are only partly understood. The role of inflammation and immune responses after stroke is twofold. The immune system may contribute to damage after stroke, but may also contribute to repair processes. The possibility that some of the immune response after stroke may be neuroprotective is exciting and suggests that deliberate enhancement of these responses may be a therapeutic option.

AB  - Abstract Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas. Its etiology remains obscure. A plausible hypothesis suggests that a complex interplay of host factors, infectious processes, and non-infectious environmental factors, matched with a susceptible genetic background, results in a pathway that leads to systemic granulomatous inflammation. Although presentations of sarcoidosis vary enormously, multi-organ involvement is a common feature. Cutaneous involvement occurs in about 25% of patients with protean manifestations and variable prognoses. Skin manifestations are divided into specific lesions with histopathologically evident non-caseating granulomas and nonspecific lesions arising from a reactive process that does not form granulomas. A peculiar form of cutaneous sarcoidosis is represented by sarcoidal lesions at sites of trauma that has caused scarring. The pathogenesis of scar sarcoidosis remains unknown. Scar sarcoidosis is also associated with herpes zoster infection, surgery, and tattooing. Such heterogeneous events, along with those at the sites of chronic lymphedema, thermal burns, radiation dermatitis, and vaccinations, occur on areas of vulnerable skin labeled ?immunocompromised districts?. Numerous options are available for the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Although corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for initial systemic therapy, other nonsteroidal agents have proven effective and therefore useful for long-term management. Tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists such as infliximab may have a role in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis, especially in refractory cases that are resistant to standard regimens. Elucidation of the relationship of sarcoidal granulomas with malignancy and immunity may facilitate a better understanding of some pathomechanisms operating in neoplastic and immunity-related disorders.

AB  - ABSTRACT No disease-modifying osteoarthritis (OA) drugs are available to prevent posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Mitochondria (MT) mediate the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases, and recent evidence indicates that MT dysfunction is a peracute (within minutes to hours) response of cartilage to mechanical injury. The goal of this study was to investigate cardiolipin-targeted mitoprotection as a new strategy to prevent chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration after injury. Cartilage was harvested from bovine knee joints and subjected to a single, rapid impact injury (24.0?±1.4?MPa, 53.8?±?5.3?GPa/s). Explants were then treated with a mitoprotective peptide, SS-31 (1µM), immediately post-impact, or at 1, 6, or 12?h after injury, and then cultured for up to 7 days. Chondrocyte viability and apoptosis were quantified in situ using confocal microscopy. Cell membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase activity) and cartilage matrix degradation (glycosaminoglycan loss) were quantified in cartilage-conditioned media. SS-31 treatment at all time points after impact resulted in chondrocyte viability similar to that of un-injured controls. This effect was sustained for up to a week in culture. Further, SS-31 prevented impact-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, cell membrane damage, and cartilage matrix degeneration. Clinical Significance: This study is the first investigation of cardiolipin-targeted mitoprotective therapy in cartilage. These results suggest that even when treatment is delayed by up to 12?h after injury, mitoprotection may be a useful strategy in the prevention of PTOA. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Regulatory frameworks within the European Union demand that chemical substances are investigated for their ability to induce sensitization, an adverse health effect caused by the human immune system in response to chemical exposure. A recent ban on the use of animal tests within the cosmetics industry has led to an urgent need for alternative animal-free test methods that can be used for assessment of chemical sensitizers. To date, no such alternative assay has yet completed formal validation. However, a number of assays are in development and the understanding of the biological mechanisms of chemical sensitization has greatly increased during the last decade. In this MiniReview, we aim to summarize and give our view on the recent progress of method development for alternative assessment of chemical sensitizers. We propose that integrated testing strategies should comprise complementary assays, providing measurements of a wide range of mechanistic events, to perform well-educated risk assessments based on weight of evidence.

AB  - Summary Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P?<?0·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.

AB  - Abstract Primary objective: To evaluate a multicentre clinical trial design for testing powered toothbrushes. Secondary objective:? To compare the efficacy of a prototype brush head (N2.3) for the Philips Jordan Sensiflex 2000 powered toothbrush (PTB) to that of Braun Oral-B D15 PTB in removing dental plaque Material and methods:? 137 volunteers (ages 18?25?years) were recruited to this 3-centre, 2-week, 2-group, 2-treatment, single-blind trial. Plaque was recorded at screening and again 14?days later at baseline. Stratification of subjects, for gender and screening PI, occurred at baseline. Subjects were then asked to abstain from all oral hygiene measures for 48?h followed by a supervised episode of brushing for 3?min with the allocated PTB. The allocated PTB was used at home for the next 12?days before a second abstinence from all oral hygiene measures for the 48?h prior to a second supervised brushing episode. Plaque levels were scored using a modification of the Quigley & Hein plaque index (PI) at full mouth (FM), interproximal (IP) and smooth surfaces (SS). To enable the means of the within subject differences (pre to postbrushing) to be compared between groups PIs were recorded before and after the supervised brushing episodes, differences between centres, groups and visits were examined. Results: No significant differences in PI between groups at screening, baseline or prior to the supervised brushings were detected (P?>?0.05 anova). The results of the analysis of variance showed there to be a highly significant difference (P?<?0.001) between brushing groups, but, significant differences between centres (P?<?0.001) and a significant interaction effect between centre and brushing group (P?<?0.001) was also detected. Therefore the difference between groups was not present at all three centres. Further examination of the single centre data showed there to be greater levels of plaque removed by the N2.3 compared to the D15 (FM reduction in PI 1.95 vs. 1.13, respectively) at centre 3 in contrast to the other two centres where no difference was detected. The precise reason for these differences could not be established. Conclusions:? A multicentre study design is applicable for evaluating PTBs but a minimum of 3 centres should be included so that differences between centres can be identified. The prototype brush head N2.3 for the Philips Jordan Sensiflex 2000 PTB has comparable plaque removal efficacy to the Braun Oral-B D15 PTB at FM, IP and SS sites.

AB  - Summary Solid organ transplantation is a vital therapy for end stage diseases. Decades of research have established that components of the adaptive immune system are critical for transplant rejection, but the role of the innate immune system in organ transplantation is just emerging. Accumulating evidence indicates that the innate immune system is activated at the time of organ implantation by the release of endogenous inflammatory triggers. This review discusses the nature of these triggers in organ transplantation and also potential mediators that may enhance inflammation resolution after organ implantation.

AB  - The mechanisms which lead to secondary brain damage following transient ischaemia are incompletely defined. As discussed in this hypothesis article, the events which lead to such damage could encompass (a) a perturbed membrane handling of calcium, leading to a slow, gradual increase in the free cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i), with subsequent calcium overload of mitochondria, (b) a sustained reduction of protein synthesis which, in the long run, deprives cells of enzymes or trophic factors essential to their survival, or (c) the initiation of an inherent program for cell death. Results obtained in ischaemia of brief to intermediate duration demonstrate that the ultimate cell death is heralded by a reduction in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. However, the results fail to demonstrate whether or not such a reduction precedes deterioration of the bioenergetic state which then precipitates cell death. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has recently been shown to dramatically improve the delayed CA1 damage following transient forebrain ischaemia. Since CsA is known to block a deleterious permeability transition (PT) in mitochondria from several tissues in response to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, the results on CsA effects in forebrain ischaemia support a mitochondrial origin for the delayed cell death. Furthermore, comparisons with the effects of CsA and α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in thymocytes and other cells undergoing programmed cell death suggest that delayed neuronal damage occurs by a sequence of events akin to those leading to apoptotic cell death. However, whether cell death is apoptotic or necrotic may depend on the severity of the insult (and its duration). We speculate that the initial ischaemic transient leads to gradual mitochondrial calcium overload, the latter triggering a PT, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Since similar results have been obtained in normoglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemia of intermediate duration, and in animals with preischaemic hyperglycaemia, it seems likely that both increased ischaemia duration and hyperglycaemia accelerate damage to mitochondria in the reperfusion period. Recent results obtained in transient focal ischaemia of 2 h duration demonstrate that the free radical spin trap PBN reduces infarct size, even when given 1 or 3 h after the start of reperfusion, thus providing a second window of therapeutic possibility. A major effect of the drug is exerted on the recovery of energy metabolism of the tissue since it reduces a secondary deterioration in the bioenergetic state, occurring after 2?4 h of reperfusion. At least in part, the spin trap may exert its effect by reducing microvascular dysfunction caused by oedema and to adhesion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, which give rise to an inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, lipid mediators, or free radicals. This contention is supported by the reduction in focal ischaemic damage by antibodies to adhesion molecules for PMNs. However, it has now been found that the secondary deterioration of the bioenergetic state of core and penumbral tissues are mirrored by corresponding changes in the respiratory functions of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that, also in this type of ischaemia, the mitochondria suffer secondary damage. It is conceivable that a significant fraction of malfunctioning mitochondria emanate from microvascular tissue, explaining why antibodies to adhesion molecules mitigate the ischaemic lesions.
