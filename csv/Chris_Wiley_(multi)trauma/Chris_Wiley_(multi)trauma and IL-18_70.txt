AB  - Abstract Introduction Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is a common type of dyspareunia among young women. The patho-physiology remains largely unclear. Women with PVD have general pain hypersensitivity and often report additional pain symptoms. Signs point towards PVD being a chronic pain disorder similar to other syndromes of longstanding pain, including a common comorbidity of anxiety and depression. Polymorphism in the serotonin receptor gene, 5HT-2A, has been associated with other chronic pain disorders such as fibromyalgia but has not been investigated in PVD patients. Aim We aimed to investigate a possible contribution of polymorphism in the 5HT-2A gene to the etiology of PVD as well as a potential influence on pain sensitivity. Methods In this case-control study 98 women with PVD and 103 healthy controls between 18 and 44 years and in the same menstrual cycle phase completed questionnaires and underwent quantitative sensory testing. Venous blood samples were collected for DNA isolation. Main Outcome Measures Concomitant pain was reported, a bodily pain score was created and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) on the arm, leg, and in the vestibule were measured. Intensity of coital pain was rated on a visual analog scale, range 0?100. The T102C (rs6313) and A-1438G (rs6311) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5HT-2A gene were analyzed. Results The probability of PVD was elevated in participants carrying the 1438G- and 102C-alleles of the 5HT-2A gene (OR 2.9). The G-/C- genotypes were also associated with more concomitant bodily pain in addition to the dyspareunia, but not with experimental PPTs or coital pain ratings. PVD patients reported more concomitant bodily pain and had lower PPTs compared with controls. Conclusion The results indicate a contribution of alterations in the serotonergic system to the patho-genesis of PVD and gives further evidence of PVD being a general pain disorder similar to other chronic pain disorders.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief summary of natural history of ursids and practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases. It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - The treatment of acute hepatic failure has developed rapidly over the last 40 years, reducing morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. Whilst this has been partly attributed to significant improvements in the specialist medical management of these patients, advances in surgical techniques and pharmaceutical developments have led to the establishment of successful liver transplantation programmes, which have improved mortality significantly. This review will examine the clinical impact of alternative methods that have been used to provide extra-corporeal hepatic support. Non-biological, bio- logical and hybrid hepatic extra-corporeal support will be explored, offering a comprehensive historical overview and an appraisal of present and future advances.

Am J Reprod Immunol 2011; 65: 212?219 For many years, the focus of attention in the study of semen has been on spermatozoa, its major cellular component, given their importance in the process of reproduction, and the role of the seminal fluid as their transport medium. More recently, evidence has accumulated of the complexity of seminal fluid, its components that perturb the female reproductive tract in ways promoting both survival of spermatozoa there-in and facilitating the implantation of embryos within the endometrium, hence initiating pregnancy. These same factors, however, may also make the female reproductive tract susceptible to invasion not only by spermatozoa but viruses, playing a significant role in the male-to-female transmission of HIV. Knowledge of the histology, anatomy, and immunology of the male reproductive tract is essential in understanding its role in HIV pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.

AB  - Purpose:?? Preoperative radiotherapy (PRT) reduces the risk of local pelvic recurrence (LR) after rectal cancer surgery but is associated with considerable side-effects. This study aims to identify the LR rate associated with the present MRI based selection criterion for PRT (tumour threatening the fascia propria on MRI) at Auckland City Hospital (ACH), and to assess the likely influence on LR rates of a regimen using a PRT selection criterion based on a 5?mm clearance of the fascia propria. Methodology:?? All patients with rectal cancer treated at ACH from 1997?2005 who had preoperative MRI scans were identified from the National Cancer Registry. Details of demographics, MRI results, treatment and outcome were collated. Long-term outcomes were obtained from digital records, GPs, patient contact and death-certificates. All MRIs were re-reported using the new criterion of 5?mm clearance for the fascia propria. Results:?? There were 126 patients eligible patients, 20 were excluded with lack of MRI or follow-up. 106 patients (mean age 66.5?years, 67% male) were followed-up for a minimum 2?years (med 3?years). Using the present MRI based ACH criteria for PRT 29 (27%) patients were irradiated. Using a 5?mm tumour free margin 80 (75%) of patients would have been offered PRT. Overall 7 (6.6%) patients developed LR, 6 of these did not receive PRT, 4 of these fulfilled the new criterion and only 2 of these patients had a resection with curative intent. Conclusion:?? Selective PRT based on threatened fascia propria involvement on MRI lead to low PRT and LR rates. The use of a 5?mm tumour free lateral margin on MRI would result in three times as many patients receiving PRT and is likely to reduce the local recurrence rate by about 2%.

AB  - Purpose:?? Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a promising new modality to treat faecal incontinence. This study was designed to examine patient satisfaction with the procedure and relate this to changes in quality of life (QoL) and incontinence scores. Methodology:?? Twenty-eight patients underwent insertion of a permanent stimulator after temporary stimulation had achieved a good result. Faecal incontinence QoL data, incontinence scores (scale 0?24) and baseline anorectal physiology measurements were recorded prospectively in a database, together with a postoperative survey and repeat physiological investigations. Results:?? Twenty-four patients (86%) completed the survey. The median age of patients at the time of SNS insertion was 62?yrs (range 47?83) and median follow-up was 10?months (2?50?m). The mean St Mark's incontinence scores were 16.9 pre-operatively and 10.6 post-operatively (p < 0.001). Faecal incontinence quality of life (FIQL) measurements showed statistically significant improvements across all domains (lifestyle p = 0.02, coping p < 0.01, depression p = 0.01 and embarrassment p < 0.01). Mean patient satisfaction was 6.8 (visual analogue scale of 0?10). This score showed statistically significant correlations with both incontinence scores and three out of four FIQL domains. No correlation was seen with duration of treatment and patient satisfaction. Conclusion:?? SNS is a valid procedure for faecal incontinence as demonstrated by significant improvements in incontinence scores, FIQL measurements and these improvements are closely correlated to patient satisfaction with the procedure.

AB  - Purpose:?? We report the age-related peri-operative morbidity findings of the Australia and New Zealand prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing laparoscopic (LCR) and open (OCR) surgical treatments of right- and left-sided, potentially curable, colon cancer. Methods:?? Between January 1998 and April 2005, 601 eligible patients were recruited by 33 surgeons from 31 Australian and New Zealand centres. Complications were analyzed by an independent reviewer. Their severity was classified as; mild, moderate or severe and their relatedness to surgery as; not, probably not, possibly or definitely. Results:?? 294 patients had LCR and 298 had OCR. 266 patients were < 70 and 326 ≥70?years (mean = 70.3 ± 11?years). There were 43 (14.6%) conversions from LCR to OCR, of which 35 (81%) had a complication. The numbers of surgical (p = 0.003) and medical (p = 0.043) complications were reduced in completed LCR operations when compared with OCR. These differences were attributable to significantly lower numbers of complications in patients ≥70?years (surgical, p = 0.002; medical, p = 0.043). Likewise, the numbers of individuals experiencing any complication favoured LCR treatment (p = 0.001) and specifically those ≥70?years (p = 0.004). Conclusion:?? Treatment choices for colon cancer depend upon survival and tumour recurrence, short-term outcomes, costs and quality of life measures. If LCR is proven safe and affordable, our results suggest that patients ≥70?years with potentially curable colon cancer be rigorously investigated preoperatively to avoid conversions and then considered for LCR.

AB  - Objective:?? The aim of this study was to determine the demand for hospital resources generated by anastomotic leakage, including surgical, medical, imaging, pathology, and other allied health consultations or services and length of postoperative hospital stay. Patients and Methods:?? Data were obtained from a comprehensive, prospective hospital registry of all resections for colorectal cancer from January 1995 to December 2004 and from retrospective review of patients? notes. Results:?? Forty-one patients with a leak spent 92?days in intensive care, required 129?days of total parenteral nutrition, 69?days of enteric feeding and 41?days on ventilation and had a median postoperative hospital stay of 28?days (range 11?104). These patients required 24 re-operations and 2,273 separate medical consultations or allied services. Conclusion:?? Anastomotic leakage generates a very considerable demand for hospital resources and diverts these resources from the hospital population at large.
