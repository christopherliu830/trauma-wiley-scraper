AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic anterior resection for rectal cancer remains controversial due to the possibility of a positive circumferential margin with the laparoscopic approach. The ?hybrid procedure? has been performed with laparoscopic colonic mobilization but rectal dissection is through a Pfannenstiel incision. Methods:?? Data from a prospective single institution rectal cancer database was used to compare hybrid, converted and open anterior resections for mid and low rectal cancer from February 2003 to August 2008. Results:?? There were 253 patients found. There were 66 (26%) hybrid (H), 5 (2%) converted (C) and 182 (72%) open (O) cases. The median follow up all 3 groups was similar. 30 (h), 28 (C), 34 (O)?months. The median length of stay (days) was shorter in the (H) group. [6.5 (H), 10 (C), 9 (O), p = 0.001. There was a trend to a higher ASA score, age, median BMI, more wound infections and higher stage in the (O) group. The circumferential margin was involved in 6 (O) group compared with 0 in H) or (C) group (p = 0.5). There were no significant differences in local recurrences [1.1% (O) vs. 1.5% (H&C)] or T stage. There was no difference in neoadjuvant radiation, (48 (26%) (O), 20 (30%) (H), 1 (20%), p = 0.9. The median lymph node count was 11 in each group. The 2?year overall survival was the same both groups, 90% (H), 89% (O) 100% (C) (p = 0.65) as was the progression free survival 76% (H), 64%(O), 80% (C), (p = 0.32). Conclusion:?? The hybrid procedure results in improved short term outcomes for patients with rectal cancer compared to open cases. The hybrid approach did not compromise circumferential margins or lymph node yield, and has no effect in short term progression free or overall survival.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-10 is one of the most crucial immunoregulatory cytokines. Its short-term effects have been analysed extensively, but little is known about its long-term effects. This is of considerable importance, as high systemic IL-10 levels are present for long periods in patients with persistent viral infections, certain cancers and in critical care patients. Our study investigated the effects of the long-term presence of IL-10 on human peripheral blood monocytes. In vitro, IL-10 treatment of these cells for 7?days induced the development of a novel cell type characterized by unique phenotypical and functional characteristics. These cells showed high HLA-DR expression and low expression of CD86 and other co-stimulatory molecules on their surface. The mRNA levels of both HLA-DR and CD86 were high, but no intracellular accumulation of CD86 protein was observed. With respect to its function, these cells showed strongly diminished tumour necrosis factor-α production following lipopolysaccharide stimulation, strongly diminished allogenic CD4+ T cell stimulatory capacity, and even induced a hyporesponsive state in CD4+ T cells. The phenotype remained stable despite the removal of IL-10. In vivo, we found monocytic cells from patients exhibiting this phenotype after long-term IL-10 exposure. These results complement our knowledge further about the biological effects of IL-10 and may provide an explanation for the sustained immunodeficiency in cases of the persistent presence of systemic IL-10.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that increased lymphocyte apoptosis (Ao) detected in peripheral blood T?cells from burn patients appears to contribute to decreased lymphocyte immunoresponsiveness. However, while it is known that sepsis induces a marked depression in the splenocyte immune response (i.e. decreased interleukin-2, interferon-? production and proliferation) in response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), it is unknown whether this depression is associated with an increase in inducible Ao and if so, which mediators control this process. To assess this, splenocytes were harvested from mice at 24?hr (a period associated with decreased Con A response) after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis [caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)] or sham-CLP (Sham) and then stimulated with 2·5??g Con A/ml (24?hr). Septic mouse splenocytes stimulated with Con A, while not showing a change in their phenotypic make-up, did exhibit a marked increase in the percentage of splenocyte that were Ao+ which was associated with altered cytokine release. This appears to be due to an increase in the percentage of Ao+ cells in the CD4+ CD8? population and was associated with enhanced Fas antigen expression as well as an increase in mRNA for the Fas?FasL gene family. To determine if the changes in Ao are due to either endotoxin (a product of Gram-negative bacteria seen in CLP mice) or the expression of Fas ligand (FasL; a mediator of activation-induced lymphocyte Ao), a second set of studies examining Con A-inducible Ao was performed with splenocytes harvested from septic endotoxin-tolerant C3H/HeJ and the FasL-deficient C3H/HeJ-Fasl?gld mice. The results show that increased splenocyte Ao detected following CLP is due to a FasL-mediated process and not to endotoxin. Thus the inadvertent up-regulation of FasL-mediated splenocyte Ao may contribute to the depression of splenocyte immune responses seen during polymicrobial sepsis.

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2013; 19: 242?248 Abstract The impact of bloodstream infection (BSI) on admission to hospital on the outcome of patients with community-acquired sepsis (CAS) admitted to intensive-care units (ICU) is largely unknown. We selected 803 adult patients consecutively admitted with CAS to one of 17 Portuguese ICU, in whom blood cultures were collected before initiation of antibiotic therapy during a 12-month period. A BSI was identified on hospital admission in 160 (19.9%) patients. Those with and without BSI had similar mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and age. The presence of BSI was independently associated with mortality in ICU (adjusted odds ratio 1.86; 95% confidence interval 1.20?2.89; p 0.005). On the 4th day in ICU, patients with BSI were found to be significantly more dependent on vasopressor support (p 0.002) but not on ventilatory support. Cumulative ICU mortality was significantly higher in BSI patients from the 9th day onwards. A seasonal variation of BSI isolates was noted: gram-negative BSI were more common in the summer, whereas in the winter, gram-positive infections were more frequent (p 0.024), without mortality differences.

AB  - Purpose:?? Colonic inertia (CI) may co-exist with obstructed defaecation (OD). It is unclear if it adversely influences the results of surgery for OD. We aimed to compare the functional results of laparoscopic anterior rectopexy (LAR) for OD secondary to high-grade internal rectal prolapse (IRP) in those with normal colonic transit (NCT) and CI. Methodology:?? Patients with high-grade (recto-anal) IRP were evaluated with defaecating proctography and colonic transit study. Colonic transit time (CTT) (hours) was calculated by the number of pellets remaining in the colon and rectum at 7?days ? 2.4. Patients were offered surgery for significant symptoms if they failed a program of conservative management. Constipation was prospectively assessed pre-op and at 3?months using Wexner constipation scores. Results:?? 80 patients (93% female) underwent LAR for OD and IRP. Patients with NCT gave less history of stool infrequency currently (10% versus 32%) and in their 20's (17% versus 71%). 61 patients had normal colonic transit (CTT median 17, range 0?48 hours) and 19 had CI (CTT median 79, range 50?154 hours, p < 0.0001). Overall symptom improvement at 3?months was similar for NCT and CI (84% versus 84%, p = 0.97). Rates of total (50% versus 68%, p = 0.19) and partial (34% versus 16%, p = 0.16) symptom improvement were similar. Improvement in Wexner constipation score was similar for NCT (mean pre-op 13 to post-op 5) and CI (14 to 5), (p = 0.34). Conclusions:?? In the short term, colonic inertia has no adverse impact and may be disregarded when considering laparoscopic anterior rectopexy for obstructed defaecation and high-grade internal rectal prolapse.

AB  - Purpose:?? Slow transit constipation (STC) is a debilitating condition mainly affecting young women. Total colectomy (TC) is an option for patients with severe symptoms who are unresponsive to conservative measures. Open TC has been the procedure of choice but is associated with long term SBO and ongoing symptoms. It is difficult to determine if these ongoing symptoms are related to gut dysmotility or to post operative adhesions. Laparoscopic TC appears equivalent open TC with the advantage of being able to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy at a later stage to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause of chronic obstructive symptoms or pain. Methods:?? All consecutive patients undergoing a laparoscopic TC ± rectopexy for STC from 1991?2007 were reviewed. Results:?? 84 patients (81 female, 3 male) were included. Average operating time was 188 min, average LOS 8?days. Conversion rate was 1.2%. There were no post op mortalities. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 2.4%, pelvic collections in 2.4%, intra-abdominal bleeds in 4.7% and 3.5% developed wound infections. Bowel frequency was significantly improved however, 31% had at least 1 episode of obstructive symptoms. Ongoing pain was experienced by 38%. 57% underwent a further procedure a majority of which was a laparoscopy ± division of adhesions. Conclusion:?? Lap TC is a feasible and acceptable option for patients with STC with reasonable operating times, low conversion rates and acceptable mortality and morbidity. Bowel frequency is significantly improved however long term chronic pain and SBO are common. Lap TC allows for a minimally invasive laparoscopy to be performed to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause for obstructive symptoms or ongoing pain.

AB  - Purpose:?? The aim of this study is to make an objective assessment of whether multidisciplinary meetings (MDM) improve the management of patients requiring surgery for colorectal cancer as this has never been examined. Methodology:?? This retrospective study analyzed patients from the Geelong Hospital mandatory Colorectal Database between 1/1/2006 and 31/12/2007. MDM were implemented on 3/10/2006. To be included in the study patients had to have had an operation for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Each patient's management was determined to have conformed, or not conformed, to meet the best practice guidelines according to the 2005 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Early Detection and Management of Colorectal Cancer. Those patients who had been discussed in an MDM were compared with those pre-MDM to ascertain if there was any difference in patient treatment. Results:?? 182 patients had surgery for colorectal cancer. In the period where an MDM was available, 46% (53 of 116) patients were discussed in an MDM and all conformed to best practice guidelines. Of the 130 patients where no MDM review occurred, 98.5% conformed to best practice guidelines. This was consistent in both the pre MDM period (98.5%) and MDM available period (98.4%). Conclusion:?? The implementation of MDM at Geelong Hospital has marginally improved management of colorectal cancer. Few clinicians would dispute the benefits of such meetings but where an already high standard of care exists it is difficult to objectively demonstrate these improvements. We support using MDM but look to the less tangible benefits such as improved consistency and coordination of care, communication between health professionals and educational opportunities that MDM provide.

AB  - Purpose:?? Approximately 10% of temporary stomas created after low or ultra low anterior resection for rectal cancer remain unreversed. In this study, we aim to determine the reversal rate at our institution and the reasons for stomas remaining unreversed, especially due to anastomotic leaks. Method:?? A retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer at a single institution between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2007 was performed. Patients with unreversed stomas were identified and their patient files reviewed. Results:?? 230 patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer were considered. 54 of these had low or ultra-low anterior resection and a stoma fashioned. 47 (87%) had their stomas reversed (RS), and 7 (13%) had not (US). The RS group were younger, with 30 (63%) males compared to 6 (86%) in the US group. Not surprisingly, the US group were more likely to have surgical complications (72% vs. 28%, p = 0.022). The reasons for non-reversal were anastomotic leak 2(28%), death 2(28%), metastatic disease 1(14%), medical co-morbidities 1 (14%), and patient refusal 1 (14%). Of the 2 patients with anastomotic leaks, 1 remained unreversed due to development of stricture at the point of anastomosis, while the other was reversed 8?months later (outside the study period). Conclusion:?? When faecal diversion surgery is undertaken in low or ultra low anterior resection for the treatment of rectal cancer, it is usually reversed during a reasonable period of time. Surprisingly, even in our very small set of patients (7) with unreversed stomas, only 2 were unreversed due to anastomotic leaks.

AB  - Purpose:?? Concern about maternal morbidity associated with vaginal delivery (VD) may be driving the increasing trend for elective caesarean section (CS). This study aimed to quantify the risk of morbidity from VD that pregnant women would be prepared to accept before requesting an elective CS, and to compare these views with those of clinicians. Methodology:?? Participants completed a questionnaire to ascertain the maximum level of risk they would be prepared to accept before opting for an elective CS. Utility scores for each complication were calculated, with higher scores (closer to 1) indicating a preference towards VD. Results:?? 122 pregnant women, 84 midwives, 166 obstetricians, 12 urogynaecologists and 79 colorectal surgeons participated. For the evaluated 18 potential complications of VD pregnant women were willing to accept higher risks than clinicians. Pregnant women were least accepting of risks of severe anal incontinence (mean utility score 0.32), emergency CS (0.51), moderate anal incontinence (0.56), severe urinary incontinence (0.56), fourth degree tears (0.59), and third degree tears (0.72) The views of midwives were closest to those of pregnant women. Urogynaecologists and colorectal surgeons were the most risk averse, with 42% and 41% respectively stating they would request an elective CS for themselves or their partners. Conclusions:?? Pregnant women were able to quantify the level of risk they are prepared to accept from a VD before opting for an elective CS being aware of the potential complications of elective CS, and these risks were significantly higher than those accepted by the clinicians involved in their care. Their views are more closely aligned to midwives than to specialist clinicians.

AB  - Summary Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely well equipped antigen (Ag)-presenting cells. Their classic function was thought to be that of potent initiators of innate and adaptive immunity to infectious organisms and other Ags (including transplanted organs). Evidence has emerged, however, that DCs have a central and crucial role in determining the fate of immune responses toward either immunity or tolerance. This dichotomous function of DCs, coupled with their remarkable plasticity, renders them attractive therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In transplantation, much recent work has focused on the ability of DCs to silence immune reactivity in an Ag-specific manner in the hope of preventing rejection and diminishing reliance on potentially harmful immunosuppressive agents. Experimental strategies have included in vivo targeting of DCs, as well as ex vivo generation of regulatory (or tolerogenic) DCs with subsequent reinfusion (i.e. cell therapy). Different approaches to ?program? DC toward tolerogenic properties include genetic (transgene insertion), biologic (differential culture conditions, anti-inflammatory cytokine exposure) and pharmacologic manipulation. Recent data suggest a promising role for pharmacologic treatment as a means of generating potent regulatory DCs and have further stimulated speculation regarding their potential clinical application. Herein, we discuss evidence that the potential of regulatory DC therapy is considerable and that there are compelling reasons to evaluate it in the setting of organ transplantation in the near future.

AB  - Abstract Aim To compare the efficacy and safety between rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) and anti-T lymphocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius, ATG-F) in donation after cardiac death (DCD) kidney transplantation. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 255 cases of DCD kidney transplantation performed at our hospital from February 2007 to October 2013. The patients were divided into two groups based on their induction therapies with Thymoglobulin (n?=?188) or ATG-F (n?=?67). Clinical data were collected and compared between the two groups. Results Delayed graft function (DGF) occurred in 36 (19.1%) patients in the Thymoglobulin group versus 17 (25.4%) patients in the ATG-F group (P?=?0.281). However, if we subgroup the patients with increased risk factors for DGF, the DGF rate was 9/40 (22.5%) in the Thymoglobulin group versus 9/16 (56.3%) in the ATG-F group (P?=?0.015). Duration of DGF was significantly shorter in the Thymoglobulin group (11.7 days vs. 16.1 days). The acute rejection rate was significantly lower in the Thymoglobulin group (9.6% vs. 19.4%, P?=?0.035). One-year graft and patient survival were both comparable between the Thymoglobulin and ATG-F groups. The adjusted odds ratio of DGF was 4.283 (1.137?16.13) between the ATG-F and Thymoglobulin groups in patients with increased risk factors for DGF. Conclusion Compared with ATG-F, Thymoglobulin may reduce duration of DGF and acute rejection rate after DCD kidney transplantation. Moreover, Thymoglobulin significantly reduced DGF in patients with increased risk factors for DGF.

AB  - The treatment of acute hepatic failure has developed rapidly over the last 40 years, reducing morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. Whilst this has been partly attributed to significant improvements in the specialist medical management of these patients, advances in surgical techniques and pharmaceutical developments have led to the establishment of successful liver transplantation programmes, which have improved mortality significantly. This review will examine the clinical impact of alternative methods that have been used to provide extra-corporeal hepatic support. Non-biological, bio- logical and hybrid hepatic extra-corporeal support will be explored, offering a comprehensive historical overview and an appraisal of present and future advances.

AB  - Background: Several studies have shown that GTR therapy of intrabony defects results in significantly better outcomes than access flap alone. Most of the available data, however, have been produced in highly controlled research environments by a small group of investigators. Generalizability of results to different clinicians and different subject populations has not been evaluated so far. Methods: This parallel group study involved 143 patients recruited in a practicebased research network of 11 offices in 7 countries. It was designed to evaluate: 1) the applicability of the documented added benefits of GTR in the treatment of intrabony defects to different populations, and 2) the generalizability of the expected results to different clinicians. GTR was compared to access flap alone. Defects, one in each patient, were accessed with a previously described papilla preservation flap in both the test and control group. In addition, GTR sites received application of a bioabsorbable poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide membrane. A stringent plaque control regimen was enforced in all patients during the 1-year observation period. Outcomes included gains in clinical attachment (CAL) and reductions in probing depth. Results: Observed gains in CAL were 2.18 ± 1.46 mm for access flap and 3.04 ± 1.64 mm for the GTR-treated group. The treatment-associated difference was statistically significant (P = 0.03) after correcting for both center effect and defect anatomy. Among the various centers, a 1.73 mm difference in CAL gain was observed. This is a clinically relevant amount, which underlines the significance of center variability in the outcome of periodontal surgical procedures. A frequency distribution analysis of the obtained CAL gains indicated that GTR treatment of deep intrabony defects decreased, with respect to the access flap control, the probability of obtaining only a modest attachment gain at 1 year. Conversely, CAL gains of 4 mm or more were observed in more than 40% of GTR-treated defects and in less than 20% of the controls (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: These data indicate that GTR therapy of deep intrabony defects performed by different clinicians on various patient populations resulted in both greater amounts and improved predictability of CAL gains than access flap alone.

AB  - Purpose:?? The multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) has been widely adopted as standard of care for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there is little evidence to support the MDM, and individual clinician attitudes have not been studied. Methods:?? Clinicians involved in patients with CRC patients completed a questionnaire. The study was conducted in 2008 at 5 institutions, including MDM naïve (NG) and experienced groups (EG), with repetition in 6?months. The impact of the MDM was prospectively studied at a hospital from 7/7/08 to 22/12/08. The initial plan and the final consensus were recorded. Results:?? 22 clinicians completed the survey. The clinicians in the NG stated that there was an influence of MDM on routine patient management in 40% of patients. After 6?months, in both the EG and the NG, the MDM was felt to have an impact on the patients? management in >70% of cases (p = 0.16). 115 cases (91 patients) were discussed at the MDM. The median age was 65?years (range 26 to 101) with 48% males. The locations were colonic 53 (46%), rectum 40 (35%), anus 6 (5%) and other 16 (14%). 80 (69%) were discussed at the time of initial diagnosis. In 79 (69%) the main issue was chemotherapy and/or radiation administration. In 17 (52%) patients it was decided that further investigations were required. There was an impact on the management in 33 (29%) patients. A change in treatment intent occurred, either curative or palliative, in 5 (15%) patients. Conclusion:?? Clinicians involved in an MDM believe that this influences management in majority of patients with impact on management of almost a third of patients discussed. The multidisciplinary meeting is valuable in the treatment of colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - Purpose:?? Significant pain and discomfort are reported by a proportion of patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids. Several nerve blocks have been trialled with varied results. The aim of this study was to determine whether an anal intersphincteric nerve block may reduce post-operative pain and analgesic requirements in these patients. Methodology:?? One hundred sequential patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids were randomised to either an anal intersphincteric nerve block using 0.5% Marcaine with adrenaline or to the control group. The procedures were performed by a single surgeon using the KilRoid (TM) rubber band ligator (Astratech ? Sweden). Patients were assessed for pain and analgesic use in the immediate post operative period and at 24?hours. Both the patient and data collector were blinded to whether a nerve block had been administered. Results:?? There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in median post operative pain (3.0 vs. 2.0 p > 0.0.29), median post operative analgesic use (1.6 vs. 3.3 p = 0.62), median pain score at 24 hour (4.14 vs. 4.22 p = 0.9) and median analgesic use at 24 hours (1.0 vs. 1.0 p = 0.13). Conclusions:?? There is no benefit from performing an intersphincteric nerve block in patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes have demonstrated significant reduction in hospital stay for patient undergoing colonic surgery, however their impact on long term outcomes such as Post Operative Fatigue (POF) has not been fully established. Aim: To assess the impact of an ERAS programme on POF and recovery following elective open colonic surgery. Method:?? In a prospective study, 26 consecutive patients undergoing open colonic surgery under a conventional care plan were compared to 26 consecutive patients in an ERAS programme. Results:?? Demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable at baseline. The median duration of total hospital-stay (4 v 7?days p < 0.001), rates of urinary-tract infections (p = 0.028) and ileus (p = 0.042) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Postoperatively, POF significantly increased in both groups. However peak POF score was significantly lower in the ERAS group (p = 0.001). In the first 30?days after surgery, Fatigue Consequence scores were also significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Overall, the total fatigue experience (p = 0.035) and the total fatigue impact (p = 0.005) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Conclusion:?? The impact of ERAS programmes may extend beyond the commonly reported short term outcomes and ERAS may accelerate overall recovery and return to normal function.

AB  - Purpose:?? The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge relating to risk factors, tumorigenesis and survival of patients with metachronous colorectal cancer to address potential advances in surveillance and management of patients with colorectal cancer. Methodology:?? The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Ovid databases were searched from 1966 to December 2008 for both published reviews and published articles on metachronous colorectal cancer regarding incidence, carcinoma sequence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, detection, treatment, surveillance and survival. Further articles were obtained by a manual review of the reference lists of all retrieved articles. All publications relevant to this study were included. Results:?? Factors likely to increase the risk of developing metachronous colorectal cancer include; age, personal and family history of multiple malignancies, synchronous polyps, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and microsatellite instability. Conclusion:?? Pre-operative colonoscopic polyp status and biopsy analysis regarding microsatellite instability are essential in identifying patients at risk of metachronous colorectal cancer. A rapid adenoma-carcinoma sequence less than the accepted 2 to 5?years would warrant stringent colonoscopic surveillance. Thus, frequent colonoscopic surveillance is recommended, within the first 5?years post-operatively, for the detection of metachronous colorectal cancer.

AB  - Introduction:?? Post-operative fatigue (POF) is an important indicator of recovery after major surgery. Recent data have suggested a relationship between the post-operative peritoneal cytokine response and development of POF. Glucocorticoids decrease the production of cytokines and thus we hypothesised that administration of dexamethasone to patients undergoing colonic surgery may decrease peritoneal cytokine production and POF. Aim:?? To assess the influence of 8?mg of pre-op IV Dexamethasone on peritoneal cytokine and POF in patients undergoing elective colonic surgery. Method: In a double blinded RCT, 70 consecutive patients undergoing elective, open colonic resection were administered 8?mg I.V. Dexamethasone or saline (Placebo) prior to surgery. All patients were treated within a structured Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program. Results:?? After exclusions there were 31 patients in the Placebo group and 29 in the Dex group. At baseline there were no differences in the age, ASA, BMI or CR-POSSUM scores. Dexamethasone was associated with a significant reduction in Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-13 in the peritoneum and IL-6 and IL-8 in plasma. Subsequently, patients in the Dex group had lesser POF and fatigue impact scores at days 3 and 7. Patients in the Dex group had less post-op nausea and vomiting. There was no significant increase in complications. Conclusion:?? Preoperative Dexamethasone administration is associated with a significantly diminished post-operative pro-inflammatory reaction which is associated with clinical benefits in POF and its impact. This intervention may be an effective method of improving outcomes for patients undergoing major colonic surgery within a multimodal enhanced peri-operative care pathway.
