AB  - Background:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have gained popularity in colonic surgery. Hospital stay has been reduced dramatically as a result, but remains varied in the published literature. We were interested in investigating the factors that influence hospital stay in an ERAS setting. Methods:?? Between October 2005 and November 2008 prospective data were collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resection, without a stoma, at a single site. Patients were managed within an ERAS program. Patients unable to communicate in English, with dementia or ASA >4 were excluded. Variables were tested using the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman's two tailed correlation table for continuous data. Cox regression analysis was used for modelling. Results:?? 102 patients were included. There were 57 right sided, 43 left sided and 2 total colectomies. Mean age was 66?years (95% CI, 40?88). Median day stay was 4?days (range 3?46). Indications for surgery were: malignancy (80%), diverticular disease (13%) and other (7%). Age, operation site, ASA, indication for surgery and BMI were not significant predictors of hospital stay. Factors with the strongest correlation for reduced day stay were Cr-Possum score (p = 0.006), female sex (p = 0.013), laparoscopic (n = 6) and transverse (n = 32) incisions (p < 0.001), and the operating surgeon (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression modeling, surgeon and patient gender could be eliminated as independent predictors of day stay. The other two factors added significant strength to the model. Conclusion:?? Choice of incision and Cr-POSSUM score are independent predictors of day stay in the ERAS setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.

AB  - Background:?? Parastomal hernias can be prevented or repaired using synthetic mesh; however, reported complications include infection, fibrosis and potential bowel erosion. The study aim was to assess the safety, feasibility and potential efficacy of using a prophylactic collagen implant. Methods:?? Twenty patients undergoing defunctioning stomas were randomised to a conventional procedure or reinforcement with the implant. Follow-up included regular symptom questionnaires, clinical examination, stoma site ultrasound, and serum inflammatory markers. Results:?? Ten patients (four males; mean BMI 26.3) had a conventional stoma, and ten (three males; mean BMI 26.3) received the implant. At a median of 6.5?months follow-up, a parastomal hernia was clinically evident in three of ten patients without the implant, and in none of ten patients with the implant. There were no clinical complications, ultrasound evidence of chronic seromas or serological evidence of a systemic inflammatory response. Conclusions:?? Xenogeneic collagen has been demonstrated to aid soft tissue reinforcement. In this study, in contrast to published data relating to the use of conventional synthetic mesh, there were no complications related to infection or the implant's proximity to the bowel. This trial demonstrates that the implant is safe, feasible to use and has the potential to prevent parastomal herniation.

AB  - Background:?? Hartmann's procedure has been the treatment for complicated perforated diverticular disease. Laparoscopic washout with colonic preservation can replace radical resection. Laparoscopic washout is associated with less morbidity, mortality and improved quality of life. Methods:?? An 8-year retrospective review of 80 consecutive cases of sigmoid diverticulitis warranting emergency surgical intervention (2000?2008). During this time approximately 2000 admissions for diverticulitis were recorded. Results:?? Hinchey grades were I(10), II(26), III(38) and IV(6).Patients age mean 77, median 74. Procedures performed were Laparoscopic washout (34), Hartmann's procedure (34), percutaneous drainage of abscess (5), resection and primary anastomosis (3).Overall mortality was 7% (all in the Hartmann's group). Washout achieved success in 28 of 34 cases without immediate colonic resection. Short-term failures of washout in 6 were due to perforated cancer (2), faecal fistula formation (2), inadequate washout and ongoing sepsis (2). All failures underwent Hartmann's resection without complication. In long-term follow up 8 patients developed symptoms of recurrent complicated diverticulitis including (delayed stricture, fistulae and repeat perforation) and underwent sigmoid resection. 8 patients underwent planned resection without experiencing further symptoms. 10 patients were observed without symptoms with mean follow up of 20?months. Conclusions:?? Laparoscopic washout is superior in cases of perforated Diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis(Hinchey III). It is recommended in Hinchey I and II cases, when percutaneous drainage is unhelpful. Hartmann's colonic resection should be reserved for genuine cases of faecal peritonitis (Hinchey IV).

AB  - Introduction:?? A positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) is associated with local recurrence and poor oncological outcome. Studies highlight that positive CRMs occurs more often following abdominoperineal excisions (APER), compared to anterior resections (AR). However a bias towards performing APERs in patients with locally advanced tumours, or down staging prior to sphincter preserving surgery may underlie the difference. Aims:?? Determine (1) positive CRM rates following APER and low ARs (2) if pre-operative decision making accounts for the difference. Methods:?? The last 100 low AR and 100 APERs within our unit were reviewed. Data collected included 1) Tumour distance from the anal verge, 2) Pre-operative staging (CT / MRI) (Early stage cancers T1-2N0, Intermediate stage ? T3N0-1, and Advanced stage ? CRM threatened by tumour or involved nodes) 3) Neo-adjuvant therapy use 4) positive CRMs. Results:?? One hundred Low AR were performed Between Jan 2008 ? June 2004, while 100 APER were performed between Jan 2008 ? Jan 2003. Average tumour distance from anal verge: APERs 3.4?cm vs. AR 5.2?cm. There was no significant difference in the pre-operative stage (Early 28 vs. 27, Intermediate 51 vs. 58, and advanced 21 vs. 15), or the use of chemo-radiotherapy (APER 9 vs. AR 13). There was a significant increase in CRMs in the APER group 15 vs. 7. Conclusion:?? A positive CRM occurred twice as often following APERs vs. low AR. This difference could not be accounted for by early cancers undergoing AR, or the use of down staging chemo-radiotherapy.

AB  - Purpose:?? Faecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent and important multifactorial condition. Neuromodulation via implanted sacral nerve stimulators is efficacious, but as with other invasive treatment modalities is expensive and associated with significant complications. Peripheral neuromodulation of sacral nerve roots via posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is effective in urinary incontinence, but there is minimal evidence for its use in FI. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of PTNS in FI. Methodology:?? 12 patients with FI of various causes (8 idiopathic, 3 obstetric, 1 previous anorectal surgery) underwent PTNS at a UK hospital. All were investigated with colonic imaging, anorectal physiological studies and endoanal ultrasound. Prior treatments comprised physiotherapy (12), sphincter repairs (3 biofeedback (3) and implants (1). PTNS was performed for 30 minutes, weekly for 12?weeks. Outcome measures were episodes of incontinence, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Rockwood Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life score. Results:?? Mean monthly episodes of incontinence of wind, liquid and solid before treatment were 18.77, 21.77 and 22.15 respectively. After 12?weeks? treatment this had reduced to 0.92, 0.83 and 0.83 respectively (p < 0.05). Sphincter integrity, physiology and aetiology were not shown to affect efficacy. No patient's incontinence worsened. Non-significant improvements in Anxiety and Depression and quality of life scores were also seen. Conclusions:?? This is the first UK study to demonstrate PTNS as a potentially efficacious and minimally invasive alternative treatment modality for faecal incontinence. These early results are encouraging, but we await medium and long term follow up.

AB  - Recently, in Australasia, a plea to screen all young patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for Lynch syndrome has been advanced1. Since 2001 the three public hospitals in Auckland have had the policy of undertaking immunohistochemical (IHC) testing on the tumours of patients aged 50?years and under to detect loss of expression (LOE) of protein products for the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Purpose:?? To determine (1) the completeness of patient capture, (2) the incidence of LOE by IHC of the 4 gene proteins, and (3) to correlate IHC results with those of subsequent genetic testing for the corresponding germline mutations. Methodology:?? Retrospective review of the prospectively gathered clinical, pathological, and genetic records of all patients diagnosed with CRC aged 50?years and below between January 2001 and December 2007. Results:?? 244 patients aged 50?years or below with CRC were diagnosed in this period. 212 (86.9%) patients? tumours underwent IHC, 147 of which had all 4 gene products studied. 30 (14.2%) tumours had LOE for one or more MMR proteins. 25/30 patients were offered genetic testing of whom 3 declined. So far 8 out of 16 patients tested have a confirmed germline mutation. Only 3/8 patients report a family history of CRC. Conclusion:?? Tumour IHC reveals LOE for one of the four MMR gene proteins in approximately 14% of young patients developing CRC and in half subsequent genetic testing will identify Lynch syndrome. A policy of mandatory testing is confirmed but audit of performance and appropriate referral is required.

AB  - Abstract??? This case report describes the management of an oblique crown?root fracture of the buccal cusp of the upper right first premolar. After removal of the fractured cusp, a provisional restorative build-up in this area was carried out, in order to carry out an endodontic treatment in a sterile environment. A glass fibre post and core were then constructed and over a 90-day period the tooth was extruded orthodontically by 4?mm. The periodontal fibres associated with this tooth were cut with a tiny surgical blade to help to prevent reintrusion of the tooth and achieve fine contouring of the gingival margins. The new tooth position was maintained with a retainer for a further 60?days and after a period with a provisional acrylic crown, a porcelain bonded crown was fitted. This case report demonstrates that such a multidisciplinary treatment approach to an oblique subgingival fracture is a reliable and predictable manner in which to save a tooth that would have otherwise been difficult, if not impossible, to restore with a resultant good long-term prognosis.

AB  - Summary Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have reduced numbers and frequencies of dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, and there is also evidence for defective activation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Collectively, these observations may point to a primary defect in the generation of functional DCs. Here, we measured frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) in peripheral blood of 26 CVID patients and 16 healthy controls. The results show that the patients have reduced absolute counts of both subsets. However, the decreased numbers in peripheral blood were not reflected in reduced frequencies of CD34+ pDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-α or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9. The study represents the most thorough functional characterization to date, and the first to assess bone marrow progenitor output, of naturally occurring DCs in CVID. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.

AB  - Abstract Aim To compare the efficacy and safety between rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) and anti-T lymphocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius, ATG-F) in donation after cardiac death (DCD) kidney transplantation. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 255 cases of DCD kidney transplantation performed at our hospital from February 2007 to October 2013. The patients were divided into two groups based on their induction therapies with Thymoglobulin (n?=?188) or ATG-F (n?=?67). Clinical data were collected and compared between the two groups. Results Delayed graft function (DGF) occurred in 36 (19.1%) patients in the Thymoglobulin group versus 17 (25.4%) patients in the ATG-F group (P?=?0.281). However, if we subgroup the patients with increased risk factors for DGF, the DGF rate was 9/40 (22.5%) in the Thymoglobulin group versus 9/16 (56.3%) in the ATG-F group (P?=?0.015). Duration of DGF was significantly shorter in the Thymoglobulin group (11.7 days vs. 16.1 days). The acute rejection rate was significantly lower in the Thymoglobulin group (9.6% vs. 19.4%, P?=?0.035). One-year graft and patient survival were both comparable between the Thymoglobulin and ATG-F groups. The adjusted odds ratio of DGF was 4.283 (1.137?16.13) between the ATG-F and Thymoglobulin groups in patients with increased risk factors for DGF. Conclusion Compared with ATG-F, Thymoglobulin may reduce duration of DGF and acute rejection rate after DCD kidney transplantation. Moreover, Thymoglobulin significantly reduced DGF in patients with increased risk factors for DGF.

AB  - Summary Dendritic cells (DCs) are uniquely well equipped antigen (Ag)-presenting cells. Their classic function was thought to be that of potent initiators of innate and adaptive immunity to infectious organisms and other Ags (including transplanted organs). Evidence has emerged, however, that DCs have a central and crucial role in determining the fate of immune responses toward either immunity or tolerance. This dichotomous function of DCs, coupled with their remarkable plasticity, renders them attractive therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In transplantation, much recent work has focused on the ability of DCs to silence immune reactivity in an Ag-specific manner in the hope of preventing rejection and diminishing reliance on potentially harmful immunosuppressive agents. Experimental strategies have included in vivo targeting of DCs, as well as ex vivo generation of regulatory (or tolerogenic) DCs with subsequent reinfusion (i.e. cell therapy). Different approaches to ?program? DC toward tolerogenic properties include genetic (transgene insertion), biologic (differential culture conditions, anti-inflammatory cytokine exposure) and pharmacologic manipulation. Recent data suggest a promising role for pharmacologic treatment as a means of generating potent regulatory DCs and have further stimulated speculation regarding their potential clinical application. Herein, we discuss evidence that the potential of regulatory DC therapy is considerable and that there are compelling reasons to evaluate it in the setting of organ transplantation in the near future.

AB  - Purpose:?? Colonic inertia (CI) may co-exist with obstructed defaecation (OD). It is unclear if it adversely influences the results of surgery for OD. We aimed to compare the functional results of laparoscopic anterior rectopexy (LAR) for OD secondary to high-grade internal rectal prolapse (IRP) in those with normal colonic transit (NCT) and CI. Methodology:?? Patients with high-grade (recto-anal) IRP were evaluated with defaecating proctography and colonic transit study. Colonic transit time (CTT) (hours) was calculated by the number of pellets remaining in the colon and rectum at 7?days ? 2.4. Patients were offered surgery for significant symptoms if they failed a program of conservative management. Constipation was prospectively assessed pre-op and at 3?months using Wexner constipation scores. Results:?? 80 patients (93% female) underwent LAR for OD and IRP. Patients with NCT gave less history of stool infrequency currently (10% versus 32%) and in their 20's (17% versus 71%). 61 patients had normal colonic transit (CTT median 17, range 0?48 hours) and 19 had CI (CTT median 79, range 50?154 hours, p < 0.0001). Overall symptom improvement at 3?months was similar for NCT and CI (84% versus 84%, p = 0.97). Rates of total (50% versus 68%, p = 0.19) and partial (34% versus 16%, p = 0.16) symptom improvement were similar. Improvement in Wexner constipation score was similar for NCT (mean pre-op 13 to post-op 5) and CI (14 to 5), (p = 0.34). Conclusions:?? In the short term, colonic inertia has no adverse impact and may be disregarded when considering laparoscopic anterior rectopexy for obstructed defaecation and high-grade internal rectal prolapse.

AB  - Purpose:?? Slow transit constipation (STC) is a debilitating condition mainly affecting young women. Total colectomy (TC) is an option for patients with severe symptoms who are unresponsive to conservative measures. Open TC has been the procedure of choice but is associated with long term SBO and ongoing symptoms. It is difficult to determine if these ongoing symptoms are related to gut dysmotility or to post operative adhesions. Laparoscopic TC appears equivalent open TC with the advantage of being able to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy at a later stage to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause of chronic obstructive symptoms or pain. Methods:?? All consecutive patients undergoing a laparoscopic TC ± rectopexy for STC from 1991?2007 were reviewed. Results:?? 84 patients (81 female, 3 male) were included. Average operating time was 188 min, average LOS 8?days. Conversion rate was 1.2%. There were no post op mortalities. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 2.4%, pelvic collections in 2.4%, intra-abdominal bleeds in 4.7% and 3.5% developed wound infections. Bowel frequency was significantly improved however, 31% had at least 1 episode of obstructive symptoms. Ongoing pain was experienced by 38%. 57% underwent a further procedure a majority of which was a laparoscopy ± division of adhesions. Conclusion:?? Lap TC is a feasible and acceptable option for patients with STC with reasonable operating times, low conversion rates and acceptable mortality and morbidity. Bowel frequency is significantly improved however long term chronic pain and SBO are common. Lap TC allows for a minimally invasive laparoscopy to be performed to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause for obstructive symptoms or ongoing pain.

AB  - Purpose:?? The aim of this study is to make an objective assessment of whether multidisciplinary meetings (MDM) improve the management of patients requiring surgery for colorectal cancer as this has never been examined. Methodology:?? This retrospective study analyzed patients from the Geelong Hospital mandatory Colorectal Database between 1/1/2006 and 31/12/2007. MDM were implemented on 3/10/2006. To be included in the study patients had to have had an operation for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Each patient's management was determined to have conformed, or not conformed, to meet the best practice guidelines according to the 2005 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Early Detection and Management of Colorectal Cancer. Those patients who had been discussed in an MDM were compared with those pre-MDM to ascertain if there was any difference in patient treatment. Results:?? 182 patients had surgery for colorectal cancer. In the period where an MDM was available, 46% (53 of 116) patients were discussed in an MDM and all conformed to best practice guidelines. Of the 130 patients where no MDM review occurred, 98.5% conformed to best practice guidelines. This was consistent in both the pre MDM period (98.5%) and MDM available period (98.4%). Conclusion:?? The implementation of MDM at Geelong Hospital has marginally improved management of colorectal cancer. Few clinicians would dispute the benefits of such meetings but where an already high standard of care exists it is difficult to objectively demonstrate these improvements. We support using MDM but look to the less tangible benefits such as improved consistency and coordination of care, communication between health professionals and educational opportunities that MDM provide.

AB  - Purpose:?? Approximately 10% of temporary stomas created after low or ultra low anterior resection for rectal cancer remain unreversed. In this study, we aim to determine the reversal rate at our institution and the reasons for stomas remaining unreversed, especially due to anastomotic leaks. Method:?? A retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer at a single institution between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2007 was performed. Patients with unreversed stomas were identified and their patient files reviewed. Results:?? 230 patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer were considered. 54 of these had low or ultra-low anterior resection and a stoma fashioned. 47 (87%) had their stomas reversed (RS), and 7 (13%) had not (US). The RS group were younger, with 30 (63%) males compared to 6 (86%) in the US group. Not surprisingly, the US group were more likely to have surgical complications (72% vs. 28%, p = 0.022). The reasons for non-reversal were anastomotic leak 2(28%), death 2(28%), metastatic disease 1(14%), medical co-morbidities 1 (14%), and patient refusal 1 (14%). Of the 2 patients with anastomotic leaks, 1 remained unreversed due to development of stricture at the point of anastomosis, while the other was reversed 8?months later (outside the study period). Conclusion:?? When faecal diversion surgery is undertaken in low or ultra low anterior resection for the treatment of rectal cancer, it is usually reversed during a reasonable period of time. Surprisingly, even in our very small set of patients (7) with unreversed stomas, only 2 were unreversed due to anastomotic leaks.

AB  - Purpose:?? Concern about maternal morbidity associated with vaginal delivery (VD) may be driving the increasing trend for elective caesarean section (CS). This study aimed to quantify the risk of morbidity from VD that pregnant women would be prepared to accept before requesting an elective CS, and to compare these views with those of clinicians. Methodology:?? Participants completed a questionnaire to ascertain the maximum level of risk they would be prepared to accept before opting for an elective CS. Utility scores for each complication were calculated, with higher scores (closer to 1) indicating a preference towards VD. Results:?? 122 pregnant women, 84 midwives, 166 obstetricians, 12 urogynaecologists and 79 colorectal surgeons participated. For the evaluated 18 potential complications of VD pregnant women were willing to accept higher risks than clinicians. Pregnant women were least accepting of risks of severe anal incontinence (mean utility score 0.32), emergency CS (0.51), moderate anal incontinence (0.56), severe urinary incontinence (0.56), fourth degree tears (0.59), and third degree tears (0.72) The views of midwives were closest to those of pregnant women. Urogynaecologists and colorectal surgeons were the most risk averse, with 42% and 41% respectively stating they would request an elective CS for themselves or their partners. Conclusions:?? Pregnant women were able to quantify the level of risk they are prepared to accept from a VD before opting for an elective CS being aware of the potential complications of elective CS, and these risks were significantly higher than those accepted by the clinicians involved in their care. Their views are more closely aligned to midwives than to specialist clinicians.
