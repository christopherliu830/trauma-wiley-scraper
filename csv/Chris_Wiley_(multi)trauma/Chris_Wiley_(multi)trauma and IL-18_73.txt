AB  - Abstract Introduction Female sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent and reportedly has adverse impacts on quality of life. Although it is prevalent after childbirth, women rarely seek advice or treatment from health care professionals. Aim The aim of this study was to assess the sexual functioning of Australian women during the first year after childbirth. Methods Postpartum women who had given birth during the previous 12 months were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. A multidimensional online questionnaire was designed for this study. This questionnaire included a background section, the Female Sexual Function Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), and the Relationship Assessment Scale. Responses from 325 women were analyzed. Results Almost two-thirds of women (64.3%) reported that they had experienced sexual dysfunction during the first year after childbirth, and almost three-quarters reported they experienced sexual dissatisfaction (70.5 %). The most prevalent types of sexual dysfunction reported by the affected women were sexual desire disorder (81.2%), orgasmic problems (53.5%), and sexual arousal disorder (52.3%). The following were significant risk factors for sexual dysfunction: fortnightly or less frequent sexual activity, not being the initiator of sexual activity with a partner, late resumption of postnatal sexual activity (at 9 or more weeks), the first 5 months after childbirth, primiparity, depression, and relationship dissatisfaction. Conclusion Sexual satisfaction is important for maintaining quality of life for postpartum women. Health care providers and postpartum women need to be encouraged to include sexual problems in their discussions. Khajehei M, Doherty M, Tilley PJM, and Sauer K.

AB  - Abstract Although much progress has been made in the treatment of gliomas, the prognosis for patients with gliomas is still very poor. Stem cell-based therapies may be promising options for glioma treatment. Recently, many studies have reported that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (UC-MSCs) are ideal gene vehicles for tumor gene therapy. Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a pleiotropic immunoregulatory cytokine that has an apoptotic effect on many kinds of tumor cells and can inhibit the growth of tumors specifically without damaging normal cells. In this study, we investigated UC-MSCs as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of IL-24 to tumor sites. UC-MSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) or IL-24 complementary DNA. The results indicated that UC-MSCs could selectively migrate to glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. Injection of IL-24-UC-MSCs significantly suppressed tumor growth of glioma xenografts. The restrictive efficacy of IL-24-UC-MSCs was associated with the inhibition of proliferation as well as the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. These findings indicate that UC-MSC-based IL-24 gene therapy may be able to suppress the growth of glioma xenografts, thereby suggesting possible future therapeutic use in the treatment of gliomas.

AB  - Abstract. 3 distinct levels are involved in the periodontal inflammatory process: site, tooth, and individual. By focusing attention on the levels in the population, multilevel or hierarchical modelling (MLM) enables the researcher to understand where and how the effects at the levels involved are occurring. The aim of this paper is therefore to analyse the progression of periodontal disease using analytical models that consider the level hierarchy. 22 patients with periodontitis, in previous reports described as either non-responsive or responsive to periodontal treatment, were investigated. In the multilevel modelling method (MLM), the site pocket probing depth (PPD) is summarised in 3 parameters: the overall mean, the between-individual variance, and the within-individual, between-site variance. The model can readily be extended to include independent variables for sites, teeth and individuals. If these variables are important determinants of PPD, their inclusion in the model will lead to a reduction in residual variances between sites, teeth and individuals. The PPDs were used for construction of a PPD change variable (cPPD). This variable, together with the final registrations of PPD (fPPD) alone, were used as dependent variables in the MLM. Independent predictor variables, 12 on site-level, 3 on tooth-level, and 19 on individual-level, were constructed. The total number of sites assessed was 2236 distributed on 559 teeth in 22 subjects. Initially, a fixed, fully unconditional model (models A and E) was assessed, where no predictor variables were specified at any level. Different random-intercept models (B-D, F-H) were then calculated where the independent variables were inserted in blocks relating to each level. The variance components at all 3 levels were significantly larger than zero. This indicates that MLM is recommended for analysing the present data. The inserted predictors showed 100% sensitivity relating to the subject-level variance. Subsequent testing of the patient with disease or at high risk of disease would have to focus on diagnostic tests aimed at the individual teeth and sites. These tests would need to have a balance of sensitivity and specificity. Thus, by using multilevel modelling, the theoretical understanding of important factors in the pathogenesis of periodontitis is stimulated.

AB  - Abstract Background:? To determine the effect of scleral flap size on the medium-term intraocular pressure control and complication rates after augmented trabeculectomy. Design:? Prospective randomized clinical trial. Participants:? Glaucoma patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy. Exclusion criteria included previous ocular surgery apart from cataract surgery, secondary glaucoma and age under 18. Methods:? Patients were randomized to either standard trabeculectomy (4???4?mm scleral flap) or microtrabeculectomy (2???2?mm scleral flap), both with adjustable sutures and antimetabolites. Bleb needling was performed as required. Patients were evaluated at day 1, weeks 1, 3, 6 and months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 postoperatively. Main Outcome Measures:? Vision, intraocular pressure, complications and failure (intraocular pressure?≥?21?mmHg or not reduced by ≥20% from baseline, intraocular pressure?≤?5?mmHg, repeat glaucoma surgery and no light perception vision). Results:? Forty-one patients were recruited; 20 had standard trabeculectomy, and 21 had microtrabeculectomy. At 2?years, the mean intraocular pressure and cumulative probability of failure was 12.4?±?4.6?mmHg and 0.28 for standard trabeculectomy, and 11.5?±?3.6?mmHg and 0.27 for microtrabeculectomy (P?=?0.50 and 0.89, respectively). One patient in each group required Baerveldt device implantation. Vision reduced ≥2 Snellen lines in 15% in the standard trabeculectomy group and 25% in the microtrabeculectomy group, mainly from cataract (P?=?0.48). Conclusion:? Both trabeculectomy techniques achieved good intraocular pressure reduction and had similar complication rates. Scleral flap size had no significant effect on medium-term intraocular pressure control and complication profile.

AB  - Introduction:?? A positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) is associated with local recurrence and poor oncological outcome. Studies highlight that positive CRMs occurs more often following abdominoperineal excisions (APER), compared to anterior resections (AR). However a bias towards performing APERs in patients with locally advanced tumours, or down staging prior to sphincter preserving surgery may underlie the difference. Aims:?? Determine (1) positive CRM rates following APER and low ARs (2) if pre-operative decision making accounts for the difference. Methods:?? The last 100 low AR and 100 APERs within our unit were reviewed. Data collected included 1) Tumour distance from the anal verge, 2) Pre-operative staging (CT / MRI) (Early stage cancers T1-2N0, Intermediate stage ? T3N0-1, and Advanced stage ? CRM threatened by tumour or involved nodes) 3) Neo-adjuvant therapy use 4) positive CRMs. Results:?? One hundred Low AR were performed Between Jan 2008 ? June 2004, while 100 APER were performed between Jan 2008 ? Jan 2003. Average tumour distance from anal verge: APERs 3.4?cm vs. AR 5.2?cm. There was no significant difference in the pre-operative stage (Early 28 vs. 27, Intermediate 51 vs. 58, and advanced 21 vs. 15), or the use of chemo-radiotherapy (APER 9 vs. AR 13). There was a significant increase in CRMs in the APER group 15 vs. 7. Conclusion:?? A positive CRM occurred twice as often following APERs vs. low AR. This difference could not be accounted for by early cancers undergoing AR, or the use of down staging chemo-radiotherapy.

AB  - Purpose:?? Faecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent and important multifactorial condition. Neuromodulation via implanted sacral nerve stimulators is efficacious, but as with other invasive treatment modalities is expensive and associated with significant complications. Peripheral neuromodulation of sacral nerve roots via posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is effective in urinary incontinence, but there is minimal evidence for its use in FI. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of PTNS in FI. Methodology:?? 12 patients with FI of various causes (8 idiopathic, 3 obstetric, 1 previous anorectal surgery) underwent PTNS at a UK hospital. All were investigated with colonic imaging, anorectal physiological studies and endoanal ultrasound. Prior treatments comprised physiotherapy (12), sphincter repairs (3 biofeedback (3) and implants (1). PTNS was performed for 30 minutes, weekly for 12?weeks. Outcome measures were episodes of incontinence, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Rockwood Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life score. Results:?? Mean monthly episodes of incontinence of wind, liquid and solid before treatment were 18.77, 21.77 and 22.15 respectively. After 12?weeks? treatment this had reduced to 0.92, 0.83 and 0.83 respectively (p < 0.05). Sphincter integrity, physiology and aetiology were not shown to affect efficacy. No patient's incontinence worsened. Non-significant improvements in Anxiety and Depression and quality of life scores were also seen. Conclusions:?? This is the first UK study to demonstrate PTNS as a potentially efficacious and minimally invasive alternative treatment modality for faecal incontinence. These early results are encouraging, but we await medium and long term follow up.

AB  - Recently, in Australasia, a plea to screen all young patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for Lynch syndrome has been advanced1. Since 2001 the three public hospitals in Auckland have had the policy of undertaking immunohistochemical (IHC) testing on the tumours of patients aged 50?years and under to detect loss of expression (LOE) of protein products for the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Purpose:?? To determine (1) the completeness of patient capture, (2) the incidence of LOE by IHC of the 4 gene proteins, and (3) to correlate IHC results with those of subsequent genetic testing for the corresponding germline mutations. Methodology:?? Retrospective review of the prospectively gathered clinical, pathological, and genetic records of all patients diagnosed with CRC aged 50?years and below between January 2001 and December 2007. Results:?? 244 patients aged 50?years or below with CRC were diagnosed in this period. 212 (86.9%) patients? tumours underwent IHC, 147 of which had all 4 gene products studied. 30 (14.2%) tumours had LOE for one or more MMR proteins. 25/30 patients were offered genetic testing of whom 3 declined. So far 8 out of 16 patients tested have a confirmed germline mutation. Only 3/8 patients report a family history of CRC. Conclusion:?? Tumour IHC reveals LOE for one of the four MMR gene proteins in approximately 14% of young patients developing CRC and in half subsequent genetic testing will identify Lynch syndrome. A policy of mandatory testing is confirmed but audit of performance and appropriate referral is required.

AB  - Objectives.? The phenomenon of inflammatory masses at the tips of intrathecal drug administration catheters was the subject of a recent case-compilation report and a number of animal studies. We sought to synthesize current clinical and preclinical data to formulate hypotheses about the etiology of catheter-tip masses. Methods.? We reviewed the published human clinical data, new unpublished clinical data, and the results of preclinical studies in two mammalian species, beagle dogs and sheep. Results. Intrathecal morphine sulfate studies in beagle dogs suggested that the observed inflammatory reaction was dose or concentration dependent. Masses occurred after 28 days in one of three animals at 1.5 mg/day (the lowest morphine dose tested); in two of three animals at 3 and 9 mg/day; and in three of three animals at 12 mg/day. The addition of various amounts of clonidine to 1.5 mg/day of morphine revealed no mass formation when the clonidine dose was>0.25 mg/day. A morphine sulfate study that was performed in sheep using a commercially marketed drug administration system found catheter tip masses in two of three animals that received 12 or 18 mg/day of morphine, the highest doses tested. Human cases have occurred only in pain patients who received intrathecal opioids, alone or mixed with other drugs, or in patients who received investigational agents (such as superoxide dismutase or the partial ??opioid-receptor agonist, tramadol) that were not labeled for long-term intrathecal use. Discussion/Conclusions. The evidence suggests that the long-term administration of opioids, especially morphine, caused the masses that were observed in humans and in two species of animals. A relationship probably exists between mass formation and intrathecal morphine doses or concentration. Other factors remain to be investigated.

AB  - Abstract: A unique hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (IVOX) has been developed, which is inserted into the vena caval blood stream to transfer O2/CO2 to/from circulating blood in an intact subject without involving the natural lungs. Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated that the device can transfer significant quantities of O2 and CO2 for up to 3 weeks without significant harmful sequelae or complications. Clinical trials are in progress under FDA supervision, in which IVOX has been utilized to date in 56 patients with ARDS. Preliminary findings indicate that risks and hazards from IVOX are nil, and evidence of benefit to the patient has been demonstrated in 86% of the patients. At this time, clinical utilization of IVOX is in the experimental, data collecting mode to determine its proper role or niche as a method for temporary augmentation of blood gas transfer in patients with advanced acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Objectives Multiple studies have reported healthcare disparities in particular settings and conditions within pediatric otolaryngology, but a systematic examination of the breadth of the problem within the field is lacking. This study's objectives are to synthesize the available evidence regarding healthcare disparities in pediatric otolaryngology, highlight recurrent themes with respect to etiologies and manifestations, and demonstrate potential impacts from patient and provider standpoints. Methods A qualitative systematic review of the PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases for articles focusing on racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic disparities related to pediatric otolaryngology conditions or settings was conducted. United States-based studies of any design or publication date with analysis of children 0 to 18 years old were included. Results Of 711 abstracts identified, 39 met inclusion criteria. Manual review of references from these articles yielded 22 additional studies, for a total of 61. Disparities were identified in nearly every subspecialty within pediatric otolaryngology, with otologic conditions the most frequently studied (33 of 61). The most commonly cited disparities involved low socioeconomic status (25 of 61), inadequate insurance (23 of 61), nonwhite race (21 of 61), and barriers to accessing care (21 of 61). Only six articles found no disparities regarding the condition examined in their study. Conclusion Through a variety of study topics, designs, and settings, a growing body of literature documents disparities across the spectrum of pediatric otolaryngology care. The etiologies and manifestations of such disparities are myriad. This evidence suggests the need for interventions to address these disparities at various professional and institutional levels, ideally with methodological rigor to assess the effectiveness of such interventions.

AB  - Background: Recent studies have shown that being overweight or obese is associated with a higher risk of periodontitis. However, the literature offers an insufficient number of published reports regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on oral health. As such, the present study aims to determine the association between periodontal status and being overweight/obese in prebariatric and postbariatric surgery populations of Brazil. Methods: Three hundred forty-five participants between 18 and 60 years of age, from both sexes, were grouped according to prebariatric or postbariatric surgery and underwent a complete periodontal examination. Biologic, demographic, and behavioral variables were analyzed in a Poisson regression model. Results: Considering the timing of bariatric surgery, the sample was divided into three groups: PRE-OP (preoperative, n = 133), POS-OP1 (postoperative ≤6 months, n = 72), and POS-OP2 (post-surgery >6 months, n = 140). Regardless of the type of surgery (PRE-OP, POS-OP1, POS-OP2), the prevalence of periodontitis proved to be high (81.45%). There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of periodontitis among the PRE-OP, POS-OP1, and POS-OP2 groups (P = 0.040). In the Poisson regression model, after adjusting for biologic, demographic, and behavioral risk variables, only bleeding on probing remained significantly associated with the prevalence of periodontitis (P <0.001). Conclusion: Differences in periodontal condition were observed in individuals at different times of the bariatric surgery, showing a high prevalence of periodontitis in both preoperative and postoperative follow-up.

AB  - Background: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. Methods: A prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip fracture (≥65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30?min after admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4?h of admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. Results: The number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1%), with a decrease from 34% (45 of 132) in the control group to 22% (29 of 131) in the intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically older, more often had >4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the SPMSQ test. Conclusion: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during hospitalization by 35%.

AB  - Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for the induction of primary T-cell responses and may serve as ?biologic adjuvants? in therapeutic protocols. However, given the ?plasticity? of this antigen-presenting cell, it remains unclear which DC type (source, subtype, and stage of differentiation) should be applied clinically. To provide additional insight in this selection process, we have, for the first time, analyzed the in vitro differentiation of CD34+ precursor-derived and monocyte-derived DCs for ultrastructure, phenotype, and function. The ultrastructural intracytoplasmic differentiation of DCs correlated with increasing T-cell stimulatory activity of these cells. ?Early-stage?-DCs proliferate, exhibit high levels of soluble antigen uptake, and moderate T-cell stimulatory capacity, and are characterized by centrally located nuclei and numerous enlarged mitochondria. ?Intermediate-stage?-DCs are enlarged cells with enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity and pronounced cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery. ?Late-stage? (LS)-DCs exhibit a mature secretory cell phenotype and low proliferative index. They express high levels of the HLA-DR, CD40L, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules and CD83, a specific marker of mature DCs, and appear maximally stimulatory to T cells. Ultrastructurally, LS-DCs feature an accentric nucleus, an enlarged cytoplasm, containing numerous secretory storage vesicles, along with a fully developed Golgi complex. LS-DCs exhibited numerous multivesicular and multilaminar structures containing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, consistent with the MIIC (peptide-loading) compartment. In extended studies, cultured CD14+ monocyte-derived DCs displayed a similar, but accelerated, temporal differentiation staging pattern.

AB  - Abstract Cystic fibrosis patients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trauma, burn wound, or patients requiring ventilation are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physiological innate defense mechanisms against this pathogen, and their alterations in lung diseases, are for the most part unknown. We now demonstrate a role for the sphingoid long chain base, sphingosine, in determining susceptibility to lung infection by P. aeruginosa. Tracheal and bronchial sphingosine levels were significantly reduced in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients and from cystic fibrosis mouse models due to reduced activity of acid ceramidase, which generates sphingosine from ceramide. Inhalation of mice with sphingosine, with a sphingosine analog, FTY720, or with acid ceramidase rescued susceptible mice from infection. Our data suggest that luminal sphingosine in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells prevents pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in normal individuals, paving the way for novel therapeutic paradigms based on inhalation of acid ceramidase or of sphingoid long chain bases in lung infection.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: To present suggestions on planning for development of emergency medicine (EM) and out-of-hospital care in countries that are in an early phase of this process, and to provide basic background information for planners not already familiar with EM. Methods: The techniques and programs used by the authors and others in assisting in EM development in other countries to date are described. Conclusions: Some aspects of EM system development have applicability to most countries, but other aspects must be decided by planners based on country-specific factors. Because of the very recent initiation of many EM system development efforts in other countries, to the authors' knowledge there have not yet been extensive evaluative reports of the efficacy of these efforts. Further studies are needed on the relative effectiveness and cost-benefit of different EM development efforts.
