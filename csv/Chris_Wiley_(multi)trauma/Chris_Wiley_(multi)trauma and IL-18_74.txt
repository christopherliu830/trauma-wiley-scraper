AB  - Abstract We investigated the hypothesis that if the area, length, and mineralization of newly formed bone could be used to predict the healing quality of patella?patellar tendon (PPT) junction after partial patellectomy. Twenty-four rabbits underwent partial patellectomy and their PPT complexes of the operated limbs were harvested at weeks 6, 12, and 18 postoperatively. The area, length, and mineralization of newly formed bone at PPT junction healing interface was evaluated radiographically and peripheral quantitative computational tomographically. The healing quality of PPT complexes in terms of its tensile property was determined by biomechanical testing. The results showed that the area, length, and mineral content of newly formed bone, and its tensile strength increased significantly with follow-up time. The area of newly formed bone was strongly correlated with the failure load, ultimate strength and energy at failure (r?=?0.75, 0.76, and 0.70, respectively, p?<?0.01 for all). The length of newly formed bone was also found to be correlated with failure load, ultimate strength and energy at failure (r?=?0.61, 0.54, 0.67, respectively, p?<?0.01 for all). In addition, the bone mineral content of newly formed bone but not its bone mineral density was moderately correlated with failure load, ultimate strength and energy at failure (r?=?0.44, 0.51, 0.42, respectively, p?<?0.05 for all). In conclusion, the area, length, and mineralization of newly formed bone at the PPT junction after partial patellectomy may serve as useful noninvasive indices in assessing the quality of the bone?tendon junction repair. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. Methods: A prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip fracture (≥65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30?min after admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4?h of admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. Results: The number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1%), with a decrease from 34% (45 of 132) in the control group to 22% (29 of 131) in the intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically older, more often had >4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the SPMSQ test. Conclusion: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during hospitalization by 35%.

AB  - Background: Multiple idiopathic root resorption (MIRR) is a rare condition in man characterized by cervical resorption leading to significant tooth loss. A similar condition, feline osteoclastic resorptive lesions (FORL), affects up to 70% of domestic cats and thus provides a valuable model for investigating the etiopathogenesis of MIRR. The aim of the present study was to establish changes in the surface microanatomy of the tooth in late stage FORL and to identify whether its location has a surface bias. Methods: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the surface features of enamel and cementum of feline teeth affected with advanced FORL. Results: Resorption involved the coronal root at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) in 95% of teeth and focal resorption of intact enamel was observed in 14% of teeth. In 55% of teeth, the main lesion was on the buccal surface and a distinct circumferential resorption ?front? was present at the apical margin of resorption. The root surfaces of most affected teeth either lacked extrinsic fibers or cellular lacunae or featured evidence of cementum remodeling. Woven bone-like tissue was found within lesions, on resorbed dentin, or on the root surface in 27% of teeth. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that most FORL involve the CEJ, and the presence of focal lesions at this site suggests that this is where resorption is initiated. This implies that local factors in the oral microenvironment play a role in the etiopathogenesis of this condition. The study also shows that FORL are more likely to occur on buccal surfaces and are associated with changes in the microarchitecture of the root surface consistent with destruction of the normal periodontal attachment and stimulation of a reparative response. These findings may be relevant to understanding the etiopathogenesis of multiple idiopathic resorption areas in man. J Periodontol 2005;76:1106-1112.

AB  - Abstract Aim Anastomotic leakage is a serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, poor function and predisposing to cancer recurrence. Earlier diagnosis and intervention can minimize systemic complications but is hindered by current diagnostic methods that are non-specific and often uninformative. The purpose of this paper is to review current developments in the field and to identify strategies for early detection and treatment of anastomotic leakage. Method A systematic literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included ?anastomosis? and ?leak? and ?diagnosis? or ?detection? and ?gastrointestinal? or ?colorectal?. Papers concentrating on the diagnosis of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak were identified and further searches were performed by cross-referencing. Results Computerized tomography CT scanning and water-soluble contrast studies are the current preferred techniques for diagnosing anastomotic leakage but suffer from variable sensitivity and specificity, have logistical constraints and may delay timely intervention. Intra-operative endoscopy and imaging may offer certain advantages, but the ability to predict anastomotic leakage is unproven. Newer techniques involve measurement of biomarkers for anastomotic leakage and have the potential advantage of providing cheap real-time monitoring for postoperative complications. Conclusion Current diagnostic tests often fail to diagnose anastomotic leak at an early stage that enables timely intervention and minimizes serious morbidity and mortality. Emerging technologies, based on detection of local biomarkers, have achieved proof of concept status but require further evaluation to determine whether they translate into improved patient outcomes. Further research is needed to address this important, yet relatively unrecognized, area of unmet clinical need.

AB  - Abstract Title.? Providing psychosocial and physical rehabilitation advice for patients with burns. Aim.? This paper is a report of a study evaluating the perceived skills of nursing and allied healthcare professionals in providing psychosocial and physical rehabilitation advice, including the effect of years of burn injury experience. Background.? Recovery from burn injuries is a complex mix of physical and psychosocial rehabilitation, yet research in the UK has demonstrated that healthcare professionals feel more competent at giving advice to patients on issues of physical rehabilitation than psychosocial rehabilitation. Methods.? This was a replication study with a cross-sectional design. A questionnaire survey was conducted with a convenience sample of healthcare professionals in a large urban hospital with specialist burn and plastic services in New Zealand. The data were collected in 2005. Results.? Consistent with the UK results, New Zealand healthcare professionals rated their skills in advising patients about physical items of burn rehabilitation higher than their skills for psychosocial items. Years of experience working with burns was related to greater perceived skill in advising patients on physical rehabilitation. In contrast, no relationship between years of experience and perceived skill in the provision of psychosocial rehabilitation advice was found. Conclusion.? Strategies to enhance effective staff/patient communication should form an integral part of staff education. The psychosocial needs of patients must be incorporated as an essential part of such strategies.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Brush cytology, the conventional method to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma, has been plagued by low diagnostic sensitivity and false-negative results. This paper aims to study the clinical utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in enhancing identification of malignant biliary strictures. Methods Brush cytologic specimens collected from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliary strictures in a tertiary hospital in Singapore from March 2013 to July 2015 were examined by FISH technique using UroVysion probe set in this study. Results Thirty patients were chosen with five patients having multiple FISH performed due to indeterminate results. The diagnoses for biliary strictures were 13 (43.3%) cholangiocarcinomas, seven (23.3%) pancreatic cancers, seven (23.3%) benign biliary strictures, and three (10%) primary sclerosing cholangitis. Conventional brush cytology had sensitivity of 53.8% with specificity of 82.4%. FISH had sensitivity of 30.8% with specificity of 100%. When FISH results were interpreted in cases with negative or atypical brush cytology, two patients had positive FISH results and cholangiocarcinomas. Based on this pilot study, FISH increased sensitivity of brush cytology in detection of cholangiocarcinoma from 53.8% to 69.2% while preserving specificity of 82.4%. Conclusion Compared with conventional cytology with low sensitivity, FISH may help to increase sensitivity on top of brush cytology while maintaining high specificity.

AB  - Summary Blood transfusion in surgery has long been understood to carry a fair amount of clinical risk despite its obvious benefits. For this reason, blood loss conservation and other methods for minimization of transfusion have become of paramount importance for the advancement of ongoing safe care of the surgical patient. This chapter will serve as an overall guide to understanding the availability, cost, and usage of blood products in surgery. Additionally, we will discuss techniques used during procedures that play a role in minimization of transfusion. Further, the potential benefits of unnecessary blood transfusion in surgical patients will be explained with a goal of improving outcomes in the future.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Accurate and simple prognostic criteria based on histopathology following pancreaticoduodenectomy would be helpful in assessing prognosis and considering and evaluating adjuvant therapy. This study analysed the histological parameters influencing outcome following pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary malignancy. Methods:? A total of 110 pancreaticoduodenectomies were performed from 1998 to 2008. The median age of patients was 69 years (range 20?89 years). The median follow-up was 4.9 years. Of the procedures, 87% (96) were performed for malignancies and the remainder (n= 14) for benign aetiologies. Of the 96 malignancies, 60 were pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the rest were ampullary (14), cholangio (9), duodenal (9) carcinomas and others. Statistical analysis was performed using log-rank and Cox regression multivariate analyses. Results:? Patients who underwent resection had 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of 70%, 46% and 41%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates for periampullary cancers other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 83%, 69% and 61%, respectively; those for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 62%, 31% and 27%, respectively (P < 0.003). Poor tumour differentiation (P < 0.02), tumour size >3?cm (P < 0.04), margin ≤2?mm (P < 0.02), nodal involvement (P < 0.003), perineural infiltration (P < 0.0001) and lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.002) were associated with poorer prognosis. In a multivariate analysis, histologically identified perineural infiltration (P < 0.03) and lymphovascular invasion (P= 0.05) were significant factors influencing outcome. Five-year survival was 77% in patients negative for both factors and 15% in patients positive for both (P < 0.0001). In the pancreatic adenocarcinoma subgroup, patients who were negative for both factors had a 5-year survival of 71%, whereas those who were positive for both had a 5-year survival of 16% (P < 0.02). Conclusions:? The presence of perineural infiltration and lymphovascular invasion on histopathology is highly significant in predicting 5-year outcomes after pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary and pancreatic malignancies.

AB  - Aim:?To investigate the reasons for tooth extraction and their correlations with age and gender in Greece. Materials and methods:?The study population consisted of 1,018 patients, 560 males and 458 females, aged 18?74?years from a private practice in Greece. Each patient?s age, gender, number of extracted teeth and the reasons for the extraction were recorded for a period of 5?years. Results:?Two thousand four hundred and eighteen permanent teeth were extracted for various reasons during the study period. The results showed that the main reasons for extraction were caries (45.6%), periodontal disease (32.1%), failed root canal treatment (7.3%) and root fracture (4.4%). Caries was the main reason for extraction in patients up to 44?years old (64.7%), while periodontal disease was the main reason for extraction in patients over years of age (77.6%). Maxillary and mandibular 1st and 2nd molars, were the most frequently extracted teeth due to dental caries. Premolars of the mandible and maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth were the most frequently extracted teeth due to periodontal disease. Conclusions:?Although the targets of the WHO regarding the reduction of dental caries were accomplished, dental caries and periodontal disease are still the main reasons for tooth extraction regardless of the age of the patients.

AB  - Abstract Chitosan (CS), a polysaccharide derived from chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide, is widely used in the medical world because of its natural and nontoxic properties and its innate ability for antibacterial and hemostasis effects. In this study, the novel composites containing CS and cellulose (CEL) (i.e., [CEL?+?CS]), which we have previously synthesized using a green and totally recyclable method, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity, absorption of anticoagulated whole blood, anti-inflammatory activity through the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the biocompatibility with human fibroblasts. The [CEL?+?CS] composites were found to inhibit the growth of both Gram positive and negative micro-organisms. For examples, the regenerated 100% lyophilized chitosan material was found to reduce growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739 and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51299) by 78, 36, and 64%, respectively. The composites are nontoxic to fibroblasts; that is, fibroblasts, which are critical to the formation of connective tissue matrix were found to grow and proliferate in the presence of the composites. They effectively absorb blood, and at the same rate and volume as commercially available wound dressings. The composites, in both air-dried and lyophilized forms, significantly inhibit the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by stimulated macrophages. These results clearly indicate that the biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic [CEL?+?CS] composites, particularly those dried by lyophilizing, can be effectively used as a material in wound dressings. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Localized tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) elevation has diverse effects in brain injury often attributed to signaling via TNFp55 or TNFp75 receptors. Both dentate granule cells and CA pyramidal cells express TNF receptors (TNFR) at low levels in a punctate pattern. Using a model to induce selective death of dentate granule cells (trimethyltin; 2?mg/kg, i.p.), neuronal apoptosis [terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ end labeling, active caspase 3 (AC3)] was accompanied by amoeboid microglia and elevated TNFα mRNA levels. TNFp55R (55?kDa type-1 TNFR) and TNFp75R (75?kDa type-2 TNFR) immunoreactivity in AC3+ neurons displayed a pattern suggestive of receptor internalization and a temporal sequence of expression of TNFp55R followed by TNFp75R associated with the progression of apoptosis. A distinct ramified microglia response occurred around CA1 neurons and healthy dentate neurons that displayed an increase in the normal punctate pattern of TNFRs. Neuronal damage was decreased with i.c.v. injection of TNFα antibody and in TNFp55R?/?p75R?/? mice that showed higher constitutive mRNA levels for interleukin (IL-1α), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), TNFα, transforming growth factor ?1, Fas, and TNFRSF6-assoicated via death domain (FADD). TNFp75R?/? mice showed exacerbated injury and elevated mRNA levels for IL-1α, MIP-1α, and TNFα. In TNFp55R?/? mice, constitutive mRNA levels for TNFα, IL-6, caspase 8, FADD, and Fas-associated phosphatase were higher; IL-1α, MIP-1α, and transforming growth factor ?1 lower. The mice displayed exacerbated neuronal death, delayed microglia response, increased FADD and TNFp75R mRNA levels, and co-expression of TNFp75R in AC3+ neurons. The data demonstrate TNFR-mediated apoptotic death of dentate granule neurons utilizing both TNFRs and suggest a TNFp75R-mediated apoptosis in the absence of normal TNFp55R activity.

AB  - Abstract There is an increasing need for novel biomarkers that enable better diagnostic and prognostic stratification of patients with suspected infection. A proprotein convertase enzyme FURIN is upregulated upon immune cell activation, and it promotes infectivity by cleaving and activating pathogens. In this study, we determined FURIN levels in plasma using ELISA from 537 patients that were admitted to emergency room with suspected infection. Patients were sorted to high- and low-level FURIN groups with a cut-off level of 370 pg/ml. The study cohort included five diagnostic groups: Group 1, no systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS, n = 59 patients); Group 2, bacterial infection without SIRS (n = 67); Group 3, SIRS, but no bacterial infection (n = 308); Group 4, sepsis without organ failure (n = 308); and Group 5, severe sepsis (n = 49). Statistically significant associations were not found between the plasma level of FURIN and the prevalence of sepsis (P = 0.957), diagnostic group of a patient (P = 0.737) or the bacteria in blood culture (P = 0.499). Additionally, the concentration of FURIN did not predict the severity or case fatality of the infectious disease. However, statistically significant associations were found between high plasma level of FURIN and diagnosed rheumatic disease (P < 0.001) as well as with the prevalence of non-smokers (P = 0.034). Thus, albeit the plasma level of FURIN does not predict the severity of infectious disease, it may be of use in the diagnostics of autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Abstract Aging is associated with a decline of performance leading to reduced reproductive output and survival. While the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging has attracted considerable attention, the molecular/physiological functions underlying the early-life benefits/late-life costs paradigm remain elusive. We tested the hypothesis that while early activation of the inflammatory response confers benefits in terms of protection against infection, it also incurs costs in terms of reduced reproductive output at old age and shortened longevity. We infected mice with the malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii and increased the inflammatory response using an anti-IL-10 receptor antibody treatment. We quantified the benefits and costs of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of the infection and at old age. In agreement with the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, the inflammatory response provided an early-life benefit, since infected mice that were treated with anti-IL-10 receptor antibodies had reduced parasite density and anemia. However, at old age, mice in all treatment groups had similar levels of C-reactive protein, reproductive output, survival rate, and lifespan. Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that the benefits of a robust response to malaria infection in early life incur longer term fitness costs.

AB  - Abstract? The phenomenon of regeneration is of growing interest to medical researchers. Until recently this was an area in which research in flatworms and newts predominated, but there is now a proliferation of research concerning regeneration in virtually all of the organs, not only the heart One of the object is restoration of function to a failing heart through cell transplantation, and there have been many reports seeking donor sources of somatic stem cells, i.e.: stem cells in marrow or skeletal muscle and ES cells, beginning with those in embryonic myocardial cell transplant experiments. In particular, reports of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into nerve cell, myocardial cell, skeletal muscle cell, and vascular endothelial cell series have drawn attention to cell plasticity, and clinical applications are awaited.

AB  - Summary Functional foods fall into two broad categories: plant origin and animal origin. A review conducted in 1992 proves that plant-based foods have some components that act against lethal diseases, such as cancer. A vast number of components, such as fish oil and dairy products naturally present in animal sources are potentially beneficial to health. Nutraceuticals deliver a concentrated form of a biologically active component from a food to enhance health in dosages that exceed those that could be obtained from regular food. The use of probiotics in combination with prebiotic has been very effective against several chronic diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics provide an alternate source for the management of different intestinal disorders. The major contributions associated with the work of probiotics on human health are proper colonic function and increased metabolism. Research indicates that there is an estimated global market for functional foods of US$33 billion.
