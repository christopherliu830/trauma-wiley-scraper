AB  - Abstract After uniting the Turco-Mongol tribes and being declared Great Fierce Khan, Chinggis began his conquests of the settled lands. After conquering Northern China he looked west for trade but was forced into conflict. On his death his empire stretched from China to Russia and his sons continued the expansion. In China and Iran multicultural regimes were founded and trade links were established from Europe to China.

AB  - Abstract Localized tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) elevation has diverse effects in brain injury often attributed to signaling via TNFp55 or TNFp75 receptors. Both dentate granule cells and CA pyramidal cells express TNF receptors (TNFR) at low levels in a punctate pattern. Using a model to induce selective death of dentate granule cells (trimethyltin; 2?mg/kg, i.p.), neuronal apoptosis [terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ end labeling, active caspase 3 (AC3)] was accompanied by amoeboid microglia and elevated TNFα mRNA levels. TNFp55R (55?kDa type-1 TNFR) and TNFp75R (75?kDa type-2 TNFR) immunoreactivity in AC3+ neurons displayed a pattern suggestive of receptor internalization and a temporal sequence of expression of TNFp55R followed by TNFp75R associated with the progression of apoptosis. A distinct ramified microglia response occurred around CA1 neurons and healthy dentate neurons that displayed an increase in the normal punctate pattern of TNFRs. Neuronal damage was decreased with i.c.v. injection of TNFα antibody and in TNFp55R?/?p75R?/? mice that showed higher constitutive mRNA levels for interleukin (IL-1α), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), TNFα, transforming growth factor ?1, Fas, and TNFRSF6-assoicated via death domain (FADD). TNFp75R?/? mice showed exacerbated injury and elevated mRNA levels for IL-1α, MIP-1α, and TNFα. In TNFp55R?/? mice, constitutive mRNA levels for TNFα, IL-6, caspase 8, FADD, and Fas-associated phosphatase were higher; IL-1α, MIP-1α, and transforming growth factor ?1 lower. The mice displayed exacerbated neuronal death, delayed microglia response, increased FADD and TNFp75R mRNA levels, and co-expression of TNFp75R in AC3+ neurons. The data demonstrate TNFR-mediated apoptotic death of dentate granule neurons utilizing both TNFRs and suggest a TNFp75R-mediated apoptosis in the absence of normal TNFp55R activity.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of horses with lymphoma are often nonspecific and dependent on the organ system affected. At the present time, the prognosis for all forms of equine lymphoma is grave, but palliative therapies including surgical excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are available and have been reported with varying degrees of success to improve quality of life and prolong survival time. Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with equine lymphoma are uncommon, and are thought to be the result of soluble polypeptide hormones secreted by tumor cells. Definitive diagnosis of lymphoma can be obtained antemortem through identification of neoplastic lymphocytes in tissues, fluids, aspirates, or peripheral blood. Response to chemotherapy is highly variable, with some horses displaying dramatic improvement within 2-4 months of initiating induction protocols and remaining in remission for several months, while others show only modest or no response, regardless of treatment protocol.

AB  - Objective? The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate factor(s) associated with unexplained antepartum bleeding of unknown origin (ABUO) after 24 weeks of pregnancy and correlate unexplained haemorrhage with maternal and perinatal outcomes. Design? This is a retrospective observational study. Setting? King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH), Subiaco, Western Australia. Population? Singleton pregnancies delivering at KEMH between January 1998 and December 2004. Methods? ABUO was defined as bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation but before the onset of labour with no cause detected on vaginal examination or abdominal ultrasound. Outcomes of these pregnancies were collated and compared with those of pregnancies without ABUO. Main outcome measures? Antepartum complications assessed included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, gestational diabetes and preterm birth. Intrapartum evaluations included labour inductions, mode of delivery and gestational age at delivery. Neonatal outcomes evaluated included birthweight, Apgar scores, newborn intensive care unit (NICU) admission, neonatal complications and risk of perinatal/neonatal death. Results? Between January 1998 and December 2004, there were 26?583 deliveries without ABUO and 1431 with ABUO. Multivariable analyses of the ABUO effects revealed that ABUO was a simultaneously significant risk factor for term labour inductions (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.72?2.32, P < 0.001), preterm delivery (OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 3.84?4.84, P < 0.001), NICU admission (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01?1.51, P = 0.042), hyperbilirubinaemia (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01?1.63, P = 0.041) and reduced birthweight (26 g, 95% CI: 3?50, P = 0.026). Conclusion? Women with ABUO are at greater risk of preterm delivery, term labour induction and their neonates are at greater risk for NICU admissions, hyperbilirubinaemia and a reduced birthweight.

AB  - Summary Functional foods fall into two broad categories: plant origin and animal origin. A review conducted in 1992 proves that plant-based foods have some components that act against lethal diseases, such as cancer. A vast number of components, such as fish oil and dairy products naturally present in animal sources are potentially beneficial to health. Nutraceuticals deliver a concentrated form of a biologically active component from a food to enhance health in dosages that exceed those that could be obtained from regular food. The use of probiotics in combination with prebiotic has been very effective against several chronic diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics provide an alternate source for the management of different intestinal disorders. The major contributions associated with the work of probiotics on human health are proper colonic function and increased metabolism. Research indicates that there is an estimated global market for functional foods of US$33 billion.

AB  - AbstractBackground: Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) report greater stress and negative health consequences than nonabused women. Although an association between psychological stress and altered immune function has been shown, IPV studies have not investigated this relationship. Objective: This study explored the association of IPV with mental health symptoms and an immune marker to determine if posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms mediate the effect of IPV on pro-inflammatory (IFN-?) cytokine levels. Methods: A cross-sectional, comparative design was used to compare 62 women with IPV and 39 nonabused women. Results: Mean IFN-? values were higher in abused women and in women with current PTSD symptoms. There were no significant relationships with potential confounding variables that could provide an alternative explanation for the increase in production of proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: PTSD symptoms mediate the association between IPV and IFN-? levels and may partially explain the association of mental health symptoms with physical health sequelae in IPV.

AB  - Various factors are associated with foot ulceration, including delayed reporting of ulcers, poor glycemic control, and severity of neuropathy. Several studies have looked at the role of nitric oxide in wound healing. However, no studies have examined its role in the occurrence and recurrence of diabetic foot ulceration. In a cross-sectional study we examined the role of neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and plasma nitric oxide (estimated from plasma nitrite and nitrate) levels in diabetic patients with recurrent and non-recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers. Patients with recurrent foot ulcers had higher vibration perception threshold values compared to patients with non-recurrent foot ulcers (47.4 ± 5.7 volts versus 39.5 ± 10.3 volts respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, subjects with recurrent foot ulcers had significantly higher plasma nitric oxide compared to subjects with non-recurrent foot ulcers (46.9 ± 6.3 ?m/L versus 30.2 ± 2.4 ?m/L respectively, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, hemoglobin A1c, presence of retinopathy and nephropathy, vibration perception threshold, plasma creatinine, and total nitric oxide, indicated that only vibration perception threshold was independently associated with the presence of an ulcer [odds ratio: 1.26 (1.10-1.46); P <0.001)] and the recurrence of foot ulcers [odds ratio: 1.13 (1.01-1.27); P=0.04)]. This study has shown that although plasma nitric oxide is higher in patients with recurrent neuropathic and neuroischemic foot ulcers, severity of neuropathy was the most important factor associated with the development and recurrence of foot ulcers in diabetic patients.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to determinate the immunoproteasome concentration in the blood plasma of children with appendicitis, and its correlation with circulating proteasome and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1). Twenty-seven children with acute appendicitis, managed at the Paediatric Surgery Department, were included randomly into the study (age 2 years 9 months up to 14 years, mean age 9·5 ± 1 years). There were 10 girls and 17 boys; 18 healthy, age-matched subjects, admitted for planned surgeries served as controls. Mean concentrations of immunoproteasome, 20S proteasome and UCHL1 in the blood plasma of children with appendicitis before surgery 24 h and 72 h after the appendectomy were higher than in the control group. The immunoproteasome, 20S proteasome and UCHL1 concentrations in the blood plasma of patients with acute appendicitis were highest before surgery. The immunoproteasome, 20S proteasome and UCHL1 concentration measured 24 and 72 h after the operation decreased slowly over time and still did not reach the normal range (P?<?0·05). There was no statistical difference between immunoproteasome, 20S proteasome and UCHL1 concentrations in children operated on laparoscopically and children after classic appendectomy. The immunoproteasome concentration may reflect the metabolic response to acute state inflammation, and the process of gradual ebbing of the inflammation may thus be helpful in the assessment of the efficacy of treatment. The method of operation ? classic open appendectomy or laparoscopic appendectomy ? does not influence the general trend in immunoproteasome concentration in children with appendicitis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been associated with diminished bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of fracture; however, prior studies have not yielded consistent results, and many have suboptimal ascertainment of both PPI use and BMD. We used data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a multicenter, multi-ethnic, community-based longitudinal cohort study of women across the menopause transition to examine the association between annualized BMD changes and new use of PPIs. We compared changes in BMD in new PPI users with changes in BMD in new users of histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and with changes in BMD in subjects who did not use either class of medications. Mixed linear regression models included recognized risk factors for osteoporosis, including demographics, menopausal transition stage, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle factors, as well as comorbidities and concomitant medications. To provide further evidence for the validity of our analytic approach, we also examined the effects of hormone-replacement therapy (HT), a class of medications that should reduce bone loss, on changes in BMD as an internal positive control group. We identified 207 new users of PPIs, 185 new users of H2RAs, and 1,676 non-users. Study subjects had a mean age of 50 years and were followed for a median of 9.9 years. Adjusted models found no difference in the annualized BMD change at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip in PPI users compared with H2RA users or non-users. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. BMD increased as expected in HT users, supporting the validity of our study design. These longitudinal analyses plus similar prior studies argue against an association between PPI use and BMD loss. ? 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Background ?? In this article, current scientific knowledge on the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is reviewed. The US case definition of CFS (the CDC-definition) is most widespread in research and clinical practice. Estimates of prevalence vary from 0.2% to above 2%. The female?male ratio is approximately 3:1. Clinical Features ?? Severe fatigue is the dominating complaint; it is worsened from exertions and not substantially relieved by rest. In addition, the patients might have a varying combination of accompanying symptoms. Clinical evaluation should be based upon standardized guidelines, including an assessment of functional impairments. Pathophysiology ?? The pathophysiology should be interpreted within a biopsychosocial framework. Present knowledge suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms and personality traits might be regarded as predisposing factors, some infections and severe psychosocial stress constitute precipitating factors, whereas disturbances of immunity, skeletal muscle, cognitive abilities, endocrine control and cardiovascular homeostasis are possible perpetuating factors. Treatment ?? Cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy are of proven value in randomized controlled trials. Several pharmaceutical measures have been explored and found to have no beneficial effect. Most patients might expect long-term improvement, but full recovery is rare; however, the prognosis is better among adolescents.

AB  - Abstract? Background and Aim of the Study: Patients with low ejection farction (EF) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) usually have a higher incidence of mortality and morbidity. In this retrospective study, we sought to detect significant preoperative predictors of early mortality in these patients. Methods: Patients with an EF of ≤30% who underwent isolated CABG in Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, the Netherlands, between January 1998 and December 2008 (n = 413) were included in this study. All the preoperative patient-related risk factors were entered into a logistic regression analysis model to detect the significant predictors of early mortality. Results: Patients with an EF of ≤30% represent 4.1% of the whole CABG population. The overall early mortality in this patient group was 9.1%. Risk factors for early mortality as identified by the univariate analysis were age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prior CABG, New York Heart association (NYHA) class, emergency operation, preoperative serum creatinine (SeCr), and preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level. These factors were entered into the multivariate analysis and were all identified as independent risk factors for early mortality. Conclusions: This study confirmed the impact of some well-known preoperative risk factors on early outcome in patients with low EF undergoing CABG. In addition, we have shown the predictive value of preoperative SeCr and hemoglobin level that have not yet been described.?(J Card Surg 2011;26:9-15)

AB  - Abstract Title.? How evidence-based is venous leg ulcer care? A survey in community settings. Background:? Incongruence between evidence and practice in leg ulcer care has been reported. Little is known about predictive factors related to the provision of lifestyle advice. Method:? Two focus interviews and a Delphi procedure were used to develop a self-administered questionnaire based on the Graham questionnaire. Nurses employed by community healthcare organizations and independent nurses in private practices participated (n?=?789). The data were collected in 2006. Findings:? Compression was applied in 58·7% of patients with venous ulcers. Pain was present in 82·9%. A third of patients with pain received analgesics, but half of these patients (52·1%) took analgesics as prescribed. Half of the nurses (50·8%) gave lifestyle advice related to the leg ulcer. It was mainly instructions about leg elevation (68·3%), promoting physical activity (39·8%) and optimizing nutrition (16·7%) that were provided. Nurses who perceived themselves to have adequate leg ulcer knowledge and skills were 3·75 times more likely to provide lifestyle advice compared with those lacking such knowledge and skills. Nurses who found leg ulcer care not rewarding, rarely successful or difficult gave statistically significantly less lifestyle advice than those who found it rather rewarding, successful and not difficult. Conclusion:? Patients with leg ulcers receive less than optimum care and patient education. A particular challenge lies in leg ulcer education programmes and pain management.

AB  - Background and purpose:? White matter lesions (WMLs) caused by small vessel disease are common in elderly people and contribute to cognitive impairment. There are no established biochemical markers for WMLs. We aimed to study the relation between degree of WMLs rated on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of structural biomarkers associated with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and subcortical vascular dementia. Methods:? Fifty-three non-demented elderly individuals with WMLs were subjected to lumbar puncture. Degree of WMLs was rated using the Fazekas scale. Volumetric assessment of WMLs was performed. CSF samples were analyzed for the 40 and 42 amino acid fragments of amyloid ?, α- and ?-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein, total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau181), neurofilament light protein (NFL), sulfatide and CSF/Serum-albumin ratio. Results:? Fifteen subjects had mild, 23 had moderate and 15 had severe degree of WMLs. CSF-NFL levels differed between the groups (P?<?0.001) and correlated with the volume of WMLs (r?=?0.477, P?<?0.001). CSF sulfatide concentration displayed similar changes but less strongly. T-tau, P-tau181 and the different amyloid markers as well as CSF/S-albumin ratio did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions:? The association of increased CSF-NFL levels with increasing severity of WMLs in non-demented subjects suggests that NFL is a marker for axonal damage in response to small vessel disease in the brain. This manifestation may be distinct from or earlier than the neurodegenerative process seen in AD, as reflected by the lack of association between WMLs and AD biomarkers.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
