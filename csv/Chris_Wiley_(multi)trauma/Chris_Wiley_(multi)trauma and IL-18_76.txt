AB  - Abstract Title.? How evidence-based is venous leg ulcer care? A survey in community settings. Background:? Incongruence between evidence and practice in leg ulcer care has been reported. Little is known about predictive factors related to the provision of lifestyle advice. Method:? Two focus interviews and a Delphi procedure were used to develop a self-administered questionnaire based on the Graham questionnaire. Nurses employed by community healthcare organizations and independent nurses in private practices participated (n?=?789). The data were collected in 2006. Findings:? Compression was applied in 58·7% of patients with venous ulcers. Pain was present in 82·9%. A third of patients with pain received analgesics, but half of these patients (52·1%) took analgesics as prescribed. Half of the nurses (50·8%) gave lifestyle advice related to the leg ulcer. It was mainly instructions about leg elevation (68·3%), promoting physical activity (39·8%) and optimizing nutrition (16·7%) that were provided. Nurses who perceived themselves to have adequate leg ulcer knowledge and skills were 3·75 times more likely to provide lifestyle advice compared with those lacking such knowledge and skills. Nurses who found leg ulcer care not rewarding, rarely successful or difficult gave statistically significantly less lifestyle advice than those who found it rather rewarding, successful and not difficult. Conclusion:? Patients with leg ulcers receive less than optimum care and patient education. A particular challenge lies in leg ulcer education programmes and pain management.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Abstract Objective Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is commonly used in adult patients with coronary artery disease, but data on PCI in children and adolescents remain limited. Herein, we describe our experience with the use of PCI in pediatric and adolescent patients. Design This is a retrospective review. Setting The study was conducted at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Patients All patients ≤18 years old who underwent PCI from 2004 to 2012 were included. Interventions Intravascular ultrasound and balloon angioplasty were performed in all patients, with subsequent stent placement in 6/7 (86%) procedures. Outcome Measures Residual postintervention stenosis, early procedural morbidity and mortality were the outcome measures. Results Overall, seven unique PCI procedures were performed in five patients (four males, mean age 13.2 ± 3.8 years, range 8?18 years). Mean follow-up interval was 2 (0.6?5.5) years. Indications for the procedures included transplant coronary vasculopathy (n = 1), coronary dissection (n = 1), and acute coronary thrombosis/myocardial infarction (n = 1). Additionally, there were two patients (n = 2) who experienced coronary compression as a sequelae of prior heart surgery. Intravascular ultrasound and balloon angioplasty were performed in all patients, with subsequent stent placement in 6/7 (86%) procedures. A total of eight stents were placed (average stent diameter 3 ± 0.5?mm), including six (75%) drug-eluting stents. The targeted coronary artery lesions were successfully treated in all seven procedures. There was no early procedural morbidity or mortality. Two patients were noted to have angiographic evidence of in-stent restenosis at 3 and 15 months postdeployment, respectively, despite treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel. Conclusion PCI in children and adolescents can be utilized to improve coronary blood flow in a variety of clinical situations. It may be particularly effective in cases of postsurgical coronary compression. Close angiographic follow-up is critical as these patients are at risk for in-stent restenosis.

AB  - Abstract Background No data are available on the prevalence of mortality in neonates after major surgery such as laparotomy in China. Methods In a tertiary general hospital, 142 newborns who underwent laparotomy for a variety of surgical conditions in the past 6 years were included in this study in Beijing, China. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables potentially predictive of postoperative 30 day mortality were collected and compared between the surviving and deceased newborns. Results Death ≤30 days after laparotomy occurred in 19 of 142 newborns (13.4%) during the study period. Newborns diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) had the worst outcome (OR, 11.4). Significantly more neonates in the 30 day death group were intubated preoperatively (52.6%) compared with the survival group (19.5%; OR, 10.0). Base excess ≤?10 mmol/L immediately after laparotomy was associated with negative prognosis in the early postoperative period (OR, 11.2). Conclusion The mortality rate of newborns ≤30 days after laparotomy was 13.4% in a Chinese tertiary general hospital in the past 6 years. The factors associated with early death were NEC, preoperative intubation with mechanical ventilation, and postoperative immediate base excess ≤?10 mmol/L.

AB  - Abstract Extracts from the seed of the African shea tree Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn have been used traditionally for the treatment of arthritic conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which benefit is conferred. This single-site, 15-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study examined a range of biomarkers in 89 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees and/or hips to determine potential modes of action of SheaFlex70TM, a triterpene-rich extract of Vitellaria paradoxa. In the group of participants with levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers in the upper quartile at baseline, there were significant decreases in inflammation and cartilage breakdown and trend level decreases in bone remodeling in the SheaFlex70TM group versus placebo between commencement and completion of the study. Inflammation marker TNF-alpha fell 23.9% vs 6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.041. Cartilage degradation marker CTX-II fell 28.7% vs an increase of 17.6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.018. This marker also showed significant falls across the entire study group, 10.6% vs an increase of 11.6%, (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.016. Osteocalcin levels fell 9.2%, p = 0.014 (treatment) vs 1.2%, ns (placebo), p = 0.096 (treatment vs placebo). These findings indicate that in patients with the highest levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers, SheaFlex70TM demonstrated multiple beneficial activities consistent with slowing the disease process.

AB  - Abstract Several studies have reported that nature-derived antioxidants may prevent free radicals over-production and therefore control the onset and prevent the exacerbation of different kinds of diseases caused by oxidative stress and redox-derived stressors, including ageing, fundamentally by suppressing the oxidative by-products-mediated degradation. Naturally derived antioxidants exert their anti-ageing action via a panoply of signalling systems, many of which engaging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging, with the Nrf2/Keap1-ARE system and improving the many survival genes and functions (such as the pathway mTOR/Foxo/SIRT1) able to slow cellular senescence. Most of the research in this field has evaluated the regulative effects and even pathways of herbal extracts with antioxidant property in the ageing process, and various age-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, coronary and myocardial circulatory perfusion, peripheral vascular resistance, and even neurodegenerative disorders are prevented plant phytochemicals often via their antioxidant potential. A much more complex ability to interact with survival functions makes these compounds successfully active in preventing ageing-related disorders. This report aimed to discuss in more detail some selected medicinal plants including Allium sativum, Aloe vera, Crataegus spp., Cynara scolymus, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Ginkgo biloba, Hippophae rhamnoides, Panax ginseng, Rosmarinus officinalis, Schizandra chinensis, Vitis vinifera and seaweeds in the prevention of ageing-related pathologies. A systematic overview of the relevant information in the antioxidant function of the many herbal products reviewed here for the control of the ageing process is proposed, to provide a new horizon on the design of anti-ageing herbal medicines.

AB  - Objective??? To evaluate changes in perceptual and several acoustic parameters of voice in patients with Parkinson?s disease (PD) and to find out any relation with these parameters and motor components of Unified Parkinson?s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in this patient group. Materials and methods??? Twenty patients with PD (12 male and 8 female) were given objective and subjective voice tests and results were compared with those of 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Patient's perceptual voice analysis was assessed using GRBAS scale including Grade of Dysphonia, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain items. Measurements for objective voice analysis, acoustic assessment tests including frequency perturbation [jitter (jitt)%], intensity perturbation [shimmer (shim)%], noise to harmonic ratio (NHR), fundamental frequency (F0), variability of fundamental frequency (vF0), diadochokinetic rate (DDK) and maximum phonation time (MPT) were used. An assessment of disability caused by voice disorders was scored according to the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) by the patient. All subjects also underwent videolaryngostroboscopic (VLS) examination. Motor components of UPDRS and acoustic parameters of voice were investigated for any correlations. Results??? Compared with controls, roughness (P?=?0.15), breathiness (P?=?0.004) and asthenia (P?=?0.031) values of males and breathiness (P?=?0.043) and asthenia (P?=?0.023) values of females were higher in patients with PD. Mean VHI scores of patients with PD were higher for both male and female patients (P?=?0.0001 for male, P?=?0.002 for female). The mean values for MPT (P?=?0.02) and DDK (P?=?0.025) were shorter in patients with PD. Jitt%, shim% and mean F0 values were similar among the two groups. But mean vF0 values were significantly higher in male patients with PD (P?=?0.05). On VLS examination, non-closure glottic pattern was found to be more frequent in the PD group. Conclusion??? Although it is well known that pathophysiological changes in PD affect the voice, the present study found only few significant correlations between motor component of UPDRS and voice parameters.
