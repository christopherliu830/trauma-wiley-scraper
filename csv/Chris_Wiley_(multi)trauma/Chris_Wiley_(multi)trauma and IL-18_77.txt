AB  - Abstract Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection, is considered the major cause of death among critically ill patients in the developed world. While there is a general view that this reflects contributions from both the pathogen and the host with respect to an inappropriate inflammatory response, there is a lack of agreement as to the key immune mechanisms. This has been reflected in the diverse range of immunotherapies tested in clinical trials, often with rather marginal effects. The case has been made for a pathogenic role of excessive immunity, the so-called ?cytokine storm?, and for a role of too little immunity through immune paralysis. Apoptosis is implicated as a key mechanism in both this immune paralysis and the multi-organ failure that is a feature of severe sepsis. A number of polymorphisms have been implicated in susceptibility to sepsis, including cytokine genes, HLA class II and caspase-12. In this review we focus in particular on the role of group A streptococci in severe sepsis. Here the effect of bacterial superantigens appears to be a correlate of inflammatory activation, although the precise evolutionary role of the superantigens remains unclear.

AB  - Abstract Background Skeletal complications during or after treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been frequently reported and can cause substantial morbidity, yet their incidence is not well established. The present study assessed the incidence of fractures, osteonecrosis (ON), and bone pain during ALL treatment and compared the fracture incidence with age- and sex-specific reference data from the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Procedure Medical records of 122 ALL patients diagnosed at our institution from 1992 to 2004 were reviewed for information on fractures, ON, bone pain, and their anatomical location, risk group, phase of antileukemic therapy, and time since diagnosis. Evaluation of skeletal complications was followed up until July 2005 or the patient's death. Thirteen children were excluded as they were transferred to other institutions shortly after diagnosis. Results Skeletal complications occurred at a 5-year incidence of 32.7%. The 5-year incidence of fractures, ON, and isolated bone pain was 13.5%, 12.1%, and 12.3%, respectively. The relative rate of fractures adjusted for age and sex was 2.03 (95% confidence interval 1.15?3.57) compared to the GPRD, with greatest rates in children <5 years. Thirty ON occurred in 10 patients with a 15 times greater incidence in children >10 years than in those <5 years. Nearly all skeletal complications occurred during maintenance therapy at a median of 14.92 months (range 0.0?53.8) after diagnosis and in weight-bearing bones. Conclusions The doubled fracture rate and the high incidence of skeletal complications during the first years after diagnosis suggest the developing skeleton is very vulnerable in this period. Adolescents develop more ON whereas younger children may be more prone to fractures. Serious ?immediate effects? of chemotherapy on bone appear of great concern and should entail preventative studies in this group of patients.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: Advances in the field of cardiopulmonary resuscitation have led to an increasing number of patients initially surviving sudden cardiac arrest. Unfortunately, most of these patients do not recover from the resultant anoxic brain insult. Several animal and human trials have suggested that post-resuscitative brain hypothermia may improve neurologic recovery after cardiopulmonary arrest. Present cooling methods are slow, induce only brain surface cooling, or result in systemic hypothermia. The authors tested the hypothesis that unilateral hypothermic carotid bypass would induce bilateral brain cooling without evoking systemic hypothermia or hemodynamic instability. Methods: Anesthetized, ventilated common swine (n= 6, 24-37 kg) underwent right femoral and carotid artery bypass cannulation. Central and peripheral hemodynamic parameters were recorded every 2 minutes throughout the procedure. Thermodynamic parameters included bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral nasopharyngeal, pulmonary artery, and rectal temperatures. Hypothermic femoral?carotid bypass was accomplished by drawing blood from the right femoral artery, cooling it to 24°C, and returning it to the right carotid artery at a flow rate of 5 mL/kg/min for 30 minutes. Results: With initiation of cooling, brain temperatures dropped rapidly from baseline of 37.2°C to 30.6°C (right frontal lobe) and 33.1°C (left frontal lobe) at 30 minutes. Pulmonary artery and rectal temperatures also decreased, but never reached mild hypothermic levels (34°C). There was no significant change in any hemodynamic parameters during brain cooling. Conclusions: Femoral?carotid hypothermic bypass rapidly induced a state of selective brain hypothermia without causing systemic hypothermia or hemodynamic instability.

AB  - Abstract To overcome problems of damaged urinary tract tissues and complications of current procedures, tissue engineering (TE) techniques and stem cell (SC) research have achieved great progress. Although diversity of techniques is used, urologists should know the basics. We carried out a literature review regarding the basic principles and applications of TE and SC technologies in the genitourinary tract. We carried out MEDLINE/PubMed searches for English articles until March 2010 using a combination of the following keywords: bladder, erectile dysfunction, kidney, prostate, Peyronie's disease, stem cells, stress urinary incontinence, testis, tissue engineering, ureter, urethra and urinary tract. Retrieved abstracts were checked, and full versions of relevant articles were obtained. Scientists have achieved great advances in basic science research. This is obvious by the tremendous increase in the number of publications. We divided this review in two topics; the first discusses basic science principles of TE and SC, whereas the second part delineates current clinical applications and advances in urological literature. TE and SC applications represent an alternative resource for treating complicated urological diseases. Despite the paucity of clinical trials, the promising results of animal models and continuous work represents the hope of treating various urological disorders with this technology.

AB  - Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces adrenalitis in BALB/c mice but does not compromise adrenal function, assessed by levels of circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the response to challenge with synthetic ACTH. Levels of corticosterone increased 2 days after infection in mice of this strain, consistent with previously established interactions between mediators of acute inflammation and activation of the hypothalmus?pituitary?adrenal axis. Moreover, an adrenocortical response was critical to survival of BALB/c (but not C57BL/6) mice 3 days after infection, as pharmacologically or surgically adrenalectomized BALB/c mice died when given doses of virus up to fivefold lower than they could normally tolerate. However, death could not be prevented by the administration of soluble cytokine receptors to inhibit the action of interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The corticosteroid response did not mediate MCMV-induced thymic atrophy. As the above traits were all less evident in C57BL/6 mice, a common genetic basis is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Extracts from the seed of the African shea tree Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn have been used traditionally for the treatment of arthritic conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which benefit is conferred. This single-site, 15-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study examined a range of biomarkers in 89 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees and/or hips to determine potential modes of action of SheaFlex70TM, a triterpene-rich extract of Vitellaria paradoxa. In the group of participants with levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers in the upper quartile at baseline, there were significant decreases in inflammation and cartilage breakdown and trend level decreases in bone remodeling in the SheaFlex70TM group versus placebo between commencement and completion of the study. Inflammation marker TNF-alpha fell 23.9% vs 6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.041. Cartilage degradation marker CTX-II fell 28.7% vs an increase of 17.6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.018. This marker also showed significant falls across the entire study group, 10.6% vs an increase of 11.6%, (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.016. Osteocalcin levels fell 9.2%, p = 0.014 (treatment) vs 1.2%, ns (placebo), p = 0.096 (treatment vs placebo). These findings indicate that in patients with the highest levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers, SheaFlex70TM demonstrated multiple beneficial activities consistent with slowing the disease process.

AB  - This prospective, nonrandomized study was conducted to compare the increases in albumin and prealbumin concentrations in postoperative patients given adequate nutrition support. All surgery patients at least 18 years of age and who required parenteral nutrition were included. Of 86 patients evaluated, 16 met all criteria for study entry. Blood for albumin concentrations was drawn within 48 hours of beginning parenteral nutrition and then weekly. Blood for prealbumin concentrations was drawn within 48 hours of beginning parenteral nutrition and then twice weekly. Albumin concentrations increased from 2.00 ± 0.35 to 2.21 ± 0.42 g/dl (NS). Prealbumin concentrations increased from 11.97 ± 6.31 to 17.29 ± 8.93 mg/dl (p=0.017). All but one prealbumin concentration was in the normal range for our laboratory when parenteral nutrition was discontinued. None of the albumin concentrations were ever in the normal range. The prealbumin concentration is a better indicator than albumin of nutrition status in the postoperative patient. Since prealbumin concentrations typically rise into the normal range within a week after adequate caloric supplementation, clinicians may avoid unnecessary increases in protein-calorie intake and laboratory testing of nutrition status by using this measurement.

AB  - Abstract Osteomyelitis often causes functional impairment due to tissue destruction. This report demonstrates a novel previously unappreciated role of osteoblasts. Samples of osteomyelitic bone and bacterially challenged osteoblasts produce increased amounts of antimicrobial peptides in order to combat bacterial bone infection. An osteomyelitis mouse model confirmed the osseous induction of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, suggesting a central role in the prevention of bacterial bone infection. Antimicrobial peptides are effectors of the innate defence system and play a key role in host protection at cellular surfaces. Some of them are produced constitutively, whereas others are induced during infection. Human ?-defensins represent a major subclass of antimicrobial peptides and act as a first line of defence through their broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity. The aim of the present in-vitro and in-vivo investigations was to study the expression and regulation of human ?-defensin-2 in the case of bacterial bone infection and to analyse the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on bone-derived antimicrobial peptide expression. Samples of healthy human bone, osteomyelitic bone and cultured osteoblasts (hFOB cells) were assessed for the expression of human ?-defensin-2. Regulation of human ?-defensin-2 was studied in hFOB cells after exposure to bacterial supernatants, proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppressive drugs (glucocorticoids and methotrexate) and was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An osteomyelitis mouse model was performed to demonstrate the regulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, named murine ?-defensin-3, by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Healthy human bone and cultured osteoblasts are able to produce human ?-defensin-2 under standard conditions. Samples of infected bone produce higher levels of endogenous antibiotics, such as human ?-defensin-2, when compared with samples of healthy bone. A clear induction of human ?-defensin-2 was observed after exposure of cultured osteoblasts to Gram-positive bacteria or proinflammatory cytokines. Additional treatment with glucocorticoids or methotrexate prevented bacteria-mediated antimicrobial peptide induction in cultured osteoblasts. The osteomyelitis mouse model demonstrated transcriptional upregulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, namely murine ?-defensin-3, in bone after intraosseous contamination of the tibia. Human and murine bone have the ability to produce broad-spectrum endogenous antibiotics when challenged by micro-organisms in vitro and in vivo. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids or methotrexate, may increase the susceptibility to bone infection by decreasing antimicrobial peptide expression levels in case of microbial challenge. The induction of human ?-defensin-2 following bacterial contact suggests a central role of antimicrobial peptides in the prevention of bacterial bone infection.

AB  - Abstract We have previously demonstrated that chloroquine may evoke inflammatory responses in the central nervous system by inducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by astroglial cells. In this study, we further examined the molecular mechanism responsible for chloroquine-induced activation of NF-?B and subsequent expression of chemokines by astroglial cells. We observed that (1) chloroquine induced expression of chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL8 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human astroglial cells; (2) other lysosomotropic agents such as ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A1 had minimal effects on chemokine expression; (3) inhibition of NF-?B by MG-132 and TPCK suppressed chloroquine-induced mRNA expression of chemokines; (4) chloroquine increased the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose- and time-dependent manner by human astroglial cells, but not by monocytic/microglial cells; (5) chloroquine-induced increase of intracellular ROS level was suppressed by pre-incubation with diphenyl iodonium (DPI) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC); and (6) inhibition of chloroquine-induced ROS production by DPI or NAC suppressed chloroquine-mediated activation of NF-?B and subsequent mRNA expression of chemokines in astroglial cells. These results collectively suggest that chloroquine generates ROS, which is responsible for NF-?B activation and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines in human astroglial cells. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a common and serious complication in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the development of a PU and hospital mortality in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) in an intensive care unit (ICU). Methods A prospective cohort study was performed over two years in patients requiring MV for?≥?24 hours in a medical-surgical ICU. Primary outcome measure was hospital mortality and main independent variable was the development of a PU grade?≥?II. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox model with time-dependent covariates. Results Out of 563 patients in the study, 110 (19.5%) developed a PU. Overall hospital mortality was 48.7%. In the adjusted multivariate model, PU onset was a significant independent predictor of mortality (adjusted HR, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.003?1.65; P?=?0.047). The model also included the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment on day 3, hepatic cirrhosis and medical admission. Conclusion Within the limitations of a single-centre approach, PU development appears to be associated with an increase in mortality among patients requiring MV for 24?hours or longer.

AB  - Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a well recognized phenomenon in otologic practice with both viral and vascular etiologies being supported. However, sudden hearing loss as a complication of non-otologic surgical procedure is a seldom reported and rare phenomenon. Five cases of unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss which are time related and probably causally related to non-otologic surgery are presented. Two cases underwent open heart surgery and support previous reports of hearing loss secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Three noncardiac cases are also reviewed. None of these patients had prior otologic disease which would predispose to a sudden hearing loss, and no intraoperative or postoperative complication was specifically noted as a cause of the hearing loss. The literature is reviewed and attention is drawn to the problem. We wish to encourage further reports and to recommend early identification and treatment in those cases related to cardiopulmonary bypass.
