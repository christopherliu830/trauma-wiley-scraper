AB  - Summary.? Background:?Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and B vitamins deficiency are thought to be risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The causality and independence of those associations are still questioned. Methods:?We measured fasting serum total homocysteine, folates, and vitamin B12 levels as well as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotypes in 467 patients hospitalized with a first well-documented deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism not related to a major acquired risk factor and 467 controls matched for gender and age. Results:?Mild hyperhomocysteinemia, low serum folates, and vitamin B12 were associated with VTE independently of each other. In multivariate analysis, odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) for VTE associated with mild hyperhomocysteinemia (>15??mol?L?1), low serum folates (≤?4.9?nmol?L?1), and vitamin B12 (≤?253?pmol?L?1) were 1.48 (1.05?2.08), 3.14 (1.35?7.32) and 1.42 (1.03?1.98), respectively. An MTHFRC677T genotype was not significantly associated with VTE; OR (95% CI): 1.13 (0.70?1.81) Conclusions:?The current data provides further knowledge in the complex relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia, low vitamin levels, and VTE.

AB  - Detrimental effects of oral infections on general health have been known for almost 3000?years. Modern studies, however, have cast new light on the pathogenic mechanisms by which oral infections appear to link with morbidity and mortality. In particular, among the elderly, poor dental health seems to associate with all-cause mortality. This review aims to provide an overview of present knowledge of these issues, starting from dental bacteraemia, oral mucosal infections and problems of drug resistance and, briefly, discussing what is known about the link between oral health and some systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis and type-2 diabetes. The main conclusions are that scientific evidence is still weak on these interactions and that the elderly should be better taken into account when planning future studies. Functions of the body differ in the frail and diseased from those of the young. Consequently, novel prevention and treatment strategies should be developed and properly tested for combating oral infections in elderly populations. Specific suggestions for further research are outlined.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) treatment initiating after inflammation stage on the process of bone-tendon junction (BTJ) healing in a rabbit model. Thirty-six rabbits undergoing partial patellectomy were randomly divided into two groups: control and LIPUS. The period of initial inflammatory stage is 2 weeks. So LIPUS treatment was initiated at postoperative week 2 and continued until the patella-patellar tendon (PPT) complexes were harvested at postoperative weeks 4, 8, and 16. At each time point, the PPT complexes were harvested for qRT-PCR, histology, radiographs, synchroton radiation micro computed tomography (SR-µCT), and biomechanical testing. The qRT-PCR results showed that LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 played an anti-inflammatory role in BTJ healing. Histologically, the LIPUS group showed more advanced remodeling of the lamellar bone and marrow cavity than the control group. The area and length of the new bone in the LIPUS group were significantly greater than the control group at postoperative weeks 8 and 16. SR-µCT demonstrated that new bone formation and remodeling in the LIPUS group were more advanced than the control group. Biomechanical test results demonstrated that the failure load, ultimate strength and energy at failure were significantly higher than those of the control group. In conclusion, LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 was able to accelerate bone formation during the bone-tendon junction healing process and significantly improved the healing quality of BTJ injury. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a well recognized phenomenon in otologic practice with both viral and vascular etiologies being supported. However, sudden hearing loss as a complication of non-otologic surgical procedure is a seldom reported and rare phenomenon. Five cases of unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss which are time related and probably causally related to non-otologic surgery are presented. Two cases underwent open heart surgery and support previous reports of hearing loss secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. Three noncardiac cases are also reviewed. None of these patients had prior otologic disease which would predispose to a sudden hearing loss, and no intraoperative or postoperative complication was specifically noted as a cause of the hearing loss. The literature is reviewed and attention is drawn to the problem. We wish to encourage further reports and to recommend early identification and treatment in those cases related to cardiopulmonary bypass.

AB  - Abstract Breakdown in gastrointestinal mucosal integrity may be due to increased aggressive factors, including an excessive inflammatory response, decreased mucosal defence or a combination of the two. Our understanding of the control processes underlying these changes has rapidly expanded over the last decade and it is becoming clear that rather than being distinct elements, inflammation and repair are interrelated processes mediated by common cytokines and growth factors, with the division of factors as being a cytokine or a growth factor being somewhat artificial. The use of biological therapies, such as antibodies that cause receptor blockade or administering recombinant growth factors, has now progressed from the laboratory to the clinical arena. This review summarizes current thoughts on the use of these factors in general, but with particular emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Abstract Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used for most severe acute respiratory distress syndrome cases in specialized centers. Hemocompatibility of devices depends on the size and modification of blood contacting surfaces as well as blood flow rates. An interventional lung assist using arteriovenous perfusion of a low-resistance oxygenator without a blood pump (Novalung, Hechingen, Germany) or a miniaturized ECMO with reduced filling volume and a diagonal blood pump (Deltastream, Medos AG, Stolberg, Germany) could optimize hemocompatibility. The aim of the study was to compare hemocompatibility with conventional ECMO. Female pigs were connected to extracorporeal circulation for 24?h after lavage induced lung injury (eight per group). Activation of coagulation and immune system as well as blood cell damage was measured. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. Plasmatic coagulation was slightly activated in all groups demonstrated by increased thrombin-anti-thrombin III-complex. No clinical signs of bleeding or thromboembolism occurred. Thrombelastography revealed decreased clotting capacities after miniaturized ECMO, probably due to significantly reduced platelet count. These resulted in reduced dosage of intravenous heparin. Scanning electron microscopy of oxygenator fibers showed significantly increased binding and shape change of platelets after interventional lung assist. In all groups, hemolysis remained negligible, indicated by low plasma hemoglobin concentration. Interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentration as well as leukocyte count remained unchanged. Both devices demonstrated adequate hemocompatibility for safe clinical application, although a missing blood pump did not increase hemocompatibility. Further studies seem necessary to analyze the influence of different blood pumps on platelet drop systematically.

AB  - Abstract Miniaturized microneedle devices are being developed for painlessly targeting vaccines to the immune cell populations in skin. As skin immunization studies are generally restricted to animal models however, where skin architecture and immunity is greatly different to human, surprisingly little is known about the local human response to intradermal (ID) vaccines. Here surgically excised human skin is used to explore for the first time the complex molecular and cellular host responses to a candidate influenza vaccine comprising nanoparticulate virus-like-particles (VLPs), administered via conventional hypodermic injection or reduced scale microneedles. Responses at the molecular level are determined by microarray analysis (47,296 discrete transcripts) and validated by quantitative PCR (96 genes). Cellular response is probed through monitoring migration of dendritic cells in viable skin tissue. Gene expression mapping, ontological analysis, and qPCR reveal up-regulation of a host of genes responsible for key immunomodulatory processes and host viral response, including cell recruitment, activation, migration, and T cell interaction following both ID and microneedle injection of VLPs; the response from the microneedles being more subtle. Significant morphological and migratory changes to skin dendritic cells are also apparent following microneedle VLP delivery. This is the first study displaying the global, multifaceted immunological events that occur at the site of vaccine deposition in human skin and will subsequently influence the degree and nature of innate and adaptive immune responses. An increased understanding of the detailed similarities and differences in response against antigen administered via different delivery modalities will inform the development of improved vaccines and vaccine delivery systems.

AB  - Background: This double-blinded study aimed at evaluating and comparing the effects of magnesium and lidocaine on pain, analgesic requirements, bowel function, and quality of sleep in patients undergoing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Methods: Patients were randomized into three groups (n=40 each). Group M received magnesium sulfate 50?mg/kg intravenously (i.v.), followed by 25?mg/kg/h i.v., group L received lidocaine 2?mg/kg i.v., followed by 2?mg/kg/h i.v., and group P received saline i.v. Bolus doses were given over 15?min before induction of anesthesia, followed by an i.v. infusion through the end of surgery. Intraoperative fentanyl consumption and averaged end-tidal sevoflurane concentration were recorded. Abdominal and shoulder pain were evaluated up to 24?h using a visual analog scale (VAS). Morphine consumption was recorded at 2 and 24?h, together with quality of sleep and time of first flatus. Results: Lidocaine or magnesium reduced anesthetic requirements (P<0.01), pain scores (P<0.05), and morphine consumption (P<0.001) relative to the control group. Lidocaine resulted in lower morphine consumption at 2?h [4.9 ± 2.3 vs. 6.8 ± 2.8 (P<0.05)] and lower abdominal VAS scores compared with magnesium (1.8 ± 0.8 vs. 3.2 ± 0.9, 2.2 ± 1 vs. 3.6 ± 1.6, and 2.1 ± 1.4 vs. 3.3 ± 1.9) at 2, 6, and 12?h, respectively (P<0.05). Lidocaine was associated with earlier return of bowel function and magnesium was associated with better sleep quality (P<0.05). Conclusion: I.v. lidocaine and magnesium improved post-operative analgesia and reduced intraoperative and post-operative opioid requirements in patients undergoing LC. The improvement of quality of recovery might facilitate rapid hospital discharge.

AB  - Summary Orthobiologics have emerged as new treatment options in human and animal athletes. Musculoskeletal disorders such as tendinopathies, desmopathies, and osteoarthritis are common in competition and working dogs because of stresses induced by their repetitive activities. Several therapies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, shockwave therapy, and surgery have been used to treat these disorders, but variable levels of evidence and success have been reported. Tendon and ligament healing potential is limited, especially in chronic injuries, which are commonly seen in athletes. Therefore, novel regenerative treatment approaches are of great interest in sports medicine. There are two goals of this chapter. First, the definitions and proposed mechanisms of action for different orthobiologics are reviewed; second, the clinical applications and the evidence for efficacy of these novel treatments are discussed. The chapter focuses on two major topics. Platelet-rich plasma is reviewed in detail, as this is the most commonly used orthobiologic in veterinary medicine. Stem cell applications are also presented, focusing on musculoskeletal and spinal injuries. The chapter is not intended to provide a thorough review of the literature on these topics, but aims to introduce the sports medicine and rehabilitation therapist to the growing area of regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract Since NO production by NOS-2 made by astrocytes activated by proinflammatory cytokines contributes to the killing of neurons in variously damaged human brains, knowing the mechanisms responsible for NOS-2 expression should contribute to developing effective therapeutics. The expression and activation of NOS-2 in normal adult human cerebral cortical astrocytes treated with three proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1?, TNF-α, and IFN-?, are driven by two separable mechanisms. NOS-2 expression requires a burst of p38 MAPK activity, while the activation of the resulting enzyme protein requires MEK/ERK-dependent BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin) synthesis between 24 and 24.5 h after adding the cytokines to the culture medium. Here we show that NOS-2 expression in the activated astrocytes requires that the culture medium contain 1.8 mM Ca2+, but it is unaffected by inhibiting calcium-sensing receptors (CASRs) with NPS 89636. However, NOS-2 activation is inhibited by NPS 89626 during the MEK/ERK-dependent stage between 24 and 24.5 h after adding the cytokines, and this inhibition can be overridden by exogenous BH4. Therefore, NOS-2 expression and the subsequent BH4-dependent NOS-2-activation in human astrocytes need 1.8 mM Ca2+ to be in the culture medium, while NOS-2 activation also needs functional CASRs between 24 and 24.5 h after cytokine addition. These findings raise the possibility that calcilytic drugs prevent NO-induced damage and death of human neurons. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background The construct of ?meaning in life? (MiL) has raised the interest of clinicians working in psycho-oncology and end-of-life care. It has become a topic of scientific investigation where diverse assessment approaches have been applied. Aims: We present a comprehensive systematic review of existing MiL assessment instruments. Methods Electronic searches of articles published in English peer-reviewed journals were performed in Psycinfo, Medline, Embase and Cinahl. Instruments are appraised with regard to ten measurement properties. Results In total, 59 nomothetic and idiographic MiL instruments were identified. Most instruments were developed in North America and meet basic psychometric criteria. They assess presence of and search for MiL, crisis and sources of MiL, meaning making, meaningful activity, MiL in the context of illness, breadth, depth, and other structural indicators. These aspects are largely consistent with existing MiL definitions. Nine out of 59 instruments included cancer populations in test development. Conclusions This overview of available instruments underscores the complexity of the construct and might assist researchers to select an appropriate instrument for their research needs. Finally, it points to the need for more integrative theorizing and research on MiL. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
