AB  - Abstract Background The construct of ?meaning in life? (MiL) has raised the interest of clinicians working in psycho-oncology and end-of-life care. It has become a topic of scientific investigation where diverse assessment approaches have been applied. Aims: We present a comprehensive systematic review of existing MiL assessment instruments. Methods Electronic searches of articles published in English peer-reviewed journals were performed in Psycinfo, Medline, Embase and Cinahl. Instruments are appraised with regard to ten measurement properties. Results In total, 59 nomothetic and idiographic MiL instruments were identified. Most instruments were developed in North America and meet basic psychometric criteria. They assess presence of and search for MiL, crisis and sources of MiL, meaning making, meaningful activity, MiL in the context of illness, breadth, depth, and other structural indicators. These aspects are largely consistent with existing MiL definitions. Nine out of 59 instruments included cancer populations in test development. Conclusions This overview of available instruments underscores the complexity of the construct and might assist researchers to select an appropriate instrument for their research needs. Finally, it points to the need for more integrative theorizing and research on MiL. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Red blood cells (RBCs) degrade progressively during the weeks of refrigerated storage. No universally accepted definition of ?fresh? or ?old? RBCs exists. While practices vary from country to country, preservative solutions permitting shelf life as long as 7 weeks have been licenced. Transfusion of stored RBCs, particularly those at the end of the approved shelf life, has been implicated in adverse clinical outcomes. The results of observational analyses, animal models and studies in volunteers have proved provocative, controversial and contradictory. A recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) in premature infants exemplifies the difficulties with moderately sized clinical studies. Several other RCTs are in progress. The effect of RBC storage may well vary according to the clinical setting. Resolution of the importance of the storage lesion may require large pragmatic clinical trials. In the meantime, institutions involved in blood collection and transfusion should explore strategies that assure blood availability, while limiting the use of the oldest RBCs currently approved by regulation.

AB  - Abstract A positive stance towards nutrition support of the child with cancer assures potential for normal growth, development, and quality of life during extended oncologic treatment. Data from recent studies of children with cancer (advanced neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor) demonstrate the importance of integrating nutrition staging, assessment, and support into treatment protocols. Patients with solid tumors and lymphomas who are malnourished at diagnosis have a poor outcome when compared to nourished counterparts. Enteral nutrition (intensive nutrition counseling and favorite, nutritious foods) is effective in low nutritional risk groups but ineffective in preventing or reversing protein-energy malnutrition in high nutritional risk groups. For high-risk groups, central parenteral nutrition is a relatively short-term, but important, support measure which allows children to grow despite extended periods of intense oncologic treatment. The patient's nutritional course may affect bone marrow suppression and the ability to tolerate aggressive chemotherapeutic treatment. Although treatment tolerance may be improved with nutrition support, adequacy of primary oncologic treatment outweighs other supportive factors as a determinant of ultimate survival.

AB  - Summary According to transplant registries, grafts from elderly donors have lower survival rates. During 1999?2005, we evaluated the outcomes of 89 patients who received a liver from a donor aged ≥?60?years and managed with the low liver-damage strategy (LLDS), based on the preoperative donor liver biopsy and the shortest possible ischemia time (group D?≥?60-LLDS). Group D ≥?60-LLDS was compared with 198 matched recipients, whose grafts were not managed with this strategy (89 donors?<?60?years, group D?<?60-no-LLDS and 89 donors aged ≥60?years, group D?≥?60-no-LLDS). In the donors proposed from the age group of ≥60?years, the number of donors rejected decreased during the study period and the LLDS was found to be responsible for this in a significant manner (47% vs. 60%, respectively P?<?0.01). Among the recipients transplanted, the clinical features (age, gender, viral infection, child and model for end-stage liver disease score) were comparable among groups, but group D ≥?60-LLDS had a lower mean ischemia time: 415?±?106?min vs. 465?±?111 (D?<?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05 and vs. 476?±?94 (D?≥?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05. After a median follow-up of 3?years, the 1- and 3-year graft survival rates of group D ≥?60-LLDS (84% and 76%) were comparable with group D <?60-no-LLDS (89% and 76%) and were significantly higher than group D ≥?60-no-LLDS (71% and 54%), P?<?0.005. In conclusion, the LLDS optimized the use of livers from elderly donors.

AB  - Aims and objectives To assess changes in perceptions of confidence and preparedness for practice of preregistration nursing students before and after the introduction of a capstone subject, and factors associated with perceptions of preparedness. Background Preregistration nursing student ?readiness? or ?preparedness? for practice has been highlighted in the literature in recent years, along with employer concerns that university graduate nurses are not work ready. Few studies have examined Australian preregistration nursing students' perceptions of preparedness for clinical practice following their final clinical placement or assessed whether preregistration student nurses' perceptions of preparedness change as the result of undertaking a capstone subject. Design A capstone subject was introduced at a regional northern Australian university in 2013. Perceptions of preparedness were assessed in two different cohorts of final year nursing students; one of which undertook a capstone subject. Methods Two separate cohorts of third year nursing students were surveyed regarding their perceptions of preparedness for practice at the conclusion of their final 240 hour clinical placement. The 2012 cohort did not experience a capstone subject, whereas the 2013 cohort were the first nursing students to experience the new capstone subject. Results Both cohorts were uncomfortable performing invasive procedures and reported low levels of confidence in the area of professional identity. An overall trend of decreasing confidence as patient assignment size increased was observed for both cohorts, and higher confidence was associated with previous health care experience. Perceptions of preparedness for practice did not increase significantly following the introduction of a capstone subject. Conclusions Although Australian undergraduate nursing student report feeling prepared for practice there are areas of knowledge, skills and patient care in which confidence is low. The results of this study highlight the importance of experience in building confidence and competence. Relevance to clinical practice This study highlights that while final year nursing students report feeling prepared for practice there are areas where additional support can be provided. It is recommended that nurse educators and health care facilities tailor their programs to provide support focused on the areas highlighted by this study.

AB  - Cartilage loss is irreversible, and to date, no effective pharmacotherapies are available to protect or regenerate cartilage. Quantitative prestructural/compositional MR imaging techniques have been developed to characterize the cartilage matrix quality at a stage where abnormal findings are early and potentially reversible, allowing intervention to halt disease progression. The goal of this article is to critically review currently available technologies, present the basic concept behind these techniques, but also to investigate their suitability as imaging biomarkers including their validity, reproducibility, risk prediction and monitoring of therapy. Moreover, we highlighted important clinical applications. This review article focuses on the currently most relevant and clinically applicable technologies, such as T2 mapping, T2*, T1?, delayed gadolinium enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC), sodium imaging and glycosaminoglycan chemical exchange saturation transfer (gagCEST). To date, most information is available for T2 and T1? mapping. dGEMRIC has also been used in multiple clinical studies, although it requires Gd contrast administration. Sodium imaging and gagCEST are promising technologies but are dependent on high field strength and sophisticated software and hardware. Level of Evidence: 5 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2017;45:949?965

AB  - Objective To evaluate the association between thoracic kyphosis and physical function. Design Prospective cohort. Setting Framingham, Massachusetts. Participants Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation cohort members who had computed tomography (CT) performed between 2002 and 2005 and physical function assessed a mean 3.4 years later (N = 1,100; mean age 61 ± 8, range 50?85). Measurements Thoracic kyphosis (Cobb angle, T4-T12) was measured in degrees using supine CT scout images. Participants were categorized according to Cobb angle to compare those in the highest quartile (Q4, most-severe kyphosis) with those in the lowest quartiles (Q1-Q3). Quick walking speed (m/s), chair-stand time (seconds), grip strength (kg), and self-reported impairments were assessed using standardized procedures. Analyses were adjusted for age, height, weight, smoking, follow-up time, vertebral fractures, and prevalent spinal degeneration. Results Thoracic kyphosis was not associated with physical function in women or men, and these results were consistent in those younger than 65 and those aged 65 and older. For example, walking speed was similar in adults younger than 65 with and without severe kyphosis (women, Q4: 1.38 m/s, Q1-Q3: 1.40 m/s, P = .69; men, Q4: 1.65 m/s, Q1-Q3: 1.60 m/s; P = .39). Conclusion In healthy relatively high-functioning women and men, kyphosis severity was not associated with subsequent physical function. Individuals at risk of functional decline cannot be targeted based on supine CT thoracic curvature measures alone.

AB  - Abstract Background Handgrip strength (HGS) is used to identify individuals with low muscle strength (dynapenia). The influence of the number of attempts on maximal HGS is not yet known and may differ depending on age and health status. This study aimed to assess how many attempts of HGS are required to obtain maximal HGS. Methods Three cohorts (939 individuals) differing in age and health status were included. HGS was assessed three times and explored as continuous and dichotomous variable. Paired t-test, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland?Altman analysis were used to test reproducibility of HGS. The number of individuals with misclassified dynapenia at attempts 1 and 2 with respect to attempt 3 were assessed. Results Results showed the same pattern in all three cohorts. Maximal HGS at attempts 1 and 2 was higher than at attempt 3 on population level (P < 0.001 for all three cohorts). ICC values between all attempts were above 0.8, indicating moderate to high reproducibility. Bland?Altman analysis showed that 41.0 to 58.9% of individuals had the highest HGS at attempt 2 and 12.4 to 37.2% at attempt 3. The percentage of individuals with a maximal HGS above the gender-specific cut-off value at attempt 3 compared with attempts 1 and 2 ranged from 0 to 50.0%, with a higher percentage of misclassification in middle-aged and older populations. Conclusions Maximal HGS is dependent on the number of attempts, independent of age and health status. To assess maximal HGS, at least three attempts are needed if HGS is considered to be a continuous variable. If HGS is considered as a discrete variable to assess dynapenia, two attempts are sufficient to assess dynapenia in younger populations. Misclassification should be taken into account in middle-aged and older populations.

AB  - Scand J Caring Sci; 2010; 24; 392?403 ? Adapting the Individualized Care Scale for cross-cultural comparison Rationale:? Cross-cultural comparative studies using reliable and valid instruments can increase awareness of the differences and similarities between health worker?s ability to respond to patients? individual needs within different health systems. This will enable a better understanding of cultural perspectives in individualized nursing care. Aim:? To describe the translation and adaptation process of the Individualized Care Scale (ICS) and examine its reliability and validity in a cross-cultural study. Design:? A cross-sectional comparative study. Settings:? Twenty-seven orthopaedic and trauma in-patient units at 14 hospitals in 5 countries. Participants:? A total of 1126 patients were included in the study: Finland (n?=?425), Greece (n?=?315), Sweden (n?=?218), UK (n?=?135) and USA (n?=?33). Methods:? A systematic forward- and back-translation procedure using bilingual techniques, a committee approach, pretest techniques and pilot testing were used with a convenience sample to produce a valid ICS for each participating group. Psychometric evaluation of the adapted ICS was based on means, SD, missing data analysis, Cronbach?s alpha coefficients and average inter-item correlations. Construct validity was examined using sub-scale correlations to total scales and principal components analysis. Results:? The use of the range of options and the sub-scale mean scores ranging from 2.72 to 4.30 demonstrated the sensitivity of the scale. Cronbach?s alpha coefficients (0.77?0.97) and average inter-item correlations (0.37?0.77) were acceptable. The sub-scale correlations to total scales were high (0.83?0.97). The underlying theoretical construct of the ICS was demonstrated by the explained variances ranging from 58% to 79%. Conclusions:? The ICS shows promise as a tool for evaluating individualized care in European cultures. The international expansion of an existing instrument developed for one country facilitates comparative studies across countries. There is a need to further test the construct validity and appropriateness of the ICS in different settings in European and nonwestern cultures.

AB  - Summary Background Previous investigation on the duration of untreated illness (DUI) in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) revealed a different latency to first antidepressant treatment, with adverse consequences in terms of outcome for individuals with a longer DUI. Recent reports, moreover, documented a reduced DUI, as observed with the passage of time, in patients with different psychiatric disorders. Hence, the present study was aimed to assess DUI and related variables in a sample of Italian patients with MDD as well as to investigate potential differences in subjects with onset before and after 2000. Methods An overall sample of 188 patients with MDD was assessed through a specific questionnaire investigating DUI and other variables related to the psychopathological onset and latency to first antidepressant treatment, after dividing them in two different subgroups on the basis of their epoch of onset. Results The whole sample showed a mean DUI of approximately 4.5 years, with patients with more recent onset showing a significantly shorter latency to treatment compared with the other group (27.1±42.6 vs 75.8±105.2 months, P<.05). Other significant differences emerged between the two subgroups, in terms of rates of onset-related stressful events and benzodiazepine prescription, respectively, higher and lower in patients with more recent onset. Conclusions Our findings indicate a significant DUI reduction in MDD patients whose onset occurred after vs before 2000, along with other relevant differences in terms of onset-related correlates and first pharmacotherapy. Further studies with larger samples are warranted to confirm the present findings in Italy and other countries.

AB  - Summary The lagomorphs include the hares/rabbits (family Leporidae) and the pikas (Ochotonidae) which occupy numerous habitats throughout North America. This chapter focuses on cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.) since they are more widely distributed than jackrabbits/hares and pikas and are more likely to be encountered and brought in for rehabilitation. The 17 species of cottontails are widely distributed throughout the New World. In general, they utilize disturbed, early successional, or shrub-dominated habitats with abundant forage and dense understory cover. Wild rabbits must show behavioral fitness prior to release back into the Wild. In particular, juvenile rabbits should be appropriately wary of predators, be able to recognize and forage effectively for natural food items, and interact normally with conspecifics. The chapter also presents much more information about captive care and medical/surgical concerns in cottontails than for other North American lagomorphs.
