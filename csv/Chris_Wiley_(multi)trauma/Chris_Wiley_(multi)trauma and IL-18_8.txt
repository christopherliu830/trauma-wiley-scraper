AB  - The mechanisms which lead to secondary brain damage following transient ischaemia are incompletely defined. As discussed in this hypothesis article, the events which lead to such damage could encompass (a) a perturbed membrane handling of calcium, leading to a slow, gradual increase in the free cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i), with subsequent calcium overload of mitochondria, (b) a sustained reduction of protein synthesis which, in the long run, deprives cells of enzymes or trophic factors essential to their survival, or (c) the initiation of an inherent program for cell death. Results obtained in ischaemia of brief to intermediate duration demonstrate that the ultimate cell death is heralded by a reduction in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. However, the results fail to demonstrate whether or not such a reduction precedes deterioration of the bioenergetic state which then precipitates cell death. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has recently been shown to dramatically improve the delayed CA1 damage following transient forebrain ischaemia. Since CsA is known to block a deleterious permeability transition (PT) in mitochondria from several tissues in response to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, the results on CsA effects in forebrain ischaemia support a mitochondrial origin for the delayed cell death. Furthermore, comparisons with the effects of CsA and α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in thymocytes and other cells undergoing programmed cell death suggest that delayed neuronal damage occurs by a sequence of events akin to those leading to apoptotic cell death. However, whether cell death is apoptotic or necrotic may depend on the severity of the insult (and its duration). We speculate that the initial ischaemic transient leads to gradual mitochondrial calcium overload, the latter triggering a PT, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Since similar results have been obtained in normoglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemia of intermediate duration, and in animals with preischaemic hyperglycaemia, it seems likely that both increased ischaemia duration and hyperglycaemia accelerate damage to mitochondria in the reperfusion period. Recent results obtained in transient focal ischaemia of 2 h duration demonstrate that the free radical spin trap PBN reduces infarct size, even when given 1 or 3 h after the start of reperfusion, thus providing a second window of therapeutic possibility. A major effect of the drug is exerted on the recovery of energy metabolism of the tissue since it reduces a secondary deterioration in the bioenergetic state, occurring after 2?4 h of reperfusion. At least in part, the spin trap may exert its effect by reducing microvascular dysfunction caused by oedema and to adhesion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, which give rise to an inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, lipid mediators, or free radicals. This contention is supported by the reduction in focal ischaemic damage by antibodies to adhesion molecules for PMNs. However, it has now been found that the secondary deterioration of the bioenergetic state of core and penumbral tissues are mirrored by corresponding changes in the respiratory functions of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that, also in this type of ischaemia, the mitochondria suffer secondary damage. It is conceivable that a significant fraction of malfunctioning mitochondria emanate from microvascular tissue, explaining why antibodies to adhesion molecules mitigate the ischaemic lesions.

AB  - Summary Background Facial wrinkles are key signs of aging which affect one's quality of life and psychological well-being. Absorbable wedge-shaped polydioxanone (PDO) sutures are popular in the esthetic clinics of Korea and may be a treatment option for static wrinkles on the upper face. Objective To describe a novel technique applicable to deep static wrinkles on the upper face and to assess its safety and efficacy. Patients and Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on the static wrinkle cases which were treated with folded, wedge-shaped PDO threads. A total of 33 Korean patients with glabellar and forehead wrinkles were included. All participants underwent a single treatment session. The results were assessed objectively using serial photography and subjectively based on the patients' satisfaction scores. Complications were also recorded. Results Our patients displayed moderate (15.2%), severe (39.4%), and very severe (45.4%) static wrinkles at baseline. The majority of patients (81.8%) considered the results satisfactory. Consensus ratings by two independent dermatologists showed that the objective outcomes at 2-month follow-up were very much improved (30.3%), much improved (30.3%), and improved (24.2%). The incidence of complications was low, and the complications were minor. Conclusion Wedge-shaped PDO sutures in a folded configuration (?solid fillers?) are a promising treatment option for deep static wrinkles on the upper face. They may be applied as an adjunct, or as an alternative to conventional therapies such as botulinum toxin and soft tissue filler injection.

AB  - Abstract ?? Biochemistry of chondrotin sulphate ?? Mechanism of action of chondroitin sulphate -? Effect of chondroitin sulphate on the chondrocyte -? Effect of chondroitin sulphate on the synovial membrane -? Effect of chondroitin sulphate on subchondral bone ?? Human use of chondroitin sulphate -? Chondrotin sulphate in osteoarthritis -? Chondrotin sulphate in psoriasis -? Chondrotin sulphate in atherosclerosis -? Chondroitin sulphate in IBD -? Chondroitin sulphate in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) -? Other autoimmune diseases that may benefit from chondroitin sulphate ?? Conclusions Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is a natural glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix and is formed by the 1?3 linkage of D-glucuronic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine. In chondrocytes, CS diminishes interleukin-1 p (IL-1p)-induced increases in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and decreases nuclear factor-KB (NF-kB) nuclear translocation and as a consequence, reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 p and TNF-a, and pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2). The mechanism of action of CS explains its beneficial effect on the cartilage, synovial membrane and subchondral bone. On the other hand, in vivo, CS given orally prevents hepatic NF-kB nuclear translocation, suggesting that systemic CS may elicit an anti-inflammatory effect in many tissues besides the articulation. There is preliminary evidence showing that in human beings, CS may be of benefit in other diseases where inflammation is an essential marker, such as psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The review of the literature suggest that CS might also be of interest for the treatment of other diseases with an inflammatory and/or autoimmune character, such as inflammatory bowel disease, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system and stroke, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Summary The description of highly exposed individuals who remain seronegative (HESN) despite repeated exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 has heightened interest in identifying potential mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance. HIV-specific humoral and T cell-mediated responses have been identified routinely in HESN subjects, although it remains unknown if these responses are a definitive cause of protection or merely a marker for exposure. Approximately half of HESN lack any detectible HIV-specific adaptive immune responses, suggesting that other mechanisms of protection from HIV-1 infection also probably exist. In support of the innate immune response as a mechanism of resistance, increased natural killer (NK) cell activity has been correlated with protection from infection in several high-risk cohorts of HESN subjects, including intravenous drug users, HIV-1 discordant couples and perinatally exposed infants. Inheritance of protective NK KIR3DL1high and KIR3DS1 receptor alleles have also been observed to be over-represented in a high-risk cohort of HESN intravenous drug users and HESN partners of HIV-1-infected subjects. Other intrinsic mechanisms of innate immune protection correlated with resistance in HESN subjects include heightened dendritic cell responses and increased secretion of anti-viral factors such as ?-chemokines, small anti-viral factors and defensins. This review will highlight the most current evidence in HESN subjects supporting the role of epithelial microenvironment and the innate immune system in sustaining resistance against HIV-1 infection. We will argue that as a front-line defence the innate immune response determines the threshold of infectivity that HIV-1 must overcome to establish a productive infection.

AB  - New findings ?? What is the topic of this review? This review discusses the regulation of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene and how it is uniquely set up to respond to stress signals in skeletal muscle. We propose that skeletal muscle is a ?stress sensor? that responds by releasing highly active endocrine and paracrine proteins, such as IL-6. ?? What advances does this highlight? Recent discoveries on the regulation of the IL-6 gene in various stress exposures have resulted in the emergence of a new potential role for skeletal muscle in life-threatening stress conditions. Understanding the relationship between IL-6 secretion and stress may provide new insights into normal adaptive responses to disease, deconditioning, inflammation and ageing. Skeletal muscle has been identified as an endocrine organ owing to its capacity to produce and secrete a variety of cytokines (myokines) and other proteins. To date, myokines have primarily been studied in response to exercise or metabolic challenges; however, numerous observations suggest that skeletal muscle may also release myokines in response to certain categories of internal or external stress exposure. Internal stress signals include oxidative or nitrosative stress, damaged or unfolded proteins, hyperthermia or energy imbalance. External stress signals, which act as indicators of organismal stress or injury in other cells, employ mediators such as catecholamines, endotoxin, alarmins, ATP and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1?. External stress signals generally induce cellular responses through membrane receptor systems. In this review, we focus on the regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a prototypical stress response myokine and highlight evidence that IL-6 gene regulation in muscle is inherently organized to respond to a wide variety of internal and external stressors. Given that IL-6 can initiate protective, anti-inflammatory or restorative processes throughout the organism during life-threatening conditions, we present the argument that skeletal muscle has a physiological function as a sensor and responder to stress. Furthermore, we hypothesize that it may comprise a fundamental component of the organism's acute stress response.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the often fatal sequelae of a broad range of precipitating conditions. Despite decades of intensive research and clinical trials there remain no therapies in routine clinical practice that target the dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response that characterises ARDS. Neutrophils play a central role in the initiation, propagation and resolution of this complex inflammatory environment by migrating into the lung and executing a variety of pro-inflammatory functions. These include degranulation with liberation of bactericidal proteins, release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species as well as production of neutrophil extracellular traps. Although these functions are advantageous in clearing bacterial infection, the consequence of associated tissue damage, the contribution to worsening acute inflammation and prolonged neutrophil lifespan at sites of inflammation are deleterious. In this review, the importance of the neutrophil will be considered, together with discussion of recent advances in understanding neutrophil function and the factors that influence them throughout the phases of inflammation in ARDS. From a better understanding of neutrophils in this context, potential therapeutic targets are identified and discussed. ? 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Though first introduced more than 130 years ago, the concept of stress diabetes or stress hyperglycemia has gained tremendous attention in recent years in view of the landmark article by van den Berghe and colleagues in 2001. As opposed to earlier work that suggested that hyperglycemia in the acute clinical setting may be beneficial, it now appears that lower glucose levels are associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms behind the improved outcomes are numerous and seem to be tied to the inflammatory process. Both lower glucose values and insulin therapy seem to be anti-inflammatory, whereas hyperglycemia increases the proinflammatory process and negatively affects the innate immune system. Despite the numerous approaches to achieve normoglycemia described in the literature, only modest success has been achieved. Understanding the pathophysiology driving stress hyperglycemia?the stress response and modulation of the inflammatory process?seems to be the key to improving the care of the most critically ill and injured patients.

AB  - Summary All diseases, including neurological diseases, can be broadly defined as homeostatic failures. Neuroglial cells are a major component of pathogenesis of neurological diseases. The function of neuroglia is neuroprotection. In neurological diseases, glia attempt to maintain tissue and cellular homeostasis. Reactive astrogliosis can be defined as a constitutive, graded, multi-stage and evolutionary conserved defensive astroglial reaction. It can be classified according to (a) morphological appearances, and (b) severity. This chapter focuses on Wallerian degeneration which is currently used to describe axonal degeneration in both CNS and PNS. Wallerian degeneration is a specialised active process that involves activation of localised signals in both axons and surrounding glial cells. The chapter dicusses excitotoxic vulnerability of oligodendrocytes. The main function of microglia is to detect insults to the CNS and to mount a defensive response, the activation of microglia. The activated microglia can change the repertoire and levels of expression of numerous receptors.
