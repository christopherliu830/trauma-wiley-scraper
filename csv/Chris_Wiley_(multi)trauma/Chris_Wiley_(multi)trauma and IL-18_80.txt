AB  - Summary The lagomorphs include the hares/rabbits (family Leporidae) and the pikas (Ochotonidae) which occupy numerous habitats throughout North America. This chapter focuses on cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.) since they are more widely distributed than jackrabbits/hares and pikas and are more likely to be encountered and brought in for rehabilitation. The 17 species of cottontails are widely distributed throughout the New World. In general, they utilize disturbed, early successional, or shrub-dominated habitats with abundant forage and dense understory cover. Wild rabbits must show behavioral fitness prior to release back into the Wild. In particular, juvenile rabbits should be appropriately wary of predators, be able to recognize and forage effectively for natural food items, and interact normally with conspecifics. The chapter also presents much more information about captive care and medical/surgical concerns in cottontails than for other North American lagomorphs.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of ezetimibe/simvastatin (EZE/SIMVA) tablet and SIMVA monotherapy. This was an extension study of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. Protocol-compliant patients who completed the 12-week base study were eligible to enter a randomised, double-blind, 14-week extension study and were administered 1 of 8 daily treatments: EZE/SIMVA 10/10-, 10/20-, 10/40- or 10/80-mg, or SIMVA 10-, 20-, 40- or 80-mg. Patients receiving these treatments during the base study remained on the same treatment in the extension. Patients administered placebo or EZE 10-mg monotherapy during the base study were re-randomised to EZE/SIMVA 10/10?mg or SIMVA 80?mg. The primary analysis was mean per cent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline to extension study end-point. Mean changes from baseline in LDL-C of ?38.8% and ?53.7% were observed for pooled SIMVA and pooled EZE/SIMVA respectively. The between treatment difference of ?14.9% (95% confidence interval: ?16.4, ?13.3) was statistically significant (p?<?0.001). The incremental LDL-C lowering effect of EZE/SIMVA compared with the corresponding dose of SIMVA alone was consistent across the dose range (p?<?0.001 for each between-group comparison). More patients receiving EZE/SIMVA than SIMVA achieved LDL-C concentrations <?100?mg/dl and <?70?mg/dl (p?<?0.001 for both goals). EZE/SIMVA was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to SIMVA monotherapy. There were no significant between-group differences in the incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver transaminase or creatine kinase levels. In conclusion, EZE/SIMVA had a comparable safety and tolerability profile and was more efficacious than SIMVA monotherapy for up to 6?months.

AB  - Summary Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the equine stifle is currently one of the most challenging anatomical locations on the horse to image. Limitations in scanner design and the unique anatomy of the horse have made imaging of this region difficult in the best of circumstances. Imaging of the stifle with MRI should be considered when a horse's lameness has been localized to the stifle. Disruption of the medial meniscus is readily visible with MRI. Osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) is the most common irregularity identified to date in equine MRI of the stifle. This is much more readily visible on MRI compared with traditional radiography. MRI allows the accurate imaging of previously unidentified bone marrow oedema. Routine imaging techniques such as radiography and ultrasound are unable to identify this pathological process. Cartilage erosions and damage not related to OCD fragmentation is readily visible using MRI evaluation.

AB  - Use of very old donors in liver transplantation (LT) is controversial because advanced donor age is associated with a higher risk for graft dysfunction and worse long-term results, especially for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive recipients. This was a retrospective, single-center review of primary, ABO-compatible LT performed between 2001 and 2010. Recipients were stratified in four groups based on donor age (<60 years; 60?69 years; 70?79 years and ≥80 years) and their outcomes were compared. A total of 842 patients were included: 348 (41.3%) with donors <60 years; 176 (20.9%) with donors 60?69 years; 233 (27.7%) with donors 70?79 years and 85 (10.1%) with donors ≥80 years. There was no difference across groups in terms of early (≤30 days) graft loss, and graft survival at 1 and 5 years was 90.5% and 78.6% for grafts <60 years; 88.6% and 81.3% for grafts 60?69 years; 87.6% and 75.1% for grafts 70?79 years and 84.7% and 77.1% for grafts ≥80 years (p?=?0.065). In the group ≥80 years, the 5-year graft survival was lower for HCV-positive versus HCV-negative recipients (62.4% vs. 85.6%, p?=?0.034). Based on our experience, grafts from donors ≥80 years may provide favorable results but require appropriate selection and allocation policies.

AB  - Abstract Endoneurial macrophages are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathies. Historically, the macrophage response in neuropathies is believed to be of hematogenous origin. However, recent studies could demonstrate an intrinsic generation of the early macrophage response by resident endoneurial macrophages after traumatic nerve injury and in a model of hereditary neuropathy. We hypothesized that the local macrophage response might suffice to generate an appropriate macrophage response in mild neuropathies, supplemented by infiltrating macrophages only in severe nerve pathology. To clarify this assumption, we investigated the macrophage response in acrylamide-induced neuropathy as a model of a slowly progressive neuropathy with a defined onset. We induced the neuropathy in bone marrow chimeric mice carrying green fluorescent protein transgenic bone marrow, allowing the differentiation of resident (GFP?) and invading hematogenous endoneurial (GFP+) macrophages. Quantification of GFP? and GFP+ endoneurial macrophages in the sciatic nerve revealed an increase only of resident macrophages in proximal parts, whereas in distal parts a minor additional influx of hematogenous macrophages was observed. The immunohistochemical profile of GFP? and GFP+ macrophages was similar but distal GFP? macrophages were differentially activated than their GFP+ counterparts. Characterization of CCR2-deficient mice revealed a function for this chemokine system in attracting hematogenous macrophages but not in generating the intrinsic macrophage response. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of resident macrophages in acrylamide-induced neuropathy. Resident endoneurial macrophages intrinsically generate the macrophage response in this slowly progressive neuropathy, which only becomes supplemented by hematogenous macrophages in distal areas of more pronounced damage. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Leprosy or Hansen's disease is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) or Mycobacterium lepromatosis (M. lepromatosis). In Europe, most of the leprosy cases are imported. However, occasionally a case is diagnosed in one of the old endemic foci. Leprosy is often not suspected because it is no longer emphasized in the medical curricula. Attention shifted from leprosy to tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus infections in the late 20th century, whereby the WHO leprosy programme was toned down in the conviction that leprosy was all but eliminated. The result of unawareness is a harmful doctor's delay. Material and methods This paper focusses on clinical diagnosis, complications and treatment based on literature and experience. Results It mentions the value of laboratory tests in classification, follow-up and detection of relapses. It discusses the etiopathology. Conclusion This is a position statement.

AB  - Abstract The effect of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands on free radical production was investigated in primary cultures of rat brain astrocytes and neurons as well as in BV-2 microglial cell lines using the fluorescent dye dichlorofluorescein-diacetate. Free radical production was measured at 2, 30, 60 and 120?min of treatment with the PBR ligands 1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195), 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864) and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) (all at 10?nm). In astrocytes, all ligands showed a significant increase in free radical production at 2?min. The increase was short-lived with PK11195, whereas with Ro5-4864 it persisted for at least 2?h. PpIX caused an increase at 2 and 30?min, but not at 2?h. Similar results were observed in microglial cells. In neurons, PK11195 and PpIX showed an increase in free radical production only at 2?min; Ro5-4864 had no effect. The central-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand, clonazepam, was ineffective in eliciting free radical production in all cell types. As the PBR may be a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, and free radical production may occur following induction of the MPT, we further investigated whether cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of the MPT, could prevent free radical formation by PBR ligands. CsA (1?µm) completely blocked free radical production following treatment with PK11195 and Ro5-4864 in all cell types. CsA was also effective in blocking free radical production in astrocytes following PpIX treatment, but it failed to do so in neurons and microglia. Our results indicate that exposure of neural cells to PBR ligands generates free radicals, and that the MPT may be involved in this process.

AB  - Abstract Objective To study the prevalence of musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms and disorders among garment workers in Bangladesh, to look for possible relationships between pain location and type of work performed and to estimate the prevalence of rheumatological diagnoses. Methods A cross-sectional pilot study among 350 garment workers using the COPCORD (Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Disorders) methodology. Subjects with musculoskeletal pain were examined by rheumatologists for rheumatological diagnosis. The workers were classified into cutting, sewing, finishing and quality control operators. Results Most of the workers were aged below 35 years (88%) and females (82.9%) and the majority had only primary education (74.6%). The prevalence of MSK pain within 7 days of the interview was 77.1%, a much higher figure than in the general population. The most affected sites were: shoulder (17.9%), lower back (15.2%), neck (13.8%) and knee (10.8%). Multiple regional pain was the commonest finding in 173 of 350 workers. In this pilot study rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed in 0.9%, undifferentiated arthritis in 1.1%, nonspecific low back pain in 4.6%, soft tissue rheumatism in 3.7%, osteoarthritis in 0.9% and lumbar spondylosis in 1.1%, figures comparable with those observed in the general population; spondyloarthropathy was seen more often, in 1.42%, possibly explained by the small numbers. Conclusions Musculoskeletal pains are common among garment workers of Bangladesh and may cause morbidity, disability, and work loss. Our findings may be important to plan ergonomic measures preventing complaints and may be of interest for international companies ordering garments in Bangladesh.

AB  - Summary Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are stem cell populations present among the bone marrow stroma and a number of other tissues that are capable of multi-lineage differentiation into mesoderm-type cells such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. MSC provide supportive stroma for growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and hematopoiesis. These cells have been described as important immunoregulators due to their ability to suppress T cells proliferation. MSC can also directly contribute to tissue repair by migrating to sites of injury and providing a source of cells for differentiation and/or providing bystander support for resident stromal cells. This chapter discusses the cellular and molecular properties of MSC, the mechanisms by which they can modulate immune responses and the clinical applications of MSC in disorders such as graft-versus-host disease and aplastic anaemia. The role of MSC in the treatment of autoimmune disorders as well as their potential in the arena of tissue repair and a view of what the future clinical applications of MSC might be is outlined in this chapter.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the new Cobalt?Chromium (Co-Cr) Presillion? stent for the treatment of high-risk acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent represents the gold standard treatment for acute MI. Methods and Results: We enrolled patients with high-risk acute MI (either ST-segment elevation MI or non-ST-segment elevation MI) treated with PCI using a new Co-Cr bare metal stent with closed cells design and limited balloon compliance. We considered high-risk features as one of the following: age ≥70 years, ejection fraction ≤35%, glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min, diabetes mellitus, rescue PCI, or chronic atrial fibrillation or other conditions requiring long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. Primary outcome of the study was rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, new MI, and target-vessel revascularization. A total of 129 consecutive patients were enrolled (69 ± 11 years, 74% men): 71 (55%) patients with ST-segment elevation MI and 58 (45%) patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI. A total of 153 vessels (169 lesions and 179 stents) were treated. The device success rate was high (98.8%). In-hospital MACE rate was 5.4% mainly because of death associated with the acute MI. At 1-year follow-up, the MACE rate was 17.3%, with 11% all-cause death (7.9% of cardiac origin), 0.6% of stent thrombosis, and 4.6% target-vessel revascularization. Conclusions: The use of the Co-Cr Presillion stent in patients with high-risk acute MI treated invasively seems to be safe and efficacious with optimal deliverability and good long-term outcomes and represents a good option in the treatment of these patients. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
