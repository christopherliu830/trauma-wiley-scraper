AB  - Abstract Endoneurial macrophages are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathies. Historically, the macrophage response in neuropathies is believed to be of hematogenous origin. However, recent studies could demonstrate an intrinsic generation of the early macrophage response by resident endoneurial macrophages after traumatic nerve injury and in a model of hereditary neuropathy. We hypothesized that the local macrophage response might suffice to generate an appropriate macrophage response in mild neuropathies, supplemented by infiltrating macrophages only in severe nerve pathology. To clarify this assumption, we investigated the macrophage response in acrylamide-induced neuropathy as a model of a slowly progressive neuropathy with a defined onset. We induced the neuropathy in bone marrow chimeric mice carrying green fluorescent protein transgenic bone marrow, allowing the differentiation of resident (GFP?) and invading hematogenous endoneurial (GFP+) macrophages. Quantification of GFP? and GFP+ endoneurial macrophages in the sciatic nerve revealed an increase only of resident macrophages in proximal parts, whereas in distal parts a minor additional influx of hematogenous macrophages was observed. The immunohistochemical profile of GFP? and GFP+ macrophages was similar but distal GFP? macrophages were differentially activated than their GFP+ counterparts. Characterization of CCR2-deficient mice revealed a function for this chemokine system in attracting hematogenous macrophages but not in generating the intrinsic macrophage response. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of resident macrophages in acrylamide-induced neuropathy. Resident endoneurial macrophages intrinsically generate the macrophage response in this slowly progressive neuropathy, which only becomes supplemented by hematogenous macrophages in distal areas of more pronounced damage. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Animal models of tinnitus allow us to study the relationship between changes in neural activity and the tinnitus percept. Here, guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral noise trauma and tested behaviourally for tinnitus 8 weeks later. By comparing animals with tinnitus with those without, all of which were noise-exposed, we were able to identify changes unique to the tinnitus group. Three physiological markers known to change following noise exposure were examined: spontaneous firing rates (SFRs) and burst firing in the inferior colliculus (IC), evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), and the number of neurons in the cochlear nucleus containing nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We obtained behavioural evidence of tinnitus in 12 of 16 (75%) animals. Both SFRs and incidences of burst firing were elevated in the IC of all noise-exposed animals, but there were no differences between tinnitus and no-tinnitus animals. There were significant decreases in ipsilateral ABR latencies in tinnitus animals, contrary to what might be expected with a small hearing loss. Furthermore, there was an ipsilateral?contralateral asymmetry in NOS staining in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) that was only apparent in tinnitus animals. Tinnitus animals had a significantly greater number of NOS-containing neurons on the noise-exposed side, whereas no-tinnitus animals did not. These data suggest that measuring NOS in the VCN and recording ABRs supplement behavioural methods for confirming tinnitus in animals, and that nitric oxide is involved in plastic neural changes associated with tinnitus.

AB  - Aim Although advanced treatments are provided to improve outcomes after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation, the actual treatments in clinical settings have been insufficiently investigated. The aim of the current study is to describe the actual treatments carried out for out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation patients, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients, at critical care medical centers. Methods We registered consecutive adult patients suffering bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac origin, for whom resuscitation was attempted by emergency medical service personnel, who had ventricular fibrillation as an initial rhythm, and who were transported to critical care medical centers in Osaka from March 2008 to December 2008. This study merged data on treatments after transportation, collected from 11 critical care medical centers in Osaka with the prehospital Utstein-style database. Results During the study period, there were 260 bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation arrests of cardiac origin. Of them, 252 received defibrillations before hospital arrival, 112 (44.4%) were transported to critical care medical centers, and 35 had shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. At the critical care medical centers, 54% (19/35), 40% (14/35), and 46% (16/35) of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients were treated with extracorporeal life support, percutaneous coronary interventions, and therapeutic hypothermia, respectively, but their treatments differed among institutions. Some patients with prolonged arrest without prehospital return of spontaneous circulation who received advanced treatments had neurologically favorable survival, whereas approximately two-thirds of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients with advanced treatments did not. Conclusion This pilot descriptive study suggested that actual treatments for prehospital ventricular fibrillation patients differed between critical care medical centers. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of in-hospital advanced treatments for ventricular fibrillation including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - Abstract Objective To study the prevalence of musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms and disorders among garment workers in Bangladesh, to look for possible relationships between pain location and type of work performed and to estimate the prevalence of rheumatological diagnoses. Methods A cross-sectional pilot study among 350 garment workers using the COPCORD (Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Disorders) methodology. Subjects with musculoskeletal pain were examined by rheumatologists for rheumatological diagnosis. The workers were classified into cutting, sewing, finishing and quality control operators. Results Most of the workers were aged below 35 years (88%) and females (82.9%) and the majority had only primary education (74.6%). The prevalence of MSK pain within 7 days of the interview was 77.1%, a much higher figure than in the general population. The most affected sites were: shoulder (17.9%), lower back (15.2%), neck (13.8%) and knee (10.8%). Multiple regional pain was the commonest finding in 173 of 350 workers. In this pilot study rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed in 0.9%, undifferentiated arthritis in 1.1%, nonspecific low back pain in 4.6%, soft tissue rheumatism in 3.7%, osteoarthritis in 0.9% and lumbar spondylosis in 1.1%, figures comparable with those observed in the general population; spondyloarthropathy was seen more often, in 1.42%, possibly explained by the small numbers. Conclusions Musculoskeletal pains are common among garment workers of Bangladesh and may cause morbidity, disability, and work loss. Our findings may be important to plan ergonomic measures preventing complaints and may be of interest for international companies ordering garments in Bangladesh.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the new Cobalt?Chromium (Co-Cr) Presillion? stent for the treatment of high-risk acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent represents the gold standard treatment for acute MI. Methods and Results: We enrolled patients with high-risk acute MI (either ST-segment elevation MI or non-ST-segment elevation MI) treated with PCI using a new Co-Cr bare metal stent with closed cells design and limited balloon compliance. We considered high-risk features as one of the following: age ≥70 years, ejection fraction ≤35%, glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min, diabetes mellitus, rescue PCI, or chronic atrial fibrillation or other conditions requiring long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. Primary outcome of the study was rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, new MI, and target-vessel revascularization. A total of 129 consecutive patients were enrolled (69 ± 11 years, 74% men): 71 (55%) patients with ST-segment elevation MI and 58 (45%) patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI. A total of 153 vessels (169 lesions and 179 stents) were treated. The device success rate was high (98.8%). In-hospital MACE rate was 5.4% mainly because of death associated with the acute MI. At 1-year follow-up, the MACE rate was 17.3%, with 11% all-cause death (7.9% of cardiac origin), 0.6% of stent thrombosis, and 4.6% target-vessel revascularization. Conclusions: The use of the Co-Cr Presillion stent in patients with high-risk acute MI treated invasively seems to be safe and efficacious with optimal deliverability and good long-term outcomes and represents a good option in the treatment of these patients. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Given the high prevalence of overweight/obesity among young people in residential out-of-home care (OOHC), and as their carers are in loco parentis, this research aimed: 1) to examine the healthy lifestyle cognitions and behaviours of residential carers; and 2) to describe resources needed to improve diet and/or physical activity outcomes for residents. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 243 residential carers. Measures included: demographics; knowledge of dietary/physical activity recommendations; self-reported encouragement/importance of health behaviours; physical activity/screen time (at work); unit ?healthiness?; and necessary resources for creating a healthy environment. Results: Staff placed importance on the residents eating well and being physically active. However, examination of carer knowledge found significant gaps in staff education. Three key priority areas were identified to help build a healthy food and activity environment in residential OOHC: funding, professional development and policy. Conclusion: Carer knowledge of healthy lifestyles can be improved and they need to be well resourced to ensure children in public care settings live in a healthy environment. Implications: These findings may inform the development of ongoing professional development to improve carers' health literacy, as well as policy to support dietary/activity guidelines for the OOHC sector.

AB  - Summary Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are stem cell populations present among the bone marrow stroma and a number of other tissues that are capable of multi-lineage differentiation into mesoderm-type cells such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. MSC provide supportive stroma for growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and hematopoiesis. These cells have been described as important immunoregulators due to their ability to suppress T cells proliferation. MSC can also directly contribute to tissue repair by migrating to sites of injury and providing a source of cells for differentiation and/or providing bystander support for resident stromal cells. This chapter discusses the cellular and molecular properties of MSC, the mechanisms by which they can modulate immune responses and the clinical applications of MSC in disorders such as graft-versus-host disease and aplastic anaemia. The role of MSC in the treatment of autoimmune disorders as well as their potential in the arena of tissue repair and a view of what the future clinical applications of MSC might be is outlined in this chapter.

AB  - Abstract? Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is hampered by the scant therapeutic options available to the practicing physician. Albumin dialysis has been proposed to improve the management of such patients, by removing both water-soluble and protein bound toxins. A recently completed trial of albumin dialysis in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy offers the opportunity to evaluate the role of such a therapy. Such patients had encephalopathy associated with acute-on-chronic liver failure rather than the result of precipitant-induced changes in mental state. In this entity, improvement in encephalopathy may also require correction of the hemodynamic changes associated with liver failure.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the data of 29 patients (30 subtalar joints) who underwent subtalar joint arthrodesis between 1 July 2013 and 31 December 2017. The customized guides were designed on a full-scale 3D polylactic acid model made from computed tomography (CT) data of patients by Model Intestinal Microflora in Computer Simulation (MIMICS) software, which were manufactured by 3D printing technology. A total of 14 joints used customized guides (experimental group); the remained 16 joints used the traditional method (control group). The time of drilling the Kirschner wires to the correct position, the time of subtalar fusion, American Orthopaedic Foot  in the control group, it took 4.6?±?1.9?min to drill the Kirschner wire to the satisfactory position (P?<?0.05), and 8 cases needed to be re-drilled. No serious complications occurred in both groups during and after the surgery. Postoperative radiographic fusion was confirmed in all cases. No significant difference was observed in the fusion time and AOFAS scores 1?year postoperatively between the two groups (P?>?0.05). Conclusion It is safe to apply 3D-printed customized guides for subtalar joint arthrodesis, which can assist the accurate drilling of Kirschner wires into the appropriate position according to the preoperative plan, and reduce the operation time as well as intraoperative radiation.

AB  - Abstract Acute poisonings represent a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prognostic utility of the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters combined with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in acute poisoning with different xenobiotics, upon admission in the hospital, was not evaluated. This prospective observational cohort study included 229 acutely poisoned non-diabetic adults, with a median age of 44 years (range 18?90 years), 50.7% women, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 8.7%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, the left ventricle kinetic abnormalities, the E-wave deceleration time (EDT) and BNP correlated significantly with mortality in acutely poisoned patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that only EDT [odds ratio (OR) 3.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54?7.69, p 0.003], BNP (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02?2.55, p 0.04) and age (OR 2.66, 95% CI: 1.23?5.76, p 0.013) are predictive for mortality. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis proved EDT [area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.85; CI: 0.76?0.94; p 0.001], BNP (AUC, 0.83; CI: 0.75?0.91; p 0.001) and age (AUC, 0.82; CI: 0.74?0.90; p 0.001) as indicators for fatalities. In hospitalized patients acutely intoxicated with undifferentiated poisons, EDT as a parameter of left ventricle diastolic function and BNP are useful to early predict mortality.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: An increasing demand for esthetic restorations has resulted in the development of new ceramic systems, but fracture of veneering ceramics still remains the primary cause of failure. Porcelain repair frequently involves replacement with composite resin, but the bond strength between composite resin and all-ceramic coping materials has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of different ceramic surface treatments on the micro-shear bond strength of composite resin to IPS Empress 2 coping material. Materials and Methods: Sixteen 7 ? 7 ? 1 mm3 lithia disilicate-based core ceramic plates were fabricated using the lost wax technique. The plates were divided into eight groups, and eight different surface treatments were performed: (1) no treatment (NT); (2) airborne-particle abrasion with 50-?m alumina particles (Al); (3) acid etching with 9.6% hydrofluoric acid for 1 min (HF); (4) silane coating (S); (5) AlHF; (6) AlS; (7) HFS; and (8) AlHFS. Then, ten composite resin cylinders (0.8-mm diameter ? 0.5-mm height) were light-polymerized onto the ceramic plates in each group. Each specimen was subjected to a shear load at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min until fracture occurred. The fracture sites were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the location of failure during debonding and to examine the surface treatment effects. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison (Dunnet T3) tests were used for statistical analysis of data. Results: The mean micro-shear bond strength values (SD) in MPa were?NT: 4.10 (3.06), Al: 7.56 (4.11), HF: 14.04 (2.60), S: 14.58 (2.14), AlHF: 15.56 (3.36), AlS: 23.02 (4.17), HFS: 24.7 (4.43), AlHFS: 26.0 (3.71). ANOVA indicated the influence of surface treatment was significant (p < 0.0001). SEM analysis did not reveal entirely cohesive failure in any composite or ceramic. Conclusion: The micro-shear bond strength of a composite resin to IPS Empress 2 was significantly different depending on the surface treatment method. Among the investigated methods, silane coating after airborne-particle abrasion and etching was the most effective surface treatment in terms of bond strength increase.

AB  - Abstract Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is likely involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction in people with obesity and diabetes. Although tissue biopsy is often used to evaluate the presence and severity of ER stress, it is not known whether acute tissue injury-induced by percutaneous muscle biopsy causes ER stress and its potential downstream effects on markers of inflammation and metabolic function. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that percutaneous biopsy-induced tissue injury causes ER stress and alters inflammatory and metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. Vastus lateralis muscle tissue was obtained by percutaneous biopsy at 0600 h and 12 h later from either the contralateral leg (Group 1, n = 6) or at the same site as the initial biopsy (Group 2, n = 6) in women who were overweight. Muscle gene expression of selected markers of ER stress, inflammation, and regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism were determined. Compared with Group 1, muscle gene expression in the second biopsy sample obtained in Group 2 demonstrated marked increases in markers of ER stress (GRP78, XBP1, ATF6) and inflammation (IL6, TNF), and alterations in metabolic regulators (decreased expression of GLUT4 and PPARGC1A and increased expression of FASN). Our results suggest that acute tissue injury induced by percutaneous muscle biopsy causes an integrated local response that involves an induction of ER stress and alterations in markers of inflammation and regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Perineural spread (PNS) of mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region occurs with a reported frequency of 2% to more than 27%. Patients previously diagnosed with and treated for head and neck cancer should be closely followed by both their physician and their dentist in order to facilitate the coordination of care. This case history demonstrates the results that can occur when a team approach to head and neck cancer is not followed, especially in a patient who is an infrequent and somewhat reluctant health care utilizer. Despite mandibular pain, the patient, who had a history of a carcinoma of the lower lip and had developed PNS, was not referred to a dentist. In patients with a previous history of squamous cell carcinoma, sensory and/or motor changes must be closely monitored when there is a suspicion of PNS. The outcome of this case supports improved collaborations between physicians and dentists in following head and neck cancer patients.
