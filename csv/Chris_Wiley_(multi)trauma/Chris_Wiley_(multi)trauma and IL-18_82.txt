AB  - Aim Although advanced treatments are provided to improve outcomes after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation, the actual treatments in clinical settings have been insufficiently investigated. The aim of the current study is to describe the actual treatments carried out for out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation patients, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients, at critical care medical centers. Methods We registered consecutive adult patients suffering bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac origin, for whom resuscitation was attempted by emergency medical service personnel, who had ventricular fibrillation as an initial rhythm, and who were transported to critical care medical centers in Osaka from March 2008 to December 2008. This study merged data on treatments after transportation, collected from 11 critical care medical centers in Osaka with the prehospital Utstein-style database. Results During the study period, there were 260 bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation arrests of cardiac origin. Of them, 252 received defibrillations before hospital arrival, 112 (44.4%) were transported to critical care medical centers, and 35 had shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. At the critical care medical centers, 54% (19/35), 40% (14/35), and 46% (16/35) of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients were treated with extracorporeal life support, percutaneous coronary interventions, and therapeutic hypothermia, respectively, but their treatments differed among institutions. Some patients with prolonged arrest without prehospital return of spontaneous circulation who received advanced treatments had neurologically favorable survival, whereas approximately two-thirds of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients with advanced treatments did not. Conclusion This pilot descriptive study suggested that actual treatments for prehospital ventricular fibrillation patients differed between critical care medical centers. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of in-hospital advanced treatments for ventricular fibrillation including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to show the connection between structure (anatomical and histochemical) and function (muscle contraction properties) of vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) and vastus medialis longus (VML). The non-invasive tensiomyography (TMG) method was used to determine the contractile properties (contraction time; Tc) of VML and VMO muscle, as a reflection of the ratio between the slow and fast fibers in two groups of nine young men. VML and VMO significantly (P?<?0.01) differ in the proportion of type 1 (59.6: 44%) and type 2b (6.3: 15%) fibers. The VML muscle is almost entirely composed of type 1 and type 2a fibers. In many samples of this muscle no type 2b fibers were found. The proportion of slow-twitch type 1 fibers is nearly twice as high as the proportion of fast-twitch type 2a fibers. These observations indicate that VML is a slower and more fatigue-resistant muscle than VMO muscle. These characteristics correspond to the different functions of the VML, which is an extensor of the knee, and to the VMO, which maintains the stable position of the patella in the femoral groove. Our results obtained by TMG provided additional evidence that muscle fibers within the segments of VM muscle were not homogenous with regard to their contractile properties, thereby confirming the histochemical results. Tc can be attributed to the higher percentage of slow-twitch fibers ? type 1. The statistically shorter Tc (P?≤?0.001) of VMO (22.8?±?4.0?ms) compared with VML (26.7?±?4.0?ms) in our study is consistent with previously found differences in histochemical, morphological and electrophysiological data. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that the VML and VMO muscles are not only anatomically and histochemically different muscles, but also functionally different biological structures.

AB  - Abstract Several recent studies have demonstrated that the activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) by thrombin and activated protein C (APC) on cultured vascular endothelial cells elicits paradoxical proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses, respectively. Noting that the protective intracellular signaling activity of APC requires the interaction of the protease with its receptor, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), we recently hypothesized that the occupancy of EPCR by protein C may also change the PAR-1-dependent signaling specificity of thrombin. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that EPCR is associated with caveolin-1 in lipid rafts of endothelial cells and that the occupancy of EPCR by the Gla-domain of protein C/APC leads to its dissociation from caveolin-1 and recruitment of PAR-1 to a protective signaling pathway through the coupling of PAR-1 to the pertussis toxin sensitive Gi-protein. Thus, when EPCR is bound by protein C, a PAR-1-dependent protective signaling response in cultured endothelial cells can be mediated by either thrombin or APC. This article will briefly review the mechanism by which the occupancy of EPCR by its natural ligand modulates the PAR-1-dependent signaling specificity of coagulation proteases. ? 2011 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 63(6): 390?396, 2011

AB  - Abstract Objective: Given the high prevalence of overweight/obesity among young people in residential out-of-home care (OOHC), and as their carers are in loco parentis, this research aimed: 1) to examine the healthy lifestyle cognitions and behaviours of residential carers; and 2) to describe resources needed to improve diet and/or physical activity outcomes for residents. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 243 residential carers. Measures included: demographics; knowledge of dietary/physical activity recommendations; self-reported encouragement/importance of health behaviours; physical activity/screen time (at work); unit ?healthiness?; and necessary resources for creating a healthy environment. Results: Staff placed importance on the residents eating well and being physically active. However, examination of carer knowledge found significant gaps in staff education. Three key priority areas were identified to help build a healthy food and activity environment in residential OOHC: funding, professional development and policy. Conclusion: Carer knowledge of healthy lifestyles can be improved and they need to be well resourced to ensure children in public care settings live in a healthy environment. Implications: These findings may inform the development of ongoing professional development to improve carers' health literacy, as well as policy to support dietary/activity guidelines for the OOHC sector.

PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Purpose: An increasing demand for esthetic restorations has resulted in the development of new ceramic systems, but fracture of veneering ceramics still remains the primary cause of failure. Porcelain repair frequently involves replacement with composite resin, but the bond strength between composite resin and all-ceramic coping materials has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of different ceramic surface treatments on the micro-shear bond strength of composite resin to IPS Empress 2 coping material. Materials and Methods: Sixteen 7 ? 7 ? 1 mm3 lithia disilicate-based core ceramic plates were fabricated using the lost wax technique. The plates were divided into eight groups, and eight different surface treatments were performed: (1) no treatment (NT); (2) airborne-particle abrasion with 50-?m alumina particles (Al); (3) acid etching with 9.6% hydrofluoric acid for 1 min (HF); (4) silane coating (S); (5) AlHF; (6) AlS; (7) HFS; and (8) AlHFS. Then, ten composite resin cylinders (0.8-mm diameter ? 0.5-mm height) were light-polymerized onto the ceramic plates in each group. Each specimen was subjected to a shear load at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min until fracture occurred. The fracture sites were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the location of failure during debonding and to examine the surface treatment effects. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison (Dunnet T3) tests were used for statistical analysis of data. Results: The mean micro-shear bond strength values (SD) in MPa were?NT: 4.10 (3.06), Al: 7.56 (4.11), HF: 14.04 (2.60), S: 14.58 (2.14), AlHF: 15.56 (3.36), AlS: 23.02 (4.17), HFS: 24.7 (4.43), AlHFS: 26.0 (3.71). ANOVA indicated the influence of surface treatment was significant (p < 0.0001). SEM analysis did not reveal entirely cohesive failure in any composite or ceramic. Conclusion: The micro-shear bond strength of a composite resin to IPS Empress 2 was significantly different depending on the surface treatment method. Among the investigated methods, silane coating after airborne-particle abrasion and etching was the most effective surface treatment in terms of bond strength increase.

AB  - Abstract Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is likely involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction in people with obesity and diabetes. Although tissue biopsy is often used to evaluate the presence and severity of ER stress, it is not known whether acute tissue injury-induced by percutaneous muscle biopsy causes ER stress and its potential downstream effects on markers of inflammation and metabolic function. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that percutaneous biopsy-induced tissue injury causes ER stress and alters inflammatory and metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. Vastus lateralis muscle tissue was obtained by percutaneous biopsy at 0600 h and 12 h later from either the contralateral leg (Group 1, n = 6) or at the same site as the initial biopsy (Group 2, n = 6) in women who were overweight. Muscle gene expression of selected markers of ER stress, inflammation, and regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism were determined. Compared with Group 1, muscle gene expression in the second biopsy sample obtained in Group 2 demonstrated marked increases in markers of ER stress (GRP78, XBP1, ATF6) and inflammation (IL6, TNF), and alterations in metabolic regulators (decreased expression of GLUT4 and PPARGC1A and increased expression of FASN). Our results suggest that acute tissue injury induced by percutaneous muscle biopsy causes an integrated local response that involves an induction of ER stress and alterations in markers of inflammation and regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Abstract? Sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) is the gold standard for assessing sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), but is considered a diagnostic sensitivity of 30?80% and associated with significant complications of pancreatitis. Electromyography (EMG) of sphincter of Oddi (SO) using a circular electrode (CE) may be useful in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing complications. To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the CE, we record myoelectric activity of SO in rabbits using the CE to compare with the traditional needle electrode (NE). The CE was prepared using a double-channel biogel catheter with two silver rings at the head of the catheter. The CE was then inserted into the lumen of the SO through the duodenal papilla, and myoelectric activity was recorded in the SO in 30 rabbits. An EMG recorded using an NE was performed at the same time, when the SO was in basal state, after injection of cholecystokinin and N-butylscopolamine bromide. Electromyographs recorded by the two methods were then evaluated. Satisfactory SO EMGs were acquired using the CE without any injury. Simultaneous recording revealed a very similar traces and one-to-one correspondence of SO spike bursts (SOSB). Linear regression analysis showed a significant direct correlation between the two methods for SOSB duration and amplitude. The results suggested that CE was comparable with NE in terms of recording efficacy. The CE also has advantages of easy fixation, accurate localisation, broad applicability and ease of achieving satisfactory outcomes without trauma, compared with the NE.

AB  - ABSTRACT Trauma and age-related cartilage disorders represent a major global cause of morbidity, resulting in chronic pain and disability in patients. A lack of effective therapies, together with a rapidly aging population, creates an impressive clinical and economic burden on healthcare systems. In this scenario, experimental therapies based on transplantation or in situ stimulation of skeletal Mesenchymal Stem/progenitor Cells (MSCs) have raised great interest for cartilage repair. Nevertheless, the challenge of guiding MSC differentiation and preventing cartilage hypertrophy and calcification still needs to be overcome. While research has mostly focused on the stimulation of cartilage anabolism using growth factors, several issues remain unresolved prompting the field to search for novel solutions. Recently, inhibition of anti-chondrogenic regulators has emerged as an intriguing opportunity. Anti-chondrogenic regulators include extracellular proteins as well as intracellular transcription factors and microRNAs that act as potent inhibitors of pro-chondrogenic signals. Suppression of these inhibitors can enhance MSC chondrogenesis and production of cartilage matrix. We here review the current knowledge concerning different types of anti-chondrogenic regulators. We aim to highlight novel therapeutic targets for cartilage repair and discuss suitable tools for suppressing their anti-chondrogenic functions. Further effort is needed to unveil the therapeutic perspectives of this approach and pave the way for effective treatment of cartilage injuries in patients. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary The results of the findings obtained from EEGs of the 1,200 cases with definite epilepsy were summarized as follows: 1) The synthetic interpretation proved that the approximately normal cases accounted for 4%, the borderline-abnormal for 6% and the definitely abnormal for 90%, thereby seizure discharge was observed in 85% of the total number of cases. 2) Dysrhythmia in respect to the basic activity was observed in half of the cases, which was verified also by the EEG auto-analyser. 3) With regard to the abnormal EEG-findings, the non-focal diffuse findings were perceived in 15% of the cases, the so-called centrencephalic type in 30%; and the focal signs in 55%. Moreover, in 95% of the latter, the existence of either the areal or discrete foci were confirmed in 85%. 4) Concerning seizure discharge, it appeared in 96% of the abnormal EEGs, and the ratio of the focal to the non-focal was 3:2. It also appeared in the following decreasing order: spike- the other patterns were very scanty. 5) As for the distributions of the foci, the following numerical order was obtained: the temporal < the frontal < the central < the parietal > the occipital; only the last two were sparse in number. 6) Abnormal EEG-findings appeared in 50% of the resting record, but were increased to 90% by activations, thus the significance of activating techniques was presumed. 7) In regard to the relations between clinical seizure patterns and EEG-findings, there existed a definitely positive correlation between petit mal absence and/or automatism and rhythmic 3 c/s spike-&-wave complex. And, as for the other patterns, the centrencephalic type was usually observed in cases of both generalized convulsion and the petit mal group, and the focal signs (especially the temporal ones) almost always in both the focal seizure group and the psychomotor seizure group, and the multiple spikes for the most part in cases with both myoclonic seizure and massive myoclonic seizure. However, it seems to be difficult to introduce any definite and uniform relation according to the each seizure type unitarily. 8) In clinical EEG-examination, even in the case of epilepsy, a generalized or multi-dimensional interpretation using systematic procedures, including application of activating techniques, is yet necessary.

AB  - Abstract Objectives. To determine whether hysteroscopic tubal occlusion will produce the same efficacy as laparoscopic tubal occlusion of functionless hydrosalpinx prior to IVF/ICSI. Design. A prospective comparative study. Setting. Endoscopy Unit of the Women's Health Center, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. Subjects. A pilot safety phase included 10 uteri removed by hysterectomy in perimenopausal women subjected to roller ball coagulation of the peritubal bulge. The study phase included 27 patients with uni- or bilateral functionless hydrosalpinges, who were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A comprised 14 patients who were randomly allocated for laparoscopic occlusion. Group B included 13 patients scheduled for a hysteroscopic approach. Interventions. Laparoscopic occlusion of the isthmic part of the fallopian tube was carried out using bipolar diathermy in 9 (64%) cases or clips in 3 (21.4%) cases in Group A. Roller ball electrode of the resectoscope was utilised for occlusion of the tubal ostium under local, spinal, or general anesthesia in Group B. Second-look office hysteroscopy was performed in Group B whenever possible. In both groups, hysterosalpingography or sonohysterography was carried out 1 month later to confirm tubal occlusion. Main outcome measures. Safety phase aimed at confirming tubal occlusion with minimal harm to adjacent tissues. Confirmed tubal occlusion of the functionless hydrosalpinx. Results. The safety phase resulted in bilateral complete occlusion of the proximal part of the tubes with secondary coagulation <8 mm, as shown in the histopathologic sections. The suspected main cause of functionless hydrosalpinges was iatrogenic (pelvic surgery) in 9 (64%) and 8 (61.5%) cases in both groups, respectively. The mean number of abdominal scars/patient was 1.4 and 1.5 in both groups, respectively. Unilateral functionless hydrosalpinx was encountered in 7 (50%) and 5 (38%) cases in both groups, respectively. In Group A, the procedure was possible and successful in 10 cases (76.9%), while in Group B, hysteroscopic access and occlusion were achieved in 12 (85.7%) and 9 (64.2%) cases, respectively. In Group B, diagnostic hysteroscopy showed fine marginal adhesions in 2 cases (15%), and a small polyp in 1 case (7.7%). Hysteroscopic tubal occlusion showed shorter operative time (9±2.8 versus 24±4.8min, p = 0.0001) and hospital stay (2±1.8 versus 5±1.1h, p = 0.0001). Second-look office hysteroscopy was performed in 8 cases in Group B and revealed no significant corneal lesions at the site of hysteroscopic occlusion. Conclusions. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of hysteroscopic tubal occlusion of functionless hydrosalpinx in all cases with acceptable efficacy. It has the advantage of adding a valuable evaluation of the endometrial cavity prior to IVF/ICSI. It should be an option for treatment protocol in cases of functionless hydrosalpinges. Further large sample-sized studies are required to test its impact on the implantation rate and clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract:? Multiple investigations in vivo have shown that melatonin (MEL) has a neuroprotective effect in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). This study investigates the role of MEL as an intervening agent for ameliorating Ca2+-mediated events, including activation of calpain, following its administration to rats sustaining experimental SCI. Calpain, a Ca2+-dependent neutral protease, is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of SCI. Rats were injured using a standard weight-drop method that induced a moderately severe injury (40?g.cm?force) at T10. Sham controls received laminectomy only. Injured animals were given either 45?mg/kg MEL or vehicle at 15?min post-injury by intraperitoneal injection. At 48?hr post-injury, spinal cord (SC) samples were collected. Immunofluorescent labelings were used to identify calpain expression in specific cell types, such as neurons, glia, or macrophages. Combination of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and double immunofluorescent labelings was used to identify apoptosis in specific cells in the SC. The effect of MEL on axonal damage was also investigated using antibody specific for dephosphorylated neurofilament protein (dNFP). Treatment of SCI animals with MEL attenuated calpain expression, inflammation, axonal damage (dNFP), and neuronal death, indicating that MEL provided neuroprotective effect in SCI. Further, expression and activity of calpain and caspse-3 were examined by Western blotting. The results indicated a significant decrease in expression and activity of calpain and caspse-3 in SCI animals after treatment with MEL. Taken together, this study strongly suggested that MEL could be an effective neuroprotective agent for treatment of SCI.
