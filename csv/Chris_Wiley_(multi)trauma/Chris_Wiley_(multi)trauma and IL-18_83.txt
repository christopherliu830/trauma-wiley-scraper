AB  - Nutrition support for the patient with cancer is an important part of the overall treatment regimen. Nutrition support for the child with cancer poses a special challenge. For the purpose of reviewing the special nutritional needs of children with cancer, a Task Force was formed by the American Academy of Pediatrics to review the current state of knowledge. The work of the Task Force was supported by the Food and Drug Administration through its Liaison Representative, Joginder Chopra, M.D., Staff support from the Academy was provided by Jean D. Lockhart, M.D., This review is prepared from the Task Force Report to the FDA. It is designed to review factors enhancing nutritional risks for the child with cancer and to discuss nutritional intervention strategies and their efficacies.

AB  - Summary Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, required for the degradation of glycosphingolipids. Clinical manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bone disease and a bleeding diathesis, frequently resulting in presentation to haematologists. Historically managed by splenectomy, transfusions and orthopaedic surgery, the development of specific therapy in the form of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in the 1990s has resulted in dramatic improvements in haematological and visceral disease. Recognition of complications, including multiple myeloma and Parkinson disease, has challenged the traditional macrophage-centric view of the pathophysiology of this disorder. The pathways by which enzyme deficiency results in the clinical manifestations of this disorder are poorly understood; altered inflammatory cytokine profiles, bioactive sphingolipid derivatives and alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment have been implicated. Further elucidating these pathways will serve to advance our understanding not only of GD, but of associated disorders.

AB  - Summary The measurement of homocysteine is still part of routine thrombosis or thrombophilia work-up in many thrombosis centres in the world. Previous observational studies have shown that hyperhomocysteinaemia is associated with an increased risk of first and recurrent venous thrombosis (VT). Randomised trials, however, showed no benefit of homocysteine-lowering therapy on the risk of first or recurrent VT. This discrepancy could be explained by incomplete adjustment for confounders in the observational studies. We investigated in a large population-based follow-up study whether if the levels of homocysteine and its metabolites, methionine and cysteine, were associated with recurrent VT. Approximately three months after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment, homocysteine, methionine and cysteine concentrations were measured in 2210 patients with VT. During a median follow-up of 6·9 years, 340 patients developed a recurrence (incidence rate, 2·8/100 patient-years). We found that elevated homocysteine concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of recurrent VT, neither as a continuous variable per 5 ?mol/l increase (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0·90?1·04)) nor when levels were >95th (>23·0 ?mol/l) percentile (HR 1·03 (95% CI, 0·65?1·64)). Similar results were obtained for cysteine and methionine values. We conclude that hyperhomocysteinaemia is not associated with an increased risk of recurrent VT.

AB  - The concept of repetition compulsion, which has never been fully acknowledged by Kohut and his followers, is re-evaluated in this article within the context of self-psychology. In line with the underlying principles of defensive contact-shunning on the one hand, and non-traumatic empathic failure on the other hand, the repetition can be seen as the twofold expression both of the wish for a new benign relationship and of the dread of traumatic, repeated disappointment. Therefore, early non-traumatic disappointments are initiated by the patient, and role-responded to by significant others. This way, the risk of disillusionment of full-blown expectations is avoided. The repetition compulsion, then, is a complex mechanism: preventive in one part, it protects the vulnerable self from potentially traumatising experiences; thus, it is operated in response to the danger signal of emotional cravings, once the latter are experienced as getting out of hand. Providing novel experiences, in its other part, it can lead to opening the road for change; such curative impact relies on lengthy working through in a safe, empathic, holding environment.

AB  - Objective To estimate incidence, trends over time, and risk factors for massive blood transfusions in obstetric patients. A secondary aim was to evaluate transfusion ratios in relation to massive transfusion. Design Population-based cohort. Setting Five hospitals, in the Stockholm County, Sweden, from 1990 to 2011. Population All women that gave birth in Stockholm county, Sweden, and who received blood transfusions postpartum between 1990 and 2011. Methods Data on pregnancies and deliveries from the Swedish National Medical Birth Registry was cross-linked to the Stockholm transfusion database. Massive blood transfusion was defined as the transfusion of ≥10 units of red blood cells from partus through the next day. Main outcome measures Main primary outcome was massive blood transfusion postpartum. Results Our cohort comprised 517 874 deliveries. Massive blood transfusion occurred in 277 women, for an incidence of 5.3 per 10 000 deliveries, and increased by 30% (P < 0.001) between the first and the second half of the study period. Major risk factors apparent before delivery were abnormal placentation (odds ratio [OR] 41; 95% CI 29.3?58.1), pre-eclampsia/placental abruption (OR 4; 95% CI 2.8?5.6), and previous caesarean delivery (OR 4; 95% CI 3.1?6.0). Risk factors at time of delivery were uterine rupture, atonic uterus, and caesarean delivery (OR 38, 17, and 3, respectively). Conclusion We found an increasing trend in the postpartum rate of massive transfusion. Women with abnormal placentation were found to have the highest increased risk. Improved antenatal awareness of these women at risk might improve management and reduce the rate of massive transfusion. Tweetable abstract Risk of massive blood transfusion in obstetric patients increases with placental complications and prior caesarean section.

AB  - Abstract The use of alcohol in a dependent or even a regular heavy pattern predisposes the drinker to a range of adverse consequences. These include a risk of direct harm from alcohol, including organ damage, mental health disorders and a range of social and legal problems associated with behaviours due to alcohol's effects. The range of organ damage associated with regular heavy alcohol consumption is well described. Much new information on the mechanisms by which damage occurs is available and is reviewed in this paper. New knowledge can assist in the development of more appropriate management strategies for those affected by the medical complications of alcohol use. Genetic susceptibility to tissue injury is explored and the reasons why many heavy drinkers do not appear to experience organ damage are considered. Approaches to the management of certain alcohol-related disorders are outlined.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissue. Current diagnostics have low sensitivity or specificity to incremental progression of mineralization, especially at early time points. Without accurate and reliable early diagnosis and intervention, HO progression often results in incapacitating conditions of limited range of motion, nerve entrapment, and pain. We hypothesized that non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging can detect HO at early time points and monitor heterotopic bone turnover longitudinally. C57BL6 mice received an Achilles tenotomy on their left hind limb in combination with a dorsal burn or sham procedure. A calcium-chelating tetracycline derivative (IRDye 680RD BoneTag) was injected bi-weekly and imaged via NIR to measure accumulative fluorescence for 11?wk and compared to in vivo microCT images. Percent retention of fluorescence was calculated longitudinally to assess temporal bone resorption. NIR detected HO as early as five days and revealed a temporal response in HO formation and turnover. MicroCT could not detect HO until 5?wk. Confocal microscopy confirmed fluorophore localization to areas of HO. These findings demonstrate the ability of a near-infrared optical imaging strategy to accurately and reliably detect and monitor HO in a murine model. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The overall number of pancreas transplants continued to increase to 1027 in 2018, after a nadir of 947 in 2015. New additions to waiting list remained stable, with 1485 candidates added in 2018. Proportions of patients with type II diabetes waiting for transplant (14.6%) and undergoing transplant (14.8%) have steadily increased since 2016. Waiting times for simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant have decreased; median months to transplant was 13.5 for simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant and 19.7 for pancreas transplant alone in 2018. Outcomes, including patient and kidney survival, as well as rejection rates, have improved consistently over the past several years. Pancreas graft survival data are being collected by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and will be included in a future report once there are sufficient cohorts for analysis.

AB  - Abstract Major advances have recently been made in our understanding of stem cell biology, and in the application of stem cells to treat cardiac disease. Resident cardiac stem cells have now been described and the long-accepted paradigm of the adult mammalian heart as an organ without regenerative capacity has been questioned. Various stem-cell-based approaches for ameliorating cardiac disease have been shown to be beneficial in animal models and are now being trialled in humans, with several phase I clinical studies already completed. Although these clinical studies lacked adequate placebo controls, they have consistently shown promising results. If confirmed by larger phase II/III trials, it is possible that within a few years a powerful new therapeutic option may be available for the burgeoning number of patients suffering from myocardial ischaemia and/or other cardiac disorders.

AB  - Abstract Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffer from a failure of cognitive control over emotional distracters. The physiological substrates of cognitive-emotional interactions and their breakdown in disease are, however, unknown. Here, we studied brain activity in PTSD patients and healthy controls in response to emotion-provoking pictures using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrate that in healthy individuals, emotion-induced frontal theta rhythm modulates activity in the beta rhythm mainly in sensory-motor regions. In contrast, in PTSD patients, beta activity is elevated irrespective of emotion, and is not modulated by frontal theta activity in response to negative emotion. EEG source localization and fMRI findings suggest that theta activity is localized to the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices while beta activity is localized to sensory-motor regions. We further found that beta activity in sensory-motor regions is related to the emotion-induced slowing of the motor response in healthy controls while the excess frontal theta activity in PTSD is related to the intensity of negative emotional experience. These findings reveal for the first time the importance of brain electrical oscillations and coherence in emotional top-down modulation and point to specific failure of these mechanisms in PTSD.

AB  - Chronic depression is assumed to be caused and maintained by interpersonal deficits. We describe the development and psychometric evaluation of the Interactive Test of Interpersonal Behavior (ITIB) that we developed for self-assessment of these deficits. Participants with chronic depression (CD, N = 15), episodic depression (ED, N = 15) and healthy controls (HC, N = 15) participated in this pilot study. They completed the ITIB and a number of pen and paper questionnaires including the Lübeck Questionnaire of Preoperational Thinking (LQPT) and the inventory of interpersonal problems (IIP). The ITIB was highly acceptable for use in these participants. Internal consistency for the ITIB was adequate for group comparisons (Cronbach's alpha = 0.649). Item-total correlations indicated adequate discriminatory power of five of the six items. The ITIB correlated moderately with the LQPT (r = 0.524) and the IIP (r = ?0.568). The ITIB score differed significantly between the diagnostic groups (ANOVA F(2,42) = 6.22, p = 0.004). It was the only measure that ? albeit at a trend level ? was associated with diagnostic group (CD vs. ED) on multinomial logistic regression analysis (B = 0.049 ± 0.029; OR 1.051; p = 0.088). We found preliminary evidence that the ITIB is an acceptable and psychometrically adequate measure of interpersonal behavior that distinguishes between patients with CD and patients with ED. If replicated with an improved version of the test, our results could support the hypothesis that having interpersonal problems is a core deficit in patients with CD.

AB  - Abstract The infrapatellar pad, a fibro-adipose tissue with peculiar microscopic and mechanical features, is gaining wide attention in the field of rheumatological research. The purpose of this descriptive review is to summarize the most recent published evidence on the anatomic, physiologic and biomechanical inter-relationship between the infrapatellar fat pad and the knee synovial membrane. As an extrasynovial tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad does not directly interact with the articular cartilage; based on its location in close contact with the synovial membrane, and due to the metabolic properties of adipose tissue, it may influence the behavior of the synovial membrane. In fact, considering evidence of macroscopic and microscopic anatomy, the infrapatellar fat pad is the site of insertion of the infrapatellar and medial synovial plicae. Also biochemically, there is much evidence highlighting the interaction among these two structures; in the case of inflammation, the mutual interplay is ascribable to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators stimulating the proliferation of inflammatory cells and promoting tissue modifications in both. All these assumptions could support the emerging idea that the infrapatellar fat pad and the synovial membrane may be considered a morpho-functional unit.
