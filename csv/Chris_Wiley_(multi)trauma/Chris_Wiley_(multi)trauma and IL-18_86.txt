AB  - Abstract Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) provides mechanical support following cardiac surgery when respiratory or cardiac failure occurs. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and feasibility of the Medos Deltastream diagonal pump (DP3) ECLS system in pediatric cardiac patients. We described the technical considerations and risk factors related to the survival outcomes in 102 pediatric cardiac patients who received ECLS support between March 2011 and April 2016. We switched from the DP2 system, which was used for the initial 25 patients, to the DP3 system after November 2012. The DP3 was then used in a consecutive series of 77 patients (4.5% of all pediatric patients who underwent congenital heart surgery during the same time period). The patients? median age was 90 days (range: 2 days?12 years), while their median weight was 4 kg (range: 2.1?40 kg). Fifty four patients (70%) were weaned off ECLS, while 28 patients (36.3%) were successfully discharged from the hospital by means of the DP3 system. The median ECLS duration for survivors was 8.2 days (range: 4?14.5 days). The ECLS indications, durations, and initiation times had no statistical significance in terms of survival. Renal, hemorrhagic, and neurologic complications were all associated with decreased hospital discharge rates (P?=?0.003, P?=?0.045, and P?<?0.001 respectively). Higher lactate levels (P?=?0.009) and longer duration for normalization (P?<?0.001) were both associated to failure to wean off ECLS support and, hence, to hospital deaths. The weaning rate was 36% prior to November 2012. It increased to 70.3% after that time (P?=?0.009). The mechanical complication rate was 9% with the DP3 system and 32% with the DP2, which was statistically significant (P?=?0.009). Additionally, the lactate levels were higher and decreased more slowly in the patients supported by the DP2. As a result of the shift to the DP3 system, a revised ECLS protocol, and increased ECLS experience, a significant improvement was observed in our clinical outcomes. The results of this study suggested that the combination of a DP3 pump and a Hilite oxygenator in pediatric ECLS circuits may improve durability and reduce circuit-induced complications.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of treating infrapopliteal lesions using a novel drug delivery catheter locally delivering liquid paclitaxel. Background Balloon angioplasty is currently the Gold Standard to treat below-the-knee disease; however, restenosis continues to be a great challenge following these percutaneous revascularization procedures. Methods The Occlusion Perfusion Catheter for Optimal Delivery of Paclitaxel for the Prevention of Endovascular Restenosis (COPPER-A) study?Below-the-Knee Cohort was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, feasibility, and safety study that enrolled 35 patients at 11 participating sites. The safety endpoints at 1, 3, and 6 months were freedom from thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. The efficacy endpoints were primary patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 6 months. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Thirty-five patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 112?±?81.2?mm with the lesion length range of 20?286?mm. At 6-month follow-up, primary patency was 89.3% and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 96.4%. No patients demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1-, 3- and 6-months follow-up intervals. Conclusions The results of this multi-center study demonstrated that infrapopliteal arteries can be safely and effectively treated with liquid paclitaxel using the occlusion perfusion catheter.

AB  - Abstract T cell adaptation is an important peripheral tolerogenic process which ensures that the T cell population can respond effectively to pathogens but remains tolerant to self-antigens. We probed the mechanisms of T cell adaptation using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in which the fate of autopathogenic T cells could be followed. We demonstrated that immunisation with a high dose of myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide and complete Freund's adjuvant failed to effectively initiate EAE, in contrast to low dose MBP peptide immunisation which readily induced disease. The proportion of autopathogenic CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice immunised with a high dose of MBP peptide was not significantly different to mice immunised with a low dose. However, autopathogenic T cells in mice immunised with high dose MBP peptide had an unresponsive phenotype in ex vivo recall assays. Importantly, whilst expression of PD-1 was increased on adapted CD4+ T cells within the CNS, loss of PD-1 function did not prevent the development of the unresponsive state. The lack of a role for PD-1 in the acquisition of the adapted state stands in striking contrast to the reported functional importance of PD-1 in T cell unresponsiveness in other disease models.
