AB  - This paper describes some similarities and differences between contemporary approaches to analysis as practised by ?Freudians? and ?Jungians? in London today. It aims to contribute to mutual understanding between different schools of analysis by showing how the analyst?s interventions can only be understood in terms of the theoretical context from which they arise (cf. ?the analyst?s preconscious?, as discussed by Hamilton [1996]). A discussion of five key themes of Jungian theory is followed by an account of clinical work with a patient who enacted her inner world through the use of material objects brought to the consulting room, presenting difficult technical dilemmas concerning boundaries and enactment. The paper aims to shows how these Jungian themes influenced the analyst?s response, particularly in relation to ideas of symbolic transformation, the unknowable nature of unconscious processes and the purposive orientation of the self towards wholeness and integration.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of deep surgical site infection (DSSI) during hospitalisation after closed tibial plateau fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). We performed this retrospective study at a university-affiliated hospital with an advanced trauma centre. The data of adult patients with closed tibial plateau fractures treated with ORIF from January 2012 to February 2017 were extracted from the electronic medical records. Demographics, injury-related and surgery-related variables of DSSI and non-DSSI groups were compared by univariate test. Multivariate logistic analysis models were used to investigate the independent risk factors. In total, 676 patients with complete data met the inclusion criteria and were included, and of them, 17 developed DSSI (2.51%) during hospitalisation. Approximately 60% (9/17) of DSSI was caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Compared to the non-DSSI group, DSSI patients had a significantly longer stay in hospital (25.8 vs 15.2?days). Independent risk factors of DSSI identified by multivariate analysis were higher BMI (>26.0) (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.27; P?=?0.032), prolonged surgical duration (>138?min) (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.54 to 11.19; P?=?0.005) and current smoking (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.47 to 8.62; P?=?0.01). A relatively low incidence rate of DSSI (2.51%) was found in this study, and several significant risk factors were identified. Smoking cessation programmes should be implemented immediately after hospitalisation, especially for obesity and morbid obesity patients. Detailed and comprehensive preoperative assessment and a considerate operative plan should be guaranteed to reduce surgical duration.

AB  - Abstract Although the aberrant assembly of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) is implicated in the pathogenesis of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the molecular basis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) oligomerization remains undetermined. We investigated the roles of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), an endogenous cross-linker in mSOD1-linked ALS. TG2 interacted preferentially with mSOD1 and promoted its oligomerization in transfected cells. Purified TG2 directly oligomerized recombinant mutant SOD1 and the apo-form of the wild-type SOD1 proteins in a calcium-dependent manner, indicating that misfolded SOD1 is a substrate of TG2. Moreover, the non-cell-autonomous effect of extracellular TG2 on the neuroinflammation was suggested, since the TG2-mediated soluble SOD1 oligomers induced tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1?, and nitric oxide in microglial BV2 cells. TG2 was up-regulated in the spinal cord of pre-symptomatic G93A SOD1 transgenic mice and in the hypoglossal nuclei of mice suffering nerve ligation. Furthermore, inhibition of spinal TG2 by cystamine significantly delayed the progression and reduced SOD1 oligomers and microglial activation. These results indicate a novel role of TG2 in SOD1 oligomer-mediated neuroinflammation, as well as in the involvement in the intracellular aggregation of misfolded SOD1 in ALS. A new role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in misfolded SOD1-linked neuroinflammation has been clarified. TG2 recognized and oligomerized only misfolded forms of SOD1, which robustly activated microglia, and induce the expression of proinflammatory molecules such as iNOS, IL-1?, and TNF-α. The inhibition of spinal cord TG2 of mutant SOD1 transgenic mice successfully suppressed neuroinflammation and delayed the progression.

KW  - autoimmune diabetes
KW  - immune dysfunction
KW  - TCR revision
PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary A single determinant factor for autoimmunity does not exist; disease development probably involves contributions from genetics, the environment and immune dysfunction. Type 1 diabetes is no exception. Genomewide-associated studies (GWAS) analysis in T1D has proved disappointing in revealing contributors to disease prediction; the only reliable marker has been human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Specific HLAs include DR3/DR4/DQ2/DQ8, for example. Because HLA molecules present antigen to T cells, it is reasonable that certain HLA molecules have a higher affinity to present self-antigen. Recent studies have shown that additional polymorphisms in HLA that are restricted to autoimmune conditions are further contributory. A caveat is that not all individuals with the appropriate ?pro-autoimmune? HLA develop an autoimmune disease. Another crucial component is autoaggressive T cells. Finding a biomarker to discriminate autoaggressive T cells has been elusive. However, a subset of CD4 helper cells that express the CD40 receptor have been described as becoming pathogenic. An interesting function of CD40 on T cells is to induce the recombination-activating gene (RAG)1/RAG2 T cell receptor recombination machinery. This observation is contrary to immunology paradigms that changes in TCR molecules cannot take place outside the thymic microenvironment. Alteration in TCR, called TCR revision, not only occurs, but may help to account for the development of autoaggressive T cells. Another interesting facet is that type 1 diabetes (T1D) may be more than a single disease; that is, multiple cellular components contribute uniquely, but result ultimately in the same clinical outcome, T1D. This review considers the process of T cell maturation and how that could favor auto-aggressive T cell development in T1D. The potential contribution of TCR revision to autoimmunity is also considered.

AB  - The progressive deterioration in nutrition status frequently seen in cancer patients is often referred to as cancer cachexia. Unlike starvation, in which fat stores from adipose are depleted and protein is spared from skeletal muscle, neither fat nor protein is spared in cachexia. Cachexia affects nearly half of cancer patients, causing the clinical manifestations of anorexia, muscle wasting, weight loss, early satiety, fatigue, and impaired immune response. Cachexia does not only impede the response to chemotherapy but also is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. According to clinical studies, increasing caloric intake does not necessarily reverse cachexia. The pathophysiology of cachexia involves more complex mechanisms than simply caloric deficiency. The process appears to be mediated by circulating catabolic factors, either secreted by the tumor alone or in concert with host-derived factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1 and IL-6), interferon (IFN-y), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The successful reversal of this process will require in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms involved, which will then enable the development of effective pharmacologic interventions that may not only improve quality of life, but more importantly, improve survival among cancer patients.

AB  - Background: The effect of an oral bile salt binder, cholestyramine, on parenteral nutrition-related hepatic dysfunction and lidocaine metabolism was studied in rats. Methods: Rats were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: the PN group received infusions of dextrose and amino acids; the PNC group was treated the same as the PN group, but also received oral cholestyramine; CF group animals were fed rat food and water. Lidocaine metabolism was studied in livers isolated from animals after 7 days of parenteral nutrition. Results: No differences in liver function test values of PN and PNC groups were detected compared with group fed rat food. However, lidocaine metabolism was found to be significantly reduced in both the PN and PNC groups. Significant reductions were observed in the hepatic extraction ratio (23% and 15%) and in intrinsic clearance (61% and 53%) in PN and PNC animals, respectively (p <.05). Material balance at steady state showed that recovery of lidocaine was threefold higher in the PN group and twofold higher in the PNC group than the rat food group (p <.05). Metabolite-to-drug ratios were determined for each lidocaine metabolite and this revealed significant reductions in N-dealkylation (64% and 57%) and aryl methyl hydroxylation (92% and 86%) in PN and PNC animals, respectively (p <.05). Conclusions: Histologic fmdings suggest that cholestyramine feeding prevented liver dysfunction, possibly through interruption of secondary bile salt reabsorption. However, lidocaine metabolism was still impaired after cholestyramine ingestion; the impairment mechanism remains unknown. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 20:349?356, 1996)
