AB  - Asthma has generally been thought to result from exposure to allergens in infancy leading to atopy, and eventually to airway hyperresponsiveness. There is now evidence that implicates absence of childhood infections as a factor in development of asthma. Childhood infections seem to be important in normal maturation of the immune system, with asthma a manifestation of a persistent ?immature? immune system.

AB  - Abstract Aim Colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy usually have elevated levels of inflammatory markers and experience numerous side effects from chemotherapy thereby leading to poor quality of life. Omega-3 fatty acid and microbial cell preparation (MCP) have been known to provide significant benefits in patients on chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid and MCP in quality of life, chemotherapy side effects and inflammatory markers in colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Methods A double-blind randomized study was carried out with 140 colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Subjects were separated into two groups to receive either placebo or MCP [30 billion colony-forming unit (CFUs) per sachet] at a dose of two sachets daily for 4 weeks, and omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 2 g daily for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were quality of life, side effects of chemotherapy and levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein. Results The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid improved the overall quality of life and alleviated certain side effects of chemotherapy. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid also managed to reduce the level of IL-6 (P = 0.002). There was a significant rise in the placebo group's serum TNF-α (P = 0.048) and IL-6 (P = 0.004). Conclusion The combined supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid may improve quality of life, reduce certain inflammatory biomarkers and relieve certain side effects of chemotherapy in colorectal patients on chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract An acute administration of the hippocampal toxicant trimethyltin (TMT) produced a specific pattern of neuronal necrosis in dentate granule cells with accompanying astrogliosis and initiation of a cytokine response within 24 hours. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DEX), on the pattern of cytokine expression and neuronal degeneration occurring after an acute TMT injection. Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered to 21-day-old male mice 1 hour prior to an injection of TMT hydroxide (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice receiving 0.2 mg/kg DEX received a second injection 6 hours after TMT. Twenty-four hours later, neuronal necrosis and astrogliosis were assessed and found to be similar in animals treated with TMT, either in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Pretreatment with dexamethasone failed to prevent the neurodegeneration and astrogliosis. The TMT-induced injury response was represented in elevations of mRNA levels for the injury-associated host response genes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), EB22/5.3, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The combination of DEX and TMT produced increased elevation in mRNA levels for EB22/5.3 and ICAM, while GFAP levels remained the same as with TMT alone. The injury response from TMT was accompanied by elevations in mRNA levels for the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, TNF?, and interleukin (IL)-1α. Treatment with dexamethasone prior to TMT resulted in significantly elevated levels of TNFα, TNF?, and IL-1α as compared to TMT alone. These data represent the inability of glucocorticoids to downregulate the injury response in rat hippocampus following a systemic injection of TMT and suggest a stimulation and ?priming? of hippocampal cells by dexamethasone.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Continuous monitoring of blood use and feedback on transfusions are effective in decreasing inappropriate blood transfusions. However, traditional methods of monitoring have practical challenges, such as the limited availability of experts and funding. Administrative data including a patient classification system may be employed for risk-adjusted assessment of hospital-wide blood use. Materials and Methods? We conducted an audit of blood use at two hospitals and determined proportions of appropriate blood use at each hospital. We then used administrative data of 587?045 cases provided by 73 hospitals to develop two mathematical models to calculate risk-adjusted use of blood products. The first model is a logistic regression model to predict the percentage of transfused patients. Patient demographics, surgery and diagnostic groups were utilized as predictors of transfusion. The second model is a case-mix adjusted model which predicts hospital-wide use of units of blood products from the distribution of diagnosis-related groups. For each model, the observed to expected (O/E) ratio of blood use in each hospital was calculated. We compared resultant ratios with proportions of appropriate blood use in two of the hospitals studied. Results? Both models showed good prediction abilities. O/E ratios calculated using the two models were relevant to proportions of appropriate transfusions. Conclusions? Risk-adjusted assessments of blood product use based on administrative data allow hospital-wide evaluation of transfusion use. Comparing blood use between different hospitals contributes toward establishing appropriate transfusion practices.

AB  - Abstract Many positive trends in kidney transplantation were notable in 2017. Deceased donor kidney transplant rates and counts continued to rise, the kidney transplant waiting list declined for the third year in a row after decades of growth, and both short- and long-term allograft survival continued to improve year over year. In total, more than 220,000 patients were living in the United States with a functioning allograft. With 3 years of data available since implementation of the new kidney allocation system, better prediction of longer-term results of the allocation policy changes became possible. The data also reveal several areas in need of improvement and attention. Overall, the challenge of providing adequate access to kidney transplant persisted nationally, with additional dramatic regional variation. The proportion of living donor kidney transplants in both adults and children continued to fall, and racial disparities in living donor kidney transplant grew in the past decade.

AB  - Abstract A hallmark of the disease state following severe burn injury is decreased liver function, which results in gross metabolic derangements that compromise patient survival. The underlying mechanisms leading to hepatocyte dysfunction after burn are essentially unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the underlying mechanisms leading to hepatocyte dysfunction and apoptosis after burn. Rats were randomized to either control (no burn) or burn (60% total body surface area burn) and sacrificed at various time-points. Liver was either perfused to isolate primary rat hepatocytes, which were used for in vitro calcium imaging, or liver was harvested and processed for immunohistology, transmission electron microscopy, mitochondrial isolation, mass spectroscopy or Western blotting to determine the hepatic response to burn injury in vivo. We found that thermal injury leads to severely depleted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores and consequent elevated cytosolic calcium concentrations in primary hepatocytes in vitro. Burn-induced ER calcium depletion caused depressed hepatocyte responsiveness to signalling molecules that regulate hepatic homeostasis, such as vasopressin and the purinergic agonist ATP. In vivo, thermal injury resulted in activation of the ER stress response and major alterations in mitochondrial structure and function ? effects which may be mediated by increased calcium release by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Our results reveal that thermal injury leads to dramatic hepatic disturbances in calcium homeostasis and resultant ER stress leading to mitochondrial abnormalities contributing to hepatic dysfunction and apoptosis after burn injury.

AB  - Summary We performed a single centre, double blind, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority study comparing ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block with spinal morphine for the primary outcome of 24-h postoperative morphine consumption in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty under spinal anaesthesia with levobupivacaine. One hundred and eight patients were randomly allocated to receive either ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block with 2 mg.kg?1 levobupivacaine (fascia iliaca group) or spinal morphine 100 ?g plus a sham ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block using saline (spinal morphine group). The pre-defined non-inferiority margin was a median difference between the groups of 10 mg in cumulative intravenous morphine use in the first 24 h postoperatively. Patients in the fascia iliaca group received 25 mg more intravenous morphine than patients in the spinal morphine group (95% CI 9.0?30.5 mg, p < 0.001). Ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block was significantly worse than spinal morphine in the provision of analgesia in the first 24 h after total hip arthroplasty. No increase in side-effects was noted in the spinal morphine group but the study was not powered to investigate all secondary outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Aucubin (AU) is the main active ingredient of Aucuba japonica which has showed many positive effects such as anti-inflammation and liver protection. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. In this research, we explored the effects of AU on the tyloxapol-induced NAFLD in mice and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) induced-3T3L1 cells. Tyloxapol (300 mg/kg) was injected to C57BL/6 mice with aucubin. The differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with or without aucubin after stimulation of apoC-III (100 ?g/mL). In results, aucubin inhibited hyperlipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation by influencing the content of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumour necrosis factor receptor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and IL-6 in blood. AU activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), PPAR? and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the phosphorylation of adenosine 5?-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα), AMPK?, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and protein kinase B (AKT). In conclusion, AU performed the function of hypolipidaemic by its obvious anti-inflammation and antioxidant activity, which may become a kind of new drug targeting at NAFLD.

AB  - Abstract The European Society of Endodontology and the American Association for Endodontists have released position statements and clinical considerations for regenerative endodontics. There is increasing literature on this field since the initial reports of Iwaya et al. (Dental Traumatology, 17, 2001, 185) and Banchs  (i) resolution of clinical signs and symptoms; (ii) further root maturation; and (iii) return of neurogenesis. It is known that results are variable for these objectives, and true regeneration of the pulp/dentine complex is not achieved. Repair derived primarily from the periodontal and osseous tissues has been shown histologically. It is hoped that with the concept of tissue engineering, namely stem cells, scaffolds and signalling molecules, that true pulp regeneration is an achievable goal. This review discusses current knowledge as well as future directions for regenerative endodontics. Patient-centred outcomes such as tooth discolouration and possibly more appointments with the potential for adverse effects needs to be discussed with patients and parents. Based on the classification of Cvek (Endodontics and Dental Traumatology, 8, 1992, 45), it is proposed that regenerative endodontics should be considered for teeth with incomplete root formation although teeth with near or complete root formation may be more suited for conventional endodontic therapy or MTA barrier techniques. However, much is still not known about clinical and biological aspects of regenerative endodontics.

AB  - Summary Objective Recent studies have shown that an elevated 1-h postload plasma glucose (1hPG) is able to identify subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at high risk for future type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, clinical studies about the characteristics of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with elevated 1hPG are lacking. The aim of this study was to analyse the 1hPG level in CHD patients with NGT. Methods A total of 204 CHD patients with NGT were recruited. Subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, echocardiography and coronary angiography. Demographic data were recorded and blood samples obtained. According to the 1hPG cut-off point of 8·6 mm, patients were divided into two groups: 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm (n = 65) and 1hPG < 8·6 mm (n = 139). Results Compared with the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, subjects with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm had a worse metabolic profile, exhibiting significantly higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride level and lower HDL-cholesterol level. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels were higher in the 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm group than in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group. Coronary angiography revealed that single-vessel changes were more frequent in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, but there were no significant differences in the Gensini score. Conclusions Patients with CHD with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm have a worse metabolic profile, higher levels of hsCRP and multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that, in patients with CHD, elevated 1hPG increases coronary risk factors and may be a marker for early-stage glucose intolerance.
