AB  - BACKGROUND Although a majority of the studies conducted to date on platelet (PLT) storage have been focused on PLT hemostatic function, the effects of 4°C PLTs on regulation of endothelial barrier permeability are still not known. In this study, we compared the effects of room temperature (22°C) stored and (4°C) stored PLTs on the regulation of vascular endothelial cell (EC) permeability in vitro and in vivo. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Day 1, Day 5, and Day 7 leukoreduced apheresis PLTs stored at 4 or 22°C were studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, PLT effects on EC permeability and barrier function, adhesion, and impedance aggregometry were investigated. In vivo, using a mouse model of vascular leak, attenuation of vascular leak and circulating PLT numbers were measured. RESULTS Treatment of EC monolayers with Day 5 or Day 7 PLTs, stored at both 22°C and 4°C, resulted in similar decreases in EC permeability on average. However, analysis of individual samples revealed significant variation that was donor dependent. Additional in vitro measurements revealed a decrease in inflammatory mediators, nonspecific PLT-endothelial aggregation and attenuated loss of aggregation over time to TRAP, ASPI, ADP, and collagen with 4°C storage. In mice, while 22°C and 4°C PLTs both demonstrated significant protection against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)-induced vascular leak 22°C PLTs exhibited increased protection compared to 4°C PLTs. Systemic circulating levels of 4°C PLTs were decreased compared to 22°C PLTs. CONCLUSIONS In vitro, 4°C-stored PLTs exhibit a greater capacity to inhibit EC permeability than 22°C-stored PLTs. In vivo, 22°C PLTs provide superior control of vascular leak induced by VEGF-A. This discrepancy may be due to increased clearance of 4°C PLTs from the systemic circulation.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim:? To study the low-molecular-weight metabolites in blood plasma of patients with the progressive disease, gastric cancer, and to characterize different stages from chronic superficial gastritis (CSG) to chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), gastric dysplasia (DYS) and finally gastric cancer (GC). Methods:? We applied gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) to determine metabolites levels in plasma obtained from 80 patients including 19 with CSG, 13 with CAG, 10 with IM, 15 with DYS and 22 with GC (nine preoperation and 13 postoperation). Principal component analysis (PCA) and statistics were used to differentiate the stages and to identify the markers of gastric cancer. Results:? Totally, 223 peaks were detected in GC/TOF-MS and 72 compounds were authentically identified. CSG showed distinct difference from the other groups of CAG, IM, DYS and GC, whose plots clustered closely. IM clustered closely to GC, suggesting similar metabolic patterns of them. Fifteen identified metabolites contributed most to the differentiating between CSG and GC, and characterized different stages of GC. Statistics revealed elevated levels of 2-Hydroxybutyrate, pyroglutamate, glutamate, asparagine, azelaic acid, ornithine, urate, 11-eicosenoic acid, 1-monohexadecanoylglycerol and ?-tocopherol, while downregulation of creatinine, threonate in GC group, indicating that GC patients were obviously involved in oxidative stress, and perturbed metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids. Conclusion:? The metabolic phenotype of CSG is significantly different from GC, while that of IM is similar to it. The discriminatory metabolites characterizing progressive stages from CSG to GC might be the potential markers to indicate a risk of GC.

AB  - Abstract Detection and accurate classification of traumatic tarsal fractures are important for identifying cases requiring surgical intervention. The aim of this prospective, experimental, methods comparison study was to directly compare the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of tarsal computed tomography (CT), ten-view and two-view digital radiographs for detecting traumatic fractures of the canine tarsus. The working hypothesis was that tarsal fractures would be detected with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using CT imaging compared to radiography, and a ten-view would be superior to a two-view radiographic study. Ten cadaver hind limbs of medium to large dogs received a CT scan and ten-view radiographic study before and after induction of fractures with a hydraulic press. All bones included in the radiographic images were assessed for fractures by two observers and gross dissection was used as the gold standard. The two-view radiographic study (dorsoplantar, lateromedial) was created from the ten-view study and reviewed 2 years later. All limbs sustained fractures, the most common locations were the talus and calcaneus (n = 7). The sensitivity of CT was greater than ten-view radiographic study (77% vs. 57%), while the specificity was similar (97% vs. 98%). The sensitivity and specificity of the ten-view and two-view radiograph studies were similar (57% vs. 55%; both 98%). Computed tomography images were reassessed postdissection to determine if failure to identify fractures resulted from observer error. Overall, CT was better than radiography for detecting fractures of the canine tarsus, however there was little improvement with ten-view compared to two-view radiographic studies.

AB  - SUMMARY With the advent of standard flow cytometric methods using two-colour fluorescence on samples of whole blood, it is possible to establish the ranges of CD3. CD 4 and CDS T lymphocyte subsets in the routine laboratory, and also to assist the definition of HIV-1-related deviations from these normal values. In 676 HIV-1-seronegative individuals the lymphocyte subset percentages and absolute counts were determined. The samples taken mostly in the morning. The groups included heterosexual controls, people with various clotting disorders but without lymphocyte abnormalities as well as seronegative homosexual men as the appropriate controls for the HIV-1-infected groups. The stability of CD4% and CD8% values was demonstrated throughout life, and in children CD4 values < 25% could be regarded as abnormal. The absolute counts of all T cell subsets decreased from birth until the age of 10 years. In adolescents and adults the absolute numbers (mean±s.d.) of lymphocytes, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells were 1·90±0·55, 1·45±0·46, 0·83±0·29 and 0·56± 0·23 ± 109/l, respectively. In patients with haemophilia A and B the mean values did not differ significantly. In homosexual men higher CD8 levels were seen compared with heterosexual men and 27% had an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio but mostly without CD4 lymphopenia (CD4<0·4 ± 109/l). However, some healthy uninfected people were?physiologically? lymphopenic without having inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. When the variations?within persons? were studied longitudinally over a 5-year period, the absolute CD4 counts tended to be fixed at different levels. As a marked contrast, over 60% of asymptomatic HIV-1+ patients exhibited low CD4 counts <0·4 ± 109/l together with inverted CD4/CD8 ratios. Such combined changes among the heterosexual and HIV-1-seronegative homosexual groups were as rare as 1·4% and 3%, respectively. For this reason, when the lymphocyte tests show <0·4 ± 109/l CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio of less than unity, the individuals need to be investigated further for chronicity of this disorder, the signs of viral infections such as HIV-1 and other causes of immunodeficiency.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osseointegration, the direct functional and structural connection between device and bone is influenced by multiple factors such as implant macrogeometry and surgical technique. This study investigated the effects of osseodensification drilling techniques on implant stability and osseointegration using trabecular metal (TM) and tapered-screw vent (TSV) implants in a low-density bone. Six skeletally mature sheep were used where six osteotomy sites were prepared in each of the ilia, (n?=?2/technique: Regular [R] (subtractive), clockwise [CW], and counterclockwise [CCW]). One TM and one TSV implant was subsequently placed with R osteotomy sites prepared using a conventional (subtractive) drilling protocol as recommended by the implant manufacturer for low density bone. CW and CCW drilling sites were subjected to osseodensification (OD) (additive) drilling. Evaluation of insertion torque as a function of drilling technique showed implants subjected to R drilling yielded a significant lower insertion torque relative to samples implanted in OD (CW/CCW) sites (p?<?0.05). Histomorphometric analysis shows that the osseodensification demonstrates significantly greater values for bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO). Histological analysis shows the presence of bone remnants, which acted as nucleating surfaces for osteoblastic bone deposition, facilitating the bridging of bone between the surrounding native bone and implant surface, as well as within the open spaces of the trabecular network in the TM implants. Devices that were implanted via OD demonstrated atemporal biomechanical stability and osseointegration. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the impact of transurethral resection of the prostate on quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Methods A group of 49 consecutive patients with and 487 without prior transurethral resection of the prostate responded to the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire before, on the last day, and a median time of 2?months and 16?months after external beam radiotherapy (70?78?Gy). A matched-pair analysis was used to avoid the influence of treatment-associated confounding factors, including dose, treatment volume and hormonal therapy. Results Significantly smaller acute urinary score changes relative to baseline levels resulted with versus without prior transurethral resection of the prostate (mean function/bother score decrease of 3/6 vs 18/21?points at the end of radiotherapy; P?<?0.01), affecting urinary incontinence (pads to control urinary leakage in 4% vs 24%; P?=?0.03) and irritative/obstructive symptoms (big/moderate problem with weak urinary stream in 11% vs 37%; P?=?0.02). As opposed to acute changes, transurethral resection of the prostate was a significant predisposing factor for a long-term urinary function score decrease >10?points (20% vs 6% of patients with vs without prior resection; P?=?0.04). Urinary incontinence risk was higher for patients with a longer time from resection to radiotherapy. Conclusions Transurethral resection of the prostate significantly affects acute (considerably fewer symptoms) and long-term (relevant toxicity in some cases) urinary quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

AB  - Background: Clinical studies have explored the relationship between toothbrushing and development of gingival recession (GR), but relevant GR data for the multidirectional power toothbrush (PT) are lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of brushing with either a multidirectional PT or American Dental Association reference manual toothbrush (MT) on mid-buccal preexisting GR (PreGR) during 12 months. Methods: This was a 12-month prospective, single-masked, parallel-group, randomized, controlled clinical study. Healthy participants without periodontitis with at least two teeth showing PreGR ≥2 mm were randomized to a group brushing with either an MT or PT. The primary outcome parameter was change at sites with PreGR ≥2 mm. All clinically based GR measurements were performed by one calibrated examiner at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were changes of GR at all mid-buccal sites (with or without PreGR), changes in percentage of GR sites demonstrating a change of ≥1 mm, and changes in probing depths. Results: A total of 107 participants completed the study (PT: 55, MT: 52). During the 12-month study period the mean recession at sites with PreGR ≥2 mm decreased significantly from 2.2 to 2.1 mm in both groups (P <0.05). The extent of GR parameters did not differ between MT and PT groups at any time point. GR evaluated clinically and on stone casts was well correlated. Conclusion: Neither the PT nor MT led to an increase in PreGR during 12 months of daily use.

AB  - Summary This study evaluated the costs of intensive care in Trinidad applying the cost-blocks method. Data regarding demographics, severity of illness, therapeutic interventions and length of stay were prospectively recorded for 111 patients admitted to four intensive care units during a 3-month period. Annual costs, cost per admission, cost per patient-day and cost per therapeutic intervention score point were derived. The cost-block for staff, especially medical staff, was the largest proportion of the expenditure. Process of care and outcome were comparable, whereas costs were lower than the developed countries. The median cost per intensive care unit bed per year and cost per patient per day in Trinidad were £133?117 and £366, respectively, in comparison with £265?163 and £904 in the UK. The cost-blocks method is a useful framework for evaluating the costs of intensive care and for comparing costs between countries.

AB  - Abstract Despite very significant technical and software improvements in flow cytometry (FCM) since the 1980's, the demand for a cytometric technology combining both quantitative cell analysis and morphological documentation in Cytomics became evident. Improvements in microtechnology and computing permit nowadays similar quantitative and stoichiometric single cell-based high-throughput analyses by microscopic instruments, like Slide-Based Cytometry (SBC). SBC and related techniques offer unique tools to perform complex immunophenotyping, thereby enabling diagnostic procedures during early disease stages. Multicolor or polychromatic analysis of cells by SBC is of special importance not only as a cytomics technology platform but also because of low quantities of required reagents and biological material. The exact knowledge of the location of each cell on the slide permits repetitive restaining and reanalysis of specimens. Various separate measurements of the same specimen can be ultimately fused to one database increasing the information obtained per cell. Relocation and optical evaluation of cells as typical SBC feature, can be of integral importance for cytometric analysis, since artifacts can be excluded and morphology of measured cells can be documented. Progress in cell analytic: In the SBC, new horizons can be opened by the new techniques of structural and functional analysis with the high resolution from intracellular and membrane (confocal microscopy, nanoscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and tissue level (tissomics), to organ and organism level (in vivo cytometry, optical whole body imaging). Predictive medicine aims at the detection of changes in patient's state prior to the manifestation of the disease or the complication. Such instances concern immune consequences of surgeries or noninfectious posttraumatic shock in intensive care patients or the pretherapeutic identification of high risk patients in cancer cytostatic therapy. Preventive anti-infectious or anti-shock therapy as well as curative chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation may provide better survival chances for patient at concomitant cost containment. Predictive medicine-guided optimization of therapy could lead to individualized medicine that gives significant therapeutic effect and may lower or abrogate potential therapeutic side effects. The 10th Leipziger Workshop combined with the 3rd International Workshop on SBC aimed to offer new methods in Image- and Slide-Based Cytometry for solutions in clinical research. It moved towards practical applications in the clinics and the clinical laboratory. This development will be continued in 2006 at the upcoming Leipziger Workshop and the International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry. ? 2005 International Society for Analytical Cytology
