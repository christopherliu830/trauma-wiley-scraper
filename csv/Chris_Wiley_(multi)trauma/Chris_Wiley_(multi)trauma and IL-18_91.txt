AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the success of strategies ?including replacing petrol with aviation gasoline (avgas) in the fuel supply, and employment and skills-training programs targeting young people ?in reducing petrol sniffing at Maningrida, an isolated Aboriginal community in northern Australia. MethodsA follow-up study of 13 Aboriginals who were non-sniffers, 15 who were ex-sniffers and 27 who were petrol sniffers in 1992 was conducted by questionnaire in 1994, 20 months after intervention strategies were commenced; 11 non-sniffers, 11 ex-sniffers and 18 petrol sniffers, respectively, participated. Main outcome measuresPetrol-sniffing status, changes in employment status, blood lead levels of the participants, and community crime statistics. ResultsAfter intervention strategies in Maningrida, petrol sniffing ceased, with related crime falling markedly. Employment increased significantly among petrol sniffers, from 7% to 63% (x2= 11.53; df= 1; P< 0.001). Only two petrol sniffers were reported to have continued petrol sniffing elsewhere. Apart from one of these individuals, who had recently returned to Maningrida, blood lead levels fell significantly in those with a history of petrol sniffing, indicating they had not continued to sniff avgas, which contains lead additives (0.8 g/L). ConclusionsWhile avgas introduction was a key element in eliminating petrol sniffing, its apparent lack of success as a single intervention elsewhere indicates the importance of widespread community resolve against petrol sniffing and the development of coordinated employment strategies in successfully eliminating the practice and reducing associated social disruption.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the impact of transurethral resection of the prostate on quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Methods A group of 49 consecutive patients with and 487 without prior transurethral resection of the prostate responded to the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire before, on the last day, and a median time of 2?months and 16?months after external beam radiotherapy (70?78?Gy). A matched-pair analysis was used to avoid the influence of treatment-associated confounding factors, including dose, treatment volume and hormonal therapy. Results Significantly smaller acute urinary score changes relative to baseline levels resulted with versus without prior transurethral resection of the prostate (mean function/bother score decrease of 3/6 vs 18/21?points at the end of radiotherapy; P?<?0.01), affecting urinary incontinence (pads to control urinary leakage in 4% vs 24%; P?=?0.03) and irritative/obstructive symptoms (big/moderate problem with weak urinary stream in 11% vs 37%; P?=?0.02). As opposed to acute changes, transurethral resection of the prostate was a significant predisposing factor for a long-term urinary function score decrease >10?points (20% vs 6% of patients with vs without prior resection; P?=?0.04). Urinary incontinence risk was higher for patients with a longer time from resection to radiotherapy. Conclusions Transurethral resection of the prostate significantly affects acute (considerably fewer symptoms) and long-term (relevant toxicity in some cases) urinary quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osseointegration, the direct functional and structural connection between device and bone is influenced by multiple factors such as implant macrogeometry and surgical technique. This study investigated the effects of osseodensification drilling techniques on implant stability and osseointegration using trabecular metal (TM) and tapered-screw vent (TSV) implants in a low-density bone. Six skeletally mature sheep were used where six osteotomy sites were prepared in each of the ilia, (n?=?2/technique: Regular [R] (subtractive), clockwise [CW], and counterclockwise [CCW]). One TM and one TSV implant was subsequently placed with R osteotomy sites prepared using a conventional (subtractive) drilling protocol as recommended by the implant manufacturer for low density bone. CW and CCW drilling sites were subjected to osseodensification (OD) (additive) drilling. Evaluation of insertion torque as a function of drilling technique showed implants subjected to R drilling yielded a significant lower insertion torque relative to samples implanted in OD (CW/CCW) sites (p?<?0.05). Histomorphometric analysis shows that the osseodensification demonstrates significantly greater values for bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO). Histological analysis shows the presence of bone remnants, which acted as nucleating surfaces for osteoblastic bone deposition, facilitating the bridging of bone between the surrounding native bone and implant surface, as well as within the open spaces of the trabecular network in the TM implants. Devices that were implanted via OD demonstrated atemporal biomechanical stability and osseointegration. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Abstract Background Intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (IRFA) is added to surgery to obtain hepatic clearance of liver metastases. Complications occurring in IRFA should differ from those associated with wedge or anatomic liver resection. Methods Patients with liver metastases treated with IRFA from 2000 to 2010 were retrospectively analysed. Postoperative outcomes are reported according to the Clavien?Dindo system of classification. Results A total of 151 patients underwent 173 procedures for 430 metastases. Of these, 97 procedures involved IRFA plus liver resection and 76 involved IRFA only. The median number of lesions treated by IRFA was two (range: 1?11). A total of 123 (71.1%) procedures were carried out in patients who had received preoperative chemotherapy. The mortality rate was 1.2%. Thirty (39.5%) IRFA-only patients and 45 (46.4%) IRFA-plus-resection patients presented complications. Immediate complications (n = 4) were associated with IRFA plus resection. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, previous abdominal surgery or hepatic resection, body mass index, number of IRFA procedures, portal pedicle clamping, total vascular exclusion and preoperative chemotherapy were not associated with a greater number of complications of Grade III or higher severity. Length of surgery >4?h [odds ratio (OR) 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1?6.3; P < 0.05] and an associated contaminating procedure (OR 3.72, 95% CI 1.53?9.06; P < 0.005) led to a greater frequency of complications of Grade III or higher. Conclusions Mortality and morbidity after IRFA, with or without resection, are low. Nevertheless, long interventions and concurrent bowel operations increase the risk for septic complications.

AB  - Background and purpose:? This is the first single center experience illustrating the effectiveness of the penumbra system (PS) in the treatment of large vessel occlusive disease in the arena of acute ischaemic stroke. The PS is an innovative mechanical thrombectomy device, employed in the revascularization of large cerebral vessel occlusions in patients via the utilization of an aspiration platform. Methods:? This is a prospective, non-randomized controlled trial evaluating the clinical and functional outcome in 29 patients with acute intra-cranial occlusions consequent to mechanical thrombectomy by the PS either as mono-therapy or as an adjunct to current standard of care. Patients were evaluated by a neurologist and treated by our in house interventional neuro-radiologists. Primary end-points were revascularization of the occluded target vessel to TIMI grade 2 or 3 and neurological outcome as measured by an improvement in the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score after the procedure. Results:? Complete revascularization (TIMI 3) was achieved in 21/29 (72.4%) of patients. Partial revascularization (TIMI 2) was established in 4/29 (13.8%) of patients. Revascularization failed in four (13.8%) patients. Nineteen (19) patients (65.5%) had at least a four-point improvement in NIHSS scores. Modified Rankin scale scores of ≤2 were seen in 37.9% of patients. There were no device-related adverse events. Symptomatic intra-cranial hemorrhage occurred in 7% of patients. Conclusions:? The PS has the potential of exercising a significant impact in the interventional treatment of ischaemic stroke in the future.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines play a crucial role in tumor initiation and progression. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-6 is a key factor by driving tumor progression from benign to malignant, invasive tumors in the HaCaT-model of human skin carcinoma. IL-6 activates STAT3 and directly stimulates proliferation and migration of the benign noninvasive HaCaT-ras A-5 cells in vitro. Furthermore, IL-6 induces a complex, reciprocally regulated cytokine network in the tumor cells that includes inflammatory and angiogenic factors such as IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF and MCP-1. These IL-6 effects lead to tumor cell invasion in organotypic cultures in vitro and to the formation of malignant and invasive s.c. tumors in vivo. Tumor invasion is supported by the IL-6 induced overexpression of MMP-1 in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate a key function of IL-6 in the progression of skin SCCs by regulating a complex cytokine and protease network and suggest new therapeutic approaches to target this central player in skin carcinogenesis.

AB  - Summary This study evaluated the costs of intensive care in Trinidad applying the cost-blocks method. Data regarding demographics, severity of illness, therapeutic interventions and length of stay were prospectively recorded for 111 patients admitted to four intensive care units during a 3-month period. Annual costs, cost per admission, cost per patient-day and cost per therapeutic intervention score point were derived. The cost-block for staff, especially medical staff, was the largest proportion of the expenditure. Process of care and outcome were comparable, whereas costs were lower than the developed countries. The median cost per intensive care unit bed per year and cost per patient per day in Trinidad were £133?117 and £366, respectively, in comparison with £265?163 and £904 in the UK. The cost-blocks method is a useful framework for evaluating the costs of intensive care and for comparing costs between countries.

AB  - ABSTRACT In the United States? battle against sexual human trafficking, the nascent integration of criminal justice and social service agency work is severely hampered by an array of information problems, which are amenable to mitigation from Information Studies scholars. Naïve information organization and infrastructure design undermine many of these integrated projects. More critical however, is their general focus on process with little reference to supporting victims? personal agency through their required mastery of information resources. Using a systematic analysis of current scholarly research articles on sexual human trafficking, this study identified 31 research and application projects developed in reference to concrete support for government and social service agencies. For each study, analysis examines the nature of the victims? personal information agency, as well as the primary actors in each information situation. Disciplinary distinctions regarding the human rights approach to prostitution, underpin many of Information Studies? missed opportunities for contributing to agency effectiveness.

AB  - ABSTRACT Knee injuries cause structural damage and acute inflammation that initiates the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a member of a family of enzymes that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in normal development of the musculoskeletal system, but may increase ROS production to harmful levels after joint injury. The role of ROS in both normal joint homeostasis and injury is poorly understood, but inhibition of excessive ROS production by Nox4 after joint injury could be protective to the joint, decreasing oxidative stress, and initiation of PTOA. Knee injuries were simulated using inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary human chondrocytes and a non-invasive mouse model of PTOA in C57BL/6N and Nox4 knockout mice. There is an acute decrease in Nox4 activity within 24?h after injury in both systems, followed by a subsequent sustained low-level increase, a novel finding not seen in any other system. Inhibition of Nox4 activity by GKT137831 was protective against early structural changes after non-invasive knee injury in a mouse model. Nox4 knockout mice had significant differences in structural and mechanical properties of bone, providing further evidence for the role of Nox4 in development of joint tissues and biochemical response after joint injury. Nox4 plays a significant role in the acute phase after joint injury, and targeted inhibition of inflammation caused by Nox4 may be protective against early joint changes in the pathogenesis of PTOA. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Aims The SUCCESS trial is a phase III study of the Vesair? balloon in the United States for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The purpose of this manuscript is to present the 3 month primary efficacy and tolerability outcome data. Methods The SUCCESS trial is a multi-center, prospective, single blind, randomized, sham-controlled study. Subjects were randomized on a 2.33:1 basis to either Vesair balloon placement or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of both a >50% reduction from baseline on 1?h provocative pad weight test and a ≥10-point improvement in symptoms on the Incontinence Quality of Life Survey (I-QOL) questionnaire assessed at the 3 month study visit. Results A total of 221 subjects were randomized, including 157 treatment arm subjects and 64 controls. The 3 month composite primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 42.1% of treatment group subjects compared with 28.1% of controls on intention-to-treat analysis (p?=?0.046). Treatment arm subjects were significantly more likely to report at least a 50% reduction in incontinence frequency on 7-day voiding diary (55.2% vs 32.3%, P?=?0.002, ITT) and more commonly reported their incontinence was improved on Patient Global Impression of Improvement in Incontinence (PGI-I) at 3 months compared with controls (58.0% vs 37.7%, P?=?0.007, ITT). No device- or procedure-related serious adverse events nor unanticipated adverse events were reported and no cases of urinary retention were observed. All adverse events fully resolved following balloon removal. Conclusions In this phase three trial, the Vesair intravesical balloon achieved 3 month primary and secondary endpoints both objectively and subjectively.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Keeping a small stock of liquid plasma readily available for transfusion is common practise in Sweden. We report data on complement activation markers in plasma components during storage in the liquid state and the kinetics of C3a-desArg after transfusion of autologous plasma with high content of C3a-desArg. Material and Methods? Plasma components were prepared by apheresis or from whole blood. C3 fragments (C3a-desArg, C3d,g, iC3), and soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9) were investigated. C3a-desArg kinetics was investigated in regular apheresis donors. Results? Apheresis plasma prepared by membrane centrifugation had significantly higher level of C3a-desArg, C3d,g and sC5b-9 from day 0 and low iC3, than plasma prepared by other methods. By storage day 7, C3a-desArg -levels were above the reference value in 88% of all components. After re-infusion of autologous plasma with high C3a-desArg content, there were rapid a1 and a2-distribution followed by a slower b-elimination phase. Conclusion? Plasma components prepared by different methods and stored in the liquid phase differ significantly in the amount and timing of complement activation. C3a-desArg present in plasma is rapidly eliminated after transfusion. Autologous plasma could be used to study complement kinetics in different clinical situations.
