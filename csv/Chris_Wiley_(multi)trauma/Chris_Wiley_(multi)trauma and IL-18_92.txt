AB  - Background and Objectives? Keeping a small stock of liquid plasma readily available for transfusion is common practise in Sweden. We report data on complement activation markers in plasma components during storage in the liquid state and the kinetics of C3a-desArg after transfusion of autologous plasma with high content of C3a-desArg. Material and Methods? Plasma components were prepared by apheresis or from whole blood. C3 fragments (C3a-desArg, C3d,g, iC3), and soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9) were investigated. C3a-desArg kinetics was investigated in regular apheresis donors. Results? Apheresis plasma prepared by membrane centrifugation had significantly higher level of C3a-desArg, C3d,g and sC5b-9 from day 0 and low iC3, than plasma prepared by other methods. By storage day 7, C3a-desArg -levels were above the reference value in 88% of all components. After re-infusion of autologous plasma with high C3a-desArg content, there were rapid a1 and a2-distribution followed by a slower b-elimination phase. Conclusion? Plasma components prepared by different methods and stored in the liquid phase differ significantly in the amount and timing of complement activation. C3a-desArg present in plasma is rapidly eliminated after transfusion. Autologous plasma could be used to study complement kinetics in different clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract Dimemorfan, an antitussive and a sigma-1 (σ1) receptor agonist, has been reported to display neuroprotective properties. We set up an animal model of ischemic stroke injury by inducing cerebral ischemia (for 1?h) followed by reperfusion (for 24?h) (CI/R) in rats to examine the protective effects and action mechanisms of dimemorfan against stroke-induced damage. Treatment with dimemorfan (1.0??g/kg and 10??g/kg, i.v.) either 15?min before ischemia or at the time of reperfusion, like the putative σ1 receptor agonist, PRE084 (10??g/kg, i.v.), ameliorated the size of the infarct zone by 67?72% or 51?52%, respectively, which was reversed by pre-treatment with the selective σ1 receptor antagonist, BD1047 (20??g/kg, i.v.). Major pathological mechanisms leading to CI/R injury including excitotoxicity, oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis are all downstream events initiated by excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Dimemorfan treatment (10??g/kg, i.v., at the time of reperfusion) inhibited the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1?, which occurred in parallel with decreases in neutrophil infiltration, activation of inflammation-related signals (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-?B, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1), expression of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase, oxidative/nitrosative tissue damage (lipid peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and 8-hydroxy-guanine formation), and apoptosis in the ipsilateral cortex after CI/R injury. Dimemorfan treatment at the time of reperfusion, although did not prevent an early rise of glutamate level, significantly prevented subsequent glutamate accumulation after reperfusion. This inhibitory effect was lasted for more than 4?h and was reversed by pre-treatment with BD1047. These results suggest that dimemorfan activates the σ1 receptor to reduce glutamate accumulation and then suppresses initiation of inflammation-related events and signals as well as induction of oxidative and nitrosative stresses, leading to reductions in tissue damage and cell death. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that dimemorfan exhibits protective effects against ischemic stroke in CI/R rats probably through modulation of σ1 receptor-dependent signals to prevent subsequent glutamate accumulation and its downstream pathologic events.

AB  - Abstract Adolescence, the period lasting from the onset of puberty to the emergence of physical and sexual maturity, is a period of social change for many species including chimpanzees. Several reports have implicitly linked the physiological changes that occur during male chimpanzee adolescence to significant disruption in the social group, which in turn may result in serious agonism and wounding. To assess the association between adolescent males and wounding rates, 38 institutions housing 399 chimpanzees among 59 social groups, recorded all wounds incurred by chimpanzees over a 6-month period. The rate of wounding did not differ between groups with or without adolescent males. Adolescent males received the most wounds, but were no more likely to cause wounds than group members of any other sex?age class. Social groups with multiple adult males experienced lower wounding rates than those with a single adult male. Results indicate that (1) adolescent male chimpanzees may receive, but not inflict, more wounds than chimpanzees in other sex?age classes; and (2) management strategies that support natural social groupings may control and limit group agonism.

AB  - Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were analysed in 502 consecutive patients admitted to our stroke unit Elevated ACA levels ≥11 units) were found in 20 of 396 patients (5%) with ischemic stroke and TIA, in none of 42 patients with cerebral haematomas and in five of 64 patients (8%) with other diagnoses than stroke. There were no statistically significant differences in occurrence of ACA in these groups. Markedly elevated ACA levels (> 20 units) were found in nine of the 396 patients (2%) with TIA/ischemic stroke. The frequency of ACA was higher in the age group 40?50 years (15%) than in the age group 50?90 years (3.6?6.0%). Re-examination in 18 of the 20 patients with ischemic stroke and elevated ACA levels after 26?395 days (mean 100 days) showed that in 10 patients ACA levels were lower (difference ≥ 6 units = 2 SD), compared to the initial value, whereas eight patients had unchanged ACA levels. The occurrence of previous deep venous thrombosis was significantly more common in patients with elevated ACA levels, otherwise there were no differences concerning earlier stroke, risk factor analysis or other laboratory parameters between patients with and without elevated ACA levels. In conclusion, we found elevated ACA levels in patients with ischemic stroke at a rather low prevalence as compared to most previous studies. The clinical relevance of ACA is uncertain, especially in patients with multiple risk factors. We recommend screening for ACA only in stroke patients < 50 years of age, or when the antiphospholipid syndrome is suspected.

AB  - Abstract The study was aimed to explore the functions of circulating fibrocytes (CFs) on injury repair in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) mice model and its clinical value as a biomarker for ALI/ARDS. ALI/ARDS mice model was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of ALI/ARDS model and flow cytometry was used to measure CFs defined as cells positive for CD45 and collagen-1. Histological changes of lung tissues were evaluated by H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. The correlations of CFs counts with damnification of lung tissue and the severity of pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of collagen-1. ELISA was applied to determine cytokine CXCL12 concentration. Clinical relevance between CFs and ALI/ARDS was investigated. The greater number of CFs in the ALI/ARDS group implied higher degree of lung injury and more severe pulmonary fibrosis. The protein expression of collagen-1 and concentration of cytokine CXCL12 in ALI/ARDS group were higher than that in control group. Clinical and prognostic analysis revealed the higher injury degree and death rates in ALI/ARDS group than those in control group, and identified a greater severity and mortality for patients with ARDS than those with ALI. ROC curve analysis indicated the counts of CFs greater than 5.85% can predict death rates with AUC?=?0.928. CFs had an inhibitory effect on injury repair in ALI/ARDS mice model. This might be unfavorable as a clinical marker for progression of ALI/ARDS.

AB  - Abstract Bacterial infection is a common wound complication that can significantly delay healing. Classical local therapies for infected wounds are expensive and are frequently ineffective. One alternative therapy is photodynamic therapy (PDT). We conducted a systematic review to clarify whether PDT is useful for bacteria-infected wounds in animal models. PubMed and Medline were searched for articles on PDT in infected skin wounds in animals. The language was limited to English. Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The overall study methodological quality was moderate, with a low-moderate risk of bias. The animal models were mice and rats. The wounds were excisional, burn, and abrasion wounds. Wound size ranged from 6?mm in diameter to 1.5???1.5 cm2. Most studies inoculated the wounds with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven and 17 studies showed that the PDT of infected wounds significantly decreased wound size and bacterial counts, respectively. Six, four, and two studies examined the effect of PDT on infected wound-cytokine levels, wound-healing time, and body weight, respectively. Most indicated that PDT had beneficial effects on these variables. PDT accelerated bacteria-infected wound healing in animals by promoting wound closure and killing bacteria.

AB  - Summary Background? Formation of colonic diverticula, via herniation of the colonic wall, is responsible for the development of diverticulosis and consequently diverticular disease. Diverticular disease can be associated with numerous debilitating abdominal and gastrointestinal symptoms (including pain, bloating, nausea, constipation and diarrhoea). Aims? To review the state of treatment for diverticular disease and its complications, and briefly discuss potential future therapies. Methods? PubMed and recent conference abstracts were searched for articles describing the treatment of diverticular disease. Results? Many physicians will recommend alterations to lifestyle and increasing fibre consumption. Empirical antibiotics remain the mainstay of therapy for patients with diverticular disease and rifaximin seems to be the best choice. In severe or relapsing disease, surgical intervention is often the only remaining treatment option. Although novel treatment options are yet to become available, the addition of therapies based on mesalazine (mesalamine) and probiotics may enhance treatment efficacy. Conclusions? Data suggest that diverticular disease may share many of the hallmarks of other, better-characterized inflammatory bowel diseases; however, treatment options for patients with diverticular disease are scarce, revolving around antibiotic treatment and surgery. There is a need for a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of diverticular disease to design treatment regimens accordingly.

AB  - Aims The SUCCESS trial is a phase III study of the Vesair? balloon in the United States for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The purpose of this manuscript is to present the 3 month primary efficacy and tolerability outcome data. Methods The SUCCESS trial is a multi-center, prospective, single blind, randomized, sham-controlled study. Subjects were randomized on a 2.33:1 basis to either Vesair balloon placement or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of both a >50% reduction from baseline on 1?h provocative pad weight test and a ≥10-point improvement in symptoms on the Incontinence Quality of Life Survey (I-QOL) questionnaire assessed at the 3 month study visit. Results A total of 221 subjects were randomized, including 157 treatment arm subjects and 64 controls. The 3 month composite primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 42.1% of treatment group subjects compared with 28.1% of controls on intention-to-treat analysis (p?=?0.046). Treatment arm subjects were significantly more likely to report at least a 50% reduction in incontinence frequency on 7-day voiding diary (55.2% vs 32.3%, P?=?0.002, ITT) and more commonly reported their incontinence was improved on Patient Global Impression of Improvement in Incontinence (PGI-I) at 3 months compared with controls (58.0% vs 37.7%, P?=?0.007, ITT). No device- or procedure-related serious adverse events nor unanticipated adverse events were reported and no cases of urinary retention were observed. All adverse events fully resolved following balloon removal. Conclusions In this phase three trial, the Vesair intravesical balloon achieved 3 month primary and secondary endpoints both objectively and subjectively.

AB  - Abstract In the present study we investigated whether donor gender of the effects of sex hormones play the greater role in the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. Kidneys of male and female Fisher rats were orthotopically transplanted into castrated male Lewis recipients. Animals were treated with testosterone, estradiol, or vehicle and the kidneys were harvested 20 weeks after transplantation for histological, immunohistological, and molecular analysis. Testosterone treatment resulted in increased proteinuria and profound glomerulo-sclerosis, irrespective of donor gender. In addition, mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) and platelet-derived growth factor-A and B (PDGF-A and B) chains were enhanced in these allografts. Estradiol reduced glomerulosclerosis and mononuclear cell infiltration in allografts of both genders that paralleled a decreased mRNA expression of TGF-?1, PDGF-A and B. No donor gender-related differences were noted in vehicle-treated animals. Our findings demonstrate that sex hormones rather than donor gender have a significant impact on chronic allograft nephropathy.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: To define the prevalence of tracheotomy tube complications and evaluate risk factors (RFs) associated with their occurrence. Study Design: Multi-institution historical cohort. Methods: Data regarding tracheotomy tube complications from consecutive surgeries performed across eight participating institutions between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 were retrospectively collected. Patient demographics, comorbidities, physician specialty, and surgical technique were recorded and statistically analyzed to identify the incidence of surgical complications following tracheotomy and associated RFs. Results: The charts of 1,175 tracheotomy procedures were reviewed from eight academic institutions. Otolaryngologists performed 66.2% of the tracheotomies. Intraoperative, early (<1 week), and late complication rates were 1.4%, 5.6%, and 7.1%, respectively. Postoperative bleeding was identified as the most common early complication (2.6%), whereas airway stenosis was the most common late complication (1.7%). The use of outer flange security sutures to anchor the tracheostomy tube was negatively associated with the incidence of early complication (P < .0001). The use of large endotracheal tubes (size >7.5) and obesity were associated with the development of airway stenosis (P < .05).Twenty-two percent of patients undergoing tracheotomy died during hospitalization. Conclusions: Perioperative tracheotomy complications are rare; however, the rate of death for all causes is high (22%) in this population. Obesity and the use of endotracheal tubes over 7.5 in size are major risk factors for the development of airway stenosis. Although percutaneous tracheotomy resulted in a significantly higher rate of postoperative bleeding (6.6%) than the open method (1.9%) (P < .05), the use of outer flange tracheostomy tube sutures may reduce this complication.Laryngoscope, 122:38?45, 2012

AB  - Background Globally, nurses becoming more aware of getting better prepared for disaster relief, but in China, disaster nursing knowledge, courses and research are still limited. Introduction China has long been prone to disasters, but disaster nursing education and training is in its infancy. Aim This study explored the skills, knowledge and attitudes required by registered nurses from across China who worked in the aftermath of three large earthquakes to try to determine future disaster nursing education requirements. Method The Questionnaire of?Nurses'?Disaster?Nursing?Skills at?Earthquake?Sites, assessing nursing skills, knowledge and attitudes, was distributed to 139 registered nurses in 38 hospitals in 13 provinces across China who had worked in one or more earthquake disaster zones. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data, and content analysis for qualitative data. Results Eighty-nine questionnaires were returned, a response rate of 68.3%. No respondent had ever received specific disaster nursing training prior to their post-earthquake nursing. Skills most often used by respondents were haemostasis bandaging, fixation, manual handling, observation and monitoring, debridement and dressing, and mass casualty transportation. Respondents identified that the most important groups of skills required were cardiopulmonary resuscitation; haemostasis, bandaging, fixation, and manual handling; and emergency management.
