AB  - Aims The SUCCESS trial is a phase III study of the Vesair? balloon in the United States for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The purpose of this manuscript is to present the 3 month primary efficacy and tolerability outcome data. Methods The SUCCESS trial is a multi-center, prospective, single blind, randomized, sham-controlled study. Subjects were randomized on a 2.33:1 basis to either Vesair balloon placement or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of both a >50% reduction from baseline on 1?h provocative pad weight test and a ≥10-point improvement in symptoms on the Incontinence Quality of Life Survey (I-QOL) questionnaire assessed at the 3 month study visit. Results A total of 221 subjects were randomized, including 157 treatment arm subjects and 64 controls. The 3 month composite primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 42.1% of treatment group subjects compared with 28.1% of controls on intention-to-treat analysis (p?=?0.046). Treatment arm subjects were significantly more likely to report at least a 50% reduction in incontinence frequency on 7-day voiding diary (55.2% vs 32.3%, P?=?0.002, ITT) and more commonly reported their incontinence was improved on Patient Global Impression of Improvement in Incontinence (PGI-I) at 3 months compared with controls (58.0% vs 37.7%, P?=?0.007, ITT). No device- or procedure-related serious adverse events nor unanticipated adverse events were reported and no cases of urinary retention were observed. All adverse events fully resolved following balloon removal. Conclusions In this phase three trial, the Vesair intravesical balloon achieved 3 month primary and secondary endpoints both objectively and subjectively.

AB  - Anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were analysed in 502 consecutive patients admitted to our stroke unit Elevated ACA levels ≥11 units) were found in 20 of 396 patients (5%) with ischemic stroke and TIA, in none of 42 patients with cerebral haematomas and in five of 64 patients (8%) with other diagnoses than stroke. There were no statistically significant differences in occurrence of ACA in these groups. Markedly elevated ACA levels (> 20 units) were found in nine of the 396 patients (2%) with TIA/ischemic stroke. The frequency of ACA was higher in the age group 40?50 years (15%) than in the age group 50?90 years (3.6?6.0%). Re-examination in 18 of the 20 patients with ischemic stroke and elevated ACA levels after 26?395 days (mean 100 days) showed that in 10 patients ACA levels were lower (difference ≥ 6 units = 2 SD), compared to the initial value, whereas eight patients had unchanged ACA levels. The occurrence of previous deep venous thrombosis was significantly more common in patients with elevated ACA levels, otherwise there were no differences concerning earlier stroke, risk factor analysis or other laboratory parameters between patients with and without elevated ACA levels. In conclusion, we found elevated ACA levels in patients with ischemic stroke at a rather low prevalence as compared to most previous studies. The clinical relevance of ACA is uncertain, especially in patients with multiple risk factors. We recommend screening for ACA only in stroke patients < 50 years of age, or when the antiphospholipid syndrome is suspected.

AB  - Background:Liver biopsies taken with an automatic Tru-Cut biopsy gun device caused unexpected fatal shock reactions in cats. The goal of the present study was to determine if this biopsy device caused more frequent fatal complications than did a semiautomatic device. Animals: All cats referred to the Utrecht University, between October 1, 2002, and October 31, 2004, in which ultrasound-guided Tru-Cut liver biopsies were taken. The indications for liver biopsy were increased liver enzyme activity, increased bile acid concentrations, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the liver, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the bile ducts, or some combination of these findings. Coagulation parameters were normal. Methods: From October 1, 2002, until October 31, 2003, 26 cats were biopsied with an automatic biopsy device. Between November 1, 2003, and October 31, 2004, 19 cats underwent liver biopsy with a semiautomatic biopsy device. Results: In the first period, 5 of the 26 cats (19%) developed severe shock within 15 minutes. Resuscitation was not successful. In the second period, none of the 19 cats experienced any major adverse effect. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to diagnosis, clinical signs, clinicopathologic findings, or the use of anesthetics. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: We conclude that the difference in complication rate is explained by the biopsy technique used. The pressure wave, which occurs when firing the automatic device, may have caused intense vagotonia and shock. Use of this automatic biopsy device should be avoided in cats because of the high risk of fatal complications.

This article describes the development of a prospective, longitudinal study of 88 ?high-risk? offspring of pregnant index women with a history of nonorganic psychoses and 104 offspring of demographically-similar pregnant control women. The maternal psychoses represented the diagnostic categories, Schizophrenia, Cycloid Psychosis, Affective Illness, Psychogenic Psychosis, Postpartum Psychosis and Other (remaining) Psychoses. The first phase of the study began during pregnancy and continued until the offspring reached 2 years of age. Selected characteristics of the mothers, the offspring and their environments were investigated during this project phase.

AB  - Abstract In the present study we investigated whether donor gender of the effects of sex hormones play the greater role in the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. Kidneys of male and female Fisher rats were orthotopically transplanted into castrated male Lewis recipients. Animals were treated with testosterone, estradiol, or vehicle and the kidneys were harvested 20 weeks after transplantation for histological, immunohistological, and molecular analysis. Testosterone treatment resulted in increased proteinuria and profound glomerulo-sclerosis, irrespective of donor gender. In addition, mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) and platelet-derived growth factor-A and B (PDGF-A and B) chains were enhanced in these allografts. Estradiol reduced glomerulosclerosis and mononuclear cell infiltration in allografts of both genders that paralleled a decreased mRNA expression of TGF-?1, PDGF-A and B. No donor gender-related differences were noted in vehicle-treated animals. Our findings demonstrate that sex hormones rather than donor gender have a significant impact on chronic allograft nephropathy.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives.? The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the circulation is approximately 10- to 50- fold higher than B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). We sought to compare the accuracy of midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) measured with a novel sandwich immunoassay with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) in the diagnosis of heart failure. Design.? The diagnosis of heart failure was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists using all available clinical data (including BNP levels) in 287 consecutive patients presenting with dyspnoea to the emergency department (ED). MRproANP and NTproBNP levels were determined at presentation in a blinded fashion. Results.? Heart failure was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 154 patients (54%). Median MRproANP was significantly higher in patients with heart failure as compared to patients with other causes of dyspnoea (400 vs. 92?pmol?L?1, P?<?0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of MRproANP was very high with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 and was comparable with that of NTproBNP (0.92, P?=?0.791). Moreover, MRproANP provided incremental diagnostic information to BNP and NTproBNP in patients presenting with BNP levels in the grey zone between 100 and 500?pg?mL?1. Conclusion.? Midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide is as accurate in the diagnosis of heart failure as NTproBNP. MRproANP seems to provide incremental information on top of BNP or NT-proBNP in some subgroups and should be further investigated in other studies.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: To define the prevalence of tracheotomy tube complications and evaluate risk factors (RFs) associated with their occurrence. Study Design: Multi-institution historical cohort. Methods: Data regarding tracheotomy tube complications from consecutive surgeries performed across eight participating institutions between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 were retrospectively collected. Patient demographics, comorbidities, physician specialty, and surgical technique were recorded and statistically analyzed to identify the incidence of surgical complications following tracheotomy and associated RFs. Results: The charts of 1,175 tracheotomy procedures were reviewed from eight academic institutions. Otolaryngologists performed 66.2% of the tracheotomies. Intraoperative, early (<1 week), and late complication rates were 1.4%, 5.6%, and 7.1%, respectively. Postoperative bleeding was identified as the most common early complication (2.6%), whereas airway stenosis was the most common late complication (1.7%). The use of outer flange security sutures to anchor the tracheostomy tube was negatively associated with the incidence of early complication (P < .0001). The use of large endotracheal tubes (size >7.5) and obesity were associated with the development of airway stenosis (P < .05).Twenty-two percent of patients undergoing tracheotomy died during hospitalization. Conclusions: Perioperative tracheotomy complications are rare; however, the rate of death for all causes is high (22%) in this population. Obesity and the use of endotracheal tubes over 7.5 in size are major risk factors for the development of airway stenosis. Although percutaneous tracheotomy resulted in a significantly higher rate of postoperative bleeding (6.6%) than the open method (1.9%) (P < .05), the use of outer flange tracheostomy tube sutures may reduce this complication.Laryngoscope, 122:38?45, 2012

AB  - Abstract The efficient transport of biological therapeutic materials to target tissues within the body is critical to their efficacy. In cartilage tissue, the lack of blood vessels prevents the entry of systemically administered drugs at therapeutic levels. Within the articulating joint complex, the dense and highly charged extracellular matrix (ECM) hinders the transport of locally administered therapeutic molecules. Consequently, cartilage injury is difficult to treat and frequently results in debilitating osteoarthritis. Here we show a generalizable approach in which the electrostatic assembly of synthetic polypeptides and a protein, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), can be used as an early interventional therapy to treat injury to the cartilage. We demonstrated that poly(glutamic acid) and poly(arginine) associated with the IGF-1 via electrostatic interactions, forming a net charged nanoscale polyelectrolyte complex (nanoplex). We observed that the nanoplex diffused into cartilage plugs in vitro and stimulated ECM production. In vivo, we monitored the transport, retention and therapeutic efficacy of the nanoplex in an established rat model of cartilage injury. A single therapeutic dose, when administered within 48 hr of the injury, conferred protection against cartilage degradation and controlled interleukin-1 mediated inflammation. IGF-1 contained in the nanoplex was detected in the joint space for up to 4 weeks following administration and retained bioactivity. The results indicate the potential of this approach as an early intervention therapy following joint injury to delay or even entirely prevent the onset of osteoarthritis.

AB  - Leukoreduction of blood products is a technique used to prevent leukocyte-induced transfusion reactions. Filters currently used for human blood products achieve at least a 99.9% reduction in leukocyte numbers per unit (450 mL) of blood. Goals of this study were to determine if a prestorage leukoreduction filter could effectively achieve leukoreduction of canine blood and to determine if viability of the leukoreduced red blood cell (RBC) product could be maintained after 35 days of storage. Blood collected from each dog was filtered through a leukoreduction filter at either room temperature or after cooling (4°C) for 4 hours. Filtration efficacy was determined by measurement of pre- and postfiltration leukocyte counts. In vitro viability of RBCs was determined by comparing RBC adenosine triphosphate concentration and percent hemolysis before and after the storage period. In vivo viability of stored cells was determined using a biotin-streptavidin-phycoerythrin labeling technique and flow cytometry. Blood filtered within 30 minutes of collection versus blood filtered after cooling had mean reductions in leukocyte numbers of 88.90 and 99.99%, respectively. The mean ATP and hemoglobin concentrations from the in vitro analysis were comparable to those obtained in previously for canine RBC adequately stored for 35 days. The mean in vivo 24-hour survival of the stored RBC was 84.7%. The leukoreduction filter used did not adversely affect in vitro or in vivo viability of canine RBCs. The filter effectively removed leukocytes from blood, with maximal efficiency of filtration achieved with use of cooled blood.
