AB  - Abstract The efficient transport of biological therapeutic materials to target tissues within the body is critical to their efficacy. In cartilage tissue, the lack of blood vessels prevents the entry of systemically administered drugs at therapeutic levels. Within the articulating joint complex, the dense and highly charged extracellular matrix (ECM) hinders the transport of locally administered therapeutic molecules. Consequently, cartilage injury is difficult to treat and frequently results in debilitating osteoarthritis. Here we show a generalizable approach in which the electrostatic assembly of synthetic polypeptides and a protein, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), can be used as an early interventional therapy to treat injury to the cartilage. We demonstrated that poly(glutamic acid) and poly(arginine) associated with the IGF-1 via electrostatic interactions, forming a net charged nanoscale polyelectrolyte complex (nanoplex). We observed that the nanoplex diffused into cartilage plugs in vitro and stimulated ECM production. In vivo, we monitored the transport, retention and therapeutic efficacy of the nanoplex in an established rat model of cartilage injury. A single therapeutic dose, when administered within 48 hr of the injury, conferred protection against cartilage degradation and controlled interleukin-1 mediated inflammation. IGF-1 contained in the nanoplex was detected in the joint space for up to 4 weeks following administration and retained bioactivity. The results indicate the potential of this approach as an early intervention therapy following joint injury to delay or even entirely prevent the onset of osteoarthritis.

AB  - Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, controls axon growth, apoptosis and neuron degeneration during neural development, as well as neurodegeneration after various insults to the adult nervous system. Interestingly, recent studies have also highlighted a role of DLK in promoting axon regeneration in diverse model systems. Invertebrates and vertebrates, cold- and warm-blooded animals, as well as central and peripheral mammalian nervous systems all differ in their ability to regenerate injured axons. Here, we discuss how DLK-dependent signalling regulates apparently contradictory functions during neural development and regeneration in different species. In addition, we outline strategies to fine-tune DLK function, either alone or together with other approaches, to promote axon regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the analgesia and anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic that is an agonist on the central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. It does not cause respiratory depression, and can be used in patients who are not intubated. Dexmedetomidine provides anesthesia without decreasing respiratory drive. It works through the central nervous system (CNS), as an alpha-2 receptor agonist. The manifestations of local analgesia toxicity start with tachycardia and hypertension. As blood levels continue to rise, symptoms can continue to progress to myocardial depression, hypertension, and decreased cardiac output. Ketamine is classified as a dissociative anesthetic. It produces amnesia and analgesia. Propofol can be used in patients with neurologic injury. It can decrease intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral metabolism.

AB  - Abstract Background? Reports of female reproductive tract neoplasia are infrequent in great apes. Methods? Two captive-born, female western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) housed at the North Carolina Zoological Park were diagnosed with reproductive neoplasia. Results? The first gorilla had uterine endometrial thickening and uterine fibroids diagnosed during a routine annual examination. Subsequently, the animal underwent several uterine curettage procedures in an attempt to debulk the uterine mass. Biopsy results indicated uterine adenocarcinoma. The animal was treated with an ovariohysterectomy followed by a combination of megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate. The second gorilla was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina, cervix, and uterus after presenting for intermittent vaginal bleeding of 1-month duration. This animal underwent palliative radiation therapy, receiving two rounds of radiation treatment 8?weeks apart. Conclusions? The following report describes the diagnosis and management of the two cases.

AB  - A classical treatment for chronic adult periodontitis consists of four to six consecutive sessions of scaling and root planing at a 1- to 2-week interval. Such a so-called ?quadrant or sextant therapy? might result in a reinfection of a previously disinfected area by bacteria from an untreated region. The purpose of this study was to investigate, over an 8-month period, the clinical benefits of full-mouth disinfection within a 24-hour period in the control of chronic periodontitis. Ten adult patients with advanced chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to a test and a control group. The control group received the standard scheme of initial periodontal therapy, consisting of scaling and root planing per quadrant at 2-week intervals. In the full-mouth disinfection group, scaling and root planing of the four quadrants was performed within 24 hours and immediately followed by a thorough supra- and subgingival chlorhexidine application to limit any transfer of bacteria. The latter involved tongue brushing with a 1% chlorhexidine gel for 60 seconds, mouthrinsing with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution twice for 60 seconds, repeated subgingival irrigation of all pockets with a 1% chlorhexidine gel (3 times within 10 minutes), and mouthrinsing twice daily with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution during 2 weeks. In addition, both groups received thorough oral hygiene instructions. The plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, gingival recession, and bleeding on probing were recorded prior to professional cleaning and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 months afterwards. Although the test group scored higher plaque indices than the control group, especially at months 2 and 4, the gingival index and bleeding tendency showed similar improvements with time. However, when the gingival/plaque ratio was considered, the latter was lower in the test group at all follow-up visits. For pockets ≥ 7 mm, full-mouth disinfection showed a significantly (P = 0.01) higher reduction in probing depth at each follow-up visit with, at month 8, a reduction of 4 mm (from 8 mm to 4 mm), in comparison to 3 mm (from 8 mm to 5 mm) for the classical therapy. The increase in gingival recession in the fullmouth disinfection group remained below 0.7 mm, while in the control group it reached 1.9 mm after 8 months. This resulted in a gain of clinical attachment level of 3.7 mm for the test group versus 1.9 mm for the control group. A radiographical examination also indicated a superior improvement for the test group when compared to the control group. This pilot study suggests that a full-mouth disinfection in one day results in an improved clinical outcome in chronic periodontitis as compared to searings per quadrant at 2-week intervals over several weeks.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This study was designed to investigate the role of apoptosis on liver IR injury and to determine the effects of roscovitine on this process. Materials and methods: Rat livers pretreated with roscovitine received 60?min right lobe ischemia followed by 4?h (n=8) and 24?h (n=8) reperfusion. Tissue injury was evaluated by serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, tissue malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase measurements and histological examination. Dead (apoptotic and necrotic) hepatocytes were determined by trypan blue dye and apoptosis was evaluated with M30 monoclonal antibody. Results: Administration of roscovitine significantly decreased both apoptotic and dead hepatocyte counts compared to controls (P<0.01). Liver transaminase levels were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-pretreated groups (P<0.05). In the groups evaluated 24?h after reperfusion, MPO levels (P<0.02) and leukocyte infiltration on histologic sections were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-administered group compared to its control. Conclusions: This study indicates that hepatocyte apoptosis may play a role in the development of IR injury of the liver. Administration of roscovitine may be beneficial in preventing this injury.

AB  - Abstract Background:? A major complication of a distal pancreatectomy (DP) is the formation of a post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF). In spite of the utilization of numerous surgical techniques no consensus on an appropriate technique for closure of the pancreatic remnant after DP has been established yet. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of pancreatoenteral anastomosis (PE) vs. direct closure (DC) of the pancreatic remnant on POPF. Methods:? A total of 198 consecutive patients who underwent a distal pancreatectomy between 2002 and 2010 at our institution were retrospectively analysed for post-operative morbidity and mortality. Results:? One hundred and fifty-one patients (76.3%) received DC whereas PE was performed in 47 patients (23.7%). The incidence of POPF was higher in the DC group (22% vs. 11%), whereas the rate of post-operative haemorrhage was higher in the PE group (11% vs. 7%). However, these differences were not significant. Additionally, there were no significant differences in overall post-operative morbidity and mortality between the groups. Conclusions:? The performance of PE instead of DC may be considered as a safe alternative in individual patients, but it does not significantly lead to a general improvement in post-operative outcome after DP. An interdisciplinary collaboration in the prevention and treatment of POPF therefore remains essential.

AB  - Abstract Microglial activation has been reported to promote neurotoxicity and also neuroprotective effects. A possible contributor to this dichotomy of responses may be the degree to which proximal neurons are injured. The aim of this study was to determine whether varying the severity of neuronal injury influenced whether microglia were neuroprotective or neurotoxic. We exposed cortical neuronal cultures to varying degrees of hypoxia thereby generating mild (<20% death, 30min hypoxia), moderate (40?60% death, 2 h hypoxia), or severe (>70% death, 6 h hypoxia) injuries. Twenty-four hours after hypoxia, the media from the neuronal cultures was collected and incubated with primary microglial cultures for 24 h. Results showed that the classic microglial proinflammatory mediators including inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-1-? were upregulated only in response to mild neuronal injuries, while the trophic microglial effectors brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor were upregulated in response to all degrees of neuronal injury. Microglia stimulated with media from damaged neurons were co-cultured with hypoxic neurons. Microglia stimulated by moderate, but not mild or severe damage were neuroprotective in these co-cultures. We also showed that the severity-dependent phenomenon was not related to autocrine microglial signaling and was dependent on the neurotransmitters released by neurons after injury, namely glutamate and adenosine 5?-triphosphate. Together our results show that severity of neuronal injury is an important factor in determining microglial release of ?toxic? versus ?protective? effectors and the resulting neurotoxicity versus neuroprotection. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Seven days after the injection of different concentrations of thrombin into the nigrostriatal pathway, a strong macrophage/microglial reaction was observed in the substantia nigra (SN), indicated by immunostaining, using OX-42 and OX-6 antibodies, and by the induction of iNOS, IL-1α, Il-1? and TNF-α. Moreover, selective damage to dopaminergic neurones was produced after thrombin injection, evidenced by loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA-expressing cell bodies, and the unaltered transcription of glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA in the SN and striatum. These thrombin effects could be produced by its ability to induce the activation of microglia described in in vitro studies, and are in agreement with the effects described for other proinflammatory compounds. Thrombin effects are produced by its biological activity since they almost disappeared when thrombin was heat-inactivated or injected along with its inhibitor α-NAPAP. Thrombin is a multi-functional serine protease rapidly produced from prothrombin at the sites of tissue injury, and also upon breakdown of the blood?brain barrier, which strongly suggests it could easily enter into the CNS. These results could have special importance in some degenerative processes of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.
