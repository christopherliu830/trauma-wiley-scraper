AB  - Abstract Microglial activation has been reported to promote neurotoxicity and also neuroprotective effects. A possible contributor to this dichotomy of responses may be the degree to which proximal neurons are injured. The aim of this study was to determine whether varying the severity of neuronal injury influenced whether microglia were neuroprotective or neurotoxic. We exposed cortical neuronal cultures to varying degrees of hypoxia thereby generating mild (<20% death, 30min hypoxia), moderate (40?60% death, 2 h hypoxia), or severe (>70% death, 6 h hypoxia) injuries. Twenty-four hours after hypoxia, the media from the neuronal cultures was collected and incubated with primary microglial cultures for 24 h. Results showed that the classic microglial proinflammatory mediators including inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-1-? were upregulated only in response to mild neuronal injuries, while the trophic microglial effectors brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor were upregulated in response to all degrees of neuronal injury. Microglia stimulated with media from damaged neurons were co-cultured with hypoxic neurons. Microglia stimulated by moderate, but not mild or severe damage were neuroprotective in these co-cultures. We also showed that the severity-dependent phenomenon was not related to autocrine microglial signaling and was dependent on the neurotransmitters released by neurons after injury, namely glutamate and adenosine 5?-triphosphate. Together our results show that severity of neuronal injury is an important factor in determining microglial release of ?toxic? versus ?protective? effectors and the resulting neurotoxicity versus neuroprotection. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted MR imaging using a transient gustatory stimulation method in patients with xerostomia. Materials and Methods: Ten consecutive patients complaining of xerostomia and 10 healthy volunteers were examined with a 1.5 Tesla (T) MR unit. All study subjects completed a questionnaire, and patients underwent salivary gland scintigraphy and Saxon test. T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted MR images were obtained before stimulation. One minute after gustatory stimulation with lemon juice, diffusion-weighted sequence was repeated 9 times. A radiologist evaluated signal intensities and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in parotid and submandibular glands. ADC increase rate (IR) and times to maximum ADC (Tmax) were assessed. Results: IRs showed a moderate positive correlation with washout rates by scintigraphy for parotid (r = 0.554, P < 0.05) and submandibular (r = 0.617, P < 0.01) glands. Furthermore, Tmax values of parotid and submandibular glands were significantly higher in patients (420 ± 226 and 357 ± 232 s, respectively) than in volunteers (181 ± 68 and 200 ± 75 s, respectively) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Our preliminary results indicate that diffusion-weighted MR imaging using a transient gustatory stimulation method is potentially useful for evaluating patients with xerostomia. J. Magn.

AB  - Abstract The effect of cimetidine (CM) on the pharmacokinetics of fentiazac (FT) was studied in six rats. FT was administered by intravenous (iv) bolus injection at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg to rats receiving iv infusion of saline (control) or CM. The infusion of CM was conducted to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of CM of 30 and 60 ?g/mL. In the control rats, the plasma disposition of FT and its major metabolite, p-hydroxy FT, followed a classical drug-metabolite profile irrespective of FT dose. The plasma level of p-hydroxy FT was comparable with that of FT. The disappearance of FT from the rat plasma was significantly delayed by the CM infusion, and p-hydroxy FT was unde-tectable in the plasma in CM-treated rats. The total body clearance (CLt) of FT was decreased to 20?50% of the control value in CM-treated rats, implying that FT metabolism to p-hydroxy FT is almost completely impaired by CM. The CLt, values in rats with different Css of CM (30 and 60 ?g/mL) were not significantly different from each other. The distribution volume of FT at steady state (Vdss) was decreased to 60?70% of the control value by the CM infusion at higher doses of FT (10 and 20 mg/kg). The decreases in Vdss and CLt, seem not to be related to the binding of FT to plasma protein because the binding of FT was not influenced by CM. In clinical settings, the magnitude of the pharmacokinetic difference may warrant dose adjustment to avoid toxic effects of FT when administered with CM.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a specific nucleotide insertion in p53 gene and FISS in a German cat population. Blood samples from 150 German cats were allocated to a control group consisting of 100 healthy cats and a FISS-group consisting of 50 cats with FISS. All blood samples were examined for the presence of the SNP in the p53 gene. Results found the T-insertion at SNP 3 in 20.0% of the cats in the FISS-group and 19.2% of cats in the control-group. No statistically significant difference was observed in allelic distribution between the two groups. Further investigations are necessary to determine the association of SNPs in the feline p53 gene and the occurrence of FISS.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Approximately one in four patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given anticoagulation and compression therapy develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Accelerated removal of thrombus by thrombolytic agents may increase patency and prevent PTS. Objectives: To assess short-term efficacy of additional catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) compared with standard treatment alone. Patients and methods: Open, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Patients (18?75?years) with iliofemoral DVT and symptoms <?21?days were randomized to receive additional CDT or standard treatment alone. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was investigated using duplex ultrasound and air-plethysmography assessed by an investigator blinded to previous treatment. Results: One hundred and three patients (64?men, mean age 52?years) were allocated additional CDT (n?=?50) or standard treatment alone (n?=?53). After CDT, grade III (complete) lysis was achieved in 24 and grade II (50%?90%) lysis in 20?patients. One patient suffered major bleeding and two had clinically relevant bleeding related to the CDT procedure. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was found in 32 (64.0%) in the CDT group vs. 19 (35.8%) controls, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction (RR) of 28.2% (95% CI: 9.7%?46.7%; P?=?0.004). Venous obstruction was found in 10 (20.0%) in the CDT group vs. 26 (49.1%) controls; absolute RR 29.1% (95% CI: 20.0%?38.0%; P?=?0.004). Femoral venous insufficiency did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: After 6?months, additional CDT increased iliofemoral patency from 36% to 64%. The ongoing long-term follow-up of this study will document whether patency is related to improved functional outcome.

AB  - Abstract Clinical criteria for the classification of symptomatic idiopathic (primary) osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands were developed from data collected in a multi-center study. Patients with OA were compared with a group of patients who had hand symptoms from other causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and the spondylar-thropathies. Variables from the medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiographs were analyzed. All patients had pain, aching, or stiffness in the hands. Patients were classified as having clinical OA if on examination there was hard tissue enlargement involving at least 2 of 10 selected joints, swelling of fewer than 3 metacarpophalangeal joints, and hard tissue enlargement of at least 2 distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. If the patient had fewer than 2 enlarged DIP joints, then deformity of at least 1 of the 10 selected joints was necessary in order to classify the symptoms as being due to OA. The 10 selected joints were the second and third DIP, the second and third proximal interphalangeal, and the trapeziometacarpal (base of the thumb) joints of both hands. Criteria derived using the ?classification tree? method were 92% sensitive and 98% specific. The ?traditional format? classification method required that at least 3 of these 4 criteria be present to classify a patient as having OA of the hand. The latter sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 87%. Radiography was of less value than clinical examination in the classification of symptomatic OA of the hands.

AB  - Abstract A panel of monoclonal antibodies with well-defined specificities were used as probes to investigate the phenotypes and lineage of circulating lymphoid cells and splenocytes in untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease. A signficant relative and absolute reduction in T cells (anti-T3+) was found only in patients with B-symptoms. There was no alteration in the fraction of helper (anti-T4+) or cytotoxic/suppressor (anti-T5+) T cells circulating in peripheral blood when compared to normals, nor was there activation of these cells as measured by the development of surface Ia (anti-I1+). Circulating T cell subsets were not altered 5 to 14 days after splenectomy. Splenic T cells were increased equally in involved and uninvolved spleen when compared with control spleens obtained from accident victims. These findings indicate that abnormal T cell function in Hodgkin's disease may be the result of subtle alterations in T cells or non-T immunoregulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Emergency Departments (EDs) face significant challenges in providing efficient, quality, safe, cost-effective care. Lean methodologies are a proposed framework to redesign ED practices and processes to meet these challenges. We outline a systematic way that lean principles can be applied across the entire ED patient experience to transform a high volume ED in a safety net hospital. We review the change in ED performance metrics prior to and after lean implementation. We discuss critical insights and key lessons learned from our lean transformation to date. The steps to implementing lean principles across the patient's ED experience are described with specific attention to executive planning of rapid improvement experiments and the subsequent roll-out of lean transformation over an 18-month time frame. Basic ED performance data were compared to the year prior. Results of the exploratory analysis (using median and interquartile ranges and nonparametric tests for group comparisons) have shown improvement in several performance metrics after initiating lean transformation. The approach, lessons learned, and early data of our transformation can provide critical insights for EDs seeking to incorporate continuous improvement strategies. Key lessons and unique challenges encountered in safety net hospitals are discussed.

The aim of this study was to assess management in 22 patients treated for haemorrhage and/or rupture of HCA. Patients and methods: Between May 1990 and July 2005, 22 female patients were diagnosed with acute haemorrhage and/or rupture of lesions highly suspicious of HCA. Preoperative imaging diagnostics and pathologic specimens were reviewed. Results: Twelve haemodynamically stable and four unstable patients could be treated conservatively. One patient underwent acute partial liver resection, whereas four patients underwent laparotomy with initial packing of the liver. In one patient, selective embolisation of the left hepatic artery was performed. Fifteen patients eventually underwent resection after a mean time of 8 months after initial treatment. Six patients did not undergo resection and showed no complications or rebleeding after a mean follow-up of 24.6 months. Only in seven patients, histopathological examination showed HCA, and in one patient, HCA with focal nodular hyperplasia. Conclusion: HCA with haemorrhage and/or rupture does not necessarily require immediate liver resection. Conservative treatment is justified in stable patients. In case of an instable patient with or without hemoperitoneum, laparotomy with packing or selective embolisation can stop the bleeding.

AB  - Abstract PHAP1 (Putative HLA-DR-associated protein 1), also termed acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32A (ANP32A), Phosphoprotein 32 (pp32) or protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor (I1PP2A), is a multifunctional protein aberrantly expressed in multiple types of human cancers. However, its expression pattern and clinical relevance in human glioma remain unknown. In this study, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated PHAP1 protein was highly expressed in glioma patients, especially in those with high-grade disease. Publicly available data also revealed high levels of PHAP1 were associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients. The functional studies showed that knock-down of PHAP1 suppressed the proliferation of glioma cells, while overexpression of PHAP1 facilitated it. The iTRAQ proteomic analysis suggested that stathmin might be a potential downstream target of PHAP1. Consistently, PHAP1 knock-down significantly decreased the expression of stathmin, while overexpression of PHAP1 increased it. Also, the upstream negative regulator, p27, expression levels increased upon PHAP1 knock-down and decreased when PHAP1 was overexpressed. As a result, the phosphorylated Akt (S473), an upstream regulator of p27, expression levels decreased upon silencing of PHAP1, but elevated after PHAP1 overexpression. Importantly, we demonstrate the p27 down-regulation, stathmin up-regulation and cell proliferation acceleration induced by PHAP1 overexpression were dependent on Akt activation. In conclusion, the above results suggest that PHAP1 expression is elevated in glioma patients, which may accelerate the proliferation of glioma cells by regulating the Akt/p27/stathmin pathway.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? Evoked phenomena in clinical neuropathic pain are viewed as a window into the underlying pathophysiology. They are also potential therapeutic targets. This study sought evidence for the effect on such evoked phenomena of currently used agents. Design.? We reviewed MEDLINE (1966?2006) and EMBASE (1980?2006) to locate all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials examining therapeutic responses of evoked neuropathic pain phenomena, including dynamic mechanical allodynia, pin prick hyperalgesia, and thermal allodynia. We also noted the methods of elicitation of these evoked pain phenomena. Results.? We found 40 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. A wide variety of methods was used to evoke neuropathic pain phenomena. For dynamic mechanical allodynia, there is some evidence for the efficacy of ketamine, alfentanil, and morphine, but only when administered intravenously. For other agents and other evoked pain phenomena, there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. Conclusions.? There is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in treating evoked pain phenomena in clinical neuropathic pain states. There is little clinical evidence to either support or refute theoretical arguments for efficacy of specific agents in evoked neuropathic pain phenomena. More and larger trials are needed to examine these phenomena. Consensus is required with respect to methods used to elicit these evoked phenomena.

AB  - ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and serious problem that adversely affects human health, limits longevity and increases costs to health-care systems worldwide. Its increasing incidence cannot be fully explained by traditional risk factors. Oxidative stress is prevalent in CKD patients and is considered to be an important pathogenic mechanism. Oxidative stress develops from an imbalance between free radical production often increased through dysfunctional mitochondria formed with increasing age, type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammation, and reduced anti-oxidant defences. Perturbations in cellular oxidant handling influence downstream cellular signalling and, in the kidney, promote renal cell apoptosis and senescence, decreased regenerative ability of cells, and fibrosis. These factors have a stochastic deleterious effect on kidney function. The majority of studies investigating anti-oxidant treatments in CKD patients show a reduction in oxidative stress and many show improved renal function. Despite heterogeneity in the oxidative stress levels in the CKD population, there has been little effort to measure patient oxidative stress levels before the use of any anti-oxidants therapies to optimize outcome. This review describes the development of oxidative stress, how it can be measured, the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and the molecular pathways that are altered, the role of oxidative stress in CKD pathogenesis and an update on the amelioration of CKD using anti-oxidant therapies.

AB  - Background Robotic gastrectomy is increasingly used in gastric cancer patients. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of full robotic gastrectomy with intracorporeal robot-sewn anastomosis for gastric cancer. Methods Three hundred and eleven patients were randomized into an open gastrectomy group or a robotic gastrectomy group, and digestive restorations were performed under direct vision and with intracorporeal robot-sewn anastomosis, respectively. Length of postoperative hospital stay, number of lymph node dissections, surgical duration, blood loss, and complication rate after surgery were recorded. Results There were no significant differences in the number of lymph node dissections (30.9?±?10.4 vs. 29.3?±?9.7 days, P?=?0.281) or complication rates (10.3 vs. 9.3%, P?=?0.756) between the two groups. Surgical duration was significantly longer in the robotic gastrectomy group than in the open gastrectomy group (242.7?±?43.8 vs. 192.4?±?31.5?min, P?=?0.002), whereas blood loss was less (94.2?±?51.5 vs. 152.8?±?76.9?ml, P?<?0.001), length of postoperative hospital stay was shorter (5.6?±?1.9 vs. 6.7?±?1.9 days, P?=?0.021), and postoperative restoration of bowel function was earlier (2.6?±?1.1 vs. 3.1?±?1.2 days, P?=?0.028). Conclusion Full robotic gastrectomy with intracorporeal robot-sewn anastomosis for gastric cancer is safe and does not increase the complication risk during or after surgery. J. Surg.

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2012; 18: 870?876 Abstract Repeated isolation of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) from respiratory secretions poses a great challenge for infection control. We conducted a retrospective case?control study to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effect of inhaled colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) in the eradication of MDRAB from the respiratory tract. Patients who were admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital between February 2009 and June 2010, had at least two sets of monomicrobial culture of MDRAB from respiratory secretions, and remained in hospital for at least 14?days after the first isolation of MDRAB (index day) were included. Patients who received intravenous CMS were excluded. Patients who received CMS inhalation for ≥3?days were selected as cases whereas the controls were matched for age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. Thirty-nine cases and controls were identified. The duration of CMS inhalation was 10.9?±?3.6?days. The use of inhaled CMS was the only independent factor associated with the eradication of MDRAB within 14?days after the index day (OR 266.33; 95% CI 11.26?6302.18, p?<0.001), and shortened the duration of MDRAB recovery from the respiratory tract by 13.3?±?1.45?days. The adverse effects were similar for both groups. The increase of colistin minimal inhibitory concentrations in the last isolate compared with the index isolate from the same patient did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that inhaled CMS enhanced the eradication of MDRAB from the respiratory tract without significant clinical adverse effect or impact on colistin resistance.
