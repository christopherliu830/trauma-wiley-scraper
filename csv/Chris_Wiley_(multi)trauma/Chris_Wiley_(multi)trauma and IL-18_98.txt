AB  - Summary A minority of injecting drug users, termed exposed uninfected, are resistant to hepatitis C (HCV) infection despite repeated low-dose exposures. We identify for the first time a cohort of blood recipients who remained uninfected despite large-dose exposure to HCV-contaminated blood and characterize immune factors that may confer protection. Of 1340 blood recipients from the English Look Back database who were transfused HCV-contaminated blood, we identified 8 who remained uninfected. In these 8 exposed uninfecteds, we characterized their natural killer (NK) cell populations and HCV-specific T-cell responses. Findings were compared with 10 spontaneous resolvers of HCV infection, 10 patients with chronic HCV infection and 10 healthy controls. Exposed uninfecteds had significantly greater numbers of NK cells with the activating receptor NKp30+ on CD56bright and CD56dim subsets compared with other groups (P < .05). Following interleukin-2 activation, NK cells of exposed uninfecteds had enhanced cytotoxicity that positively correlated with NKp30 expression (P = .02). Differences in NKp80 and KIR2DL3 expression were also observed. HCV-specific T-cell responses were observed in some exposed uninfecteds but of low amplitude. Exposure without infection following transfusion of HCV-contaminated blood is a very rare phenomenon and suggests a high level of resistance to infection. Enhanced NK cell activation and killing, with weak HCV-specific T-cell responses, were observed many years after exposure in uninfected recipients and may contribute to protection from HCV acquisition, although additional protective factors are being sought in this important cohort.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

Inter-rater reliability, test?retest reliability, and concurrent validity with other rating scales for EPS were high. Four factors were identified and the optimal diagnostic cut-off scores were obtained. These results suggest that the DIEPSS is a reliable and valid multidimensional rating scale. ? 2002 Movement Disorder Society

AB  - Abstract Introduction During robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), the quality of nerve sparing (NS) was usually classified by laterality of NS (none, unilateral, and bilateral) or degree of NS (none, partial, and full). Recently, side-specific NS have been more frequently performed, but previous NS grading system might not reflect the differential NS in each side. Aim Herein, we assessed whether a subjective NS score (NSS) incorporating both degree of NS and NS laterality can predict the time to potency recovery following RARP. Methods Data were analyzed from 1,898 patients who had left and right neurovascular bundle sparing quality scores and at least one year of follow-up after RARP was performed between January 2008 and October 2011. Main Outcome Measures Cox proportional hazard method analyses were used to determine predictive factors for early recovery. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess subjective NSS in an effort to predict time to potency recovery. Subjective NSSs were compared to a model based on the three grades according to laterality and degree. Results Time to potency recovery showed a statistically significant difference in favor of higher NSS by the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis (NSS 0 vs. NSS 5?6, 7?8, and 9?10; P?<?0.01). The regression model indicated that the statistical significance of the subjective NSS covering the differential NS is not different from that of the conventional three-grade scales, while it has a higher R2. The regression equation with subjective NSS was as follows: Log (Time)?=?5.163???(0.035???SHIM Score)?+?0.028 Age???(0.101???Subjective?NSS). Conclusion The subjective NSS can reflect NS degree for each side based on the visual cues. Regression model can be used to help inform the patient about the time to postoperative potency regain, which is an important patient concern following RARP.

AB  - Background The normal body exists in mutualistic balance with a large range of microbiota. The primary goal of this study was to establish whether there is an imbalance in the oropharyngeal flora early after hospital or ICU admittance, and whether flora differs between control, ward and critically ill patients. The secondary goal was to explore whether there are patient characteristics that can be associated with a disturbed oropharyngeal flora. Methods Oropharyngeal cultures were obtained from three different study groups: (1) controls from the community, (2) ward patients and (3) critically ill patients, the two latter within 24 h after admittance. Results Cultures were obtained from 487 individuals: 77 controls, 193 ward patients and 217 critically ill patients. Abnormal pharyngeal flora was more frequent in critically ill and ward patients compared with controls (62.2% and 10.4% vs. 1.3%, P < 0.001 and P = 0.010, respectively). Colonisation of gut flora in the oropharynx was more frequent in critically ill patients compared with ward patients or controls (26.3% vs. 4.7% and 1.3%, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Proton pump inhibitor medication was the strongest independent factor associated with the presence of gut flora in the oropharynx in both ward and critically ill patients (P = 0.030 and P = 0.044, respectively). Conclusion This study indicates that abnormal oropharyngeal flora is an early and frequent event in hospitalised patients and more so in the critically ill, compared to controls. Proton pump inhibitor medication is associated with colonisation of gut flora in the oropharynx.

AB  - Abstract Aim: To determine whether the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1 receptor) modulates brain cryoinjury and whether the CysLT1 receptor antagonist pranlukast exerts a time-dependent protective effect on cryoinjury in mice. Methods: Brain cryoinjury was induced by applying a liquid nitrogen-cooled metal probe to the surface of the skull for 30 s. Brain lesion, neuron density, and endogenous IgG exudation were observed 24 h after cryoinjury. Transcription and the expresion of the CysLT1 receptor were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, and the localization of the receptor protein by double immunofluorescence. Results: The mRNA and protein expressions of the CysLT1 receptor were upregulated in the brain 6-24 h after cryoinjury, and the CysLT1 receptor protein was primarily localized in the neurons, not in the neurons, not in the astrocytes or microglia. Pre-injury treatments with multi-doses and a single dose of pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) attenuated cryoinjury, postinjury single dose (0.1 mg/kg) at 30 min (not 1 h) after cryoinjury was also effective. Conclusion: The CysLT1 receptor modulates cryoinjury in mice at least partly, and postinjury treatment with its antagonist pranlukast exerts the protective effect with a therapeutic window of 30 min.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, severity, location, aetiology, treatment and healing of medical device-related pressure ulcers (PUs) in intensive care patients for up to 7 days. A prospective repeated measures study design was used. Patients in six intensive care units of two major medical centres, one each in Australia and the USA, were screened 1 day per month for 6 months. Those with device-related ulcers were followed daily for up to 7 days. The outcome measures were device-related ulcer prevalence, pain, infection, treatment and healing. Fifteen of 483 patients had device-related ulcers and 9 of 15 with 11 ulcers were followed beyond screening. Their mean age was 60·5 years, and most were men, overweight and at increased risk of PU. Endotracheal (ET) and nasogastric (NG) tubes were the cause of most device-related ulcers. Repositioning was the most frequent treatment. Four of 11 ulcers healed within the 7-day observation period. In conclusion, device-related ulcer prevalence was 3·1%, similar to that reported in the limited literature available, indicating an ongoing problem. Systematic assessment and repositioning of devices are the mainstays of care. We recommend continued prevalence determination and that nurses remain vigilant to prevent device-related ulcers, especially in patients with NG and ET tubes.

AB  - Abstract The development of an infection is a major complication for some patients with implanted biomaterials. Whether the material or surface composition of the used biomaterial influences infection has not been directly compared for key biomaterials currently in use in human patients. We conducted a thorough in vitro and in vivo investigation using titanium (Ti) and polyether?ether?ketone (PEEK) as both commercially available and as modified equivalents (surface polished Ti, and oxygen plasma treated PEEK). Complement activation and cytokine secretion of cell of the immune system was assessed in vitro for all materials in the absence and presence of bacterial stimulants. In a follow-up in vivo study, we monitored bacterial infection associated with clinically available and standard Ti and PEEK inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. Complement activation was affected by material choice in the absence of bacterial stimulation, although the material based differences were largely lost upon bacterial stimulation. In the in vivo study, the bacterial burden, histological response and cytokine secretion suggests that there is no significant difference between both PEEK and Ti. In conclusion, the underlying material has a certain impact in the absence of bacterial stimulation, however, in the presence of bacterial stimulation, bacteria seem to dictate the responses in a manner that overshadows the influence of material surface properties. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary? Putty form graft materials may have additional favourable effects when compared with particulate ones in periodontal bone defects. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical and also radiographic changes following application of (i) putty form demineralized bone matrix (DBM), (ii) particulate form DBM and (iii) open flap debridement (control), using modified curtain suturing technique in the treatment of interproximal suprabony (horizontal) defects. Twenty-five chronic periodontitis patients with 125 sites (radiologically ≥4?mm horizontal bone defect) were selected to participate in this triple-blind, split mouth, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Putty and particulate form DBM grafts were placed at experimental sites. Clinical measurements included probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL), gingival recession and bone probing depth (BPD) were made at baseline and repeated 12?months after the operations. Standardized digital radiographs were also taken to measure radiographic bone level (RBL) at baseline and 12?months later to be compared in a software. Probing depth reductions and RAL gains were significantly improved in all treatment groups (P?<?0·001). No significant differences in soft tissue parameters were found among three groups (P?>?0·05). Bone probing depth measurements indicated comparable significant bone gain in graft applied groups (P?<?0·01) and a significant bone resorption in open flap debridement group (P?<?0·01). Radiographic evaluation did not show any significant bone gain or resorption in all treatment groups (P?>?0·05). The results of this study indicate that either putty or particulate DBM demonstrates similar enhancements in soft and hard tissue parameters. Applying putty or particulate form DBM results with slight bone formation when compared with open flap debridement in horizontal bone defects at 1-year post-operative examination according to BPD measurements.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - A prospective case-control study was undertaken at DLEAH from May, 2001 to February, 2003 to examine risk factors for development of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). A questionnaire was filled out by the attending doctor for each IMHA case diagnosed. The diagnosis of IMHA was made based on a PCV <25%, effective rule out of other diseases, and the presence of at least 2 of the following: spherocytosis; regenerative response with elevated reticulocytes or polychromasia; hemolysis characterized by bilirubinuria, hyperbilirubinemia, hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia; positive slide agglutination or positive Coombs' test. To provide case controls, the same questionnaire was filled out for the next canine patient admitted after diagnosis. Age, breed, vaccine history, previous illness, and medication history were examined. Date of admission was compared to total hospital case numbers to look for seasonality. The study contained 31 cases and 29 controls. Cases were significantly older than controls (7.45 years versus 5.1 years, p=0.01). Cocker spaniels and Cocker mixes were significantly more likely to be cases than controls (7/31 IMHA versus 1/29 controls, p=0.05). Medication and illness history for the 2 months prior to presentation was not significantly different between cases and controls. None of the IMHA cases had received antibiotics previously reported to be associated with IMHA. In contrast to previous studies, vaccination history was not significantly different between cases and controls. Five out of 31 cases had received vaccines in the previous 2 months; 4 of 9 controls had received vaccines in that same period. At least one case presented each month of the year. Although cases presented more frequently in the summer months, overall hospital case load was also elevated during these times. The monthly distributions of IMHA cases and total hospital case load were not significantly different.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the management and outcome of 10 cases of severe fulminant mitral regurgitation (MR) treated with SNP at the Animal Emergency Center between June of 1997 and August of 2000. The presence of acute respiratory distress with echocardiograph findings consistent with mitral regurgitation; no response to oxygen, lasix, and nitroglycerine ointment after 2?4 hours; and radiographic evidence that over 75% of the lung fields were involved defined dogs with severe fulminant MR. SNP was started at a dose of 1 ?g/kg/min. The dogs were monitored every 15?min by Doppler blood pressure, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, respiratory rate, and auscultation of the lungs for respiratory crackles were recorded. If the blood pressure remained above 90?mmHg systolic and increased lung sounds were present, the dose of SNP was increased by 1??g/kg/min every 15?min until respiratory crackles were reduced. These dogs were then maintained on that dose of SNP during what was called the ?maintenance period?. During this maintenance period, they were evaluated for signs of respiratory distress and blood pressure monitoring was recorded every 2 hours. The dogs were started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor during the maintenance period, and slowly tapered off the SNP. If the blood pressure decreased below 90?mmHg systolic, the dose of SNP was reduced to the previous dose. Eight dogs survived to discharge, one dog died 1 hour after starting SNP, and one dog was euthanized after 2 hours of SNP treatment. In the 8 dogs that survived, respiratory distress improved within 2 hours in 7 dogs (mean: 1.69, median: 2, range: 1.15?2) at a SNP dose of 1?3 ?g/kg/hr (mean: 1.75, median: 1.5 and range: 1?3). Respiratory distress improved in one dog within 6 hours on SNP at a dose of 5 ?g/kg/hr. In the survival group, SNP was maintained for 9?20 hours (mean: 14, median: 13 and range: 9?22). The taper of SNP occurred over 2?3 hours (mean: 4.2, median: 3 and range: 0?14) in 7 of the dogs that survived. One dog was tapered over 14 hours due to periodic episodes of hypotension and respiratory distress. The results suggest that use of SNP for treatment of dogs with CHF secondary to MR resulted in improvement in respiratory distress in 8 of the 10 dogs evaluated, and may be an effective alternative therapy for dogs with severe refractory CHF due to MR.

AB  - Objective: To retrospectively evaluate the indications, management and outcome of 152 cases of long-term positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Methods: Medical records of patients maintained on PPV for 24 hours or longer, from 1991 to 2001 were reviewed. All cases were categorized into 3 groups according to the reason they required PPV: animals with pulmonary parenchymal disease that were not adequately oxygenating (1), animals with neuromuscular or large airway disease that were not adequately ventilating (2), or animals with both inadequate oxygenation and ventilation (3). Results: A total of 152 ventilator episodes were identified represented by 124 dogs and 24 cats. The median duration of ventilation was 49 hours (range 24?356 hours). Overall, 41.4% of cases were weaned, and 27% of cases survived to discharge. There were 78 cases with inadequate oxygenation (Group 1), of which 37.2% were weaned and 20.5% survived to discharge. There were 62 cases with inadequate ventilation (Group 2), of which 50% were weaned and 38.7% survived to discharge. In Group 3, 10 cases were identified; 25% were weaned and 8.3% survived to discharge. Arterial blood gases were collected in 61.2% of cases prior to PPV. Venous blood gases were collected in 10.5% of cases and an SpO2 was recorded on 2% of cases. In 26.3% of cases, no blood gas or SpO2 measurements were performed prior to PPV. The mean PaCO2 prior to PPV was 46.9±15.5?mmHg in Group 1, 72.6±26.9?mmHg in Group 2, and 64.3±14.1?mmHg in Group 3. In Groups 1, 2 and 3, the mean PaO2/FIO2 ratio was 101.7±67.6, 262.6±210.9 and 115.7±75.9, respectively. Pentobarbital, with or without diazepam, was the most common induction (28.9%) and maintenance (61.8%) agent utilized. Most cases (91.4%) were initially stabilized with volume or pressure control. Of the animals weaned from PPV, synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation was used in 46% of cases and continuous positive airway pressure was used in 22.2%. Complications included pneumothorax (6.6%), oral ulceration (5.9%), and corneal ulceration (3.9%). Conclusion: Long-term PPV can be both practical and successful in veterinary medicine. Patients that require PPV due to pulmonary parenchymal disease had lower weaning and survival rates than those without.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Introduction: The study objective was to describe the underlying diseases, predisposing factors, clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with thromboembolic disease of non-cardiogenic origin in cats. Study Design: Necropsy-based retrospective study (1991?2002) Results: Forty-eight cats with thromboemboli that were not associated with significant structural heart disease were identified in a retrospective study using case records from the small animal necropsy service of the University of Pennsylvania, from 1991 to 2002. Thirty-five cats presented for non-specific signs such as lethargy and anorexia while others presented for signs such as paresis (10) or dyspnea (10) that were referable to the location of the thromboemboli. Thromboembolic disease was suspected clinically in 12 of 48 cats. In cases where a single predisposing factor could be identified, thromboemboli were associated with neoplastic (9), infectious (7) and inflammatory (3) disease. Thirteen cats had multiple predisposing factors and no obvious predisposing factor could be identified in 16 cats. The thromboemboli were found in the systemic arteries (12), systemic veins (9), both systemic arteries and veins (7), pulmonary vasculature (7) and in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation (13). Eleven cats either died at home, presented in respiratory or cardiac arrest, or arrested shortly after presentation to the emergency service. Two cats arrested later during hospitalization and the remainder were euthanized (35). No sex or breed disposition was found. There were no significant differences in serum biochemistries, coagulation profiles, lactate, Doppler blood pressure or rectal temperature when groups were compared by primary disorder. Cats with neoplasia as the underlying disorder were significantly older (median 13.5 years, p=0.04). Cats with infectious disease had statistically significant higher white blood cell counts (median 35,000/?l, p=0.03) and cats with inflammatory disease had significantly longer hospital stays (median 3 days, p=0.006). Conclusion: These results suggest that most cats with non-cardiac related thromboemboli often have multiple predisposing factors, non-specific signs and non-specific changes on laboratory parameters. More sensitive tests for hypercoagulability may aid in diagnosing thromboemboli in cats.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.
