AB  - SUMMARY Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a pivotal cytokine at the centre of a cascade of cytokines and inflammatory mediators which modulate the host response to infection and trauma, and in particular the metabolic changes resulting in shock and subsequent multi-organ failure. The cytokine IL-8?predominantly an activator and chemotactic factor for circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes?is produced in response to TNF-αin vitro, and high circulating levels of IL-8 are found in septic primates. We have studied the release of IL-8 into the circulation of subjects with chronic hepatitis B undergoing a 10 week pilot trial of recombinant TNF-α (rTNF-α) therapy in doses of 15-100 ?g/m2, A marked dose-dependent increase in plasma IL-8 levels was seen commencing at 30-60 min after the start of rTNF-α infusion and peaking between 2 and 3 h (mean peak level 4300 ng/l). The temporal pattern of IL-8 production exactly echoed that of IL-6, another component of the cytokine cascade, but peak plasma levels of IL-8 were up to 17 times higher than those of IL-6. This study confirms in vitro data suggesting that IL-8 is a component of the acute circulating cytokine cascade with a potential role in the modulation of the acute immune and metabolic response to infection and trauma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between prealbumin, nutrient intake, and indicators of inflammation for recuperative and rehabilitative care patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Recuperative Care Unit within a Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eleven men (100 white; mean age 80, range 64?93). MEASUREMENTS: Prealbumin and seven markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their soluble receptors) were measured at admission and discharge (median length of stay 23 days, interquartile range 15?40 days). Detailed calorie counts were performed daily, and intake was expressed as a percentage of estimated requirements for protein (1.5?g/kg body weight per day) and energy (Harris-Benedict equation). The study objective was examined using least-squares regression analysis. RESULTS: Discharge prealbumin and the change in prealbumin were positively correlated with protein and energy intake and inversely correlated with markers of inflammation, particularly CRP and IL-6. When all covariates were included in a multivariable regression analysis, the markers of inflammation predominantly accounted for the variance in prealbumin change (56%), whereas discharge protein intake accounted for 6%. CONCLUSION: For older recuperative care patients, prealbumin and its change during hospitalization are positively associated with protein intake, but inflammation or changes in inflammation appear to exert a much more-powerful influence on prealbumin concentration. Given the potential confounding effects of inflammation, monitoring the change in prealbumin is not an adequate substitute for a more-detailed nutritional assessment in this population.

AB  - Summary The inflammatory response to acute injury among humans has proved difficult to study due to the significant heterogeneity encountered in actual patients. We set out to characterize the immune response to a model injury with reduced heterogeneity, a tracheostomy, among stable critical care patients, using a broad cytokine panel and clinical data. Twenty-three critical care patients undergoing percutaneous bedside tracheostomies were recruited in a medical intensive care unit. Blood samples were collected at five intervals during 24-h peri-procedure. Patients were followed-up for 28 days for clinical outcomes. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the cytokines between the five time-points when studied as a whole cohort. Longitudinal analysis of the cytokine patterns at the individual patient level with a clustering algorithm showed that, notwithstanding the significant heterogeneity observed, the patients? cytokine responses can be classified into three broad patterns that show increasing, decreasing or no major changes from the baseline. This analytical approach also showed statistically significant associations between cytokines, with those most likely to be associated being interleukin (IL)-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and ferritin, as well as a strong tri-way correlation between GCSF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1? (MIP1?). In conclusion, in this standard human model of soft tissue injury, by applying longitudinal analysis at the individual level, we have been able to identify the cytokine patterns underlying the seemingly random, heterogeneous patient responses. We have also identified consistent cytokine interactions suggesting that IL-6, GCSF, MCP1 and MIP1? are the cytokines most probably driving the immune response to this injury.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Background:? The results of intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures from Australian institutions have not been widely reported. This study examines a consecutive group of patients treated at a major metropolitan trauma centre and reports on the injury statistics and outcome data, and compares this to previously reported results from the literature. Methods:? A total of 101 fractures in 97 consecutive adult patients were included in the study. Nine patients were excluded. At a minimum of 6?months post injury, 54 patients were interviewed by telephone and 35 patients presented for clinical review and underwent physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scanogram of the lower limbs and Short Form 36 questionnaires. Results:? Road trauma accounted for 81% of injuries and 15% of fractures were open. Of the 54 patients reviewed, 13 (23%) required further surgery for delayed or non-union. Of the 35 who presented for physical examination, there was poor correlation between perceived leg length discrepancy and measured leg length discrepancy on examination or scanogram. Presence of a limp correlated with measured leg length discrepancy of more than 1?cm but did not correlate with rotational abnormality measured on CT scanogram. Pain at the hip, thigh or knee was present in 60% of patients. The Short Form 36 scores for physical functioning, role ? physical, bodily pain, general health and vitality were all significantly lower than population norms with P values ranging from <0.001?0.05. Subgroup analysis comparing isolated femur fracture to multi-trauma patients for all five of these parameters revealed significant differences only in the multi-trauma group. Conclusion:? The incidence of pain, limp, leg length discrepancy and delayed or non-union is higher in this study than in previously reported results of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures. This may be due to differences in the patient population, the skill level of the operating surgeon, or incomplete follow up.

AB  - Background Patients with traumatic bladder rupture frequently have associated pelvic fracture. With increasing numbers of pelvic fractures fixed internally, there are concerns that conservative management of bladder rupture may increase the risk of pelvic metalware infection. This study aims to determine if operative repair of bladder rupture in comparison to conservative management with catheter drainage alone is associated with a lower rate of infection of internal fixation device for concurrent pelvic fracture. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of level IV evidence. From July 2001 through June 2013, 45 multi-trauma patients at a level 1 trauma centre were identified to have sustained bladder rupture with concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation. Clinicopathological data were extracted from the TraumaNET database, medical records and health-coding database. Patients were stratified into two retrospective cohorts, management with surgical repair and management with catheter drainage alone. Fischer's exact test was used to determine whether the rate of pelvic metalware infection was different in the two cohorts. Results Of the 45 patients, 13 had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, 28 had extraperitoneal bladder rupture and four had combined intra-extraperitoneal bladder rupture. The median age for this cohort was 31. Bladder rupture was surgically repaired in 36 patients and managed conservatively with catheter drainage in nine patients. The rate of pelvic internal fixation device infection was lower in patients managed with surgical repair compared with conservative management (5.6% versus 33.3%, P = 0.047). Conclusion Operative repair of bladder rupture is associated with a lower rate of pelvic orthopaedic hardware infection in the presence of concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation.

AB  - In India, the case fatality ratio of the pandemic A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza was relatively higher when compared to seasonal Influenza A infection. Hypercytokinemia or ?cytokine storm? has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of other influenza viruses. The present study was undertaken to compare the cytokine profiles of A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza and seasonal H3 infection in Indian population and to correlate the findings with disease severity. Plasma levels of 18 cytokines/chemokines were measured by flow-cytometry using a bead based assay in patients infected with A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (n?=?96) and Influenza A seasonal H3 virus (n?=?30) categorised into mild, moderate, and severe groups along with healthy controls (n?=?36). There was an overall trend indicating an exuberant cytokine/chemokine response in A (H1N1) pdm09 as compared to seasonal H3 influenza, which was more evident in severe cases, suggesting a role for these cytokines/chemokines in the pathogenesis of A(H1N1) pdm09. Increased levels of CXCL-8/IL-8, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-17A were seen in both A(H1N1) pdm09 influenza and seasonal H3 cases when compared to healthy controls. However, dysregulated production of proinflammatory chemokines was seen more pronounced in A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza cases as compared to seasonal H3 cases. This study has brought forth the potential role of chemokines as prognostic indicators of disease severity and outcome. Further research on modulating the host immune response to limit severity of the disease could help in the treatment and management of influenza.

AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.

AB  - Summary The counter-regulatory mechanisms initiated to limit the overzealous inflammatory process in patients with infectious (sepsis) or non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) led to the concept of ?compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome? (CARS). One major consequence of CARS is the modification of the immune status that could favor the enhanced susceptibility of intensive care patients to nosocomial infections. The expression of surface markers can be modified, and numerous functions of circulating leukocytes are altered in sepsis and SIRS patients, as well as in animal models of sepsis or SIRS. However, this is rather a reprogramming of circulating leukocytes, since there is not a global defect of the immune cells functions.

AB  - Abstract Background and objectives The aim of this study was to assess cellular and peritoneal immune responses after radical laparoscopic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods Peripheral heparinized plasma and plain serum tube samples were collected preoperatively, and at 2 hr, 1 day, and 4 days postoperatively for analysis o; white blood cells, total lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-suppressor lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A. Twenty-four hours peritoneal fluid collection was performed on days 1 and 4 for TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 analysis. Results No statistical differences were observed between the two groups with respect to immunocompetent cell counts. The serum levels of plasma CRP and SAA gradually increased significantly with time in both groups, but these temporal increases were lower in the LADG group (CRP; P?=?0.03, SAA; P?=?0.01). Peritoneal TNF-α levels in the CODG group at 4 days postoperatively were significantly higher than at day 1, but remained almost unchanged in the LADG group, and this difference was significant (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Because of its association with reduced peritoneal immune activity, laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer may require careful consideration in practice. Additional, larger prospective multicenter trials are required before a consensus can be reached. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:54?59. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Summary? The advent of selective internal urethrotomy under direct vision has enabled precision endoscopic surgery to be undertaken on a wide range of urethral strictures. A multi-centre survey of 197 cases involving 322 urethrotomy procedures from 5 urological departments in England is reported. The overall results after a follow-up of up to 4 years suggest that there is no indication for further procedures currently existing in 160 (81%) of those cases subjected to selective internal urethrotomy. The additional injection of triamcinalone acetate into the strictured area prior to urethrotomy is recommended in resistant cases The procedure of selective internal urethrotomy is, in our opinion, the best primary method for the treatment of urethral stricture, and it is hoped this will reduce the indications for anastomotic or substitution urethroplasty.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and lymphotoxin-α, have been described widely to play important roles in the brain in physiologic conditions and after traumatic injury. However, the exact mechanisms involved in their function have not been fully elucidated. We give some insight on their role by using animals lacking either Type 1 receptor (TNFR1KO) or Type 2 (TNFR2KO) and their controls (C57Bl/6). Both TNFR1KO and to a greater extent TNFR2KO mice showed increased exploration/activity neurobehavioral traits in the hole board test, such as rearings, head dippings, and ambulations, compared with wild-type mice, suggesting an inhibitory role of TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the elevated plus maze test, ruling out a major role of these receptors in the control of anxiety. We next evaluated the response to a freeze injury to the somatosensorial cortex. The effect of the cryolesion on motor function was evaluated with the horizontal ladder beam test, and the results showed that both TNFR1KO and TNFR2KO mice made fewer errors, suggesting a detrimental role for TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling for coping with brain damage. Expression of ?22600 genes was analyzed using an Affymetrix chip (MOE430A) at 0 (unlesioned), 1, or 4 days post-lesion in the three strains. The results show a unique and major role of both TNF receptors on the pattern of gene expression elicited by the injury but also in normal conditions, and suggest that blocking of TNFR1/TNFR2 receptors may be beneficial after a traumatic brain injury. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Summary We proposed that many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients would be hypothermic in the early postoperative period and that hypothermia would be associated with increased mortality. We retrospectively reviewed patients admitted to ICU after surgery. We recorded the lowest temperature in the first 24?h after surgery using tympanic membrane thermometers. We defined hypothermia as <?36?°C, and severe hypothermia as <?35?°C. We studied 5050 consecutive patients: 35% were hypothermic and 6% were severely hypothermic. In-hospital mortality was 5.6% for normothermic patients, 8.9% for all hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001), and 14.7% for severely hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001). Hypothermia was associated with in-hospital mortality: OR 1.83 for each degree Celsius (°C) decrease (95% CI: 1.2?2.60, p?<?0.001). Given the evidence for improved outcome associated with active patient warming during surgery we suggest conducting prospective studies of active warming of patients admitted to ICU after surgery.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the Injury Severity Score (ISS) in an alpine area. Hafjell Alpine Centre was the 1994 Winter Olympic Alpine arena in Lillehammer. A total of 2 044 484 lift transportations and 183 injuries were registered in the two winter seasons 1991 and 1992. The injury rate was 1.8 injuries per 1000 skier days. The mean ISS was 3.6 per injury for this particular alpine area. Thirty-six per cent of the injured were women and 35.5% were between 15 and 19 years of age. There was no difference in mean ISS between male and female skiers, but mean ISS was higher in adolescents than in the other age groups. Injuries to the knee represented the single most frequently injured body region, but injuries to the abdomen had the highest mean ISS. Alpine skiers suffered more severe injuries than telemark and snowboard skiers Severe injuries (ISS > 16) were recorded when unexpected objects, such as a grooming machine, a net, a root, etc., appeared on the slopes. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and ISS give us additional information about the condition of the slopes, and their use as a tool in preventing skiing injuries is recommended.
