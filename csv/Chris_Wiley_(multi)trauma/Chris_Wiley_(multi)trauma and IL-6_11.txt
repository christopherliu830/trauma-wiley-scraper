AB  - Background Exacerbation of cutaneous wound infections and delayed wound closure are frequent complications seen in alcohol exposed subjects who sustain injuries. We previously reported that acute alcohol exposure alters the early dermal inflammatory phase of wound healing and also several parameters of the proliferative wound healing phase in wounds from ethanol (EtOH)-treated mice for several days or weeks after EtOH exposure. Hence, it is likely that the cumulative defects arising in the early phases of the wound healing process directly contribute to the increased complications observed in intoxicated patients at the time of injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal EtOH (2.2 g/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) EtOH using our episodic binge EtOH exposure protocol (3 days EtOH, 4 days off, 3 days EtOH) to yield a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 300 mg/dl at the time of wounding. Mice were subjected to six 3 mm full-thickness dorsal wounds and immediately treated topically with 10 ?l of sterile saline (control) or diluted Staphylococcus aureus corresponding to 1 ? 104 CFU/wound. Wounds were harvested at 24 hours post injury to evaluate wound area, neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, and the protein levels of cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1?, and IL-10, and chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and MIP-1α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC). The abundance and localization of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and the kallikrein epidermal proteases (KLK5 and KLK7) were also determined. Results Compared to control mice, EtOH-treated mice exhibited delayed wound closure, decreased macrophage accumulation, and impaired production of MIP-1α. Furthermore, skin from EtOH-treated mice demonstrated a reduction in the abundance of epidermal CRAMP and KLK7. Conclusions These findings suggest that EtOH exposure hinders several distinct components of the innate immune response, including phagocyte recruitment and chemokine/cytokine and AMP production. Together, these effects likely contribute to delayed wound closure and enhanced infection severity observed in intoxicated patients.

AB  - Abstract Extracts from the seed of the African shea tree Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn have been used traditionally for the treatment of arthritic conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which benefit is conferred. This single-site, 15-week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study examined a range of biomarkers in 89 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees and/or hips to determine potential modes of action of SheaFlex70TM, a triterpene-rich extract of Vitellaria paradoxa. In the group of participants with levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers in the upper quartile at baseline, there were significant decreases in inflammation and cartilage breakdown and trend level decreases in bone remodeling in the SheaFlex70TM group versus placebo between commencement and completion of the study. Inflammation marker TNF-alpha fell 23.9% vs 6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.041. Cartilage degradation marker CTX-II fell 28.7% vs an increase of 17.6% (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.018. This marker also showed significant falls across the entire study group, 10.6% vs an increase of 11.6%, (treatment vs placebo), p = 0.016. Osteocalcin levels fell 9.2%, p = 0.014 (treatment) vs 1.2%, ns (placebo), p = 0.096 (treatment vs placebo). These findings indicate that in patients with the highest levels of osteoarthritis biomarkers, SheaFlex70TM demonstrated multiple beneficial activities consistent with slowing the disease process.

AB  - Secreted cytokines and growth factors play a key role in the modulation of stem cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. To investigate the interplay between the changes in their expression levels, we used the newly characterized human amniotic fluid derived-mesenchymal progenitor MePR-2B cell line differentiated to a neuro-glial phenotype and exploited the very high sensitivity and versatility of magnetic beads-based immunoassays. We found that a sub-set of proteins, including the cytokines IL-6, TNFα, IL-15, IFN?, IL-8, IL-1ra, MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES and the growth factor PDGFbb, underwent a significant down-regulation following neuro-glial differentiation, whereas the expression levels of IL-12 p70, IL-5, IL-7, bFGF, VEGF and G-CSF were increased. The role of MCP-1/CCL2, previously identified as a regulator of neural progenitor stem cell differentiation, has been further investigated at transcriptional level, revealing that both the chemokine and its receptor are co-expressed in MePR-2B cells and that are regulated upon differentiation, suggesting the presence of an autocrine and paracrine loop in differentiating cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that exogenous CCL2 is capable to affect neuro-glial differentiation in MePR-2B cells, thus providing novel evidences for the potential involvement of chemokine-mediated signaling in progenitor/stem cells differentiation processes and fate specification.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) treatment initiating after inflammation stage on the process of bone-tendon junction (BTJ) healing in a rabbit model. Thirty-six rabbits undergoing partial patellectomy were randomly divided into two groups: control and LIPUS. The period of initial inflammatory stage is 2 weeks. So LIPUS treatment was initiated at postoperative week 2 and continued until the patella-patellar tendon (PPT) complexes were harvested at postoperative weeks 4, 8, and 16. At each time point, the PPT complexes were harvested for qRT-PCR, histology, radiographs, synchroton radiation micro computed tomography (SR-µCT), and biomechanical testing. The qRT-PCR results showed that LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 played an anti-inflammatory role in BTJ healing. Histologically, the LIPUS group showed more advanced remodeling of the lamellar bone and marrow cavity than the control group. The area and length of the new bone in the LIPUS group were significantly greater than the control group at postoperative weeks 8 and 16. SR-µCT demonstrated that new bone formation and remodeling in the LIPUS group were more advanced than the control group. Biomechanical test results demonstrated that the failure load, ultimate strength and energy at failure were significantly higher than those of the control group. In conclusion, LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 was able to accelerate bone formation during the bone-tendon junction healing process and significantly improved the healing quality of BTJ injury. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract In multiple sclerosis (MS), the presence of demyelinating plaques has concentrated researchers' minds on the role of the oligodendrocyte in its pathophysiology. Recently, with the rediscovery of early and widespread loss of axons in the disease, new emphasis has been put on the role of axons and axon-oligodendrocyte interactions in MS. Despite the fact that, in 1904, Müller claimed that MS was a disease of astrocytes, more recently, astrocytes have taken a back seat, except as the cells that form the final glial scar after all hope of demyelination is over. However, perhaps it is time for the return of the astrocyte to popularity in the pathogenesis of MS, with recent reports on the dual role of astrocytes in aiding degeneration and demyelination, by promoting inflammation, damage of oligodendrocytes and axons, and glial scarring, but also in creating a permissive environment for remyelination by their action on oligodendrocyte precursor migration, oligodendrocyte proliferation, and differentiation. We review these findings to try to provide a cogent view of astrocytes in the pathology of MS. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background:? The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the haemodynamic profile of patients with extensive burns during the early fluid resuscitation phase, (2) evaluate myocardial performance by invasive monitoring and echocardiography and (3) analyze the relations between serum cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and natriuretic peptide (ANP, BNP) concentrations and myocardial function in these patients. Methods:? Prospective, clinical study in a tertiary care burn centre. Invasive haemodynamic measurements including a pulmonary artery catheter, echocardiography, blood samples for cytokine and atriopeptide analyses. The follow-up time was up to 72?h postinjury. Results:? According to echocardiography, patients were hypovolaemic despite aggressive (median 7,9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 3.3?11.7) fluid resuscitation and adequate urine output (median 0.9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 0.46?1.35) during the first day postinjury. There were no consistent findings of hyperlactatemia, metabolic acidosis or low mixed venous oxygen saturations. Daily highest and lowest values of cardiac index and stroke volume index increased and the lowest and highest values of systemic vascular resistance decreased. Cardiac performance (stroke volume index) improved during the study period even though there were no initial signs of myocardial depression in echocardiography. Three patients received a dobutamine infusion based on clinical judgement. There was no consistent association between haemodynamic changes and plasma cytokine concentrations. Conclusion:? Persisting hypovolaemia is evident in the resuscitation phase of extensive burns despite aggressive fluid therapy and the lack of classic signs of hypoperfusion. Cardiac performance improves during the first days after extensive burn injury without association with plasma cytokine profile.

AB  - Abstract The immune and endocrine systems ensure two vital functions in the body. The immune system protects us from lethal pathogens, whereas the endocrine system ensures proper metabolic function of peripheral organs by regulating systemic homeostasis. These two systems were long thought to operate independently. The immune system uses cytokines and immune receptors, whereas the endocrine system uses hormones to regulate metabolism. However, recent findings show that the immune and endocrine systems closely interact, especially regarding regulation of glucose metabolism. In response to pathogen encounter, cytokines modify responsiveness of peripheral organs to endocrine signals, resulting in altered levels of blood hormones such as insulin, which promotes the ability of the body to fight infection. Here we provide an overview of recent literature describing various mechanisms, which the immune system utilizes to modify endocrine regulation of systemic metabolism. Moreover, we will describe how these immune?endocrine interactions derail in the context of obesity. From a clinical perspective we will elaborate how infection and obesity aggravate the development of metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2 in humans. In summary, this review provides a comprehensive overview of immune-induced changes in systemic metabolism following infection, with a focus on regulation of glucose metabolism.

AB  - Abstract The study was designed to investigate whether complement is activated in patients subject to rectal surgery and whether the choice of surgical technique (open or laparoscopic) has any impact on the activation of complement. Our hypothesis is that laparoscopic surgery leads to a lower-level activation of complement than open surgery. Patients (n?=?24) subject to rectal surgery owing to rectal cancer were included. The study was prospective and randomized. The patients were randomized to either laparoscopic surgery (n?=?12) or open surgery (n?=?12). Blood samples for determination of complement activation (C4d, Bb, C3bc and the terminal C5b-9 complex TCC) were drawn before start of surgery (T0) and at the following time-points after start of surgery: 180?min (T1), 360?min (T2), 24?h (T3) and 3?5?days (T4). A significant increase in the alternative pathway activation product Bb and in the terminal pathway activation product TCC was seen over time in both groups (P?<?0.001). Bb peaked early (T1) and returned to baseline levels post-operatively, whereas TCC increased steadily with maximum values in the late post-operative period. The plasma concentrations of C4d and C3bc decreased significantly in both groups at T1 and T2 and returned to baseline levels at T4. There was no significant difference between the groups. Rectal surgery causes activation of the complement system. Complement is activated through the alternative pathway. Results mostly showed no significant differences between laparoscopic and open rectal surgery apart from lower levels of factor Bb in the former group in the perioperative period.

Chondrotin sulphate in psoriasis -? Chondrotin sulphate in atherosclerosis -? Chondroitin sulphate in IBD -? Chondroitin sulphate in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) -? Other autoimmune diseases that may benefit from chondroitin sulphate ?? Conclusions Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is a natural glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix and is formed by the 1?3 linkage of D-glucuronic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine. In chondrocytes, CS diminishes interleukin-1 p (IL-1p)-induced increases in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and decreases nuclear factor-KB (NF-kB) nuclear translocation and as a consequence, reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 p and TNF-a, and pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2). The mechanism of action of CS explains its beneficial effect on the cartilage, synovial membrane and subchondral bone. On the other hand, in vivo, CS given orally prevents hepatic NF-kB nuclear translocation, suggesting that systemic CS may elicit an anti-inflammatory effect in many tissues besides the articulation. There is preliminary evidence showing that in human beings, CS may be of benefit in other diseases where inflammation is an essential marker, such as psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The review of the literature suggest that CS might also be of interest for the treatment of other diseases with an inflammatory and/or autoimmune character, such as inflammatory bowel disease, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system and stroke, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if phenytoin protein binding and metabolism were altered in prepubescent pediatric patients within the first 10 days following severe, acute traumatic brain injury. Patients (n = 10) received phenytoin loading doses (15?20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance regimen (7 mg/kg/day) initiated within 12 hours of the loading dose. Phenytoin serum concentrations were measured serially on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 at 1, 6, and 12 hours. Time-invariant and time-variant Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetic models were fit to the unbound phenytoin concentration-time data (ADAPT II?). Albumin concentrations significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001) and were predictive of the phenytoin binding ratio (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.0001). The time-variant model provided a superior fit of the data in 7 patients with no difference between models in 3 patients. Rapid inhibition of metabolism (Vmaxbaseline = 2.82 ± 2.35 mg/kg/day) was observed initially following injury. This was followed by induction of metabolism as reflected by a Vmaxinduced of 20.79 ± 13.71 mg/kg/day, which was approximately twofold higher than reported values for nonstressed children. Children with severe, acute neurotrauma were found to have markedly altered protein binding and phenytoin metabolism.

AB  - Crocus sativus L. (C.?sativus), commonly known as saffron, is used as a food additive, preservative, and medicinal herb. Traditionally, it has been used as an alternative treatment for different diseases. C.?sativus' medicinal effects are related to its major constituents like crocins, crocetin, and safranal. According to the literature, C.?sativus and its constituents could be considered as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, coronary artery diseases, asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, diabetes, and so on. Recently, numerous studies have reported such medicinal properties and found that the underlying mechanisms of action may be mediated by antioxidant, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. C.?sativus enhances the antioxidant capacity and acts as a free radical scavenger. As an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, it modulates inflammatory mediators, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity responses. This review highlights in vitro and animal findings regarding antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of C.?sativus and its constituents. Present review found that the C.?sativus and its main constituents such as safranal, crocins, and crocetin could be effective against various diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulatory effects.

AB  - Abstract Despite very significant technical and software improvements in flow cytometry (FCM) since the 1980's, the demand for a cytometric technology combining both quantitative cell analysis and morphological documentation in Cytomics became evident. Improvements in microtechnology and computing permit nowadays similar quantitative and stoichiometric single cell-based high-throughput analyses by microscopic instruments, like Slide-Based Cytometry (SBC). SBC and related techniques offer unique tools to perform complex immunophenotyping, thereby enabling diagnostic procedures during early disease stages. Multicolor or polychromatic analysis of cells by SBC is of special importance not only as a cytomics technology platform but also because of low quantities of required reagents and biological material. The exact knowledge of the location of each cell on the slide permits repetitive restaining and reanalysis of specimens. Various separate measurements of the same specimen can be ultimately fused to one database increasing the information obtained per cell. Relocation and optical evaluation of cells as typical SBC feature, can be of integral importance for cytometric analysis, since artifacts can be excluded and morphology of measured cells can be documented. Progress in cell analytic: In the SBC, new horizons can be opened by the new techniques of structural and functional analysis with the high resolution from intracellular and membrane (confocal microscopy, nanoscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and tissue level (tissomics), to organ and organism level (in vivo cytometry, optical whole body imaging). Predictive medicine aims at the detection of changes in patient's state prior to the manifestation of the disease or the complication. Such instances concern immune consequences of surgeries or noninfectious posttraumatic shock in intensive care patients or the pretherapeutic identification of high risk patients in cancer cytostatic therapy. Preventive anti-infectious or anti-shock therapy as well as curative chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation may provide better survival chances for patient at concomitant cost containment. Predictive medicine-guided optimization of therapy could lead to individualized medicine that gives significant therapeutic effect and may lower or abrogate potential therapeutic side effects. The 10th Leipziger Workshop combined with the 3rd International Workshop on SBC aimed to offer new methods in Image- and Slide-Based Cytometry for solutions in clinical research. It moved towards practical applications in the clinics and the clinical laboratory. This development will be continued in 2006 at the upcoming Leipziger Workshop and the International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry. ? 2005 International Society for Analytical Cytology

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

AB  - Changes in the differential blood cell count, monocyte phenotype and the cytokine plasma levels in a group of seven patients with cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and nine patients with thoracic surgery/without CPB, both receiving identical opioid-based anaesthetic technique, were assessed. A significant reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes was observed after anaesthesia and surgery. Interestingly, at the end of surgery as well as 1 day post-surgery a marked increase in the number of granulocytes was noted. General anaesthesia and surgery caused a significant reduction of HLA-DR and CD11c/CD18 molecules, starting immediately after induction of anaesthesia, and an increase of CD64 at day 1 after anaesthesia. The use of a CPB was followed by a significant reduction of CD32, CD16, CD54 and HLA-ABC antigens expression at the end of surgery. One day after surgery these parameters returned nearly to baseline values with the exception of CD54. A monocyte subpopulation, characterized by low CD14, high CD16 and HLA-DR expression (CD14+CD16+HLA-DR++) was found in both groups at each time point, and the percentage of this cell subset decreased from baseline to 24?h. The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 increased considerably during CPB. No dynamic changes of IL-1 level due to surgery or CPB were found. We conclude that anaesthesia as well as the use of CPB induced profound alterations in the number of circulating leucocytes, and in the phenotype of monocyte and cytokine production.

AB  - Summary Objective? IGFs and IGF binding proteins in the circulation are subject to modulation by a number of catabolic states including inflammation, trauma and surgery. We sought to determine the impact of laparoscopy on the IGF system in patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. Design? The components of the IGF system, cortisol, glucose and insulin concentration in both the serum and urine of patients were compared to those from a healthy group of subjects. An additional comparison was made between pre- and post-laparoscopically assisted patients. Patients? Thirty patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and 81 matched controls were included in the study. Measurements? Radioimmunoassays were used to determine the IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin and cortisol concentrations. The concentration of IGFBP-3 was measured using an immunoradiometric assay. The GOD-PAP method was used to determine the glucose concentration. Gel filtration chromatography was performed to calculate the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio. The amount of sialic acid in IGFBP-3 was determined by affinity chromatography. The presence of IGFBPs in serum was determined by both immunoblotting and ligandblotting. Results? The concentrations of circulating IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were significantly reduced in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. No further reductions were observed post-laparoscopy. Immunoblotting and ligandblotting demonstrated a decreased amount of IGFBP-3 in both pre- and post-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. Increased levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-1 were observed in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects, but laparoscopy did not cause further elevation. No alteration in the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio was witnessed between any of the study groups. A significant increase in the sialic acid content of IGFBP-3 was seen in both patient groups when compared to healthy subjects. The level of urinary cortisol was significantly increased in post-operative patients, whereas the urinary IGF-I concentration was decreased compared to healthy subjects. Conclusions? Our results indicate that acute cholecystitis causes several significant changes in the circulating IGF system. Laparoscopy, however, does not aggravate such changes, but elevates urinary cortisol.

AB  - Abstract One of the most overlooked of all serious complications of diabetes is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. There is now clear evidence that suggests activation of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic patients and that these correlate with abnormalities in sympathovagal balance. Dysfunction of the autonomic system predicts cardiovascular risk and sudden death in patients with type 2 diabetes. It also occurs in prediabetes, providing opportunities for early intervention. Simple tests that can be carried out at the bedside with real-time output of information ? within the scope of the practicing physician ? facilitate diagnosis and allow the application of sound strategies for management. The window of opportunity for aggressive control of all the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular events or sudden death with intensification of therapy is with short duration diabetes, the absence of cardiovascular disease and a history of severe hypoglycemic events. To this list we can now add autonomic dysfunction and neuropathy, which have become the most powerful predictors of risk for mortality. It seems prudent that practitioners should be encouraged to become familiar with this information and apply risk stratification in clinical practice. Several agents have become available for the correction of functional defects in the autonomic nervous system, and restoration of autonomic balance is now possible.

AB  - Though first introduced more than 130 years ago, the concept of stress diabetes or stress hyperglycemia has gained tremendous attention in recent years in view of the landmark article by van den Berghe and colleagues in 2001. As opposed to earlier work that suggested that hyperglycemia in the acute clinical setting may be beneficial, it now appears that lower glucose levels are associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms behind the improved outcomes are numerous and seem to be tied to the inflammatory process. Both lower glucose values and insulin therapy seem to be anti-inflammatory, whereas hyperglycemia increases the proinflammatory process and negatively affects the innate immune system. Despite the numerous approaches to achieve normoglycemia described in the literature, only modest success has been achieved. Understanding the pathophysiology driving stress hyperglycemia?the stress response and modulation of the inflammatory process?seems to be the key to improving the care of the most critically ill and injured patients.
