AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - Abstract Aging is associated with a decline of performance leading to reduced reproductive output and survival. While the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging has attracted considerable attention, the molecular/physiological functions underlying the early-life benefits/late-life costs paradigm remain elusive. We tested the hypothesis that while early activation of the inflammatory response confers benefits in terms of protection against infection, it also incurs costs in terms of reduced reproductive output at old age and shortened longevity. We infected mice with the malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii and increased the inflammatory response using an anti-IL-10 receptor antibody treatment. We quantified the benefits and costs of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of the infection and at old age. In agreement with the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, the inflammatory response provided an early-life benefit, since infected mice that were treated with anti-IL-10 receptor antibodies had reduced parasite density and anemia. However, at old age, mice in all treatment groups had similar levels of C-reactive protein, reproductive output, survival rate, and lifespan. Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that the benefits of a robust response to malaria infection in early life incur longer term fitness costs.

AB  - Human vascularized allografts are perfused through blood vessels composed of cells (endothelium, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells) that remain largely of graft origin and are thus subject to host alloimmune responses. Graft vessels must be healthy to maintain homeostatic functions including control of perfusion, maintenance of permselectivity, prevention of thrombosis, and participation in immune surveillance. Vascular cell injury can cause dysfunction that interferes with these processes. Graft vascular cells can be activated by mediators of innate and adaptive immunity to participate in graft inflammation contributing to both ischemia/reperfusion injury and allograft rejection. Different forms of rejection may affect graft vessels in different ways, ranging from thrombosis and neutrophilic inflammation in hyperacute rejection, to endothelialitis/intimal arteritis and fibrinoid necrosis in acute cell-mediated or antibody-mediated rejection, respectively, and to diffuse luminal stenosis in chronic rejection. While some current therapies targeting the host immune system do affect graft vascular cells, direct targeting of the graft vasculature may create new opportunities for preventing allograft injury and loss.

AB  - PURPOSE Both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are associated with inflammatory microenvironments. Inflammation is damaging to tissues, but it is unclear how the inflammatory microenvironment protects specialized epithelial cells that function to proliferate and repair the tissue. The objective of this study is to characterize the cell death and cell survival response of the prostatic epithelium in response to inflammation. METHODS We assessed induction of cell death (TNF, TRAIL, TWEAK, FasL) and cell survival factors (IGFs, hedgehogs, IL?6, FGFs, and TGFs) in inflamed and control mouse prostates by ELISA. Cell death mechanisms were determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for cleavage of caspases and TUNEL. Survival pathway activation was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for Mcl?1, Bcl?2, Bcl?XL, and survivin. Autophagy was determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for free and membrane associated light chain 3 (LC?3). RESULTS Cleavage of all four caspases was significantly increased during the first 2 days of inflammation, and survival protein expression was substantially increased subsequently, maximizing at 3 days. By 5 days of inflammation, 50% of prostatic epithelial cells expressed survivin. Autophagy was also evident during the recovery phase (3 days). Finally, immunofluorescent staining of human specimens indicates strong activation of survival proteins juxtaposed to inflammation in inflamed prostate specimens. CONCLUSIONS The prostate responds to deleterious inflammation with induction of cell survival mechanisms, most notably survivin and autophagy, demonstrating a coordinated induction of survival factors that protects and expands a specialized set of prostatic epithelial cells as part of the repair and recovery process during inflammation.

AB  - Abstract? Our bacterial residents are deadly Janus-faced indwellers that can lead to a sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. Over half of ICU patients suffer from infections and sepsis remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Severe ileus frequently accompanies sepsis setting up an insidious cycle of gut-derived microbial translocation and the copious intestinal production of potent systemic inflammatory mediators. Few therapeutic advances have occurred to prevent/treat the sequelae of sepsis. Here, we selectively review studies on cellular membrane-bound Toll-like receptor (TLR) mechanisms of ileus. Virtually, no data exist on Gram-positive/TLR2 signaling mechanisms of ileus; however, TLR2 is highly inducible by numerous inflammatory mediators and studies using clinically relevant scenarios of Gram-positive sepsis are needed. Specific Gram-negative/TLR4 signaling pathways are being elucidated using a ?reverse engineering? approach, which has revealed that endotoxin-induced ileus is dually mediated by classical leukocyte signaling and by a MyD88-dependent non-bone marrow-derived mechanism, but the specific roles of individual cell populations are still unknown. Like TLR2, little is also know of the role of flagellin/TLR5 signaling in ileus. But, much can be learned by understanding TLR signaling in other systems. Clearly, the use of polymicrobial models provides important clinical relevancy, but the simultaneous activation of virtually all pattern recognition receptors makes it impossible to discretely study specific pathways. We believe that the dissection of individual TLR pathways within the gastrointestinal tract, which can then be intelligently reassembled in a meaningful manner, will provide insight into treatments for sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Prolonged and persistent hypermetabolism and excessive inflammatory response after severe trauma is detrimental and associated with poor outcome. The predisposing pathology or signals mediating this complex response are essentially unknown. As the liver is the central organ mediating the systemic metabolic responses and considering that adult hepatic stem cells are on top of the hierarchy of cell differentiation and may pass epigenetic information to their progeny, we asked whether liver progenitor cells are activated, signal hypermetabolism upon post-traumatic cellular stress responses, and pass this to differentiated progeny. We generated Sox9CreERT2: ROSA26 EYFP mice to lineage-trace the periportal ductal progenitor cells (PDPCs) and verify the fate of these cells post-burn. We observed increased proliferation of PDPCs and their progeny peaking around two weeks post-burn, concomitant with the hepatomegaly and the cellular stress responses. We then sorted out PDPCs, PDPC-derived hepatocytes and mature hepatocytes, compared their transcriptome and showed that PDPCs and their progeny present a significant up-regulation in signalling pathways associated with inflammation and metabolic activation, contributing to persistent hypermetabolic and hyper-inflammatory state. Furthermore, concomitant down-regulation of LXR signalling in PDPCs and their progeny implicates the therapeutic potential of early and short-term administration of LXR agonists in ameliorating such persistent hypermetabolism.

AB  - Abstract Concern about the use of nanomaterials has increased significantly in recent years due to potentially hazardous impacts on human health. Mast cells are critical for innate and adaptive immune responses, often modulating allergic and pathogenic conditions. Mast cells are well known to act in response to danger signals through a variety of receptors and pathways including IL-33 and the IL-1-like receptor ST2. Here, the involvement of mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis in pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) exposure are examined. Toxicological effects of MWCNTs are observed only in mice with a sufficient population of mast cells and are not observed when mast cells are absent or incapable of responding to IL-33. Our findings establish for the first time that mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis orchestrates adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to an engineered nanomaterial, giving insight into a previously unknown mechanism of toxicity. This novel mechanism of toxicity could be used for assessing the safety of engineered nanomaterials and provides a realistic therapeutic target for potential nanoparticle induced toxicities.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012; 42 (3): 290?302 Abstract Background and aims? Studies suggest clinical benefits of parenteral fish oil (FO), rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), over soyabean oil (SO), rich in n-6 PUFAs, in patients with pro-inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Because the mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear, the present study explored the effects of intravenous infusion of FO and SO on fatty acid incorporation, immune functions and (anti)oxidant balance in healthy human volunteers. Methods? Saline, a SO emulsion and a FO emulsion were administered for one hour on three consecutive days at a rate of 0·2?g/kg?BW/h to eight subjects in a randomized cross-over design with a 3-week interval between treatments. Plasma phospholipid and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fatty acid compositions, and leucocyte counts and functions were assessed prior to the first infusion (T?=?0, baseline) and 1?day (T?=?4, early effects) and 8?days (T?=?11, late effects) after the third infusion. Results? Fish oil infusion significantly increased n-3 PUFA proportions and decreased n-6 PUFA proportions in plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. There were no differences in immune functions or (anti)oxidant balance between treatments at any time. Conclusions? The present lipid infusion protocol appears to be safe and well tolerated and provides significant incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. In the absence of overt inflammation, no direct effects of FO were observed on immune function or (anti)oxidant balance. This model may be useful to evaluate effects of parenteral lipids in other settings, for example in individuals displaying an inflammatory state.

AB  - Summary Critically ill patients display a state of immunosuppression that has been attributed in part to decreased plasma arginine concentrations. However, we and other authors have failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit of L-arginine supplementation. We hypothesize that, in these critically ill patients, these low plasma arginine levels may be secondary to the presence of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSC), which express arginase known to convert arginine into nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. Indeed, in a series of 28 non-surgical critically ill patients, we showed a dramatic increase in gMDSC compared to healthy subjects (P?=?0·0002). A significant inverse correlation was observed between arginine levels and gMDSC (P?=?0·01). As expected, gMDSC expressed arginase preferentially in these patients. Patients with high gMDSC levels on admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) presented an increased risk of death at day 7 after admission (P?=?0·02). In contrast, neither plasma arginine levels, monocytic MDSC levels nor neutrophil levels were associated with overall survival at day 7. No relationship was found between body mass index (BMI) or simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score or gMDSC levels, eliminating a possible bias concerning the direct prognostic role of these cells. As gMDSC exert their immunosuppressive activity via multiple mechanisms [production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-10, arginase, etc.], it may be more relevant to target these cells, rather than simply supplementing with L-arginine to improve immunosuppression and its clinical consequences observed in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract There is strong evidence that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. This elevated risk is independent of classical risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and hypertension. The risk of coronary heart disease, put simply, is proportional to the severity of the depression. Also conclusively demonstrated is the adverse effect of depression in patients following myocardial infarction, which materially increases mortality. The mechanism of increased cardiac risk attributable to MDD is at present uncertain, but activation of the sympathetic nervous system, altered baroreflex sensitivity, and/or exaggerated platelet reactivity and endothelial dysfunction are likely to be of prime importance.

AB  - Summary: Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are critically involved in activation of the coagulation system in sepsis, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (APC) regulate the coagulation system by inhibiting thrombin generation. In addition to these anticoagulant effects, both AT and APC have been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses induced by various noxious stimuli in rats such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. AT promotes the endothelial release of prostacyclin, a potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that inhibits the monocytic production of TNF-α, by interacting with cell-surface heparin-like substances. APC directly inhibits the production of TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of both nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and activator protein-1 in monocytes stimulated with LPS. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial membranous integral protein that binds thrombin, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by generating APC. Furthermore, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, a natural anticoagulant for the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system, also attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in rats by inhibiting TNF-α production by monocytes. These findings strongly suggest that natural anticoagulants could regulate inflammatory responses as well as the coagulation system in rats by inhibiting the monocytic production of TNF-α. Such anti-inflammatory properties of natural anticoagulants are potentially important for their replacement in patients with sepsis who frequently develop DIC and organ failure as inflammatory responses.

AB  - Abstract This review considers the considerable similarities between periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While the etiology of these two diseases may differ, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are remarkably similar and it is possible that individuals manifesting both periodontitis and RA may suffer from a unifying underlying systemic dysregulation of the inflammatory response. In light of these findings, the implications for the use of disease-modifying medications in the management of these two chronic inflammatory conditions is apparent. Further longitudinal studies and medication-based intervention studies are required to determine just how closely these two conditions are allied.

AB  - Modern medical practices allow patients to survive acute insults and be sustained by machinery and medicines for extended periods of time. We define chronic critical illness as a later stage of prolonged critical illness that requires tracheotomy. These patients have persistent elevations of inflammatory cytokines, diminished hypothalamic?pituitary function, hypercatabolism, immobilization, and malnutrition. The measurement of bone turnover markers reveals markedly enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption that is uncoupled from osteoblastic bone formation. We review the mechanisms by which these factors contribute to the metabolic bone disease of chronic critical illness and suggest potential therapeutics.

AB  - Abstract Oxidative stress, resulting from accumulation of reactive oxygen species, plays a critical role in astroglial cell death occurring in diverse neuropathological conditions. Numerous studies indicate that neuroglobin (Ngb) promotes neuron survival, but nothing is known regarding the action of Ngb in astroglial cell survival. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential glioprotective effect of Ngb on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured mouse astrocytes. Incubation of cells with subnanomolar concentrations of Ngb (10?14?10?10 M) was found to prevent both H2O2-evoked reduction in surviving cells number and accumulation of reactive oxygen species in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ngb treatment abolishes H2O2-induced increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. Concomitantly, Ngb treatment rescues H2O2-associated reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutases and catalase) and prevents the stimulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and interleukin (IL) IL-6 and IL-33). Moreover, Ngb blocks the stimulation of Bax (pro-apoptotic) and the inhibition of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) gene expression induced by H2O2, which in turn abolishes caspase 3 activation. The protective effect of Ngb upon H2O2 induced activation of caspase 3 activity and cell death can be accounted for by activation of protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase transduction cascade. Finally, we demonstrate that Ngb increases Akt phosphorylation and prevents H2O2-provoked inhibition of ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that Ngb is a glioprotective agent that prevents H2O2-induced oxidative stress and apoptotic astroglial cell death. Protection of astrocytes from oxidative insult may thus contribute to the neuroprotective effect of Ngb.
