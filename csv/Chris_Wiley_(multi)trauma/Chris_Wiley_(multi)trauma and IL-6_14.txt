AB  - Abstract Background: Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is defined as the anemia occurring in chronic infections and inflammatory conditions, that is not due to marrow deficiencies or other diseases and in the presence of adequate iron stores and vitamins. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether periodontitis patients show signs of anemia. Method: 39 patients with severe periodontitis, 71 patients with moderate periodontitis and 42 controls, all with good general health, participated in this study. The mean age of all groups was 42 years. Several red blood cell parameters were determined from peripheral blood samples. Results: Overall data analysis indicated that periodontitis patients have a lower hematocrit, lower numbers of erythrocytes, lower hemoglobin levels and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates. These results were adjusted for the following possible confounders: gender, age, smoking, ethnicity and level of education. Further, more periodontitis patients (23%) than controls (7%), had hemoglobin levels below the normal reference range. Conclusions: The present study provides further evidence that periodontitis has systemic effects and that periodontitis may tend towards anemia. This phenomenon may be explained by a depressed erythropoiesis.

AB  - Abstract Acute cerebral lesions are associated with dysregulation of brain glucose homeostasis. Previous studies showed that knockdown of Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 impaired outcome after middle cerebral artery occlusion and that widely expressed intracellular RS1 (RSC1A1) is involved in transcriptional and post-translational down-regulation of SGLT1. In the present study, we investigated whether SGLT1 is up-regulated during traumatic brain injury (TBI) and whether removal of RS1 in mice (RS1-KO) influences SGLT1 expression and outcome. Unexpectedly, brain SGLT1 mRNA in RS1-KO was similar to wild-type whereas it was increased in small intestine and decreased in kidney. One day after TBI, SGLT1 mRNA in the ipsilateral cortex was increased 160% in wild-type and 40% in RS1-KO. After RS1 removal lesion volume 1 day after TBI was reduced by 12%, brain edema was reduced by 28%, and motoric disability determined by a beam walking test was improved. In contrast, RS1 removal did neither influence glucose and glycogen accumulation 1 day after TBI nor up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-6 or microglia activation 1 or 5 days after TBI. The data provide proof of principle that inhibition or down-regulation of SGLT1 by targeting RS1 in brain could be beneficial for early treatment of TBI.

AB  - Microglia are rapidly activated in the central nervous system (CNS) in response to a variety of injuries, including inflammation, trauma, and stroke. In addition to modulation of the innate immune response, a key function of microglia is the phagocytosis of dying cells and cellular debris, which can facilitate recovery. Despite emerging evidence that axonal debris can pose a barrier to regeneration of new axons in the CNS, little is known of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie clearance of degenerating CNS axons. We utilize a custom micropatterned microfluidic system that enables robust microglial-axon co-culture to explore the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in microglial phagocytosis of degenerating axons. We find that pharmacologic and genetic disruption of TLR4 blocks induction of the Type-1 interferon response and inhibits phagocytosis of axon debris in vitro. Moreover, TLR4-dependent microglial clearance of unmyelinated axon debris facilitates axon outgrowth. In vivo, microglial phagocytosis of CNS axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration in a dorsal root axotomy model is impaired in adult mice in which TLR4 has been deleted. Since purinergic receptors can influence TLR4-mediated signaling, we also explored a role for the microglia P2 receptors and found that the P2X7R contributes to microglial clearance of degenerating axons. Overall, we identify TLR4 as a key player in axonal debris clearance by microglia, thus creating a more permissive environment for axonal outgrowth. Our findings have significant implications for the development of protective and regenerative strategies for the many inflammatory, traumatic, and neurodegenerative conditions characterized by CNS axon degeneration.

AB  - Summary Background Understanding of the role of vitamin D in health and disease has increased markedly in the past decade, with its involvement extending well beyond traditional roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and musculoskeletal health. This conceptual expansion has been underpinned by identification and exploration of components of this axis including vitamin D-binding protein, key enzymes and receptors in multiple cell types, and a greater recognition of nonclassical autocrine and paracrine effects. Its influence in IBD remains uncertain. Aim To review the role of vitamin D in bone health, immune regulation and cancer prevention in IBD, and to outline practical issues and limitations of its use. Methods An extensive online literature review including PubMed and Medline. Results In patients with IBD, the vitamin D axis provides an important and often underutilised pathway to preserving bone health. Furthermore, an exciting body of clinical and basic science research demonstrates that these pathways may have an integral part to play in regulation of the immune response in IBD, through effects on the intestinal barrier, antigen presenting cells and adaptive T cells. The possibility of chemoprevention requires further study. The optimal target level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with IBD is currently uncertain, as is the best therapeutic modality. Conclusions Study of vitamin D pathways may result in the development of relatively inexpensive therapeutic options to optimise patient outcomes. Further prospective clinical research is required to address efficacy and long-term safety.

AB  - Abstract The deleterious impact of concomitant muscle injury on fracture healing and limb function is commonly considered part of the natural sequela of orthopedic trauma. Recent reports suggest that heightened inflammation in the surrounding traumatized musculature is a primary determinant of fracture healing. Relatedly, there are emerging potential therapeutic approaches for severe muscle trauma (e.g., volumetric muscle loss [VML] injury), such as autologous minced muscle grafts (1 mm3 pieces of muscle; GRAFT), that can partially prevent chronic functional deficits and appear to have an immunomodulatory effect within VML injured muscle. The primary goal of this study was to determine if repair of VML injury with GRAFT rescues impaired fracture healing and improves the strength of the traumatized muscle in a male Lewis rat model of tibia open fracture. The most salient findings of the study were: (1) tibialis anterior (TA) muscle repair with GRAFT improved endogenous healing of fractured tibia and improved the functional outcome of muscle regeneration; (2) GRAFT repair attenuated the monocyte/macrophage (CD45+CDllb+) and T lymphocyte (CD3+) response to VML injury; (3) TA muscle protein concentrations of MCP1, IL-10, and IGF-1 were augmented in a proregenerative manner by GRAFT repair; (4) VML injury concomitant with osteotomy induced a heightened systemic presence of alarmins (e.g., soluble RAGE) and leukocytes (e.g., monocytes), and depressed IGF-1 concentration, which GRAFT repair ameliorated. Collectively, these data indicate that repair of VML injury with a regenerative therapy can modulate the inflammatory and regenerative phenotype of the treated muscle and in association improve musculoskeletal healing.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the extent to which inflammatory markers explain the association between handgrip strength and mortality. Methods Analyses of data from The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Handgrip strength and inflammatory marker data (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) were collected at baseline (2004/5) and inflammatory marker data at follow-up (2012/13). Participant data were linked with death records. General linear models were used to explore associations between handgrip strength and inflammatory markers at follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine associations between grip strength and risk of death. Models were estimated with the covariates age, sex, wealth, physical activity, smoking, depressive symptoms, long-standing illness, and adiposity. Results The sample comprised of 5,240 participants (mean age 65.9 (SD 9.4) years; 53.8% female). Over an average 9.7 ± 1.4 years follow-up, there were 650 deaths. Inverse associations were evident between handgrip strength and change in inflammatory markers in women only. There was an association between grip strength and lower risk of mortality in women (hazard ratio = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74, 0.98) after adjusting for age and wealth. The association was attenuated after adjustment for clinical and behavioral risk factors (0.92; 0.79, 1.07), and further attenuated after adjusting for inflammatory markers (0.95; 0.82, 1.11). Conclusion Higher grip strength is associated with lower levels of inflammation at 8-year follow-up, and inflammatory markers partly explained the association between handgrip strength and mortality.

AB  - Summary Preclinical evidence supports targeting the C5a receptor (C5aR) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To support ongoing clinical development of an anti-C5aR monoclonal antibody, we have investigated for the first time the mechanism of action and the pharmacodynamics of a blocking anti-murine C5aR (anti-mC5aR) surrogate antibody in mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). First, efficacy was demonstrated in a multiple-dose treatment study. Almost complete inhibition of clinical disease progression was obtained, including reduced bone and cartilage destruction in anti-mC5aR-treated mice. Then, the mechanism of action was examined by looking for early effects of anti-mC5aR treatment in single-dose treatment studies. We found that 48?h after single-dose treatment with anti-mC5aR, the neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the paws was already reduced. In addition, several inflammatory markers, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17A were reduced locally in the paws, indicating reduction of local inflammation. Furthermore, dose-setting experiments supported a beneficial clinical effect of dosing above the C5aR saturation level. In conclusion, these preclinical data demonstrated rapid onset effects of antibody blockade of C5aR. The data have translational value in supporting the Novo Nordisk clinical trials of an anti-C5aR antibody in rheumatoid arthritis patients, by identifying potential biomarkers of treatment effects as well as by providing information on pharmacodynamics and novel insights into the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibody blockade of C5aR.

AB  - The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxfylline are associated with a number of clinical benefits. These include reduction in mortality in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants or suffer peritonitis. In infants with sepsis, a reduction in mortality has also been associated with pentoxyfylline administration. The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxyfylline, as well as its bronchodilator, diuretic and respiratory muscle stimulant effects suggest it may have a useful role in BPD. Interim analysis of a prophylactic trial suggests pentoxyfylline may reduce treatment requirements after the neonatal period and that, in established BPD, pentoxyfylline and dexamethasone may be of similar efficacy.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.

AB  - Summary The immune system is an intricate network of specialized tissues, which protect the host from insults and infection. It can be divided into two interactive systems, innate and adaptive immunity. Neuroinflammation occurs when there is chronic activation of the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS). Alterations in the permeability of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) may also occur during neuroinflammation due to changes in local vasculature, that is increased blood flow and vascular permeability. There are several anti-inflammatory systems that play a role in regulating microglia activation, which include CD200/CD200 receptor, vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Apoptosis is a highly orchestrated form of cell death when a number of caspases are activated in a sequential manner. The distinct morphological changes of the cell undergoing apoptosis are that the cell begins to shrink and pull away from other cells, and bubble-like formations appear at its surface.

AB  - Abstract Adenosine receptor subtypes, first described 40 years ago, are known to regulate diverse biological functions and have a role in various conditions, such as cerebral and cardiac ischemia, immune and inflammatory disorders and cancer. In the brain, they limit potentially dangerous over excitation, but also regulate mechanisms essential in sleep and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we discuss the role of adenosine receptors in mood and anxiety disorders. Activation of A2A receptors is associated with increased depression-like symptoms, while increased A1 receptors signaling elicits rapid antidepressant effects. Indeed, several lines of evidence demonstrate that the therapeutic effects of different non-pharmacological treatments of depression, like sleep deprivation and electroconvulsive therapy are mediated by A1 receptor up-regulation or activation. In addition, A1 receptors may also play a role in the antidepressant effects of transcranial direct current stimulation and deep brain stimulation. As a potential downstream mechanism, which facilitates the antidepressant effects of A1 receptors, we propose a crosstalk between adenosinergic and glutamatergic systems mediated via synaptic plasticity protein Homer1a and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors. Moreover, adenosine receptors are also involved in the control of circadian rhythms, sleep homeostasis and some neuro-immunological mechanisms, all of them implicated in mood regulation. Antagonists of adenosine receptors such as caffeine have general anxiogenic effects. In particular, A2A receptors appear to have an important role in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Taken together, the results discussed here indicate that the adenosinergic system is involved in both the etiology and the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) with multi-potential differentiational capacity can undergo odontoblastic differentiation when stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines. However, factors linking proinflammatory stimuli and their odontoblastic differentiation have, as yet, not been completely understood. As an apoptotic transcription factor, DDIT3 plays a crucial role in the inflammatory reaction and in osteogenic differentiation. Thus, we hypothesized that DDIT3 may participate in odontoblastic differentiation of HDPCs. Materials and methods Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect expression of DDIT3 in HDPCs and effects of TNFα, on its nuclear accumulation. HDPCs that overexpressed DDIT3 were developed and their proliferation and odontoblastic differentiation abilities were examined. qRT-PCR was employed to detect mineralization-related genes, including ALP, runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), osterix (OSX), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) and osteocalcin (OCN). Western blot analysis was performed to detect expression of DSPP protein. Results DDIT3 was expressed in HDPCs. TNFα treatment enhanced mRNA expression as well as nuclear accumulation of DDIT3 (slightly). DDIT3 overexpression reduced HDPC proliferation, however, it increased their calcium nodule formation and expression of OSX, DSPP, DMP1 and OCN. Conclusions DDIT3 may be a factor that links proinflammatory stimuli and differentiation of HDPCs.

AB  - Abstract Models of sepsis have been instructive in understanding the sequence of events in animals and, to an extent, in humans with sepsis. Events developing early in sepsis suggest that a hyperinflammatory state exists, accompanied by a buildup of oxidants in tissues reflective of a redox imbalance. Development of immunosuppression and degraded innate and adaptive immune responses are well-established complications of sepsis. In addition, there is robust activation of the complement system, which contributes to the harmful effects of sepsis. These events appear to be associated with development of multiorgan failure. The relevance of animal models of sepsis to human sepsis and the failure of human clinical trials are discussed, together with suggestions as to how clinical trial design might be improved.

AB  - Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by an inflammatory destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular interleukin-1 (IL-1), have been suggested to be effector molecules based on the observations that pro-inflammatory cytokines cause beta-cell apoptosis in vitro and aggravate diabetes in vivo, and that inhibition of the action of these cytokines reduce diabetes incidence in animal models of type 1 diabetes and islet graft destruction. This review presents the rationale for and design of a recently launched double-blind, multicenter, randomized clinical trial that investigates the effect of interleukin-1 antagonism on beta-cell function in subjects with T1D of recent-onset.

AB  - Abstract Loss of muscle mass and insulin sensitivity are common phenotypic traits of immobilisation and increased inflammatory burden. The suppression of muscle protein synthesis is the primary driver of muscle mass loss in human immobilisation, and includes blunting of post-prandial increases in muscle protein synthesis. However, the mechanistic drivers of this suppression are unresolved. Immobilisation also induces limb insulin resistance in humans, which appears to be attributable to the reduction in muscle contraction per se. Again mechanistic insight is missing such that we do not know how muscle senses its ?inactivity status? or whether the proposed drivers of muscle insulin resistance are simply arising as a consequence of immobilisation. A heightened inflammatory state is associated with major and rapid changes in muscle protein turnover and mass, and dampened insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and oxidation in both rodents and humans. A limited amount of research has attempted to elucidate molecular regulators of muscle mass loss and insulin resistance during increased inflammatory burden, but rarely concurrently. Nevertheless, there is evidence that Akt (protein kinase B) signalling and FOXO transcription factors form part of a common signalling pathway in this scenario, such that molecular cross-talk between atrophy and insulin signalling during heightened inflammation is believed to be possible. To conclude, whilst muscle mass loss and insulin resistance are common end-points of immobilisation and increased inflammatory burden, a lack of understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these traits exists such that a substantial gap in understanding of the pathophysiology in humans endures.

AB  - Abstract Oral mucositis (OM) as a complication of high-dose chemotherapy is frequently occurred in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) settings. Erythropoietin (EPO) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and wound-healing properties and therefore could have an important role in the prevention of OM. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the EPO mouthwash effect on OM incidence and severity in 80 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin disease (HD) or multiple myeloma, undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients received either EPO mouthwash (50?IU/ml, 15?ml four times a day) (n?=?40) or placebo (n?=?40) from the starting day of high-dose chemotherapy until day +14 after transplantation or until the day of discharge from the hospital, whichever occurred first. OM was evaluated daily for 21?days after transplantation or until resolution of OM according to World Health Organization oral toxicity scale. The incidence of OM (grades 1?4) in the EPO mouthwash group and control group was significantly different (27.5% vs 77.5%, p?<?0.001). The mean?±?SD of two other parameters of OM including maximum intensity OM score (0.60?±?1.06 vs 1.67?±?1.27) and average intensity OM score (0.47?±?0.80 vs 1.28?±?0.86) was significantly lower in the intervention group (p?<?0.001). Moreover, the mean?±?SD duration of OM was also significantly shorter among the EPO mouthwash recipients (1.92?±?3.42?days vs 5.42?±?3.86?days, P?<?0.001). Also, the duration of neutropenic fever was significantly shorter in the intervention group (2.12?±?2.42?days vs 3.95?±?4.01?days, p?=?0.016). It is concluded that EPO mouthwash can reduce the incidence and duration of OM. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
