AB  - The Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) has dialyzed >320 patients with ESRD since 1993. Objective:? To identify differences, and their causes, in the practice of dialysis between Nigerian state-owned dialysis units and U.S.A. Methods:? We analyzed the characteristics of chronic dialysis at JUTH. Results:? At JUTH, chronic dialysis is started at development of frank uremia (K/DOQI standard: creatinine clearance >10?mL/min, no overt uremia). Frequency of hemodialysis was 3 times weekly in 2 patients, twice weekly in 1 and once weekly or longer in 7 patients. Breakdowns in the dialysis machinery, which is outdated, forced additional decreases in the frequency of dialysis. Duration of a dialysis session was 4?h by prescription, but much longer in several sessions because of dialysis machine breakdown during the session (US standard: 4?h). 2 patients were dialyzed through arterio-venous fistulas and 8 patients were dialyzed though temporary femoral vein dialysis catheters removed after each dialysis session. A vascular surgeon was unavailable. The urea reduction ratio was 45.38.6% (U.S.A target: 65%). The cost of the first dialysis session at JUTH is $160. With reuse of dialysis supplies, including dialyzers, dialysis tubing, femoral catheters, and guide wires, the cost of each subsequent dialysis session is $33. The minimal cost of dialysis with 3 dialysis sessions weekly and a new dialyzer every week is $501 per month. The cost of dialysis is borne exclusively by the patient. For comparison, average monthly income is $74 for unskilled laborers, $222 for dialysis technicians, $296 for dialysis nurses, and $889 for academic nephrologists. The low dose of dialysis has adverse effects on patient quality of life (frequent admissions with uremia). Despite notable exceptions (2 patients on dialysis for 12 and 9 years, respectively), survival of dialysis patients at JUTH appears to be poor. Conclusions:? Underdialysis is frequent in Nigeria and is the consequence of socioeconomic conditions and technologic deficits. Removal of the economic burden of dialysis from the patients with ESRD is the first logical step toward correction of underdialysis.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7Â½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Severe lithium poisoning requires intensive and prolonged hemodialysis (HD) treatment in addition to supportive therapy. Aggressive dialytic therapy can bring about hypophosphatemia, especially, in those patients who are normo- or hypophosphatemic to begin with. We report here the use of phosphorus (P)-enriched HD in a hypophosphatemic patient with lithium poisoning. A 58-year-old woman with a long history of bipolar disorder treated with chronic lithium therapy presented with progressively worsening confusion and incoherent speech. She was noted to be confused with a labile mood. The serum levels were lithium 3.6?mM, creatinine 1.7?mg/dL, Na 136?mM, K 4.2?mM, CO2 21?mM, BUN 23?mg/dL, and P 2.1?mg/dL. After a conventional, 4-h HD session, she became more hypophosphatemic with a P level of 1.8?mg/dL. A P-enriched dialysate, prepared by adding a Fleet? oral saline laxative preparation (containing NaH2PO4.H2O and Na2HPO4.7H2O) to the ?base concentrate? of a dual concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate generating system to obtain a final dialysate containing 3?mg (0.97?mM) of P/dL was used. She underwent 3 subsequent HD sessions using this P-enriched dialysate, followed by normalization of the serum levels of both lithium and P. Our data suggest that hypophosphatemic patients suffering from severe lithium poisoning requiring intensive HD therapy and becoming more hypophosphatemic as a result of the dialysis treatment can be further dialyzed with a P-enriched dialysate both to treat the lithium poisoning and to rectify the hypophosphatemia. In general, the use of such dialysates can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of dialysis-induced hypophosphatemia.

AB  - Valproic acid toxicity is not infrequent and is difficult to treat, as there is no specific antidote. In the past, this drug was considered unremovable by extracorporeal methods because of the highly protein bound state (90?95%). However, recent reports suggest that the toxicokinetics of valproate vary considerably from the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels, and at higher concentrations protein-binding sites become saturated. The drug's relatively low molecular weight (144?Da), small volume of distribution (0.13?0.23?L/kg), and saturable protein binding render it potentially amenable to extracorporeal removal, but published experience is scant and there are only a few reported instances in which patients were successfully treated with extracorporeal methods. Here we report the case of a patient with serious valproate toxicity treated with simultaneous ?in series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. A 35-year-old homeless male presented to the emergency department after ingesting 120 pills of valproic acid. Initial valproic acid level was 59?Âµg/mL. Urine drug screen was negative and serum chemistries including LFTs were normal. He was treated with activated charcoal and admitted to the intensive care unit. 4 h later, he developed respiratory failure and became hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequently, the valproic acid level was found to be 553?Âµg/mL and a decision was made to employ extracorporeal methods for drug removal. ?In series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were done for 4?h and simultaneous blood samples for measurement of valproic acid levels were obtained as blood entered the hemoperfusion column (arterial) and as it exited the hemodialysis membrane (venous). Extraction ratio, whole blood, and plasma clearances were calculated and they compared substantially with the published data. The above measures decreased valproate levels from 572.6 (pre-dialysis level) to 203.2?Âµg/mL. This was followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for 18?h, which sustained the drug removal and prevented significant post-dialytic rebound. This is the first reported instance in which these three methods were administered together successfully in the management of valproic acid toxicity.

AB  - Plasma fibrinogen is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disturbances, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with elevated causes of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. That is the reason to look for the causes of increased CRP levels in CRF and haemodialysis (HD). The study tries to find whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consistent factor for CRP elevation in CRF and/or in HD patients, when a dialysis-induced IL-6 synthesis may occur, as IL-6 has been claimed as a responsible factor for production of some acute phase proteins like CRP. CRP [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, limit 0.1?Âµg/L], IL-6 (ELISA, Medgenix, Brussels, Belgium), and fibrinogen (photometric technique) were tested in 45 stable predialytic CRF patients (mean age 48?Â±?7 years) and in 50 stable HD patients (mean age 62?Â±?15). In CRF patients, a positive correlation was found between plasma fibrinogen (mean 356?Â±?167?mg/dL) and CRP (r?=?0.51, p?<?0.01) and between fibrinogen and proteinuria (r?=?0.32, p?<?0.01), but no correlation was found between CRP and IL-6. In HD patients, a high positive correlation was registered between CRP (mean 6.93?Â±?5.88?mg/L) and IL-6 (mean 9.4?Â±?10.6?pg/mL) (r?=?0.84, p?<?0.001) and between CRP and fibrinogen (mean 325?Â±?110?mg/dL) (r?=?0.59, p?<?0.001). The study suggests that, in HD patients, one of the factors stimulating hepatic production of CRP is probably IL-6, which is synthesized by the dialysis-related, activated macrophages. In predialytic patients, the bacterial products in dialysate and their effect on macrophages are absent and there is no correlation between CRP and IL-6.

AB  - The purpose of the poster was to demonstrate how Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing is utilized daily within the multicultural pediatric population at the hospital for sick children. Methods:? Within this diverse and challenging population, the hemodialysis nurse is constantly challenged to ensure that the nursing care provided to the patient is reflective and meeting the needs of our pediatric population and their families. Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing has provided an avenue to ensure that the many cultures of our clients are maintained and respected. A case study will be used to show the integration of Leininger's theory. Resources for supporting the cultural values of the hemodialysis patient will also be identified. Conclusion:? The use of a transcultural nursing model enhances the quality and effectiveness of the patient care provider for the pediatric hemodialysis patient at the hospital for sick children. Utilization of a transcultural nursing model ensures that the patients and their families are respected and supported for their diverse backgrounds by the hemodialysis nurse. The hemodialysis nurses are providing quality nursing care which reflects the needs and concerns of a multicultural population.

AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.

AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.

AB  - Abstract An acute administration of the hippocampal toxicant trimethyltin (TMT) produced a specific pattern of neuronal necrosis in dentate granule cells with accompanying astrogliosis and initiation of a cytokine response within 24 hours. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DEX), on the pattern of cytokine expression and neuronal degeneration occurring after an acute TMT injection. Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered to 21-day-old male mice 1 hour prior to an injection of TMT hydroxide (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice receiving 0.2 mg/kg DEX received a second injection 6 hours after TMT. Twenty-four hours later, neuronal necrosis and astrogliosis were assessed and found to be similar in animals treated with TMT, either in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Pretreatment with dexamethasone failed to prevent the neurodegeneration and astrogliosis. The TMT-induced injury response was represented in elevations of mRNA levels for the injury-associated host response genes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), EB22/5.3, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The combination of DEX and TMT produced increased elevation in mRNA levels for EB22/5.3 and ICAM, while GFAP levels remained the same as with TMT alone. The injury response from TMT was accompanied by elevations in mRNA levels for the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Î±, TNF?, and interleukin (IL)-1Î±. Treatment with dexamethasone prior to TMT resulted in significantly elevated levels of TNFÎ±, TNF?, and IL-1Î± as compared to TMT alone. These data represent the inability of glucocorticoids to downregulate the injury response in rat hippocampus following a systemic injection of TMT and suggest a stimulation and ?priming? of hippocampal cells by dexamethasone.

AB  - Background/Aims:? Procalcitonin (PCT) has been described as a new marker of severe infection and sepsis. In this study, we investigated the serum levels of PCT during the hemodialysis (HD) in chronically hemodialyzed patients and whether the PCT levels were correlated with other cytokines. Methods:? We measured pre- and post-HD PCT, interleukin (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) concentrations in 24 stable patients undergoing chronic HD [11 males and 13 females; age 41.2?Â±?18.0 years, 12?h/week, with a Kt/V of 1.41?Â±?0.35, polysynthane (PSN) membrane being used in all patients, without reuse]. Pre- and post-HD PCT concentrations were compared with cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-Î±, and clinical parameters including age, blood pressure, leukocyte, hemoglobin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), epoetin (EPO) doses, BUN, creatinine, parathormone (PTH), ferritin, and transferrin levels. Results:? Pre- and post-HD serum PCT levels were similar (0.77?Â±?0.40 and 0.83?Â±?0.61 ng/mL), and higher than upper normal level of 0.5?ng/mL. The levels of IL-2 and IL-10 decreased and the levels of IL-1 and TNF-Î± increased. Post-HD PCT correlated with PTH, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-10. Conclusion:? About 60% of patients had elevated PCT levels, HD with low-flux PSN membrane did not change serum PCT and IL-6. While IL-1 and TNF-Î± increased, IL-2 and IL-10 decreased by PSN membrane during HD. So that PCT levels can be measured just after HD as do prior to start of HD. Is there any relationship between PCT and PTH? PCT may be important in uremic bone disease.

AB  - Frequent or occasional symptomatic intradialytic hypotension during hemodialysis may influence patients' well being, but its effects on survival, independent of comorbidities, have not previously been investigated. Objective:? To assess the effect of frequent (f-IDH) or occasional (o-IDH) dialysis-associated hypotension on survival. Methods:? During the run in period in 1998, 77 patients with f-IDH (â¥10 hypotensive events/10 months, responding only to medical intervention) and 101 patients with o-IDH (1 or 2 events/10 months) were identified among all 958 prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients of a network. Eighty-five patients who had no hypotensive episodes (no-IDH) served as controls. Patients were followed for a median of 27 months (range 0.3?37), and survival of patients was compared by log-rank test. Independent association of f-IDH and o-IDH on survival, compared to no-IDH, was assessed by proportional hazards model that included patient's demographics, laboratory data, comorbidity as well as medications. Results:? Forty-five patients (58%) with f-IDH, 47 (47%) with o-IDH, and 33 (39%) with no-IDH died during the follow up that represents mortality rates of 37 (p?=?0.013 vs. no-IDH), 26 (p =?0.375 vs. no-IDH), and 21 deaths/100?patient years in the three groups, respectively. In multivariate proportional hazards regression, where age, sex, time on dialysis, CHD, diabetes, Kt/V, albumin level, use of beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates have been adjusted for, neither f-IDH nor o-IDH was associated with survival. Conclusion:? Mortality in patients with f-IDH is significantly higher than in those without such events. Our data, however, did not provide evidence that f-IDH, independent of age and comorbidities, contributes to mortality in these patients.

AB  - Central venous catheters (CVC) remain a frequently used form of vascular access in children receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD). Whereas standard dual-lumen catheters (DL) are used in many centers, the Tesio catheter has proven to be superior to the DL catheter in terms of catheter survival and infection rates in at least one pediatric study (Sheth RD etÂ al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2001). Recently, the Ash Split catheter became available which, while similar to the Tesio internally, being comprised of 2 separate catheters, may be preferable because of the requirement for only one skin puncture for placement vs. two for the Tesio. However, no pediatric data pertaining to the Ash Split catheter have been published to date. Therefore, we reviewed and compared our experience with a small number of Ash Split (# 16) and Tesio (# 8) catheters used for semipermanent vascular access in our chronic HD population with reference to survival, infectious complications, patency, and dialysis adequacy. The results of this experience are as follows: Tesio Ash Split Survival >3 months 6/8 12/15 Sepsis (epi/catheter mo) 1/30 1/25 Exit-site infection (epi/catheter mo) 1/8.6 1/19 sp Kt/V urea 1.67 1.88 % sp Kt/V urea >1.2 100 90 Reasons for the removal of Tesio catheters were transplant (4), sepsis (1), deterioration of tubing (1), and accidental (1). Ash Split catheter removal resulted from sepsis (2), fistula placement (4), thrombosis (1), and accidental (2). This preliminary experience reveals similar outcome data for the Tesio and Ash Split catheters when used in pediatric HD patients. Definitive statements regarding the superiority of either catheter awaits additional data collection and analysis.

AB  - Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. started its nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) program in September 1997. Purpose of study:? To evaluate episodes of exit site infections, catheter sepsis, safety, and longevity of accesses for patients doing NHHD. Methods:? If IJ catheter was chosen, patient was started on Coumadin 2?mg/day when catheter was placed. If catheter malfunctioned, it was locked with a thrombolytic agent and Coumadin was adjusted to meet a goal INR of 1.5?2.25. If the problem persisted, the catheter was exchanged. For catheters, the B-D InterLink device was used to prevent air emboli and infection, and a locking device was used to prevent disconnects. If AV fistula was used, 4 buttonholes were established using 16 gauge needles. If AV graft was used, patients were taught the ladder cannulation technique using 16 gauge needles. Results:? As of September 1, 2003, 45 patients have completed training and have performed 27,063 treatments at home. Total catheter time at home was 930 months. Total AV fistula and AV graft time at home was 190 and 20 months, respectively. Upon completion of training, 34 patients were using tunneled IJ catheters, 10 using AV fistulas, and 1 using an AV graft. The IJ catheter exit site and sepsis infection rate was 0.35 and 0.49 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Average catheter life was 8.5 months with the longest 66.7 months and the shortest 0.2 months. The AV fistula and graft exit site and sepsis infection rates were 0.16 and 0 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Catheter complications included 1 episode of disconnect due to patient's failure to use locking device, 1 episode of central stenosis, and 1 episode of intracranial hemorrhage, due to prolonged INR, with resolution of symptoms. Conclusion:? Data support that tunneled IJ catheters, AV fistulas, and AV grafts were effective and safe permanent accesses for patients on NHHD.

AB  - Poorly functioning dialysis access, whether graft or AV fistula, is a contributor to decreased efficiency of dialysis. Thrombosis results in the need for surgery and increases patient suffering. Objectives:? To determine whether an advanced glycation end product (AGE), pentosidine, might serve as a marker of disease activity and thrombosis of dialysis access. These results were obtained during the blinded phase of a study to evaluate the efficacy of the antioxidant vitamin E in preventing vascular access thrombotic events. Methods:? Twenty-six patients had blood drawn and access flow evaluated initially and at intervals for up to 1.5 years. In the study design, participants received either 800?IU vitamin E daily by mouth or identical placebo capsules. Blood plasma was examined to determine pentosidine content at baseline and every 3?m. Patients with an access flow of <800?mL/min were referred to a surgeon for evaluation. Access flow was evaluated by using the transonic flow meter and the saline release method. When sequential double dialyzers were used, saline injection method was applied post dialyzers, but before the venous drip chamber. Results:? Mean initial level of pentosidine before the administration of vitamin E was 20.22?pmol/mg (range 5.04?59.62?pmol/mg). During the study period, 5 patients had procedures related to thrombosis performed on their accesses. Blood drawn before the thrombotic event showed an increase above baseline of 6.87?Â±?15.47 (range ?5.9 to +33.7?pmol/mg). Patients without events showed a mean decrease of 9.7?Â± 12.24?pmol/mg pentosidine (p?<?0.02). Conclusion:? An increase in levels of pentosidine was associated with clotting of hemodialysis access. This change may reflect the effects of oxidative stress and/or thrombus formation. As these data are gathered from an ongoing double-blinded study, the effect of vitamin E on thrombus formation and pentosidine levels has not yet been ascertained.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical dÃ©bridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - It has been shown that daily hemodialysis as well as convective transfer by hemofilitration improve the quality of extra renal treatment. Two following phases of treatment of three weeks each were tested in 2 patients: daily hemodialysis 2.5?h 6 times/week (HD*6) and daily hemofiltration 2.75?h 6 times/week (HF*6) performed according to the following modalities. Phase I, blood flow rates (QB): 300?mL/min, hemofilter 1.4 m2AN 69 dialysate flow 500?mL/min. Phase II, QB: 150?mL/min, hemofilter 1m2AN 69, exchange volume of 10?L/session; 5?L predilution and 5?L postdilution (conditions were limited by the device). We measured, during the third week of treatment of each phase, the weekly mass transfers and the predialysis plasma levels of urea (U), creatinine (C), phosphate (P), and B2 microglobulin (B2M). In the 2 phases, HD*6 and HF*6, respectively, the weekly urea Kt was: 120 vs. 60?L; std Kt/V: 3.30 vs. 2.0; npcr: 1.26 vs. 1.42?g?kg?1?day?1. Mass transfer/week Predialytic levels/L HD*6 HF*6 HD*6 HF*6 U (mmol) ?2366 ?2204 ?23.2 ?38.5 C (Âµmol) 67240 51096 769.5 934.8 P (mmol) ??127 ??111.5 ??1.91 ??2.34 B2M (mg) ??311 ??763.5 ?34.2 ?30.16 In HF*6, predialysis solute concentration increased and weekly small molecule mass transfer was insufficient. B2M mass transfer was significantly increased and predialytic plasma concentration decreased, showing a higher clearance of middle molecules with convective transfer. The clinical tolerance was excellent during the two phases of treatment. This study allows to determine the optimal conditions for adequate daily HF: higher QB and exchange volume. Further studies with QB of at least 300?mL/min and with exchange volume of 15?L/session seem to be necessary.

AB  - More frequent dialysis is thought to be associated with increased heparin requirements; however, limited data are available which compare heparin requirements of conventional to daily dialysis. Objectives:? To determine differences in heparin dose during conventional thrice-weekly dialysis (CHD) compared to daily hemodialysis (DHD). Methods:? All patients within the daily home hemodialysis at the Northwest Kidney Centers were evaluated for heparin dose both pre- and post initiation of daily hemodialysis. Patients on DHD received an initial bolus of heparin, without a continuous heparin drip, and supplemental heparin midway through the dialysis run as needed to maintain adequate activated clotting times (ACTs). CHD patients received a heparin bolus, followed by initiation of heparin drip as needed to maintain adequate ACTs. Results:? Of the 1117 patients who dialyze at the NKC, 55% were Caucasian, 21% African-American, 20% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 35% were of other ethnicity. The majority of patients were greater than 60 years (56%), while 36% ranged from 40?60 years and 13% ranged from 20?40 years. Male patients constituted 54% of patients. Diabetes was the primary cause of renal disease (36%), followed by hypertension (21%) and glomerular disease (18%). Of those patients in the home hemodialysis program (n?=?45), 10 patients started daily home hemodialysis using the Aksys daily home hemodialysis system. Of those, the majority was male (100%), Caucasian (78.8%) with an average age of 46.7?Â±?18 years. Glomerulonephritis was the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (40%), while the percentages of other diseases were similar [Alport's syndrome (20%), hypertension (20%) and diabetes (10%)]. Compared to initial DHD heparin requirements (10,111?Â±?2219 units), CHD heparin dose requirements (6833?Â±?2715 units) were significantly lower (p?=?0.045); however, total heparin needs were similar between groups (10,166?Â±?4380 units vs. 10,778?Â±?2959 units) (p?=?0.324). Conclusion:? Although patients initiating DHD have greater initial heparin requirements than when on CHD, total heparin doses remain similar to those required on conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Greater initial heparin doses required during short daily dialysis appear safe compared to those of conventional dialysis.

AB  - Cardiovascular complications affect diabetic subjects early and the more susceptible ones are those on hemodialysis. Objective:? This study was designed to observe prevalent cardiac involvement in both pre- and already on dialysis diabetics. Method:? Sixty diabetics, 30 predialysis (predialysis diabetics, group 1), and 30 on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD, group 2) were randomly selected and their different clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters were compared. Result:? Both groups of patients were matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Features like systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in predialysis diabetics group than in MHD group [138?Â±?19 vs. 152?Â±?32, p?<?0.02 and 74?Â±?10 vs. 87?Â±?10?mmHg (p?<?0.001)]; hemoglobin higher [10.3?Â±?2.1 vs. 7.5?Â±?1.5 g/dL (p?<?0.001)]; serum creatinine was lower [3.49?Â±?1.8 vs. 9.5?Â±?2.5 mg/dL (p?<?0.001)] (due to recruitment criteria); left ventricular muscle mass index (LVMI) also lower [137?Â±?96 vs. 211?Â±?77?g/m2 (p?<?0.001)]; left ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) less [58?Â±?21 vs. 85?Â±?25 mL/m2 (p?<?0.001) and fractional shortening (FS, %) higher [33?Â±?4.3 vs. 28?Â±?5.8 (p?<?0.006)]. Only 11% of Pre subjects had LV hypertrophy (LVMI >131?g/m2 in male and in female LVMI >110?g/m2) whereas it was 51% in MHD (p?<?0.001). Systolic dysfunction (FS?=?<25%) was 4% in Pre subjects and 24% in MHD (p?<?0.03) group. Correlation study showed systolic and diastolic blood pressure; both had positive correlation with LVMI (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.008 and r?=?0.32, p?<?0.02) and LVEDVI (r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and r?=?0.35, p?<?0.01) and also similarly positive with serum creatinine (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.02 and r?=?0.5, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? It may be concluded that cardiac parameters are grossly altered in majority of diabetics on dialysis and higher serum creatinine and uncontrolled blood pressure may be responsible for this.

AB  - Bacteremia (B) is a well-known complication of an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). Although prophylactic measures such as topical and catheter lock antibiotics have been demonstrated to decrease the risk of B in hemodialysis (HD) in patients with a CVC, there are concerns about the development of resistance to these agents when used for long periods of time. Objective:? We wondered if we could limit the use of these agents by identifying the period when B was most common after CVC placement. Method: We prospectively noted all patients with a CVC who developed B in any of our 3 units in CT, U.S.A.; 62 episodes of B occurred between 1/1/03 and 9/18/03. 35% of all of the HD patients had a CVC for access during the study period. Results: Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 22 (35.5%) episodes; Gram-negative organisms for 21 (33.8%) and other staphylococcal species for 14 (22.6%). The other 3 episodes were other Gram-positive organisms and 6 patients developed B with more than 1 organism. 3 (4.8%) patients expired while being treated for the B. The average time to onset of B was 96?Â±?98 CVC days with a range of 1?365 days. There was no difference in time to onset based on organism. 43.5% of the episodes of B occurred less than 60 days after the CVC was inserted, but 27.4% occurred greater than 100 days after CVC insertion. Conclusion:? The time to onset of CVC-related B was variable among the patients developing B in this study. Preventative strategies aimed at reducing the risk of B in patients with a CVC must be used for the life of the CVC.
