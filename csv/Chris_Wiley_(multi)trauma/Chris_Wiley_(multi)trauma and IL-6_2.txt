AB  - Abstract Cytokines play a crucial role in tumor initiation and progression. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-6 is a key factor by driving tumor progression from benign to malignant, invasive tumors in the HaCaT-model of human skin carcinoma. IL-6 activates STAT3 and directly stimulates proliferation and migration of the benign noninvasive HaCaT-ras A-5 cells in vitro. Furthermore, IL-6 induces a complex, reciprocally regulated cytokine network in the tumor cells that includes inflammatory and angiogenic factors such as IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF and MCP-1. These IL-6 effects lead to tumor cell invasion in organotypic cultures in vitro and to the formation of malignant and invasive s.c. tumors in vivo. Tumor invasion is supported by the IL-6 induced overexpression of MMP-1 in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate a key function of IL-6 in the progression of skin SCCs by regulating a complex cytokine and protease network and suggest new therapeutic approaches to target this central player in skin carcinogenesis.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine now widely recognized to contribute to the molecular events that follow CNS injury. Little is known, however, about its action on axonal sprouting and regeneration in the brain. We addressed this issue using the model of transection of Schaffer collaterals in mice organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Transection of slice cultures was associated with a marked release of IL-6 that could be neutralized by an IL-6 blocking antibody. We monitored functional recovery across the lesion by recording synaptic responses using a multi-electrode array. We found that application of IL-6 antibodies to the cultures after lesioning significantly reduced functional recovery across the lesion. Furthermore, the level of expression of the 43-kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43) was lower in slices treated with the IL-6 neutralizing antibody than in those treated with a control IgG. Conversely, addition of exogenous IL-6 to the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of functional recovery across the lesion and a higher level of expression of GAP-43. Co-culture of CA3 hemi-slices from thy1-YFP mice with CA1 hemi-slices from wild-type animals confirmed that IL-6-treated co-cultures exhibited an increased number of growing fluorescent fibres across the lesion site. Taken together these data indicate that IL-6 plays an important role in CNS repair mechanisms by promoting regrowth and axon regeneration.

AB  - ABSTRACT There is growing evidence in support of the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Harpagoside, one of the bioactive components of Harpagophytum procumbens (Hp), has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Here we used an in vitro model of inflammation in OA to investigate the potential of harpagoside to suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6 and matrix degrading proteases. We further investigated the likely targets of harpagoside in primary human OA chondrocytes. OA chondrocytes were pre-treated with harpagoside before stimulation with IL-1?. mRNA expression profile of 92 cytokines/chemokines was determined using TaqMan Human Chemokine PCR Array. Expression levels of selected mRNAs were confirmed using TaqMan assays. Protein levels of IL-6 and MMP-13 were assayed by ELISA and immunoblotting. Total protein levels and phosphorylation of signaling proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Cellular localization of IL-6 and c-Fos was performed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. DNA binding activity of c-FOS/AP-1 was determined by ELISA. Harpagoside significantly altered the global chemokine expression profile in IL-1?-stimulated OA chondrocytes. Expression of IL-6 was highly induced by IL-1?, which was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment of OA chondrocytes with harpagoside. Harpagoside did not inhibit the IL-1?-induced activation of NF-?B and C/EBP? transcription factors but suppressed the IL-1?-triggered induction, phosphorylation, and DNA binding activity of c-FOS, one of the main components of AP-1 transcription factors. Further, harpagoside significantly inhibited the expression of MMP-13 in OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. siRNA-mediated knockdown of IL-6 resulted in suppressed expression and secretion of MMP-13 directly linking the role of IL-6 with MMP-13 expression. Taken together, the present study suggests that harpagoside exerts a significant anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the inflammatory stimuli mediated by suppressing c-FOS/AP-1 activity in OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background Studies in different animal models and plasma analyses in humans suggest that members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family may be involved in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF). Accordingly, we have examined IL-6-related cytokines in chronic CHF in humans by analysing gene and protein expression in myocardium derived from patients with end-stage heart failure and donor hearts. Methods Gene expression of cytokines/receptors of the IL-6 family was documented in myocardial samples using cDNA array hybridization and RNase protection assays. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-6 and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) in myocardial tissues. Results Myocardial gene activity was documented for the majority of IL-6 family cytokines and their receptors. Immunohistochemical analysis localized IL-6, LIF and their common receptor subunit gp130 to myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. LIF mRNA levels were enhanced in the left ventricles of CHF patients relative to the left ventricles of donor hearts (patients 4·6?±?4·7 vs. donors 0·3?±?0·3, P?<?0·005). Myocardial IL-6 and gp130 mRNA levels were not statistically different between patients and donors, but in contrast to LIF mRNA expression in heart explants, gp130 mRNA levels were significantly higher in left atrium compared with left ventricle in both patients and donors. Conclusions Both mRNA and proteins of gp130 and its ligands IL-6 and LIF are expressed in both nonfailing and failing human myocardium. The elevated LIF mRNA levels in left ventricles from patients with end-stage heart failure suggest a role for LIF in the pathogenesis of CHF.

AB  - It has been recognized for some time that cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are, to a major extent, inflammatory disorders associated with an environment characterized by a sedentary lifestyle together with abundant intakes of calories. Systemic low-level inflammation is suggested to be a cause as well as consequence of pathological processes with local tumor necrosis factor α production as an important biological driver. It is hypothesized that physical inactivity contributes to an enhanced proinflammatory burden independently of obesity, as regular muscle contractions mediate signals with myokines/cytokines as important messengers, which suppress proinflammatory activity at distant sites as well as within skeletal muscle. Muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to possess a central role in anti-inflammatory activities and health beneficial effects in relation to physical exercise. It is discussed how this fits the consistent observation that enhanced plasma levels of IL-6 represent a strong risk marker in chronic disorders associated with systemic low-level inflammation and all-cause mortality.

AB  - Summary Stress known to stimulate sympathetic activity, as well as the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal axis (HPA), produces a significant increase in adrenomedullin (AdM) levels, suggesting a regulatory or protective role for AdM in countering HPA activation that follows a variety of stressors. Stressors can modulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a potent activator of the HPA and appears to play a pathogenic role in conditions related to stress. In the present study, we investigated the administration of AdM on IL-6 levels in cold exposed rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups as control, adrenomedullin treatment, cold stress and cold stress+adrenomedullin-treated groups. In the adrenomedullin-treated group, animals received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of adrenomedullin (2000?ng/kg body weight) once a day for a week. For the cold stress exposure the rats were kept in separate cages at 10°C for a week. Control group rats were kept in laboratory conditions. The concentration of IL-6 was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. When compared to control, IL-6 levels increased significantly in the cold stress- and adrenomedullin-treated groups (P?<?0·05). Administration of AdM in addition to cold stress decreased IL-6 levels in lung and liver, but increased in brain and heart when compared to control (P?<?0·05). The results suggest that cold stress may induce increase of rat proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and adrenomedullin may play a regulatory or protective role for cold stress.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to investigate the initiation and course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early inflammatory response and to elucidate the cytokine system in relation to the adrenal response caused by stress. Seven blood samples were collected, pre- and postoperatively (0?72?h) after total hip replacement (THR) due to osteoarthritis. The following cytokines were measured using Cytometric Bead Array: interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 (B Wilcoxon test P?<?0.01) Repeated measurements were also significant (Friedman P?<?0.05). The concentration of IL-8 doubled the day of surgery but did not reach a significant level (Friedman test =0.069). None of the other cytokines showed any significant changes. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was interrupted after the surgery and there was a significant correlation between the cortisol secretion and IL-6 response. This study demonstrates an isolated elevation in IL-6 levels with only a minor elevation in IL-8 following THR. This pro-inflammatory response seemed to decline without activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), but cortisol seemed to play a complicated role in halting the acute inflammatory response.

AB  - ABSTRACT Interleukin (IL)-6 production in contracting skeletal muscle and IL-6 concentration in plasma are increased after prolonged and strenuous exercise. However, as tissue stress or damage are unspecific triggers of increased cytokine levels, we examined whether moderate muscle activity is an independent stimulus for cytokine expression, and to which extent invasive procedures might affectthe results. Soleus muscles were isolated from sedentary rats or from rats that had been running on a treadmill at moderate intensity (70% of maximal oxygen uptake) for 1?h. In another group the soleus muscle was prepared in situ and stimulated intermittently at 5?Hz for 1?h, so that maximal developed force declined by 30%. In situ prepared soleus muscles not subjected to electrical stimulation were used as controls. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 11 cytokines was analysed in the soleus muscles using multiprobe RNAse protection assay, and IL-6 plasma concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treadmill exercise did not affect the mRNA expression of any of the measured cytokines in the soleus muscle. Irrespective of electrical stimulation, mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-1? were significantly increased in the surgically manipulated soleus muscles. Interleukin-6 plasma concentration was not affected by treadmill running or electrical stimulation. Conclusion, gentle surgical manipulation is a strong stimulus for IL-6 and IL-1? mRNA synthesis in skeletal muscle, whereas exercise or electrical muscle stimulation at moderate intensity does not independently affect cytokine mRNA levels in the contracting soleus.

The aim of this study was to investigate the intrathecal levels of cytokines in patients with acute small infarcts. Methods:? Forty patients with acute minor stroke and 32 non-stroke patients (including 29 age- and gender-matched subjects) who received operations with spinal anesthesia were studied prospectively and underwent measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-1? and IL-6 levels. Results:? After an age- and gender-matched analysis of 58 patients (29 pairs), the mean intrathecal levels of IL-1? were 0.80?pg/ml in patients with small infarcts and 0.59?pg/ml in non-stroke patients (P?<?0.0001). In addition, the mean CSF levels of IL-6 were 21.54?pg/ml and 7.52?pg/ml in the stroke and control groups, respectively (P?=?0.38). These results were consistent with the data without matching. The CSF levels of IL-1? in the 40 stroke patients were significantly higher than in the 32 non-stroke controls (P?<?0.0001). Conclusions:? The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1?, but not IL-6, remained elevated in the CSF of patients in the acute stage of small infarcts.

AB  - Summary Mice injected with endotoxin develop endotoxaemia and endotoxin-induced death, accompanied by the oxidative burst and overproduction of inflammatory mediators. Lactoferrin, an iron binding protein, provides a natural feedback mechanism to control the development of such metabolic imbalance and protects against deleterious effects of endotoxin. We investigated the effects of intraperitoneal administration of human lactoferrin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and nitric oxide (NO) in vivo. Lactoferrin was administered as a prophylactic, concurrent or therapeutic event relative to endotoxic shock by intravenous injection of LPS. Inflammatory mediators were measured in serum at 2, 6 and 18 h post-shock induction. Administration of lactoferrin 1 h before LPS resulted in a rather uniform inhibition of all mediators; TNF by 82%, IL-6 by 43%, IL-10 by 47% at 2 h following LPS injection,and reduction in NO (80%) at 6 h post-shock. Prophylactic administration of lactoferrin at 18 h prior to LPS injection resulted in similar decreases in TNF-α (95%) and in NO (62%), but no statistical reduction in IL-6 or IL-10. Similarly, when lactoferrin was administered as a therapeutic post-induction of endotoxic shock, significant reductions were apparent in TNF-α and NO in serum, but no significant effect was seen on IL-6 and IL-10. These results suggest that the mechanism of action for lactoferrin contains a component for differential regulation of cellular immune responses during in vivo models of sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Background Early life stress (ELS) has been linked to health disparities across the human lifespan, particularly increased risk for depression and its recurrence. In this study we explore two plausible and competing pathways through which ELS may lead to depression via inflammation. Methods Participants (ages 18?22; n = 41) completed the Early Trauma Inventory as a measure of ELS. Participants then completed consecutive daily diaries of mood and other sickness behavior for the 7 days prior to and 7 days after receiving the annual influenza vaccine. Circulating concentrations of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured immediately before and 24 hr after vaccination. Results ELS was not associated with the magnitude of change in IL-6 from pre- to post-vaccine, however, exposure to ELS moderated the association between change in IL-6 from pre- to post-vaccine and changes in both cognitive difficulty and depressed mood. Individuals exposed to greater ELS showed greater psychological sensitivity to increases in IL-6. Conclusions Exposure to ELS may increase sensitivity to peripheral inflammation in the central nervous system. Future studies elaborating on the impact of ELS on the sensitivity of specific neural circuits and cells to inflammation are needed.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate whether major abdominal surgery leads to complement activation and interleukin response and whether the kind of anaesthesia influence complement activation and the release of inflammatory interleukins. The study design was prospective and randomised. Fifty patients undergoing open major colorectal surgery due to cancer disease or inflammatory bowel disease were studied. Twenty-five patients were given total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil, and 25 patients were given inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl. To determine complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9) and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins (tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-8, IL-4 and IL-10), blood samples were drawn preoperatively, 60 minutes after start of surgery, 30 minutes after end of surgery and 24 hours postoperatively. Complement was activated and pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-10) were released during major colorectal surgery. There was no significant difference between TIVA and inhalational anaesthesia regarding complement activation and cytokine release. Major colorectal surgery leads to activation of the complement cascade and the release of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There are no significant differences between total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil and inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl regarding complement activation and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins.

AB  - Background: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) evokes a systemic inflammatory response involving the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin (iL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Like IL-10, opioids downregulate the immune responses in vivo and in vitro, including the activity of the cytokine-producing monocytes and granulocytes. The proinflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of the hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate if choice of anaesthesia, based on high-dose opioids (fentanyl) versus low-dose opioids influenced the release of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Secondly, it was investigated whether serum amyloid P-component (SAP) is an acute-phase protein in man such as C-reactive protein (CRP), with which it is physically and structurally related. Methods: Sixteen patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomized to either low-dose opioid anaesthesia consisting of thoracic epidural analgesia combined with inhalational anaesthesia (group I) or high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (group II). From each patient 18 blood samples were taken perioperatively. Cytokine analyses were performed with ELISA, CRP and SAP mere measured with rocket immunoelectrophoresis (REI). Results: Surgery and CPB elicited a marked, transient and almost simultaneous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response with no differences between the groups. The cytokine levels returned to preoperative levels 1?3 d after operation. Anaesthesia and surgery did not affect SAP plasma levels while patients showed a major increase in CRP concentrations preceding the cytokine responses. Conclusion: CABG performed during two different anaesthetic techniques, high-dose fentanyl versus low-dose opioid anaesthesia, elicited a well-defined cytokine response with minor variation in the time course of each cytokine. The cytokine production was not modified by type of anaesthesia. Finally, SAP is not an acute-phase protein in men.

AB  - Summary While T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis for more than three decades, the focus on the T helper type 17 (Th17) subset of CD4 T cells and their secreted cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, is much more recent. Proinflammatory actions of IL-17 were first identified in the 1990s, but the delineation of a distinct Th17 subset in late 2005 has sparked great interest in the role of these cells in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. This review summarizes current understanding of the role of Th17 cells and their products in both animal models of inflammatory arthritis and human immune-driven arthritides.

AB  - Summary Meningococcal disease is a leading infectious cause of death in children in industrialized countries. The induction of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis-related multi-organ failure. Here, we demonstrate that N. meningitidis serotypes A and B induce significantly higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α positive cells in vitro in infants and young children compared with adults (serotype A/B; infants: 64·9%/63·9%; children: 77·8%/64·3% versus adults: 27·7%/32%; P?<?0·005). Serotype A induces also higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6 positive cells in neonates and infants compared with adults (serotype A; newborn 55·4%; infants 58·8% versus adults 49%; P?<?0·05). Treatment with human recombinant erythropoietin in vitro resulted in significant attenuation of the N. meningitidis-induced proinflammatory response in all age groups (reduction rate of erythropoietin for IL-6 after stimulation with serotype B: newborn 28%, infants 15%, children 23% and adults 28% and for TNF-α after stimulation with serotype B: newborn 27%, infants 22%, children 20% and adults 28%; P?<?0·05). We conclude that (i) Neisseria meningitidis induces a higher TNF-α response in infants and children compared with adults and (ii) erythropoietin was able to attenuate IL-6 and TNF-α production in all investigated age groups. These data may explain the high incidence of meningococcal infection in infants and makes erythropoietin a potentially attractive candidate for interventional strategies in an otherwise devastating course of the disease.

AB  - Abstract Severe traumatic injuries and infections are frequently accompanied by life-threatening shock and are associated with increases in the proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The body's first perception of injury is the nociceptive or pain response. This response is induced at the site of injury and is transmitted systemically by sensory neuropeptides, the tachykinins, released from sensory afferent c-fiber neurons. We studied the role of tachykinins in regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Destruction of terminal sensory nerve endings before lipopolysaccharide administration abrogates tachykinin synthesis and down-regulates TNF-α transcription and secretion. In contrast, the responses of interleukins-1 and -6 are unaffected. Pretreating animals with an antagonist for the substance P-specific NK-1 receptor also down-regulated the TNF-α response, whereas blockade of the NK-2 receptor had no effect. These findings indicate that substance P contributes to the induction of those cytokines that are involved in precipitating the shock response. J. Leukoc. Biol. 63: 602?605; 1998.

AB  - Background One major concern in about one third of elder patients after total hip-replacement surgery is post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment is accompanied with changes in serum S-100? protein (S-100?) and inflammatory markers. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the value of serum S-100? and interleukin(IL)-1?, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in reflecting POCD after total hip-replacement surgery. Methods Forty-two elderly patients were enrolled, and 37 patients completed the follow-up. Serum S-100? protein and IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were determined pre-operatively, as well as 1?h and 6?h post-operatively. Neuropsychological tests were performed pre-operatively, as well as on day 1, 3, and 7 post-operatively. Results Seventeen (45.9%, 17/37) patients developed POCD 1?day after surgery, and three (8.1%, 3/37) developed POCD 7?days after surgery. [Correction added after publication 7 February 2012: in the preceding sentence (54.1%, 17/37) was corrected to (45.9%, 17/37)]. Patients with POCD 1?day after surgery had significantly higher serum levels of IL-6 at 6?h (135?±?32?pg/ml vs. 91?±?29?pg/ml, P?<?0.05) and S-100? at 1?h (1872?±?385?pg/ml vs. 1289?±?143?pg/ml, P?<?0.05. No significant post-operative change was detected in levels of TNF-α, IL-1, or CRP. Conclusion The serum levels of pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 and S-100? protein increased after total hip-replacement in elderly patients, and such increase may serve as predicting parameters for the occurrence of POCD.

AB  - The influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms on transplanted kidney outcome is not well understood. The aim of this one-centre study was to analyse the association between tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, interferon-? (IFN-?) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) genotypes and the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and 5-year kidney graft loss. Genotyping was performed in 199 subsequent kidney graft recipients from deceased donors without induction therapy based on polymerase chain reaction method using sequence-specific primers for TNF-α (-308A/G), IL-10 (-1082A/G, -819T/C and -592A/C), IL-6 (-174G/C), IFN-? (+874T/A) and TGF-?1 (in codons 10T/C and 25G/C). Genotypes were grouped according to the strength of cytokine expression. During a 5-year follow-up period, 14 patients died with functioning graft and 33 developed graft failure. The analysed polymorphisms were not associated with the incidence of DGF. The frequency of early episodes of AR was significantly associated only with TGF-?1 genotype. There was an association between -174G/C IL-6 gene polymorphism and the death-censored kidney graft survival. The risk of graft loss during 5-year follow-up period was greater by 57% for GG or GC (higher IL-6 production) than for CC carriers. None of the other analysed polymorphisms significantly influenced both patients and kidney graft survival, also in the analysis of the subgroup with human leucocyte antigen-DR mismatch. -174G/C IL-6 genotype of the kidney graft recipient could modulate the rate of graft excretory function deterioration and the risk of graft loss by influencing their constitutional expression.

AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) caused by sepsis occurs early and the condition is severe, and is also an important reason for accelerating the death of patients. Increasing evidence has identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) as a regulator of ALI. However, the potential mechanism underlying MALAT1 on ALI still needs further identification. To explore the mechanisms of gene regulation expression mediated by MALAT1 through miR-149/MyD88 in lung injury inflammation, we constructed a lung injury inflammatory model using the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced method and quantificated the cytokines and signaling cascade molecules as well as miR-149. The MALAT1, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and IL-6 levels were significantly increased, and the nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) pathway was activated, but the miR-149 level was decreased in the LPS-induced ALI model. miR-149 directly targeted both lncRNA MALAT1 and the MyD88 gene. Knockdown of MALAT1 down-regulated the levels of MyD88, TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-6, and inhibited the NF-?B pathway. However, MALAT1 knockdown up-regulated the expression of miR-149. Overexpression of miR-149 down-regulated MyD88, TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-6 levels, and inhibited the NF-?B pathway. MALAT1 acts as a pro-inflammatory factor in ALI via the miR-149/MyD88/NF-?B axis and is therefore a potential novel therapeutic target for ALI treatment.
