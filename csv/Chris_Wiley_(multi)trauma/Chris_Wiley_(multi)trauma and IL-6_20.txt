AB  - Purpose:? Nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHHD, 6?7 times weekly 6?9?h) results in better clinical outcome than conventional 3 times weekly hemodialysis. A good training program for patient and partner is a prequisite for success. We developed a training course for patients and partners. Methods:? Since December 2001, we trained 20 patients and their partners to perform NHHD in 2 succeeding groups. The first group, consisting of 15 patients and their partners, started a NHHD pilot study. During this pilot study, we improved the training course. The second group of 5 were trained with this improved program. All 5 participants were home hemodialysis patients for over 1 month before starting the NHHD course. First, they learned how to handle the single needle system. Then, they performed single needle hemodialysis for 2 weeks at home. This was followed by an in-center NHHD training, consisting of 4 conventional day-time and 3 long (8?h) nocturnal dialysis treatments. Main targets during this training period are to learn to deal with safety precautions, online monitoring, and special machine features, and to check biochemistry and heparinization during long dialysis. 1 month after the training we evaluated the course with all participants. Results:? For 9 of 15 couples in the first group, the training appeared to be exhausting. Stress factors were an overloaded program and too little experience with several new skills including needle technique before starting NHHD. The second group started the NHHD training 2 weeks after the single needle training. This second group was pleased with the training protocol. Conclusion:? The training course for NHHD should not be overloaded. Patients need time to learn new skills before starting NHHD.

AB  - It is unlikely that there is a solitary hospital-based dialysis unit that can claim an unlimited amount of available chronic spots. Many units, in fact, constantly face a problem of overcrowding, long patient waiting lists, and ongoing shortages of nurses trained in highly specialized areas such as dialysis. In addition, conventional dialysis does not afford the best outcomes to patients with lifestyle, fluid control, hypotension, or hypertension issues. Objective:? We developed an in-hospital nocturnal program with the goal of solving some of these issues related to wait lists, overcrowding, and shortages of trained hemodialysis nurses. Method:? In the first year, a four-bed room was converted into a 4 station unit. Nurses from the 24 bed in-patient Nephrology/Urology/Ophthalmology unit were trained to perform hemodialysis. Stable, hospitalized dialysis patients or in-center dialysis patients were selected if they met criteria drawn up by the medical director. Staffing for the unit was established at 3?:?1 or 4?:?1 patient to nurse ratio. Support staff included a hemodialysis-trained ward nurse with an assignment of 5?6 hospitalized patients. Back-up support included assistance with trouble-shooting and break coverage for the nocturnal nurse. Results:? We currently have 12 nurses from the ward trained to do hemodialysis. The nocturnal unit has been operating 3 nights/week, with plans to expand to 6 nights/week within the year. We have 3 patients on the program with plans to increase to 6?8 patients as more nurses are trained. Initiation of hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis has led to the opening of in-center dialysis spots as well as shortening wait periods for patients in the Pre-Renal Clinic, awaiting initiation of chronic dialysis. This model has also provided the in-center dialysis unit with a greater pool of skilled hemodialysis nurses to draw from during shortages. Anecdotal reports from patients indicate that they feel much better, and 1 patient no longer requires antihypertensives for their blood pressure control. Conclusion:? We conclude that hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis is a novel and extremely viable solution for many of the issues facing dialysis units today.

AB  - Introduction:? In 2001 our Renal Dialysis Unit underwent a major renovation to five stations. The new space and funding allowed for acquisition of new state-of-the-art hemodialysis machines. We describe our experience with the Gambro Phoenix with Diascan and Exalis. Prior to the move an evaluation was undertaken. Criteria for selection with a scoring tool were utilized to rate machine performance for use in children. The decision for the Gambro Phoenix machine was based on: the performance rated highly due to ease of set up; large viewing touch screen; compatibility with existing equipment; benefits of online clearance monitoring (Diascan); network data management system (Exalis) and the future availability of blood volume monitoring (Hemoscan). Our program was the first center to dialyze a pediatric patient on the Phoenix machine in Canada. Patients and results:? 13 patients (age 2?23 years) were hemodialyzed between May 2002 and September 2003 for periods of 2?week to 16 months, greater than 5000?h of dialysis time. The move was not uneventful. During the first months of operation issues such as inadequate electrical supply for the new machines, reverse osmosis (RO) pump failure, leaks, and no emergency power to the RO were prevalent. The new software also exposed glitches. Subsequent Phoenix use proceeded uneventfully. Staff were able to problem solve easily with clinical and technical support from Gambro Canada. Education for the online clearance monitoring, Diascan and Exalis, was necessary. No major problems with dialysis were encountered. The benefits and reliability of Diascan have been previously described (Lindsay RM, Sternby J, Semin Dial. 2001; 14:300). Diascan readings provided real-time measurement of sodium (Na), which correlated well with laboratory values. Automatic readouts of Kt/V allowed for monitoring of dialysis adequacy which was consistent with calculated percent reduction in urea (PRU). At this point, use of the Phoenix has been demonstrated to work well in a pediatric facility.

AB  - The mortality and morbidity of hemodialysis patients is, to a large extent, determined by demographics and by existing comorbidities, but it is obvious that variations in dialysis dose have substantial effects. Using eKt/V, 1.2 monthly comparisons are recommended by European guidelines, but they assume that dose is maintained during all monthly sessions. Because of dialysis-related problems like hypotension, reduction of blood flow, dialysis time, microclotting of the dialyzer, and vascular access problems, the delivered dose may vary from session to session. New developed devices based on online conductivity clearance reflect the electrolyte clearance and, thus, clearance of urea. The aim of this prospective study was to show the variability of dialysis dose. 24 anuric patients were studied during 3 months: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with online conductivity monitor (OCM) and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Each patient was subjected to OCM on regular sessions during 3 months, and blood Kt/V samples were taken on midweek day, once a month. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation with other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The conductivity-based OCM provides an accurate tool to monitor the dose and control of each hemodialysis session and adds to the efficiency of current dialysis adequacy monitoring. OCM device requires little maintenance, and no extra effort is needed. Monthly Kt/V does not reflect the variability of each session. Further studies are necessary to evaluate its influence on morbidity and mortality. ? Descriptives ?

AB  - Cirrhosis (Cir) is often associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Egyptian patients on regular hemodialysis (RHD). This is largely attributed to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and concomitant Hepatitis C viral infection. As the liver has a major role in vitamin D3 activation, we designed this study to envisage the impact of Cir on renal osteodystrophy (ROD). It included 130 consecutive age- and gender-matched subjects in 4 categories. Group I: 39 patients (34 male and 5 female; mean age 48.8 years) with Cir normal renal function; group II: 37 patients (30 male and 7 female; mean age 49.0 years) with CRF and normal liver function, on RHD for a mean duration of 6?±?3.9 years; group III: 41 patients (30 male and 11 female; mean age 50.7 years) with CRF and concomitant Cir, stable on RHD for a mean duration of 7.0?±?4.0 years; and group IV: 16 normal volunteers (13 male and 3 female; mean age 46.3 years). The prevalence of diabetes as well as previous infection with schistosomiasis was similar in all patient groups and that of HCV infection was alike in groups I and III. In all subjects, conventional parameters of liver and renal function were tested; in addition to measurement of serum total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphate, total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), parathormone (PTH), 5-hydroxycholecalciferol (5HD), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25HD), Cross Laps (CXL) as a marker of bone resorption, and aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) as a measure of bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by either Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Computerized Tomography (CT). Group II patients displayed the typical CRF profile comprising hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases, high PTH and 25HD, low 1,25HD, increased PINP as well as CXL, and generally decreased BMD. Cir (Group III) significantly (p value at least <0.5) modified this profile in several aspects: it checked hypocalcemia (mean 8.8 vs. 7.9?mg/dL in groups II and III, respectively), hyperphosphatemia (5.15 vs. 4.9?mg/dL), and the elevation of B-ALP (62 vs. 30.5??g/L) and PTH (89 vs. 78?pg/mL). It lowered the serum level of 25HD (18.7 vs. 13.7?ng/mL), augmented the deficiency of 1,25HD (13.4 vs. 8.0?pg/mL), did not appreciably affect the increase in bone formation (PINP 77.9 vs. 75.5?ng/mL), but ameliorated its excessive resorption (CXL 21?860 vs. 30?328?pmol/L) noticed in group II. This was associated with amelioration of the dialysis-associated osteopenia (70 vs. 33.5%) and increased incidence of osteosclerosis (30 vs. 61%), as measured by bone mineral density. Conclusion:? Our data indicate that Cir ameliorates ROD through decreased bone resorption. This is associated with better tolerance to 1,25HD deficiency, which initiates the cascade of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and increased bone resorption in CRF. Such tolerance may reflect upregulation of vitamin D receptors as a consequence of the humoral perturbation supervening in Cir, involving IGF-1, estrogens, or other vitamin D metabolites as 24,25 HD.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess quality of life (QOL) in 119 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and 89 hemodialysis (HD) patients using the SF-36 instrument (PF?=?physical function, RP?=?role limitations physical, BP?= bodily pain, GH?=?general health perceptions, VT?=?vitality, SF?=?social function, RE?=?role limitations emotional, MH?=?mental health, MCS?=?mental summary, and PCS?= physical summary). The mean (range) s-creatinine in the CKD group was 325??mol/L (133?809??mol/L). There were no differences in SF-36 scores between CKD and HD patients (Figure). CKD/HD status did not predict MCS or PCS in multivariate analyses controlling for age (p?<?0.01 for PCS), sex, depression (p?=?0.01 for PCS), Charlson comorbidity score (p?<?0.01 for PCS), s-albumin (p?=?0.05 for PCS), hemoglobin, presence of partner, and level of education. We conclude that QOL is related to comorbid illness and decreases even before dialysis is started. Longitudinal studies of QOL in CKD patients are needed to evaluate the influence of dialysis initiation on QOL.

AB  - Abstract An acute administration of the hippocampal toxicant trimethyltin (TMT) produced a specific pattern of neuronal necrosis in dentate granule cells with accompanying astrogliosis and initiation of a cytokine response within 24 hours. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DEX), on the pattern of cytokine expression and neuronal degeneration occurring after an acute TMT injection. Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered to 21-day-old male mice 1 hour prior to an injection of TMT hydroxide (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice receiving 0.2 mg/kg DEX received a second injection 6 hours after TMT. Twenty-four hours later, neuronal necrosis and astrogliosis were assessed and found to be similar in animals treated with TMT, either in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Pretreatment with dexamethasone failed to prevent the neurodegeneration and astrogliosis. The TMT-induced injury response was represented in elevations of mRNA levels for the injury-associated host response genes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), EB22/5.3, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The combination of DEX and TMT produced increased elevation in mRNA levels for EB22/5.3 and ICAM, while GFAP levels remained the same as with TMT alone. The injury response from TMT was accompanied by elevations in mRNA levels for the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, TNF?, and interleukin (IL)-1α. Treatment with dexamethasone prior to TMT resulted in significantly elevated levels of TNFα, TNF?, and IL-1α as compared to TMT alone. These data represent the inability of glucocorticoids to downregulate the injury response in rat hippocampus following a systemic injection of TMT and suggest a stimulation and ?priming? of hippocampal cells by dexamethasone.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Abstract This study tested the hypothesis that activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) contributes towards the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in the mouse. The effects of LPS on plasma glucose, biochemical markers of hepatic, renal and pancreatic exocrine function and lung content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were examined in homozygous PAR-2 knockout mice (PAR-2 -/-) and genetically equivalent, homozygous PAR-2 +/+ mice. The effect of LPS was also examined in normal mice receiving dexamethasone (10 mg kg?1, i.p.) or saline as a positive control. At six hours after intraperitoneal injection, LPS (40 mg kg?1) produced an increase in rectal temperature, hypoglycaemia and elevations in serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and lipase, as well as an increase in lung MPO content. Dexamethasone treatment reduced LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and elevation of serum ALT concentrations but did not modify elevations in serum creatinine and lipase concentrations or the increase in lung MPO content. The changes in serum concentrations of glucose, ALT, creatinine and lipase produced by LPS in PAR-2 -/- mice were not different from those seen in wild-type or PAR-2 +/+ mice. These data suggest that activation of PAR-2 may not play a pivotal role in LPS-induced multi-organ dysfunction.

The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Abstract Astrocytes become activated in response to many CNS pathologies. The process of astrocyte activation remains rather enigmatic and results in so-called reactive gliosis, a reaction with specific structural and functional characteristics. Astrocytes play a vital role in regulating aspects of inflammation and in the homeostatic maintenance of the CNS. However, the responses of different human astroglial cell-lines in viral encephalitis mediated inflammation are not well documented. We have shown that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection causes morphological and functional changes in astrocytic cell-lines. We have demonstrated that besides reactive oxygen species (ROS) JEV infection differentially regulated the induction pattern of IL-6, IL-1? and IL-8. IP-10, MCP-1, MIG and RANTES secretions in different astroglial cell-lines. The expression of different proteins such as astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the glutamate aspartate transporter/essential amino acid transporter-1 (GLAST/EAAT-1), glutamate transporter-1/essential amino acid transporter-2 (GLT-1/EAAT-2), Ceruloplasmin and Thioredoxin (TRX) expression level also differ in different human astrocyte cell-lines following infection.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bone is one of the most transplanted tissues. While most bone defects heal spontaneously, critical size defects caused by major trauma/malignant tumor and osteonecrosis of femoral head in young adults pose a great challenge in treatment. While the golden standard in treating bone defects is autologous bone grafting, available bone for grafting is quite limited in an individual. To solve the dilemma, stem cell therapy has been tried as a new modality of treatment in lesions not amenable to autologous bone grafting. While successful results were reported from individual studies, the stem cell therapy is still not an established treatment modality for bone regeneration and needs further assessment. Our focus herein is to introduce stem cell sources that have been investigated so far and review the current status of stem cell reutilization for bone regeneration as well as suggesting future perspectives.

AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical condition responsible for high mortality and the development of multiple organ dysfunctions, because of the lack of specific and effective therapies for ALI. Increasing evidence from pre-clinical studies supports preventive and therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, also called mesenchymal stromal cells) in ALI/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Therapeutic effects of MSCs were noticed in various delivery approaches (systemic, local, or other locations), multiple origins (bone marrow or other tissues), or different schedules of administrations (before or after the challenges). MSCs could reduce the over-production of inflammatory mediators, leucocyte infiltration, tissue injury and pulmonary failure, and produce a number of benefit factors through interaction with other cells in the process of lung tissue repair. Thus, it is necessary to establish guidelines, standard operating procedures and evaluation criteria for translating MSC-based therapies into clinical application for patients with ALI.
