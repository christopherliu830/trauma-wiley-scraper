AB  - ABSTRACT Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in renal transplant recipients. Frequency of UTIs depend on many factors such as age, female gender, kidney function, co-morbidity, type and amount of immunosuppression, urological instrumentation and/or the follow-up period (short term or long term) after kidney transplantation. UTI may worsen graft and patient survival. A significant proportion of renal transplant recipients with UTIs may develop acute pyelonephritis (APN), which is an independent risk factor for deterioration of graft function. Renal transplant recipients with UTIs are often clinically asymptomatic as a consequence of immunosuppression. UTI, however, may progress to APN (particularly in the early post-transplant period), bacteraemia and the full blown picture of urosepsis. Strategies for long term prophylaxis and antimicrobial treatment of UTI in renal transplant recipients are discussed.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol exposure is known to sensitize acinar cells to various insults but the pathophysiological mechanisms of alcoholic pancreatitis remain unknown. Alcohol abuse has been shown to mediate an anti-inflammatory response and periods of immune suppression seem to be associated with organ injury and mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts transcriptional activities in the rat pancreas and how alcohol alters the inflammatory response. Using the Lieber?DeCarli alcohol/control diet, rats that were fed with alcohol over 14 weeks demonstrated a decrease of inflammatory cells in pancreatic tissue compared to controls. The anti-inflammatory effects of alcohol were confirmed by decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-1?, IL-18, TGF?, and MCP-1. In addition, alcohol significantly increased the activity of PPAR?, which is a known anti-inflammatory transcription factor, while pro-inflammatory factors including AP-2 and EGR-1 were significantly suppressed. NF?B binding showed a tendency towards a reduction. Electron microscopy studies revealed enlarged and injured mitochondria and lysosomes, accompanied by peri-cellular fibrosis. Furthermore, alcohol exposure increased the activities of trypsin and cathepsin B, both known to be critical in initiating acinar cell injury and pancreatitis. Despite the known alcohol-mediated acinar cell and mitochondrial injury, the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway was attenuated. These data demonstrate that the pancreas exposed to alcohol maintains an anti-inflammatory state by activating PPAR?. Intracellular mitochondrial and lysosomal damage after chronic alcohol exposure induces premature activation of digestive enzymes and establishment of peri-cellular fibrosis in the absence of inflammation.

AB  - SUMMARY Recently it has been demonstrated that the CD14 molecule which is expressed on monocytes and macrophages serves as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bound to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and thus mediates LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production. Here we report that CD14 is found as a soluble (s) molecule in serum. In healthy volunteers sCD14 levels (mean ± s.e.m.) were 3.7±0.05 ?g/ml (n= 30, 25?50 years of age) as determined by ELISA (detection limit 20 ?g/ml serum) using two monoclonal antibodies in a sandwich technique. In polytraumatized patients (n= 16) significantly decreased levels (1.7 ± 0.3) were detected immediately after the trauma, which increased to 4.9±0.3 ?g/ml within the first 6 days post trauma. sCD14 remained elevated during the first 14 days post trauma in patients with the most severe injuries (injury severity score > 45 points), whereas a return to normal levels was observed in patients with an injury score of < 45 points. In addition, the levels of the high-density lipoproteins that partially inactivate free endotoxin are significantly decreased post trauma. No correlation between parameters of inflammation (C3a and neopterin levels, leucocyte counts, amount of band cells), liver function and sCD14 levels was established. Comparable to polytraumatized patients, increased sCD14 serum levels were observed in five patients with burn trauma (burned area > 35%) within the second week post trauma when clinical signs of septicaemia were evident.

AB  - The progressive deterioration in nutrition status frequently seen in cancer patients is often referred to as cancer cachexia. Unlike starvation, in which fat stores from adipose are depleted and protein is spared from skeletal muscle, neither fat nor protein is spared in cachexia. Cachexia affects nearly half of cancer patients, causing the clinical manifestations of anorexia, muscle wasting, weight loss, early satiety, fatigue, and impaired immune response. Cachexia does not only impede the response to chemotherapy but also is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. According to clinical studies, increasing caloric intake does not necessarily reverse cachexia. The pathophysiology of cachexia involves more complex mechanisms than simply caloric deficiency. The process appears to be mediated by circulating catabolic factors, either secreted by the tumor alone or in concert with host-derived factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1 and IL-6), interferon (IFN-y), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The successful reversal of this process will require in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms involved, which will then enable the development of effective pharmacologic interventions that may not only improve quality of life, but more importantly, improve survival among cancer patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a non-specific acute phase reaction protein that shows much higher levels in patients with cancer than in healthy individuals. The present study was designed to investigate the correlation of SAA level with overall survival (OS) and radiation pneumonitis (RP) in non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving thoracic radiotherapy. Methods Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving thoracic radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy were eligible for the study. Plasma samples were collected before radiotherapy (baseline), 2 and 4 weeks during radiotherapy, and at 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. The incidence of RP was recorded 1 year after radiotherapy. OS was defined as the interval between the date of treatment initiation and the date of death or last follow up if the patients were still alive. spss 18.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 software were used for statistical analyses, and P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results In total, data from 114 patients were used for the final analyses. The median baseline SAA level was 101.4 ?g/mL; patients with lower baseline SAA levels had a longer OS than those with a higher SAA level (25.8 vs 14.3 months, ?2 = 5.519, P = 0.019). In multivariate analysis, sex, radiation dose, and baseline SAA level were independent prognostic factors. The SAA level after radiotherapy was significantly lower than that at baseline (142.6 vs 420.1 ?g/mL, t = 3.50, P = 0.001). The average SAA level in patients with grade 2 or higher and less than grade 2 RP after radiotherapy was 476.7 ?g/mL and 113.0 ?g/mL, respectively, t = 2.72, P = 0.009. Conclusions SAA level might be a predictive biomarker for RP and OS in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving thoracic radiotherapy.

AB  - Summary All currently recognized neurological diseases are believed to be associated with some degree of neuroinflammation. Indeed, patient postmortem examinations almost always reveal enhanced expression of highly activated immunocompetent microglia within degenerating brain regions, often together with astrocyte and pro-inflammatory cytokine (neuro-immune signaling glycoproteins) accumulation. Paralleling these human studies, data from various genetic and toxin-based animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD, respectively), have likewise demonstrated a prominent cytokine-microglial inflammatory component. Such preclinical work has been critical in moving the discussion surrounding the significance of neuroinflammation in degenerative brain diseases from correlation to causation. Hence, the potential of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory agents to mitigate neurodegeneration in AD and PD deserves serious attention. That said, there is a growing consensus that neuroinflammation may be best viewed as a ?double-edged sword?, with the capacity to influence both positive and negative outcomes. A better understanding of the factors that modulate neuroinflammatory processes is therefore critical for developing optimal strategies for therapeutically manipulating neuro-immune responses in AD and PD.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Obesity during pregnancy is associated with meta-inflammation and an increased likelihood of clinical complications. Surgery results in intense, acute inflammatory responses in any individual. Because obese individuals exhibit constitutive inflammatory responses and high rates of Caesarian section, it is important to understand the impact of surgery in such populations. Whether more pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and/or counterbalancing changes in anti-inflammatory immune modulators occurs is unknown. Here we investigated innate immune capacity in vivo and in vitro in non-obese, term-pregnant controls versus healthy, term-pregnant obese women (Class II, BMI 35?40). Methods Systemic in vivo induction of eleven pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and acute phase proteins was assessed in plasma immediately prior to and again following Caesarian section surgery. Independently, innate immune capacity was examined by stimulating freshly isolated PBMC in vitro with a panel of defined PRR-ligands for TLR4, TLR8, TLR3, and RLR 24?h post-surgery. Results The kinetics and magnitude of the in vivo inflammatory responses examined were indistinguishable in the two populations across the broad range of biomarkers examined, despite the fact that obese women had higher baseline inflammatory status. Deliberate in vitro stimulation with a range of PRR ligands also elicited pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses that were indistinguishable between control and obese mothers. Conclusions Acute in vivo innate immune responses to C-section, as well as subsequent in vitro stimulation with a panel of microbial mimics, are not detectably altered in Class II obese women. The data argue that while Class II obesity is undesirable, it has minimal impact on the in vivo inflammatory response, or innate immunomodulatory capacity, in women selecting C-section.

AB  - Abstract This article highlights preclinical and clinical studies in the field of wasting disorders that were presented at the 12th Cachexia Conference held in Berlin, Germany, in December 2019. Herein, we summarize the biological and clinical significance of different strategies including antibodies that target Fn14, Spsb 1, SAA1 treatment, ZIP14, a MuRF1 inhibitor, and new diagnostic tools like T-cell communication targets and cut-offs for the detection of skeletal muscle wasting. Of particular interest were the transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells and muscle stem cell communication. Importantly, one presentation discussed the effect of metal ion transporter ZIP14 loss that reduces cancer-induced cachexia. The potential of anti-ZIP14 antibodies and zinc chelation as anti-cachexia therapy may require testing in patients with cancer cachexia. Large clinical studies were presented such as RePOWER (observational study of patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy), MMPOWER (treatment with elamipretide in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy), and ACT-ONE as well as new mouse models like the KPP mouse. Promising treatments include rapamycin analogue treatment, anamorelin, elanapril, glucocorticoids, SAA1, antibodies that target Fn14, and a MuRF1 inhibitor. Clinical studies investigated novel approaches, including the role of exercise. It remains a fact, however, that effective treatments for cachexia and wasting disorders are urgently needed in order to improve patients' quality of life and their survival.

AB  - ABSTRACT Inflammatory factors secreted by microglia play an important role in focal ischemic stroke. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a known regulator of immune responses, but the role that mTORC1 signaling plays in poststroke neuroinflammation is not clear. To explore the relationship between microglial action in the mTORC1 pathway and the impact on stroke, we administered the mTORC1 inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus to mice. Presumably, disrupting the mTORC1 pathway after focal ischemic stroke should clarify the subsequent activity of microglia. For that purpose, we generated mice deficient in the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) in microglia, whose mTORC1 signaling was blocked, by crossing Raptor loxed (Raptorflox/flox) mice with CX3CR1CreER mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 promoter. mTORC1 blockade reduced lesion size, improved motor function, dramatically decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduced the number of M1 type microglia. Thus, mTORC1 blockade apparently attenuated behavioral deficits and poststroke inflammation after middle cerebral artery occlusion by preventing microglia polarization toward the M1 type.?Li, D., Wang, C., Yao, Y., Chen, L., Liu, G., Zhang, R., Liu, Q., Shi, F.-D., Hao, J. mTORC1 pathway disruption ameliorates brain inflammation following stroke via a shift in microglia phenotype from M1 type to M2 type.
