AB  - Summary Membrane-bound and intracellular immune receptors respond to microbial pathogens by initiating signaling cascades that result in production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial factors. These host responses need to be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage and other harmful consequences of excessive inflammation. CARD-only proteins (COPs) and Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are human- and primate-specific dominant negative inhibitors that modulate inflammatory and innate immune responses. In addition, several poxviruses encode POPs that interfere with inflammatory and host defense responses. COPs and POPs modulate inflammatory signaling at several checkpoints by sequestering key components of the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling cascades, thus hampering downstream signal transduction. Here, we review and discuss current understanding of the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms by which roles of host- and virus-encoded COPs and POPs may regulate inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, we address their (patho)physiological roles and highlight topics for further research.

AB  - Abstract Macrophages are ubiquitous in the stromal compartment of tissues under normal physiological conditions and the number of these cells increases markedly with the onset and progression of many pathological states. The mechanisms underlying this response are well described in such conditions as wound healing and malignant tumors, where tissue-specific signals enhance the extravasation of blood monocytes and their subsequent differentiation into macrophages. Recent evidence suggests that macrophages may also be stimulated by microenvironmental factors present in diseased tissues to perform distinct, tissue-specific activities. One such factor, hypoxia (low oxygen tension), results from insufficient vascular perfusion of a given tissue. Various studies have shown that experimental hypoxia alters the morphology, expression of cell surface markers, viability, phagocytosis, metabolic activity, and release of cytokines by macrophages. Here we review the evidence for these macrophage responses to hypoxia, the involvement of co-stimuli, and their implications for the role of macrophages in various disease processes. Because the intracellular mechanisms mediating the effects of hypoxia on gene expression in other cell types have been characterized recently, we discuss their possible involvement in the effects of hypoxia on gene expression in macrophages.

AB  - Abstract Inspired by the coordinated multiple healing mechanism of the organism, a four-armed benzaldehyde-terminated polyethylene glycol and dodecyl-modified chitosan hybrid hydrogel with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) encapsulation are presented for efficient and versatile wound healing. The hybrid hydrogel is formed through the reversible Schiff base and possesses self-healing capability. As the dodecyl tails can insert themselves into and be anchored onto the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, the hybrid hydrogel has outstanding tissue adhesion, blood cell coagulation and hemostasis, anti-infection, and cell recruitment functions. Moreover, by loading in and controllably releasing VEGF from the hybrid hydrogel, the processes of cell proliferation and tissue remodeling in the wound bed can be significantly improved. Based on an in vivo study of the multifunctional hybrid hydrogel, it is demonstrated that acute tissue injuries such as vessel bleeding and liver bleeding can be repaired immediately because of the outstanding adhesion and hemostasis features of the hydrogel. Moreover, the chronic wound-healing process of an infectious full-thickness skin defect model can also be significantly enhanced by promoting angiogenesis, collagen deposition, macrophage polarization, and granulation tissue formation. Thus, this multifunctional hybrid hydrogel is potentially valuable for clinical applications.

AB  - Inflammation is a hallmark of virtually all liver diseases, such as liver cancer, fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cholangiopathies. Liver macrophages have been thoroughly studied in human disease and mouse models, unravelling that the hepatic mononuclear phagocyte system is more versatile and complex than previously believed. Liver macrophages mainly consist of liver-resident phagocytes, or Kupffer cells (KCs), and bone marrow-derived recruited monocytes. Although both cell populations in the liver demonstrate principal functions of macrophages, such as phagocytosis, danger signal recognition, cytokine release, antigen processing, and the ability to orchestrate immune responses, KCs and recruited monocytes retain characteristic ontogeny markers and remain remarkably distinct on several functional aspects. While KCs dominate the hepatic macrophage pool in homeostasis (?sentinel function?), monocyte-derived macrophages prevail in acute or chronic injury (?emergency response team?), making them an interesting target for novel therapeutic approaches in liver disease. In addition, recent data acquired by unbiased large-scale techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, unraveled a previously unrecognized complexity of human and murine macrophage polarization abilities, far beyond the old dogma of inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Despite tremendous progress, numerous challenges remain in deciphering the full spectrum of macrophage activation and its implication in either promoting liver disease progression or repairing injured liver tissue. Being aware of such heterogeneity in cell origin and function is of crucial importance when studying liver diseases, developing novel therapeutic interventions, defining macrophage-based prognostic biomarkers, or designing clinical trials. Growing knowledge in gene expression modulation and emerging technologies in drug delivery may soon allow shaping macrophage populations toward orchestrating beneficial rather than detrimental inflammatory responses.
