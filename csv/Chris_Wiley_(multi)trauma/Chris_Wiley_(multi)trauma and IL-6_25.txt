AB  - ABSTRACT Trauma and age-related cartilage disorders represent a major global cause of morbidity, resulting in chronic pain and disability in patients. A lack of effective therapies, together with a rapidly aging population, creates an impressive clinical and economic burden on healthcare systems. In this scenario, experimental therapies based on transplantation or in situ stimulation of skeletal Mesenchymal Stem/progenitor Cells (MSCs) have raised great interest for cartilage repair. Nevertheless, the challenge of guiding MSC differentiation and preventing cartilage hypertrophy and calcification still needs to be overcome. While research has mostly focused on the stimulation of cartilage anabolism using growth factors, several issues remain unresolved prompting the field to search for novel solutions. Recently, inhibition of anti-chondrogenic regulators has emerged as an intriguing opportunity. Anti-chondrogenic regulators include extracellular proteins as well as intracellular transcription factors and microRNAs that act as potent inhibitors of pro-chondrogenic signals. Suppression of these inhibitors can enhance MSC chondrogenesis and production of cartilage matrix. We here review the current knowledge concerning different types of anti-chondrogenic regulators. We aim to highlight novel therapeutic targets for cartilage repair and discuss suitable tools for suppressing their anti-chondrogenic functions. Further effort is needed to unveil the therapeutic perspectives of this approach and pave the way for effective treatment of cartilage injuries in patients. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary This chapter demonstrates several approaches for innovative three-dimensional (3D) tissue fabrications by employing layer-by-layer (LbL) nanofilms constructed through biological recognition. It discusses how the 3D tissues could contribute to understanding pathophysiological and pharmaceutical events. Currently, various methodologies such as cell sheet engineering, the cell beads method, and magnetic liposomes have been reported in the development of multilayered tissue constructs. 4L-normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) provide a more favorable environment for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as compared to a plastic cell culture dish for the induction of high thermosensitivity and suppression of inflammatory responses from the substrate. Inkjet printing is a promising technology for noncontact and computer-aided design (CAD) cell printing. 3D human tissue chips prepared by hierarchical cell manipulation with automatic inkjet printing will be an innovative technology for <I>in vitro</I> evaluations of drugs, cosmetics, and chemicals, instead of animal testing.

AB  - Abstract With an increase in the ageing population worldwide, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases at an alarming rate in both male and female irrespective of their ethnicity. At present, the currently available therapeutic options are mostly limited to either bone resorptive or bone forming efficacies and both approaches are associated with serious side effects. Despite these options, there is still need for newer therapeutics to treat osteoporosis, which can offer beneficial effects for maintaining balanced dynamics between bone formation and bone resorption, devoid of any side effect. The proper understanding of pathophysiology of the disease is essential for designing or investigating an effective and safe anti-osteoporotic agent. This review represents a discussion around the molecular targets with their implications in disease progression, available therapeutic options, the emerging targets, and the importance of designing an effective anti-osteoporotic agent.

AB  - Summary Understanding the complex immunological consequences of red cell transfusion is essential if we are to use this valuable resource wisely and safely. The decision to transfuse red cells should be made after serious considerations of the associated risks and benefits. Immunological risks of transfusion include major incompatibility reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury, while other immunological insults such as transfusion-related immunomodulation are relatively underappreciated. Red cell transfusions should be acknowledged as immunological exposures, with consequences weighed against expected benefits. This article reviews immunological consequences and the emerging evidence that may inform risk-benefit considerations in clinical practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Men and women appear to exhibit different susceptibilities to sepsis and possibly divergent outcomes. However, the effect of sex and gender in critical illness outcomes is still controversial and the underlying mechanisms appear to be complex. Objectives We aimed to systematically review and synthesize evidence on the influence of sex on outcomes in critically ill adult patients with sepsis, as reported in published studies specifically including investigation of the effect of sex among their aims. Primary outcome measures include in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU. Search strategy The review was based on focused literature searches (CINAHL, PUBMED, EMBASE and COCHRANE). Methodological quality was assessed through the STROBE checklist and the Cochrane Tool for Bias in Cohort Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA. Published observational studies addressing outcomes of sepsis among their primary aims and having included gender comparisons among primary outcomes in critically ill adult patients were included. Results A total of eight eligible studies were included. With the exception of mortality, it was not possible to perform meta-analysis for other outcomes. Included studies reported data on 25,619 patients with sepsis (14?309 male/11?310 female). There is a paucity of well-designed studies addressing the effect of sex on mortality among patients with sepsis, and absence of studies addressing the effects of sex on multiple organ dysfunction of non-infectious origin. There was significant heterogeneity among study estimates (p?=?0·001; I2=78·1%). Conclusions Although results of data syntheses appear to point towards a small disadvantage for survival among women, our results suggest that data on the impact of sex on sepsis outcomes remain equivocal. Implications for future research include approaches to adjustment for confounders and prospective designs. Relevance to clinical practice Clarifying sex-related differences in sepsis, if any, is crucial for informing evidence-based care.

AB  - Conventional heart rate variability (HRV) indices comprise time domain and frequency domain HRV indices that not only reflect the autonomic control of the heart but also serve as prognostic markers of various cardiovascular disorders. These indices have been extensively investigated as prognostic factors for patients who develop coronary artery diseases including myocardial infarction (MI). Non-linear indices of HRV such as the long (?)- and short (α1 and ?2)-term fractal component indices and approximate entropy analysis have been clinically applied. In addition, heart rate turbulence (HRT) and the deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate have been studied as potential HRV indices for predicting untoward outcomes of cardiovascular diseases. This overview examines HRV indices and their roles in the setting of cardiovascular disorders including sudden cardiac death. We describe changes in HRV indices and clarify the relationship between prognosis and the indices in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units.

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.
