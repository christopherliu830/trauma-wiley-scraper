AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and fusion proteins directed towards cell surface targets make an important contribution to the treatment of disease. The purpose of this review was to correlate the clinical and preclinical data on the 15 currently approved mAbs and fusion proteins targeted to the cell surface. The principal sources used to gather data were: the peer reviewed Literature; European Medicines Agency ?Scientific Discussions?; and the US Food and Drug Administration ?Pharmacology/Toxicology Reviews? and package inserts (United States Prescribing Information). Data on the 15 approved biopharmaceuticals were included: abatacept; abciximab; alefacept; alemtuzumab; basiliximab; cetuximab; daclizumab; efalizumab; ipilimumab; muromonab; natalizumab; panitumumab; rituximab; tocilizumab; and trastuzumab. For statistical analysis of concordance, data from these 15 were combined with data on the approved mAbs and fusion proteins directed towards soluble targets. Good concordance with human pharmacodynamics was found for mice receiving surrogates or non-human primates (NHPs) receiving the human pharmaceutical. In contrast, there was poor concordance for human pharmacodynamics in genetically deficient mice and for human adverse effects in all three test systems. No evidence that NHPs have superior predictive value was found.

AB  - Abstract? Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a physiological gas found at low levels in the atmosphere and produced in cells during the process of aerobic respiration. Consequently, the levels of CO2 within tissues are usually significantly higher than those found externally. Shifts in tissue levels of CO2 (leading to either hypercapnia or hypocapnia) are associated with a number of pathophysiological conditions in humans and can occur naturally in niche habitats such as those of burrowing animals. Clinical studies have indicated that such altered CO2 levels can impact upon disease progression. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CO2 has shown that like other physiological gases such as molecular oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO), CO2 levels can be sensed by cells resulting in the initiation of physiological and pathophysiological responses. Acute CO2 sensing in neurons and peripheral and central chemoreceptors is important in rapidly activated responses including olfactory signalling, taste sensation and cardiorespiratory control. Furthermore, a role for CO2 in the regulation of gene transcription has recently been identified with exposure of cells and model organisms to high CO2 leading to suppression of genes involved in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation. This latter, transcriptional regulatory role for CO2, has been largely attributed to altered activity of the NF-?B family of transcription factors. Here, we review our evolving understanding of how CO2 impacts upon gene transcription.

AB  - Abstract Given what evidence there is for the molecular and functional nature of cytokines and their cognate binding proteins in the immune system and the emerging similarities or even identities for these ligands and receptors in the nervous system, two general models may be relevant. The first emerging pattern is that receptors for related but distinct trophic factors in the CNS are in many instances multichain complexes with one or more shared components. The shared components of the receptor complex may be either signal- or nonsignal-transducing chains. A second emerging motif is that related ligands and related receptors fall into gene families. Undoubtedly, these models will facilitate the cloning of novel members of these families whose function is quite specific to the nervous system and in particular to glial cells. This article will review the function of the receptors for cytokines and families of differentiation/survival/growth factors as they operate on astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in development, health, and disease. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We have previously demonstrated that chloroquine may evoke inflammatory responses in the central nervous system by inducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by astroglial cells. In this study, we further examined the molecular mechanism responsible for chloroquine-induced activation of NF-?B and subsequent expression of chemokines by astroglial cells. We observed that (1) chloroquine induced expression of chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL8 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human astroglial cells; (2) other lysosomotropic agents such as ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A1 had minimal effects on chemokine expression; (3) inhibition of NF-?B by MG-132 and TPCK suppressed chloroquine-induced mRNA expression of chemokines; (4) chloroquine increased the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose- and time-dependent manner by human astroglial cells, but not by monocytic/microglial cells; (5) chloroquine-induced increase of intracellular ROS level was suppressed by pre-incubation with diphenyl iodonium (DPI) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC); and (6) inhibition of chloroquine-induced ROS production by DPI or NAC suppressed chloroquine-mediated activation of NF-?B and subsequent mRNA expression of chemokines in astroglial cells. These results collectively suggest that chloroquine generates ROS, which is responsible for NF-?B activation and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines in human astroglial cells. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The development of an infection is a major complication for some patients with implanted biomaterials. Whether the material or surface composition of the used biomaterial influences infection has not been directly compared for key biomaterials currently in use in human patients. We conducted a thorough in vitro and in vivo investigation using titanium (Ti) and polyether?ether?ketone (PEEK) as both commercially available and as modified equivalents (surface polished Ti, and oxygen plasma treated PEEK). Complement activation and cytokine secretion of cell of the immune system was assessed in vitro for all materials in the absence and presence of bacterial stimulants. In a follow-up in vivo study, we monitored bacterial infection associated with clinically available and standard Ti and PEEK inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. Complement activation was affected by material choice in the absence of bacterial stimulation, although the material based differences were largely lost upon bacterial stimulation. In the in vivo study, the bacterial burden, histological response and cytokine secretion suggests that there is no significant difference between both PEEK and Ti. In conclusion, the underlying material has a certain impact in the absence of bacterial stimulation, however, in the presence of bacterial stimulation, bacteria seem to dictate the responses in a manner that overshadows the influence of material surface properties. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary: Tissue damage occurs often in the life of mammals and is usually repaired. Dying cells are swiftly phagocytosed, but before disappearing, they alert surrounding cells to activate homeostatic programs. They release signals that recruit inflammatory cells to the site of injury, promote cell migration and cell division to replace dead cells, and activate the immune system in anticipation of microbial invasion. Many of these events involve high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a nuclear protein that is released passively when necrotic cells lose the integrity of their membranes. HMGB1 behaves as a trigger of inflammation, attracting inflammatory cells, and of tissue repair, recruiting stem cells and promoting their proliferation. Moreover, HMGB1 activates dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes their functional maturation and their response to lymph node chemokines. Activated leukocytes actively secrete HMGB1 in the microenvironment. Thus, HMGB1 acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion and sustains long-term repair and defense programs. DCs secrete HMGB1 several hours after contact with the first maturation stimulus; HMGB1 secretion is critical for their ability to reach the lymph nodes, to sustain the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, to prevent their activation-dependent apoptosis, and to promote their polarization towards a T-helper 1 phenotype. These immune responses will also be directed against self-antigens that DCs process at the time of injury and can lead to autoimmunity.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.
