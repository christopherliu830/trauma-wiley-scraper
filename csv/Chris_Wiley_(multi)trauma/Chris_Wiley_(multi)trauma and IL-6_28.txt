AB  - Summary Patients who have sustained brain injury or had developmental brain lesions present a non-negligible risk for developing delayed epilepsy. Finding therapeutic strategies to prevent development of epilepsy in at-risk patients represents a crucial medical challenge. Noncoding microRNA molecules (miRNAs) are promising candidates in this area. Indeed, deregulation of diverse brain-specific miRNAs has been observed in animal models of epilepsy as well as in patients with epilepsy, mostly in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Herein we review deregulated miRNAs reported in epilepsy with potential roles in key molecular and cellular processes underlying epileptogenesis, namely neuroinflammation, cell proliferation and differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and synaptic remodeling. We provide an up-to-date listing of miRNAs altered in epileptogenesis and assess recent functional studies that have interrogated their role in epilepsy. Last, we discuss potential applications of these findings for the future development of disease-modifying therapeutic strategies for antiepileptogenesis.

Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.

AB  - Background Interdigital pyoderma is a common multifactorial, inflammatory disease of the canine interdigital skin. Lesions commonly become infected secondarily. In addition to management of the underlying cause, management of the chronic inflammatory changes in the interdigital skin created by secondary infection and by the release of keratin into deep tissues is required. Fluorescence biomodulation appears to modulate the inflammatory process in dermatological disorders and has shown promise in preliminary studies evaluating its use in superficial and deep pyoderma in dogs. Hypothesis/Objectives To evaluate the effect of a fluorescence biomodulation (FB) system used in conjunction with systemic antibiotic on clinical manifestations of canine interdigital pyoderma (CIP), compared to dogs treated with antibiotic alone. Animals Thirty-six dogs diagnosed with CIP. Methods and materials Dogs were randomly allocated to treatment groups of either antibiotic alone (Group A) or antibiotic plus twice-weekly FB application (Group B). Dogs were scored over a 12 week period on the basis of two measured parameters: a global lesion score composed of four different lesions types and neutrophil engulfing bacterial scores. Results A statistically significant decrease was seen by Week 3 in both measured parameters for Group B compared to Group A. The mean time-to-resolution of lesions was 4.3 weeks in Group B and 10.4 weeks in Group A. Conclusion and clinical importance The FB system shows promise as an adjunct therapy to systemic antibiotic use in the management of CIP.

AB  - Summary In vivo and in vitro studies in the cellular and molecular signaling activations on adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided new insights into their potential clinical applications, particularly for tissue repair and regeneration. This review focuses on these advances, specifically in the context of characterizing MSCs and self-renewal for tissue repair and recovery after diseases. MSCs have been extensively characterized and demonstrated mitigation and therapy on different diseases in human clinical cases and experimental animal models. MSC-based technologies for treating diseases alone or in combination with adjuvants are foreseeable. Current challenges in MSC therapy are the need to overcome cell purity, bioengineering difficulties for tissue structures, optimization of MSC administration protocols, termination of MSC activation after repair and regeneration accomplished, and safety of long-term presence of MSCs in the body.

AB  - Summary:? Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis are chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases with a heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. Both the adaptive and the innate immune systems have been suggested to contribute to their pathogenesis and recovery. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system in mediating demyelinating diseases. In particular, we provide an overview of the anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory functions of dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells, ?δ T cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes. We emphasize the interaction of astroctyes with the immune system and how this interaction relates to the demyelinating pathologies. Given the pivotal role of the innate immune system, it is possible that targeting these cells may provide an effective therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases.
