Effects of inhalable particulate matter on blood coagulation. This issue, pp 662?8. Summary.? Background:?Ambient air pollution is a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, possibly because of alterations in coagulation that influence the arterial circulation. Whether air pollution influences diseases associated with peripheral venous thrombogenesis remains largely unknown. Objectives: To determine the association between air pollution and venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) in a sample of the general population. Methods: A time-series analysis was used to test the association between daily air pollution and VTE hospitalizations in Santiago between 2001 and 2005. Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day of the week and average daily humidex. Results: From a population of 5.4?million, there were, on average, 2.3 admissions for VTE per day. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of hospitalization for venous disease were: 1.07 (1.05, 1.09) for a 58.4?p.p.b. increase in ozone (O3); 1.06 (1.02, 1.09) for a 5.85?p.p.b. increase in sulphur dioxide (SO2); 1.08 (1.03, 1.12) for a 29.25??g/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and 1.05 (1.03, 1.06) for a 20.02??g/m3 increase in particulate matter ≤?2.5??m in mean aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). For pulmonary embolism (PE) results were: 1.10 (1.07, 1.13) for O3; 1.05 (1.02, 1.08) for SO2; 1.07 (1.04, 1.09) for NO2; and 1.05(1.03, 1.06) for PM2.5, respectively. Conclusion: Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis and PE, a disease with a significant fatality rate.

AB  - Summary:? Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis are chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases with a heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. Both the adaptive and the innate immune systems have been suggested to contribute to their pathogenesis and recovery. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system in mediating demyelinating diseases. In particular, we provide an overview of the anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory functions of dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells, ?δ T cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes. We emphasize the interaction of astroctyes with the immune system and how this interaction relates to the demyelinating pathologies. Given the pivotal role of the innate immune system, it is possible that targeting these cells may provide an effective therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases.

AB  - Brain inflammation has been implicated in the development of brain edema and secondary brain damage in ischemia and trauma. Adhesion molecules, cytokines and leukocyte chemoattractants released/presented at the site of blood-brain barrier (BBB) play an important role in mobilizing peripheral inflammatory cells into the brain. Cerebral endothelial cells (CEC) are actively engaged in processes of microvascular stasis and leukocyte infiltration by producing a plethora of pro-inflammatory mediators. When challenged by external stimuli including cytokines and hypoxia, CEC have been shown to release/express various products of arachidonic acid cascade with both vasoactive and pro-inflammatory properties, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These metabolites induce platelet and neutrophil activation and adhesion, changes in local cerebral blood flow and blood rheology, and increases in BBB permeability. Ischemic CEC have also been shown to express and release bioactive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-I?, IL-8 and MCP-1. Many of these mediators and ischemia in vitro and in vivo have been shown to up-regulate the expression of both selectin and Ig-families of adhesion molecules in CEC and to facilitate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration into the brain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a pivotal role of CEC in initiating and regulating inflammatory responses in cerebral ischemia. Summary Inflammatory genes/mediators are involved in molecular/biochemical cascades determining stroke outcome. Cerebral endothelial cells, targeted by inflammatory mediators produced in ischemic brain, undergo pro-inflammatory activation by expressing/secreting various inflammatory mediators, thus becoming a source of inflammation themselves. A unique position of the cerebral endothelial cells at the interface between blood and brain establishes their role as principal regulators of peripheral inflammatory cell recruitment into the brain during stroke. Cerebral endothelial cells also exhibit ability to regulate vasomotor responses of brain microcirculation and the permeability of the BBB, both important components of inflammation. Therefore, approaches to attenuate consequences of stroke must take into consideration cerebral endothelial cells as an easily accessible target to interfere with the ischemic brain inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: Glycosylation of acute-phase proteins (APP), which is partially regulated by cytokines, may be distinct in disease and provide useful tumour markers. Thus, we have examined the glycosylation of major serum APP in pancreatic cancer (PaC), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and control patients. Experimental design: Using a specific anti-sialyl Lewis X antibody and N-glycan sequencing, we have determined glycosylation changes on α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), haptoglobin (HPT), fetuin (FET), α-1-antitrypsin (AT) and transferrin (TRF). Results: Increased levels of sialyl Lewis X (SLex) were detected on AGP in advanced PaC and CP and on HPT, FET, AT and TRF in CP. An increase in N-glycan branching was detected on AGP and HPT in the advanced stage of PaC and CP and on FET and TRF in the CP. A core fucosylated structure was increased on AGP and HPT only in the advanced PaC patients. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Changes in APP SLex and branching are probably associated with an inflammatory response because they were detected in both advanced PaC and CP patients and these conditions give rise to inflammation. On the contrary, the increase in APP core fucosylation could be cancer associated and the presence of this glycoform may give an advantage to the tumour.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the changes in gene expression known up to date that are associated with the application of orthodontic forces to induce orthodontic tooth movement. Histological and immunohistochemical studies have clearly demonstrated that orthodontic forces stimulate remodeling of the periodontal ligament (PDL). The application of orthodontic forces elicits a physical, cellular and molecular response from the PDL for affecting all tissues that constitute the periodontium including blood vessels. In order to achieve tooth movement, remodeling of the alveolar bone surrounding the dental roots is required. Bone remodeling in response to orthodontic forces requires the synchronized action of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and PDL cells. As expected, orthodontic tooth movement evokes a pronounced biological reaction in the dental pulp as well. The pulpal response to orthodontic force involves cell damage, inflammation and wound healing, processes that could adversely affect the dental pulp.

AB  - Abstract The meglitinides offer an opportunity to target specifically the postprandial hyperglycemia that occurs commonly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Their rapid onset and short duration of action leads to more ?physiological? release of insulin and partially restores the pattern of postprandial insulin secretion that is defective in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This potentially allows tighter glycemic control while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. As prandial glucose regulators they allow flexible dosing such that a tablet need only be taken before a patient has a meal. Repaglinide in particular has been shown to reduce HbA1c and is well-tolerated by patients both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents. It appears to have some advantages from head-to-head studies with sulfonylureas. Nateglinide appears to produce a faster early-phase insulin response that gives it the potential to produce less hypoglycemia, but randomized controlled trials in comparison with sulfonylureas are lacking. Both agents are more expensive than sulfonylureas. Formal data regarding cost-effectiveness are not currently available. However, their flexible administration may be of benefit in certain subgroups such as shift-workers and those with flexible lifestyles. Efficacy in early diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance is currently being investigated. The ability to flexibly dose with these agents makes them useful in patients with flexible lifestyles. Macrovascular and microvascular outcome data for the meglitinides are awaited.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis results from a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response induced by allergens. Skin dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the initiation of allergic skin responses. Following encounter with an allergen, DCs become activated and undergo maturation and differentiate into immunostimulatory DCs and are able to present antigens effectively to T cells. The frequency of allergic skin disorders has increased in the past decades. Therefore, the identification of potential sensitizing chemicals is important for skin safety. Traditionally, predictive testing for allergenicity has been conducted in animal models. For regulatory reasons, animal use for sensitization testing of compounds for cosmetic purposes is shortly to be prohibited in Europe. Therefore, new non-animal-based test methods need to be developed. Several DC-based assays have been described to discriminate allergens from irritants. Unfortunately, current in vitro methods are not sufficiently resilient to identify allergens and therefore need refinement. Here, we review the immunobiology of skin DCs (Langerhans? cells and dermal dendritic cells) and their role in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and then explore the possible use of DC-based models for discriminating between allergens and irritants.

A recombinant form of BPI(rBPI21) has been developed and is being tested as atherapeutic agent to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections andexposure to Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. BPI is also a targetantigen of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). BPI-ANCAare present in cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis,and primary sclerosing cholangitis; presence of BPI-ANCA appearsassociated with a higher inflammatory disease activity and greaterorgan damage. BPI-ANCA as well as ANCA directed at otherneutrophil-granule proteins may exacerbate inflammation by nonspecificeffects of extracellular and cell-associated immune complexes. BPI-ANCAmay further worsen inflammation by reducing the ability of BPI topromote clearance of Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial-associatedendotoxin.

AB  - Abstract Early origins of adult disease may be defined as adversity or challenges during early life that alter physiological responses and prime the organism to chronic disease in adult life. Adverse childhood experiences or early life stress (ELS) may be considered a silent independent risk factor capable of predicting future cardiovascular disease risk. Maternal separation (MatSep) provides a suitable model to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which ELS increases the risk to develop cardiovascular disease in adulthood. The aim of this review is to describe the links between behavioural stress early in life and chronic cardiovascular disease risk in adulthood. We will discuss the following: (i) adult cardiovascular outcomes in humans subjected to ELS, (ii) MatSep as an animal model of ELS as well as the limitations and advantages of this model in rodents and (iii) possible ELS-induced mechanisms that predispose individuals to greater cardiovascular risk. Overall, exposure to a behavioural stressor early in life sensitizes the response to a second stressor later in life, thus unmasking an exaggerated cardiovascular dysfunction that may influence quality of life and life expectancy in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract Differentiation inhibiting activity/leukaemia inhibitory factor (DIA/LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine which has been implicated in a variety of developmental and physiological processes in mammals due to its broad range of biological activities in vitro. A role in very early development is suggested by the requirement for DIA/ LIF to support the self-renewal of cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells. Other data point to potential roles in the establishment and maintenance of primordial germ cells, in osteogenesis and in haematopoiesis, and possibly in neuronal specification. DIA/LIF may also act as a mediator of the hepatic acute phase response. In the present study the expression of DIA/LIF transcripts during murine development and in adult mice has been determined using a highly sensitive ribonuclease protection analysis. In contrast to previous reports, it is apparentthat DIA/LIF transcripts are present at low levels in many adult mouse tissues. Higher levels of expression are observed in skin, lung, intestine, and uterus. Elevated amounts of mRNA are also found in certain foetal tissues during late gestation and neonatally. In earlier embryogenesis, however, DIA/LIF mRNA is produced primarily in extraembryonic tissues. The alternative transcripts which produce either soluble or matrix-associated DIA/LIF exhibit overlapping but non-identical patterns of expression, consistent with the proposition that the two isoforms may have distinct biological functions. These findings are suggestive of widespread roles for DIA/LIF in vivo and are discussed in the light of available data on the phenotype of homozygous DIA/LIF-deficient mice. ? 1993Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the often fatal sequelae of a broad range of precipitating conditions. Despite decades of intensive research and clinical trials there remain no therapies in routine clinical practice that target the dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response that characterises ARDS. Neutrophils play a central role in the initiation, propagation and resolution of this complex inflammatory environment by migrating into the lung and executing a variety of pro-inflammatory functions. These include degranulation with liberation of bactericidal proteins, release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species as well as production of neutrophil extracellular traps. Although these functions are advantageous in clearing bacterial infection, the consequence of associated tissue damage, the contribution to worsening acute inflammation and prolonged neutrophil lifespan at sites of inflammation are deleterious. In this review, the importance of the neutrophil will be considered, together with discussion of recent advances in understanding neutrophil function and the factors that influence them throughout the phases of inflammation in ARDS. From a better understanding of neutrophils in this context, potential therapeutic targets are identified and discussed. ? 2018 The Authors.
