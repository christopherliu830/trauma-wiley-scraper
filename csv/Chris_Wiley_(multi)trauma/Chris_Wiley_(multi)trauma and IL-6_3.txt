AB  - Abstract: Cytokines presently known to be involved in systemic bacterial infection are tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) and the counterregulatory molecules soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra). In animal models TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? mediate organ damage, low blood pressure and fatality, whereas IL-6 is involved in infection-related manifestations, like the production of acute-phase protein and fever, and IL-8 is chemotactic to granulocytes. TNF and IL-1 increase expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and influence a number of components of the haemostatic system in favour of coagulation. The presence of cytokines in the circulation is characterized by sequential releases of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6/IL-8; however, many variations of this pattern exist during human infection. In experiments as well as in human infection TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-? have been detected, and levels of TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 have been found to be associated with the severity of the disease. Collectively, TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? emerge as mediators of systemic infection and septic shock whereas IL-6 and IL-8 are related to other manifestations of infection. Counteracting molecules like sTNFR are released after somewhat of a delay following TNF and IL-1Ra is released concomitantly with IL-1. Probably these factors modulate the cytokine effect although their true potency in natural infection has yet to be clarified. In granulocytopenic infections TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 can be detected in scrum, and levels of TNF and IL-6 are even higher than in the normal situation in experimental animals. Antibodies to TNF inhibit bacteria-induced fatality in granulocytopenic mice. Altogether, few data related to the granulocytopenic situation are available. However, it is reasonable to believe that the altered development of granulocytopenic infections is due to changes in the cellular constitution and not to changes in cytokine production.

What are the expectations? Inflammation is a central element of atherogenesis. Innate pathways contribute to vascular inflammation. However, the initial molecular process(es) starting atherogenesis remain elusive. The various risk factors, represented by particular compounds (activators), may cause altered cellular functions in the endothelium (e.g. vascular endothelial cell activation or -dysfunction), in invading cells (e.g. inflammatory mediator production) or in local vessel wall cells (e.g. inflammatory mediators, migration), thereby triggering the innate inflammatory process. The cellular components of innate immunology include granulocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes. Among the molecular innate constituents are innate molecules, such as the toll-like receptors or innate cytokines. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 are among the innate cytokines. Cytokines are potent activators of a great number of cellular functions relevant to maintain or commove homeostasis of the vessel wall. Within the vessel wall, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can significantly contribute to the cytokine-dependent inflammatory network by: (i) production of cytokines, (ii) response to cytokines and (iii) cytokine-mediated interaction with invading leucocytes. The cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are involved in SMC-leucocyte interaction. The IL-6 effects are proposed to be mediated by trans-signalling. Dysregulated cellular functions resulting from dysregulated cytokine production may be the cause of cell accumulation, subsequent low-density lipoprotein accumulation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The deposition of ECM, increased accumulation of leucocytes and altered levels of inflammatory mediators may constitute an ?innate-immunovascular-memory? resulting in an ever-growing response to anew invasion. Thus, SMC-fostered inflammation, promoted by invading innate cells, may be a potent component for development and acceleration of atherosclerosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aging and diabetes are known to be the major cause to affect the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been observed to accumulate in various organs especially in joint tissue and do damage to the joint tissue during aging and diabetes. Synovial angiogenesis and inflammation are observed across the full range of OA severity. The signaling pathway of AGEs on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and inflammatory responses in synoviocytes are still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and the signaling pathway involved in AGEs-induced VEGF production and inflammatory responses in human synoviocytes. Human synoviocytes were cultured and treated with AGEs (25?100?µg/ml). AGEs significantly induced the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and VEGF and the productions of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), VEGF, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) in human synoviocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, AGEs markedly activated the phosphorylations of I?B kinase (IKK)α/?, I?Bα, and nuclear factor (NF)-?B-p65 proteins in human synoviocytes in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with neutralizing antibody for RAGE statistically significantly decreased the AGEs-induced increase in COX-2, VEGF, PGE2, IL-6, and MMP13 and AGEs-activated NF-?B pathway activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that AGEs are capable of inducing VEGF production and inflammatory responses via RAGE-NF-?B pathway activation in human synoviocytes. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients a blunt chest trauma is an important trigger of the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response. There is clinical evidence that fracture healing is delayed in such patients, however, experimental data are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the influence of a thoracic trauma on fracture healing in a rat model. Male Wistar rats received either a blunt chest trauma combined with a femur osteotomy or an isolated osteotomy. A more rigid or a more flexible external fixator was used for fracture stabilization to analyze whether the thoracic trauma influences regular healing and mechanically induced delayed bone healing differently. The blunt chest trauma induced a significant increase of IL-6 serum levels after 6 and 24?h, suggesting the induction of a systemic inflammation, whereas the isolated fracture had no effect. Under a more rigid fixation the thoracic trauma considerably impaired fracture healing after 35 days, reflected by a significantly reduced flexural rigidity (three-point-bending test), as well as a significantly diminished callus volume, moment of inertia, and relative bone surface (µCT analysis). In confirming the clinical evidence, this study reports for the first time that a blunt chest trauma considerably impaired bone healing, possibly via the interaction of the induced systemic inflammation with local inflammatory processes. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Hypercatabolism and immune dysfunction are closely associated with the development of systemic inflammatory response?multiple organ dysfunction (SIRS/MODS) in critical illness. It remains unclear however, whether leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone whose levels are influenced by several cytokines and which regulates immune function, food-intake and energy expenditure is independently related to the development of and/or severity and mortality from SIRS/MODS. DESIGN and PATIENTS To assess the role of leptin in SIRS/MODS we performed a matched case control and a longitudinal study (14?days) in 35 critically ill patients with SIRS/MODS and 35 matched controls. RESULTS Baseline leptin levels were positively associated with body mass index (BMI) and TNF-α (P?<?0·01) in patients and with IGF-1 and IL-6 levels (P?<?0·05) in controls. Furthermore, leptin levels exhibited a progressive increase from the first to the last day of the study and although baseline levels were not different, peak leptin levels as well as leptin levels on the last day of the study were significantly higher in cases than in controls (P?<?0·05). TNF-α levels, IL-6 and cortisol levels were also higher, whereas IGF-1 levels were lower in cases (P?<?0·05). To assess whether leptin levels are independently associated with SIRS/MODS we performed multivariate logistic regression analysis which revealed that leptin up-regulation in cases is mediated by elevated TNF-α and cortisol levels. Finally, there was no independent association between leptin and survival in this group of critically ill patients. CONCLUSION We conclude that cytokines and cortisol upregulate leptin levels, which may contribute to the development of the hypercatabolism, wasting and immune dysfunction but leptin levels are not independently associated with severity or mortality of patients with systemic inflammatory response?multiple organ dysfunction .

AB  - Abstract LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein with the ability to bind and transfer LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as cell wall compounds of other pathogenic bacteria. This soluble pattern-recognition molecule is present in high concentrations in serum and represents an important defense mechanism of the host. Regulation of the hepatic acute-phase response and its termination are important mechanisms for limiting systemic inflammatory activity of the host organism. We show here that TGF-?1, in a dose-dependent fashion, is able to inhibit LBP transcript accumulation and LBP protein synthesis induced by IL-6, IL-1? and dexamethasone in hepatoma cell lines. These data were confirmed employing primary human hepatocytes, where TGF-?1 also inhibited LBP protein synthesis. We identified and analyzed several Smad-binding sites (Smads are major regulatory elements of TGF-?1) within the LBP promoter, and found that one of them was active. We furthermore identified an AP-1-binding site clearly conferring inhibitory effects of TGF-?1 towards LBP promoter activity, shown by gel shift and promoter mutagenesis experiments. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel intervention strategies for the acute-phase response, sepsis, and septic shock.

AB  - Abstract Organs available for solid organ transplantation are mainly procured from brain dead donors. The inflammation associated with brain death may reduce organ quality and increase organ immunogenicity, thus leading to inferior recipient outcome. We hypothesized that the extensive surgical procedure performed during multiorgan procurement enhances the levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers. We measured the levels of 27 cytokines and the terminal complement complex (TCC) in plasma samples from brain dead organ donors (n = 34) drawn before and at three specific time points during procurement surgery. Baseline levels of G-CSF, interferon-?, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), regulated upon activation T cell expressed and secreted, and tumor necrosis factor-α were significantly elevated in brain dead donors compared with normal individuals (n = 14), but they were not associated with time on ventilator or any other registered clinical variable. Notably, the secretion of G-CSF, IL1-ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1?, PDGF, and TCC, the latter reflecting ongoing complement activation, increased significantly during surgery. None of the biomarker increases were correlated with operation duration. Multiorgan procurement surgery significantly adds to the inflammatory response revealed by both pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers associated with brain death. Future studies should determine whether this is associated with inferior recipient outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objective Extracorporeal life support is increasingly used in the treatment of patients presenting with cardiogenic shock or in need of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Identifying therapeutic targets and factors associated with the prognosis are highly desirable. The present study analysed the impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on the outcome of patients undergoing VA ECMO. Methods Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels of 329 patients were analysed prior to, on day 1 and 5 of VA ECMO therapy. IL 6 and 8 serum levels of surviving and non-surviving patients were compared. At time points with significant differences, receiver operating characteristics and cut-off levels were analysed to determine the prognostic value of interleukin serum levels. Survival analysis was performed to compare patients above and below cut-off levels. Results Interleukin 6 serum levels were significantly elevated in non-surviving patients prior to VA ECMO initiation. Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels in non-surviving patients were significantly elevated on day 1 of VA ECMO. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed significant prognostic impact of interleukins 6 and 8 on day 1 of VA ECMO (AUC 0.70 and 0.72). Survival analysis comparing patients above and below cut-off showed a 1 year survival of 32.6% for IL6 and 20.8% for IL8 above, as well as 66.9% for IL6 and 61.9% for IL8 below the cut-off (p<0.05). Conclusion Interleukin 6 and 8 serum levels demonstrated prognostic value early in VA ECMO therapy. The technical applicability of interleukin reduction raises interest in interleukin 6 and 8 as therapeutic targets.

Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) or saline (control) was given to female BALB/cByJ mice for three consecutive days before exposure to the pathogen. For cytokine production, serum and peritoneal fluid were assayed for IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-2 by ELISA at 3, 6, and 9 hr after intraperitoneal infection of the organism. At 6 hr after infection, serum and peritoneal fluid levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-2 were significantly higher in the ibuprofen group. For mortality determination, 73 mice (37 ibuprofen, 36 control) were injected intramuscularly with V. vulnificus. Kaplan?Meier survival curves were analyzed. Survival was significantly decreased by ibuprofen only for the lowest inoculum (25 CFU) of V. vulnificus. Administration of ibuprofen before infection may augment the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus by stimulating cytokine production.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury is the predominant risk factor for post-traumatic osteoarthritis development (PTOA). Several non-invasive mouse models mimicking human PTOA investigate molecular mechanisms of disease development; none have characterized the inflammatory response to this acute traumatic injury. Our aim was to characterize the early inflammatory phase and later degenerative component in our in vivo non-invasive murine model of PTOA induced by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Right knees of 12-week-old C57Bl6 mice were placed in flexion at a 30° offset position and subjected to a single compressive load (12N, 1.4?mm/s) to induce ACL rupture with no obvious damage to surrounding tissues. Tissue was harvested 4?h post-injury and on days 3, 14, and 21; contralateral left knees served as controls. Histological, immunohistochemical, and gene analyzes were performed to evaluate inflammatory and degenerative changes. Immunohistochemistry revealed time-dependent expression of mature (F4/80 positive) and inflammatory (CD11b positive) macrophage populations within the sub-synovial infiltrate, developing osteophytes, and inflammation surrounding the ACL in response to injury. Up-regulation of genes encoding acute pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17, and the matrix degrading enzymes, ADAMTS-4 and MMP3 was detected in femoral cartilage, concomitant with extensive cartilage damage and bone remodelling over 21-days post-injury. Our non-invasive model describes pathologically distinct phases of the disease, increasing our understanding of inflammatory episodes, the tissues/cells producing inflammatory mediators and the early molecular changes in the joint, thereby defining the early phenotype of PTOA. This knowledge will guide appropriate interventions to delay or arrest disease progression following joint injury. ? 2018 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

AB  - Abstract Objectives The soluble form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) was evaluated as an early prognostic marker of sepsis in patients with suspected infection. Design A single-centre prospective cohort study. Methods The cohort comprised 539 patients in the emergency department with suspected infection: 59 without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and without bacterial infection (group 1), 68 with bacterial infection and without SIRS (group 2), 54 with SIRS and without bacterial infection (group 3), 309 with sepsis (SIRS and bacterial infection) and without organ failure (group 4) and 49 with severe sepsis (SIRS, bacterial infection and organ failure) (group 5). suPAR was measured on admission using a commercial solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The median soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) concentrations in groups 1?5 were 4.7, 5.0, 4.4, 4.8 and 7.9 ng mL?1, respectively (P < 0.001). The levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (8.3 vs. 4.9 ng mL?1, P < 0.001) and in patients with severe sepsis (group 5) compared with those in the other groups (7.9 vs. 4.8 ng mL?1, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCROC ) for the prediction of case fatality was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72?0.86, P < 0.0001) and 0.75 for severe sepsis (95% CI: 0.68?0.81, P < 0.0001). At a cut-off level of 6.4 ng mL?1, suPAR had 76% sensitivity and 69% specificity for fatal disease; at a cut-off level of 6.6 ng mL?1, the sensitivity and specificity for severe sepsis were 67% and 72%, respectively. In multivariate models, high suPAR remained an independent predictor of case fatality and severe sepsis after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions A high suPAR level predicts case fatality and severe sepsis in patients with suspected infection.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the potential utility of cytokine and arachidonic acid metabolite levels in ED patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as a predictor of progression to severe sepsis. Methods: A prospective, observational study of test performance was performed using convenience samples of adult control subjects and admitted patients. The latter patients were identified in the ED as having signs of SIRS. Levels of cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites measured from specimens obtained in the ED were compared between groups and associated with the progression of sepsis within 24 hours in the SIRS patients. Results: There were 30 control patients and 29 SIRS patients. There were 8 SIRS subjects who progressed to severe sepsis within 24 hours using the following criteria (hypotension, n = 5; hypoperfusion, n = 1; and organ dysfunction, n = 2). Of the 21 SIRS subjects who did not progress to severe sepsis, 11 had resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours. There were no significant differences in mean mediator levels between the SIRS patients who progressed to severe sepsis and those who did not. Of the 11 patients with resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours, the mean interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was significantly lower than that for the patients who did not recover or who progressed at 24 hours (n = 18); 65.4 ± 49.1 vs 230 ±112 pg/mL, p = 0.001). Six of 15 subjects with IL-6 >150 pg/mL progressed to severe sepsis (p = NS). Using threshold values based on the range of levels for normals, the sensitivity of an abnormal marker for the development of severe sepsis within 24 hours varied from 50% to 87%, while the specificity varied from 11% to 84%. Conclusion: While mean levels were significantly elevated when compared with those of normal control subjects, they had limited ability to predict the subset of patients likely to progress to severe sepsis. However, initial low levels of cytokines may have exclusionary prognostic value. Prospective validation of the latter finding is warranted.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether proinflammatory biomarkers are associated with frailty assessed according to functional status, mobility, mental health, and falls over 24 months. Design Secondary analysis of a 2-year double-blind clinical trial for osteoporosis. Setting Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Participants Women aged 65 and older with osteoporosis in long-term care (LTC) (N = 178). Measurements Baseline serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and soluble receptors (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its two receptors (TNFα-R1 and TNFα-R2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), IL-10), functional status assessed according to activities of daily living, the Nursing Home Physical Performance Test, gait speed, cognitive status, mental health, and falls. Results At baseline, older age was moderately associated with higher serum concentrations of hs-CRP (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.22), TNFα-R1 (r = 0.36), TNFα-R2 (r = 0.34), and IL-10 (r = 0.16) (all P < .05). Frail participants had significantly higher hs-CRP, TNFα-R1, TNFα-R2, IL-6, and IL-6-sR levels (all P < .05) than those nonfrail participants. Higher baseline hs-CRP and IL-6 levels were associated with worse physical performance and gait speed at 12 months independent of age, zoledronic acid use, and comorbidity (|r| = 0.25?0.30; all P < .05). Inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with incident falls. Conclusions Higher proinflammatory biomarker levels are associated with frailty and poorer function and mobility in older women residing in LTC facilities.

AB  - Abstract Aim To test the null hypothesis of association between chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) and plasmatic levels of the C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen in a population of severely hypertensive patients. Methodology One hundred and seventy patients with severe refractory hypertension were selected. All patients were submitted to radiographic, clinical and periodontal evaluation. Plasmatic levels of CRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen were measured on the morning of the first periodontal appointment using commercially available kits. Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to appraise the effect of the co-variables on the plasmatic levels of the inflammatory markers assessed. Results Of the 170 subjects who participated, 105 (61.8%) were females and the median age of the participants was 53 years (range: 40?78). The adjusted multiple linear analyses demonstrated that plasmatic levels of CRP levels were associated with the body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.259, P < 0.001) and residual tooth roots (RTR) (r = 0.191, P = 0.041). IL-6 and fibrinogen levels showed associated with BMI (r = 0.400, P < 0.001 and r = 0.214, P = 0.002 respectively). CAP correlated weakly with CRP (r = 0.250, P = 0.005), IL-6 (r = 0.174, P = 0.020) and fibrinogen (r = 0.393, P < 0.001) levels. Conclusion The null hypothesis was rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis. In other words, the presence of chronic apical periodontitis was associated with higher plasmatic levels of CRP, IL-6 and fibrinogen, in a population of severely hypertensive patients. However, the weak association between CAP and each dependent variable suggests a modest participation of endodontic infection on the plasmatic levels of biomarkers.

AB  - Emerging data suggest that the genetic regulation of the biological response to inflammatory stress may be fundamentally different to the genetic underpinning of the homeostatic control (resting state) of the same biological measures. In this paper, we interrogate this hypothesis using a single-SNP score test and a novel class-level testing strategy to characterize protein-coding gene and regulatory element-level associations with longitudinal biomarker trajectories in response to stimulus. Using the proposed class-level association score statistic for longitudinal data, which accounts for correlations induced by linkage disequilibrium, the genetic underpinnings of evoked dynamic changes in repeatedly measured biomarkers are investigated. The proposed method is applied to data on two biomarkers arising from the Genetics of Evoked Responses to Niacin and Endotoxemia study, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored investigation of the genomics of inflammatory and metabolic responses during low-grade endotoxemia. Our results suggest that the genetic basis of evoked inflammatory response is different than the genetic contributors to resting state, and several potentially novel loci are identified. A simulation study demonstrates appropriate control of type-1 error rates, relative computational efficiency, and power. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background Multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) is reported as a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. Recently, continuous blood purification (CBP) has been mostly applied for MODS treatment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CBP on plasma phospholipid level in patients with MODS. Methods A total of 126 patients with MODS and 120 healthy people were collected. The serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes were detected, and the correlation among phospholipid compounds with serum cytokine levels, blood biochemical parameters, and blood gas indexes was analyzed. Results Before CBP, levels of body temperature, RR, HR, CVP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 were obviously higher, and pH, HCO3-, PaO2, SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 were lower in the MODS group than those in the control group. During CBP, the MODS group had gradually declined RR, CVP, levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, BUN, SCr, PaCO2, SM747, and LPC540 and increased HCO3-, PaO2 and SaO2, PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747. Besides, levels of PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, PC854, PC802, and PG747 had an obvious negative correlation with levels of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, BUN, SCr, and PaCO2, and a significant positive correlation with levels of HCO3-, PaO2, and SaO2. Conclusion CBP could effectively ameliorate clinical signs of patients with MODS and correct the plasma phospholipid levels.

AB  - Abstract Aim Single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) surgery is expanding, but its benefits, efficacy and safety compared with conventional laparoscopic (CL) surgery remain unclear. This pilot study examined clinical outcomes and biochemical markers of inflammation for colorectal resections by SIL and CL in a randomized controlled pilot trial. Method Fifty patients undergoing elective colorectal resection were randomized to either SIL or CL. Primary outcomes were operating time and length of stay (LoS); secondary outcomes included combined length of scars, pain scores, complications, Quality of Life EQ5D-VAS and the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline, 2, 6, 24 and 72 h. Results There was no difference in age, gender, body mass index, indications and site of surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade or incidence of previous surgery between the groups. Except for one conversion from SIL to open surgery, surgery was completed as intended. No difference between SIL and CL was found for operating time [median 130 (72?220) vs 130 (90?317) min, respectively, P = 0.528], LoS [median 4 (3?8) vs 4 (2?19)days, P = 0.888] and time to first flatus [2 (1?4) vs 2 (1?5) days, P = 0.374]. The combined length of scars was significantly shorter for SIL [4 (2?18) vs 7 (5?8) cm, P < 0.001]; in each group, four postoperative complications occurred (16%). Postoperative pain scores were similar [mean 7.67 (interquartile range 4) vs 7.25 (interquartile range 3.75), P = 0.835] to day 3. EQ5D-VAS was no different for both groups at discharge [72.5 (40?90) vs 70 (30?100), P = 0.673] but slightly higher for CL at 3 months [79 (45?100) vs 90 (50?100), P = 0.033].The IL-6, IL-8 and CRP levels between both groups showed similar peaks and no significant differences. Conclusion SIL colorectal surgery by experienced laparoscopic surgeons appears to be safe and equivalent to CL, with no discernible difference in its effect on the physiological response to surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.
