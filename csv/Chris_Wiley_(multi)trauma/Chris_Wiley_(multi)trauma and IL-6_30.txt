AB  - ABSTRACT The elevation of tissue pO2 induced by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a physiological stimulus that elicits a variety of cellular responses. These effects are largely mediated by, or in response to, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). The major consequences of elevated RONS include increased oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant capacity, and modulation of redox-sensitive cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, these phenomena underlie both the therapeutic and potentially toxic effects of HBO. Emerging evidence indicates that supporting mitochondrial health is a potential method of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of, and preventing oxygen toxicity during, HBO. This review will focus on the cellular consequences of HBO, and explore how these processes mediate a delicate balance of cellular protection versus damage. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Early origins of adult disease may be defined as adversity or challenges during early life that alter physiological responses and prime the organism to chronic disease in adult life. Adverse childhood experiences or early life stress (ELS) may be considered a silent independent risk factor capable of predicting future cardiovascular disease risk. Maternal separation (MatSep) provides a suitable model to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which ELS increases the risk to develop cardiovascular disease in adulthood. The aim of this review is to describe the links between behavioural stress early in life and chronic cardiovascular disease risk in adulthood. We will discuss the following: (i) adult cardiovascular outcomes in humans subjected to ELS, (ii) MatSep as an animal model of ELS as well as the limitations and advantages of this model in rodents and (iii) possible ELS-induced mechanisms that predispose individuals to greater cardiovascular risk. Overall, exposure to a behavioural stressor early in life sensitizes the response to a second stressor later in life, thus unmasking an exaggerated cardiovascular dysfunction that may influence quality of life and life expectancy in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the often fatal sequelae of a broad range of precipitating conditions. Despite decades of intensive research and clinical trials there remain no therapies in routine clinical practice that target the dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response that characterises ARDS. Neutrophils play a central role in the initiation, propagation and resolution of this complex inflammatory environment by migrating into the lung and executing a variety of pro-inflammatory functions. These include degranulation with liberation of bactericidal proteins, release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species as well as production of neutrophil extracellular traps. Although these functions are advantageous in clearing bacterial infection, the consequence of associated tissue damage, the contribution to worsening acute inflammation and prolonged neutrophil lifespan at sites of inflammation are deleterious. In this review, the importance of the neutrophil will be considered, together with discussion of recent advances in understanding neutrophil function and the factors that influence them throughout the phases of inflammation in ARDS. From a better understanding of neutrophils in this context, potential therapeutic targets are identified and discussed. ? 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Rationale Many recent studies suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system play a protective role in the impairment of vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cell. Aims The study aims to determine whether tissue kallikrein is efficacy for preventing the long-term in-stent restenosis after stenting of symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery M1 segment. Design This is a Phase II, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial. In line with SAMMPRIS stenting indications, patients (n?=?90) with the symptomatic the middle cerebral artery M1 segment stenosis ≥70% and successfully treated with stent will be enrolled. Eligible patients will be randomized using computer generated numbers, and allocated to receive tissue kallikrein treatment or not. Patients in tissue kallikrein treatment group will be prescribed with intravenous infusion of tissue kallikrein (0·15 PNAU/d, dissolved in 100?ml saline) for 7 days after stenting and then oral administration of pancreatic kallikrein enteric-coated tablet (240?U, 3/d) to the end of study. As the foundation treatment, all the enrolled patients will receive aspirin (100?mg/d), clopidogrel (75?mg/d), and atorvastatin (20?mg/d) for the first 6 months and continue with the combination of aspirin and atorvastatin at the previous dosage. Study outcomes Patients will be evaluated at 1, 6 and 12 months after stenting. The primary outcomes are the in-stent restenosis rate, new stroke or aggravation of the previous ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the severe stenotic artery. Secondary outcomes include stroke of other artery territories, myocardial infarction and vascular death. Modification of stroke knowledge, exercise and diet habit, smoking cessation and available laboratory data will also be recorded. Conclusion As our pilot study, tissue kallikrein would be expected to prevent the long-term in-stent restenosis after stenting of the symptomatic middle cerebral artery dramatically.

AB  - Abstract Laparoscopic colon surgery is gaining acceptance for benign conditions, but cannot yet be considered an established procedure for malignancy. The main reported benefit of the technique is the reduction in length of hospital stay. Other potential benefits such as cosmesis, improvement in quality of life, physiologic and immunologic advantages, as well as reduced complication rates have not been clearly demonstrated. Concerns about laparoscopic colon surgery for cancer including the possibility of inadequate resection, tumor staging, and altered tumor spread due to pneumoperitoneum have only been partially addressed by retrospective and experimental studies and require a prospective randomized trial for definitive resolution. Details of the trial currently underway sponsored by the National Institutes of Health are described. Although innovations in clinical practice and increased familiarity account for the expanding popularity of laparoscopic colon surgery, results from this and similar worldwide trials are needed before this approach can be recommended for cancer.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the principles and physics of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and its current use in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources: Research for this manuscript included current human and veterinary literature. Human-based studies: Human studies of BIA and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MFBIA) have resulted in a considerable amount of controversy about the capability of BIA and MFBIA to accurately assess exact fluid volume and distribution. The recent emphasis on point-of-care monitoring has resulted in the use of BIA and MFBIA to evaluate the rapid changes in fluid distribution that can occur with trauma and various disease states. Veterinary-based studies: The use of BIA and MFBIA has been limited in veterinary medicine. However, studies in domestic and laboratory animals have shown good correlation with the isotope dilution method. The effectiveness of BIA/MFBIA in monitoring the critically ill veterinary patient has not yet been evaluated. Conclusion: BIA and MFBIA have been used to evaluate a variety of biological parameters such as nutritional status, cardiac output, and intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes. Recent studies using BIA and MFBIA to evaluate fluid compartmentalization and shifts in critically ill human patients have shown promising results. BIA and MFBIA provide immediate results that may aid in the assessment of a patient's clinical progress and response to therapy.

AB  - Abstract Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute gastrointestinal disorder that is the most common and requiring emergency hospitalization. Its incidence is increasing worldwide, thus increasing the burden of medical services. Approximately 20% of the patients develop moderate to severe necrotizing pancreatitis associated with pancreatic or peri-pancreatic tissue necrosis and multiple organ failure. There are many reports about the anti-inflammatory effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on pancreatitis and the repair of tissue damage. MSCs cells come from a wide range of sources, autologous MSCs come from bone marrow and allogeneic MSCs such as umbilical cord blood MSCs, placenta-derived MSCs, etc. The wide source is not only an advantage of MSCs but also a disadvantage of MSCs. Because of different cell sources and different methods of collection and preparation, it is impossible to establish a unified standard method for evaluation of efficacy. The biggest advantage of iMSCs is that it can be prepared by a standardized process, and can be prepared on a large scale, which makes it easier to commercialize. This paper reviews the present status of diagnosis and progress of MSCs therapy for AP.

AB  - Abstract Objective Pain medicine still lacks mechanism-specific biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment, and defective top-down modulation is an important factor in the pathophysiology of chronic pain conditions. Using modern analytical tools and advanced multivariate statistical analysis, the aim of this study was to revisit two classical potential biomarkers of pro- and anti-nociception in humans (substance P and beta-endorphin), focusing particularly on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Design Cross-sectional, comparative, observational study. Subjects Patients with chronic, post-traumatic and/or post-surgical, neuropathic pain refractory to conventional treatment (N?=?15) and healthy controls (N?=?19) were included. Methods Samples were taken from CSF and blood, and levels of substance P and beta-endorphin were investigated using a Luminex technology kit. Results We found low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF of neuropathic pain patients (66?±?11?pcg/mL) compared with healthy controls (115?±?14?pcg/mL) (P?=?0.017). Substance P levels in the CSF did not differ (20?±?2?pcg/mL, 26?±?2, P?=?0.08). However, our multivariate data analysis showed that belonging to the patient group was associated with low levels of both substances in the CSF. A higher correlation between the levels of beta-endorphin and substance P in CSF was found in healthy controls than in patients (rs?=?0.725, P?<?0.001 vs rs?=?0.574, P?=?0.032). Conclusions Patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to trauma or surgery had low levels of beta-endorphin in the CSF. We speculate that this could indicate a defective top-down modulation of pain in chronic neuropathic pain. Our results also illustrate the importance of taking a system-wide, multivariate approach when searching for biomarkers.
