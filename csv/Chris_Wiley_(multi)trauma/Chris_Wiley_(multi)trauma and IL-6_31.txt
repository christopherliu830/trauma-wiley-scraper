AB  - Abstract Stimulator of interferons genes (STING) is an adaptor protein that plays a critical role in the secretion of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to cytosolic nucleic acid. Recent research indicates the involvement of the STING pathway in uncontrolled inflammation, sepsis, and shock. STING signaling is significantly up-regulated in human sepsis, and STING agonists are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis and shock. Nevertheless, little is known about the consequences of activated STING-mediated signaling during sepsis. It has been shown that aberrant activation of the STING-dependent way can result in increased inflammation, type I interferons responses, and cell death (including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis). In addition, autophagy modulation has been demonstrated to protect against multiple organs injuries in animal sepsis model. However, impaired autophagy may contribute to the aberrant activation of STING signaling, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and cell death. Here we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in the understanding of STING signaling, focusing on the regulatory mechanisms and the roles of this pathway in sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed at exploring changes in YAP expression and their effect on periodontitis (PD) combined with traumatic occlusion (TO). Materials and Methods BALB/cJ mice were used to establish a PD model by local administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g, ATCC 33277) and a TO model by occlusal elevation (OE) using composite resin bonding on the bilateral maxillary molar. The mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) and pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) were subjected to cyclic tensile/compressive stress and inflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli) to verify in vivo results. Results Severe bone resorption was observed by microCT scanning in OE with P.g group, when compared to OE only and P.g only groups. Mechanical stress caused by OE activated the Hippo-YAP pathway in periodontal tissues and upregulated the expression of JNK/AP-1. OE with P.g further promoted the expression of YAP and JNK/AP1, leading to the upregulation of the JNK/AP-1 related inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL6. Similar results were obtained when osteoblasts were subjected to mechanical stress in vitro. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that periodontitis with TO caused severe inflammation-induced bone resorption. Activation of YAP and upregulation of JNK/AP-1 induced by TO potentially aggravated the symptoms of PD.

AB  - Abstract Traumatized muscle, such as that debrided from blast injury sites, is considered a promising and convenient tissue source for multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs), a population of adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells. The present study aimed to assess the regenerative therapeutic potential of human traumatized muscle-derived MPCs, e.g., for injury repair in the blast-traumatized extremity, by comparing their pro-angiogenic potential in vitro and capillary recruitment activity in vivo to those of MSCs isolated from human bone marrow, a widely-used tissue source. MPCs were tested for their direct and indirect effects on human microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. The findings reported here showed that MPC-conditioned culture medium (MPC-CM), like MSC-CM, promoted EC-cord network branching. Silent (si)RNA-mediated silencing of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in MPCs attenuated this effect. In a chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane in vivo angiogenesis assay, MPCs encapsulated in photocrosslinked gelatin scaffold recruited blood vessels more efficiently than either MSCs or human foreskin fibroblasts. Together, these findings support the potential application of traumatized muscle-derived MPCs in cell-based regenerative medicine therapies as a result of their influence on EC organization.

AB  - Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common and poses a significant problem in high-risk populations. In most cases, ICD resolves despite continued exposure in a process known as ?hardening?, allowing individuals to continue with their work. Those who cannot clear ICD develop chronic ICD, which is a significant source of emotional, physical, and financial distress for affected individuals. While hardening is well known among labourers and clinicians, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much can be learned from the study of self-healing processes like the hardening phenomenon. This overview briefly documents the pathogenesis of ICD, focuses on the latest advances pertaining to the hardening phenomenon in ICD, and then highlights potential avenues of productive research. A better understanding of the ?hardening? process in the skin will hopefully lead to advances for the treatment of ICD.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To determine if C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration is elevated in spontaneously occurring canine acute pancreatitis (AP), and to measure changes in CRP during the course of hospitalization. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine Foster Hospital for Small Animals. Animals: Sixteen client-owned dogs with AP and 16 healthy controls. Interventions: Blood samples were obtained from the AP group on the day of diagnosis (Day 1), and on Days 3 and 5, unless the dog died or was discharged from the hospital. Blood was obtained from the control dogs once. Measurements and main results: Serum CRP was measured using a commercial immunoassay for each dog with AP and for healthy controls. Day 1 CRP concentrations were significantly higher in the AP group (56.1Â±12.7??g/mL) compared with controls (2.8Â±1.3??g/mL; P<0.001). For the 7 dogs that had samples collected on all 3 days, the mean CRP concentrations decreased significantly (P=0.043) over the 5 days of measurement. Of the 16 dogs with AP, 14 were discharged from the hospital and 2 were euthanized. Conclusions: Serum CRP concentrations were elevated in this group of 16 dogs with spontaneously occurring AP. In the 7 dogs that had measurements on all 3 days, the mean CRP concentration decreased from the day of diagnosis to the measurement made 5 days later.

AB  - Abstract Cortisol - the end product of the HPA axis - has widely been viewed as a stress biomarker, and has been shown to be particularly sensitive to social stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Culture shapes the social and emotional worlds that individuals inhabit, and thus scaffolds stressful experiences, their meaning, and their subsequent effects on the health and functioning of a person. Despite the wealth of research in these two disparate areas, there is a relative scarcity of empirical work investigating the cultural shaping of the associations between social experiences, emotion regulation, and the HPA axis. The paucity of the literature precludes systematic quantitative analyses (e.g., meta-analyses). Instead, we review the state of the science as found in this growing body of literature, encourage researchers to tap into the vast potential of the HPA axis to illuminate the complex interplay of culture, relationships, and stress physiology, and put forth theoretical and methodological recommendations for future research.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews available reports that reveal details of the biological responses of paradental tissues and cells to applications of mechanical forces in vitro and in vivo. A review of bone cell biology as related to orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) has identified the osteoblasts as the cells that control both the resorptive and formative phases of the remodeling cycle. The main cellular and tissue reactions to orthodontic forces were perceived as being limited predominantly to the alveolar bone and periodontal ligament (PDL). However, the findings summarized in the chapter have demonstrated that orthodontic forces are transmitted to all dental and paradental tissues, both mineralized and non-mineralized, whose cells contain mechanosensing molecules and structures capable of responding to force-induced physical changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Orthodontics entails reactions and interactions between several systems and cell types to applied mechanical forces to teeth.

AB  - Abstract Hemopoiesis-stimulating activity of various recombinant human colony-stimulating factors (rhCSFs) has been studied in four different preclinical animal models. The CSFs used were erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CSF, granulocyte (G) CSF, interleukin (IL) 3, IL-1?, and mast cell growth factor (MGF) or stem cell factor (SCF). Emphasis was placed on effects induced by combination treatment with varied pairs of the factors. Dogs and primates were chosen because of evidence of efficacy from earlier studies with the single recombinant human factors alone. The animal models chosen were: 1) isovolemic hemodilution to a hematocrit of 10% (or 20%) of dogs, splenectomized at least three months before start of the study. Additionally, the animals had been primed with Epo (or Epo plus IL-3) on three days daily or five days every other day before hemodilution. 2) Total body irradiation (TBI) of dogs (2.4 Gy) followed by daily treatment with IL-1? (d1-7) plus Epo administered daily over three weeks. 3) TBI of rhesus monkeys (4.5 Gy) and daily treatment with IL-3 and GM-CSF over three weeks. 4) Treatment of healthy normal cynomolgus monkeys with various factor combinations over about two or three weeks. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Priming with Epo before blood loss (withdrawal) allows a strikingly enhanced recovery of hematocrit and other hematological parameters. Further evaluation of the role of concomitantly applied CSFs (e.g., IL-3, GM-CSF or G-CSF) on the restoration of immune functions would be desirable. 2) Single CSFs and preferentially factor combinations are valuable agents to reduce irradiation injury and to enhance recovery from bone marrow hypoplasia. 3) Treatment of healthy animals with selected CSF combinations results in a stronger hemopoietic stimulation than with single factors alone. Some particular combinations even stimulate platelet production, e.g., IL-3/GM-CSF, GM-CSF/Epo or G-CSF/IL-3. The results obtained indicate that stimulatory responses of hemopoiesis in normal animals cannot always be compared with the effects seen in compromised animals. It is assumed that the preclinical data obtained in compromised animals may perhaps more realistically reflect what is eventually to be expected in future clinical studies.
