AB  - Abstract Localized tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) elevation has diverse effects in brain injury often attributed to signaling via TNFp55 or TNFp75 receptors. Both dentate granule cells and CA pyramidal cells express TNF receptors (TNFR) at low levels in a punctate pattern. Using a model to induce selective death of dentate granule cells (trimethyltin; 2?mg/kg, i.p.), neuronal apoptosis [terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ end labeling, active caspase 3 (AC3)] was accompanied by amoeboid microglia and elevated TNFα mRNA levels. TNFp55R (55?kDa type-1 TNFR) and TNFp75R (75?kDa type-2 TNFR) immunoreactivity in AC3+ neurons displayed a pattern suggestive of receptor internalization and a temporal sequence of expression of TNFp55R followed by TNFp75R associated with the progression of apoptosis. A distinct ramified microglia response occurred around CA1 neurons and healthy dentate neurons that displayed an increase in the normal punctate pattern of TNFRs. Neuronal damage was decreased with i.c.v. injection of TNFα antibody and in TNFp55R?/?p75R?/? mice that showed higher constitutive mRNA levels for interleukin (IL-1α), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), TNFα, transforming growth factor ?1, Fas, and TNFRSF6-assoicated via death domain (FADD). TNFp75R?/? mice showed exacerbated injury and elevated mRNA levels for IL-1α, MIP-1α, and TNFα. In TNFp55R?/? mice, constitutive mRNA levels for TNFα, IL-6, caspase 8, FADD, and Fas-associated phosphatase were higher; IL-1α, MIP-1α, and transforming growth factor ?1 lower. The mice displayed exacerbated neuronal death, delayed microglia response, increased FADD and TNFp75R mRNA levels, and co-expression of TNFp75R in AC3+ neurons. The data demonstrate TNFR-mediated apoptotic death of dentate granule neurons utilizing both TNFRs and suggest a TNFp75R-mediated apoptosis in the absence of normal TNFp55R activity.

AB  - Abstract Natural molecules, such as flavonoid, are very welcome strategies to modulate bone turnover. This prompted us to comprehend better the effect of silibinin on osteoblast metabolism, mainly considering intracellular pathways able to drive cell adhesion to differentiation. By exploring in vitro approaches, our data show a modulatory effect of the silibinin (200??g/mL) on the osteoblast intracellular signaling, contributing with decisive pathways governing cell adhesion, differentiation, and further mineralization, recapitulating important stages of osteogenesis. Within the first 24?hours of adhesion (acute stage), osteoblasts respond to silibinin by rearranging their cytoskeleton and start mechanisms responsible to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which reach intense profile at 28 days of treatment (chronic stage) by favoring matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs-2, and -9) activities, concomitant to mineralizing phenotype. Importantly, silibinin seems to reprogram genes related to inflammatory landscape and significantly upmodulating osteoprotegerin (>25 fold-changes), signaling molecule involved with osteoclastogenesis. Altogether, our results show for the first time that silibinin drives in vitro osteoblast differentiation by requiring specific intracellular signaling. In conjunction, this molecular landscape contributes to understand the effect of silibinin on osteoblasts performance and open novel therapeutic possibilities to silibinin in bone disorders, such as osteoporosis.

Abstract Aim: To compare histopathological characteristics of peri-implantitis and periodontitis lesions. Methods: A search was conducted on publications up to July 2010. Studies carried out on human biopsy material and animal experiments were considered. Results: While comprehensive information exists regarding histopathological characteristics of human periodontitis lesions, few studies evaluated peri-implantitis lesions in human biopsy material. Experimental peri-implantitis lesions were evaluated in 10 studies and three of the studies included comparisons to experimental periodontitis. Human biopsy material: the apical extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate (ICT) was more pronounced in peri-implantitis than in periodontitis and was in most cases located apical of the pocket epithelium. Plasma cells and lymphocytes dominated among cells in both types of lesions, whereas neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages occurred in larger proportions in peri-implantitis. Experimental studies: placement of ligatures together with plaque formation resulted in loss of supporting tissues and large ICTs around implants and teeth. Following ligature removal, a ?self-limiting? process occurred in the tissues around teeth with a connective tissue capsule that separated the ICT from bone, while in peri-implant tissues the ICT extended to the bone crest. Conclusion: Despite similarities regarding clinical features and aetiology of peri-implantitis and periodontitis, critical histopathological differences exist between the two lesions.

AB  - ABSTRACT The bone is an amazing organ that grows and remodels itself over a lifetime. It is generally accepted that bone sculpting in response to stress and force is carried out by groups of cells contained within bone multicellular units that are coordinated to degrade existing bone and form new bone. Because of the nature of bone and the extensiveness of the skeleton, it is difficult to study bone remodeling in vivo. On the other hand, because the bone contains a complex environment of many cell types, is it possible to study bone remodeling in vitro? We propose that one can at minimum study the interaction between osteoblasts (bone formation) and osteoclasts (bone degradation) in a three dimensional (3D) ?bioreactor?. Furthermore, one can add bone degrading metastatic cancer cells, and study how they contribute to and take part in the bone degradation process. We have primarily cultured and differentiated MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts for long periods (2?10 months) before addition of bone marrow osteoclasts and/or metastatic (MDA-MB-231), metastasis suppressed (MDA-MB-231BRMS1) or non-metastatic (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. In the co-culture of osteoblasts and osteoclasts there was clear evidence of matrix degradation. Loss of matrix was also evident after co-culture with metastatic breast cancer cells. Tri?culture permitted an evaluation of the interaction of the three cell types. The 3D system holds promise for further studies of cancer dormancy, hormone, and cytokine effects and matrix manipulation. J. Cell. Biochem. 116: 2715?2723, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether past history of depression is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, and whether history of gestational diabetes is associated with increased rates of postpartum depression. Research design Data for this case?control study consisted of de-identified chart records for 1439 women who received pregnancy care at a large university hospital between 1998 and 2017. Results A history of depression prior to pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes requiring insulin, although not with subtler degrees of gestational hyperglycemia. Diabetes in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Trauma history was associated with both impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy and postpartum depression. Conclusions Past episodes of depression increase risk for the most severe form of gestational diabetes; however, gestational diabetes does not contribute significantly to risk for postpartum depression. This suggests a unidirectional association, unlike the bidirectional association of diabetes with depression among the general population. History of trauma increases risk for both gestational hyperglycemia and postpartum depression, suggesting important health effects of trauma that may differ measurably from those associated with depression.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Abnormal activation of NF-?B signalling is a major mechanism of apoptosis resistance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Therefore, better understanding of the regulation of NF-?B signalling has a significant impact for GBM therapy. Here, we uncovered a critical role of the small GTPase RND3 in regulating the p65 subunit of NF-?B and NF-?B signalling in GBM. Materials and methods Human GBM samples, GBM cells and a human orthotopic GBM-xenografted animal model were used. The mechanisms of RND3 in regulation of NF-?B signalling and GBM cell apoptosis were examined by luciferase assay, quantitative PCR, immunostaining, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, TUNEL staining, JC-1 analysis and flow cytometry. Results Overexpression of RND3 led to reduced p65 activity in GBM-cultured cells and a GBM animal model, indicating that the NF-?B pathway is negatively regulated by RND3 in GBM. Mechanistically, we found that RND3 bound p65 and promoted p65 ubiquitination, leading to decreased p65 protein levels. Furthermore, RND3 enhanced cleaved caspase 3 levels and promoted apoptosis in GBM cells, and RND3 expression was positively correlated with cleaved caspase 3 and IL-8 in human GBM samples. The effect of RND3 on promoting apoptosis disappeared when p65 ubiquitination was blocked by protease inhibitor carfilzomib or upon co-expression of ectopic p65. Conclusions RND3 binds p65 protein and promotes its ubiquitination, resulting in reduced p65 protein expression and inhibition of NF-?B signalling to induce GBM cell apoptosis.

AB  - Inflammatory and immune responses play important roles following ischaemic stroke. Inflammatory responses contribute to damage and also contribute to repair. Injury to tissue triggers an immune response. This is initiated through activation of the innate immune system. In stroke there is microglial activation. This is followed by an influx of lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain, triggered by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory response contributes to further tissue injury. There is also a systemic immune response to stroke, and there is a degree of immunosuppression that may contribute to the stroke patient's risk of infection. This immunosuppressive response may also be protective, with regulatory lymphocytes producing cytokines and growth factors that are neuroprotective. The specific targets of the immune response after stroke are not known, and the details of the immune and inflammatory responses are only partly understood. The role of inflammation and immune responses after stroke is twofold. The immune system may contribute to damage after stroke, but may also contribute to repair processes. The possibility that some of the immune response after stroke may be neuroprotective is exciting and suggests that deliberate enhancement of these responses may be a therapeutic option.
