AB  - Abstract The incidence of NHL has increased dramatically since at least the 1950s, and during this timeframe there has been a major increase in the use of blood transfusions, invasive surgical procedures and anesthesia, all of which can impact immune function. We evaluated these factors with NHL risk in a population-based study of 759 cases and 589 frequency-matched controls. Risk factor data were collected during in-person interviews. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs, adjusted for the matching factors. History of transfusion was associated with a 26% higher risk of NHL (95% CI 0.91?1.73), and the elevated risk was specific to transfusions first given 5?29 years before the reference date (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.08?2.62) and transfusions given for a medical condition (OR = 2.09; 95% CI 1.03?4.26). The total number of surgeries and dental procedures (OR = 1.53 for 26+ surgeries compared to 0?6; 95% CI 1.02?2.29) and to a lesser extent the total number of exposures to general or local/regional anesthesia (OR = 1.35 for 24+ times compared to 0?6; 95% CI 0.91?2.02) were positively associated with risk of NHL. Inclusion of transfusion and surgery or transfusion and anesthesia in the same model did not attenuate these associations. All results were broadly consistent for both DLBCL and follicular subtypes. Blood transfusions were associated with NHL risk, but appear to be a marker for underlying medical conditions. Multiple surgical procedures and/or repeated administration of anesthesia have not been previously reported to be associated with risk of NHL and these exposures warrant further evaluation.

AB  - Ageing is associated with a slow, but progressive muscle weakness, which is largely attributable to muscle wasting. A diminished function of satellite cells at old age may hamper preservation and repair from (contraction)-induced injury and contribute to the age-related muscle wasting. Satellite cell function may be affected by circulating factors, as muscle regeneration in old mice sharing the circulation of young mice is not impaired. Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in old organisms may be that environmental factor. Indeed, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) negatively affects the muscle regenerating capacity. TNFα destabilizes MyoD, a muscle-specific transcription factor involved in satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, and induces apoptosis of satellite cells, particularly at old age. Here it is proposed that some of these effects are mediated by TNFα-induced expression of inhibitors of differentiation proteins. Yet, the increase in TNFα during the normal inflammatory response helps, rather than impairs, the repair process. This apparent contradiction may be resolved by the fact that the effects of TNFα are concentration and time dependent. Thus, the negative effect of systemic inflammation on muscle strength at old age may only become apparent when it exceeds a certain threshold and persists for a prolonged period.

AB  - Summary Postnatal neural development is characterized by rapid changes in neuronal and glial numbers and vast modifications in synaptic numbers, types, and distributions. A number of toxic substances have been linked to developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The etiologies proposed for ASD show the same general range as those proposed for the well-known neurological disorders associated with aging, such as Parkinson's disease, ALS, and Alzheimer's disease. The 'fetal basis of adult disease' (FeBAD) hypothesis postulates that certain events occurring during prenatal life have a profound, but delayed, impact in later adult life. Autism and related disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by dysfunctional immune function, stereotypic behaviors, and various degrees of impairment in social skills and verbal communication. The chapter also talks about mature central nervous system (CNS) disorders and the impact of toxic molecules. One emerging area in which the FeBAD hypothesis may have the most weight is studies of ASD and schizophrenia.

AB  - Summary We report the case of a 38?year-old woman who presented initially as the driver in a road traffic accident with a Glasgow Coma Score of 14, agitated, tachycardic, tachypnoeic and hypertensive. The combination of an abdominal CT scan and clinical findings led to the decision to perform an emergency laparotomy. Her persisting symptoms and laboratory results revealed her to be manifesting acute thyroid storm; TSH of <?0.10?IU.l?1, free T4 of 59.8?pmol.l?1 and free T3 of 20.20?pmol.l?1.

AB  - Abstract Various bacterial components (e.g., endotoxin, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycans, DNA) induce or enhance inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system and/or are directly toxic in eukariotic cells (e.g., hemolysins). When antibiotics which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis kill bacteria, smaller quantities of proinflammatory or toxic compounds are released in vitro and in vivo than during killing of bacteria by ?-lactams and other cell-wall active drugs. In general, high antibiotic concentrations liberate lower quantities of bacterial proinflammatory or toxic compounds than concentrations close to the minimum inhibitory concentration. In animal models of Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis/sepsis and of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, a lower release of proinflammatory bacterial compounds was associated with a reduced mortality or neuronal injury. Pre-treatment with a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor reduced the strong release of bacterial products usually observed during treatment with a ?-lactam antibiotic. Data available strongly encourage clinical trials comparing antibiotic regimens with different release of proinflammatory/toxic bacterial products. The benefit of the approach to reduce the liberation of bacterial products should be greatest in patients with a high bacterial load.
