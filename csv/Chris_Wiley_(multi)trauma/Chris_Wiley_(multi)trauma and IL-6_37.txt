AB  - Abstract:? The cornea epithelium responds to injury by synthesizing several cytokines, growth factors, and tissue remodeling molecules. Proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the inflammation that follows corneal epithelial injury and cytokine-mediated processes play a significant role in corneal epithelial wound healing. Poorly regulated corneal inflammatory reactions that occur after injury can retard healing. In turn, persistent corneal epithelial defects and inflammation may lead to ocular morbidity and permanent visual loss. Therefore, treatments with agents that enhance corneal reepithelialization and regulate the inflammatory response without the deleterious side effects of currently used agents, such as corticosteroids, would result in improved clinical outcome and would represent a major advance in the field. Evidence is mounting to support the idea that thymosin ?-4 (T?-4) has multiple, seemingly diverse, cellular functions. In the cornea, as in other tissues, T?-4 promotes cell migration and wound healing, has anti-inflammatory properties, and suppresses apoptosis. Prior studies from our laboratory have demonstrated the potent wound healing and anti-inflammatory effects of T?-4 in numerous models of corneal injury. Recently, we demonstrated that T?-4 suppresses the activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa b (NF-?B) in TNF-α-stimulated cells. TNF-α initiates cell signaling pathways that converge on the activation of NF-?B, thus both are known mediators of the inflammatory process. These results have important clinical implications for the potential role of T?-4 as a corneal anti-inflammatory and wound-healing agent.

AB  - Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases numerous factors and adipokines with paracrine effects on both vascular structure and function. These effects are variable as they depend on regional differences in PVAT among blood vessels and vary with changes in adiposity. There is considerable evidence demonstrating an association between coronary PVAT and the development and progression of coronary artery disease, which is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling and blood clotting. However, PVAT also has a protective role in vascular grafts, especially the no-touch saphenous vein, in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass. This beneficial influence of PVAT involves factors such as adipocyte-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide (NO), leptin, adiponectin, prostanoids, hydrogen sulphide and neurotransmitters, as well as mechanical protection. This article aims to highlight and compare the dual role of PVAT in the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis, as well as in increased graft patency. Different deleterious and protective mechanisms of PVAT are also discussed and the inside-outside signalling paradigm of atherosclerosis development re-evaluated. The bidirectional communication between the arterial and venous wall and their surrounding PVAT, where signals originating from the vascular wall or lumen can affect PVAT phenotype, has been shown to be very complex. Moreover, signals from PVAT also influence the structure and function of the vascular wall in a paracrine manner.

AB  - Summary Most infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women escape HIV infection. Infants evade infection despite an immature immune system and, in the case of breastfeeding, prolonged repetitive exposure. If infants become infected, the course of their infection and response to treatment differs dramatically depending upon the timing (in utero, intrapartum, or during breastfeeding) and potentially the route of their infection. Perinatally acquired HIV infection occurs during a critical window of immune development. HIV's perturbation of this dynamic process may account for the striking age-dependent differences in HIV disease progression. HIV infection also profoundly disrupts the maternal immune system upon which infants rely for protection and immune instruction. Therefore, it is not surprising that infants who escape HIV infection still suffer adverse effects. In this review, we highlight the unique aspects of pediatric HIV transmission and pathogenesis with a focus on mechanisms by which HIV infection during immune ontogeny may allow discovery of key elements for protection and control from HIV.
