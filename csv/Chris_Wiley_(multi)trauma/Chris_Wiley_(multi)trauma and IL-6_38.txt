AB  - Abstract Background/Aims: Patients with coagulation factor disorders require lifelong symptomatic treatment. This is associated with limited efficacy and transmission risks. From a clinical point of view, hepatocyte transplantation offers a rational alternative but is currently being hampered by lack of functional stability of engrafted cells. It was the aim of our study to devise culture conditions providing stable cell polarity, attachment and growth factor stimulation to improve longevity and coagulation factor production. Methods: Human hepatocytes (HC) were plated on different extracellular matrices, inside collagen gel or Matrigel. HC were grown inside growth factor-enriched serum-free medium (SFM) or exposed to media switching from differentiation (DM) to dedifferentiation (DeDM). Results: Over more than 30 days in vitro human HC synthesized coagulation factors (factors VII, VIII, IX, fibrinogen) and coagulation inhibitors (antithrombin III, protein C). Protein synthesis was augmented when HC were grown inside a 3D collagen type I matrix, while Matrigel showed no additional benefit. Soluble growth factors improved coagulation factor production when applied in SFM or in sequential DM/DeDM. Coagulation factor levels ranged from 3% to 12% in the first week to 2.5?5% after 4 weeks, reaching biologically relevant levels. Conclusion: Preserved synthesis and secretion of coagulation factors in balanced proportion by human HC in this model may offer new perspectives for HC transplantation in coagulation defects of patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Sarcopenia is linked to functional impairments, loss of independence, and mortality. In the past few years, obesity has been established as being a risk factor for a decline in muscle mass and function. There are several molecular pathological mechanisms, which have been under discussion that might explain this relationship. However, most studies were conducted using male animals and for a short period of time. Methods In this study, the gender-specific effect of long-term, high-fat content feeding in Sprague?Dawley rats was examined. Development of the quadriceps muscle of the animals was monitored in vivo using magnetic resonance. The results of these measurements and of the biochemical analysis of the aged muscle were compared. Results Surprisingly, only male but not female rats showed a decline in muscle cross-sectional area at 16 months of age as a result of a chronic oversupply of dietary fats. This loss of muscle mass could not be explained by either de-regulation of the anabolic Akt pathway or by up-regulation of the main ubiquitin ligases of muscle, MAFbx and MuRF-1. However, fusion of satellite cells to myotubes was induced by the high-fat diet in male rats, possibly as a result of an increased need for compensatory regeneration processes. Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis induction, irrespective of diet, seems to be the major determinant of muscle decline during ageing in male but not female rats. Conclusion Taken together, activation of the apoptosis-inducing Caspase-3 seems to be the most important trigger for the age-related muscle loss. Male rats were more prone to the decline of muscle during ageing than female animals, which was further enforced by a long-term, high fat diet.

AB  - Summary Inflammation is an overall protective response and can be defined as a cellular and non specific immune response to irritation, injury, or infection leading to the local accumulation of leukocytes and fluid. In intensive farming conditions, fish are usually transported, sorted, vaccinated and subjected to stressful handling procedures which may potentially lead to local inflammation and affect the integrity of the spine. The present mini-review aims to introduce the reader in the field of spinal deformities in salmon, propose inflammation as a risk factor for spinal deformities and emphasize the need for conducting further research in the area having an integrated and multidisciplinary perspective.

AB  - Summary 1. The role of satellite cells in muscle growth during development is well documented, but the involvement of these cells in muscle repair after contusion is less well known. In the present study, we investigated the time-course of satellite cell activity (from 3?h to 7?days) after contusion of rat gastrocnemius muscle using specific molecular markers for immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 2. Inflammation of the injured muscle occurred within 6?h, followed by disintegration of the damaged myofibres within 12?h. Newly formed myofibres appeared by Day 7. 3. The number of MyoD-positive nuclei (activated satellite cells) in the injured muscle was significantly increased by 6?h, reaching a maximum by 12?h after contusion. However, the number of MyoD-positive nuclei decreased towards control levels by Day 7. Changes in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labelled nuclei (proliferating satellite cells) paralleled the changes seen in the number of MyoD-positive nuclei. Conversely, expression of myogenin protein was not apparent until Day 3 and increased further by Day 7. Colabelling of MyoD and myogenin was seen in only a few cells. 4. The time-course of MyoD mRNA expression corresponded with MyoD protein expression. However, there were two peaks in myogenin mRNA expression: 6?h and Day 7 after contusion. The second peak coincided with upregulation of myostatin mRNA levels. 5. The results of the present study suggest that contusion activates a homogeneous population of satellite cells to proliferate within 3?days, followed by differentiation to form new myofibres. The latter may be regulated, in part, by myostatin.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of horses with lymphoma are often nonspecific and dependent on the organ system affected. At the present time, the prognosis for all forms of equine lymphoma is grave, but palliative therapies including surgical excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are available and have been reported with varying degrees of success to improve quality of life and prolong survival time. Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with equine lymphoma are uncommon, and are thought to be the result of soluble polypeptide hormones secreted by tumor cells. Definitive diagnosis of lymphoma can be obtained antemortem through identification of neoplastic lymphocytes in tissues, fluids, aspirates, or peripheral blood. Response to chemotherapy is highly variable, with some horses displaying dramatic improvement within 2-4 months of initiating induction protocols and remaining in remission for several months, while others show only modest or no response, regardless of treatment protocol.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is involved in the regulation of many essential processes, especially metabolic homeostasis. SIRT6 knockout mice undergo premature aging and die at age ~4 weeks. Severe glycometabolic disorders have been found in SIRT6 knockout mice, and whether a dietary intervention can rescue SIRT6 knockout mice remains unknown. In our study, we found that at the same calorie intake, a high-fat diet dramatically increased the lifespan of SIRT6 knockout mice to 26 weeks (males) and 37 weeks (females), reversed multi-organ atrophy, and reduced body weight, hypoglycemia, and premature aging. Furthermore, the high-fat diet partially but significantly normalized the global gene expression profile in SIRT6 knockout mice. Regarding the mechanism, excessive glucose uptake and glycolysis induced by the SIRT6 deficiency were attenuated in skeletal muscle through inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling by the high-fat diet. Similarly, fatty acids but not ketone bodies inhibited glucose uptake, glycolysis, and senescence in SIRT6 knockout fibroblasts, whereas PI3K inhibition antagonized the effects of a high-fatty-acid medium in vitro. Overall, the high-fat diet dramatically reverses numerous consequences of SIRT6 deficiency through modulation of insulin and IGF1 signaling, providing a new basis for elucidation of SIRT6 and fatty-acid functions and supporting novel therapeutic approaches against metabolic disorders and aging-related diseases.
