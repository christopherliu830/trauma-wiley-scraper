AB  - Abstract An adhesive yet easily removable burn wound dressing represents a breakthrough in second-degree burn wound care. Current second-degree burn wound dressings absorb wound exudate, reduce bacterial infections, and maintain a moist environment for healing, but are surgically or mechanically debrided from the wound, causing additional trauma to the newly formed tissues. We have developed an on-demand dissolvable dendritic thioester hydrogel burn dressing for second-degree burn care. The hydrogel is composed of a lysine-based dendron and a PEG-based crosslinker, which are synthesized in high yields. The hydrogel burn dressing covers the wound and acts as a barrier to bacterial infection in an in vivo second-degree burn wound model. A unique feature of the hydrogel is its capability to be dissolved on-demand, via a thiol?thioester exchange reaction, allowing for a facile burn dressing removal.

AB  - Abstract Elevated serum procalcitonin (PCT) level has been reported to be a diagnostic index in systemic bacterial infections, but it can also increase in some non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Stevens?Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare immune-mediated cutaneous mucosal reaction which is susceptible to bacterial infections and may have elevated PCT levels. The value of serum PCT has not been assessed in series of SJS/TEN patients. We aimed to investigate the PCT levels in SJS/TEN patients with systemic bacterial infections (systemic infected group), with skin surface bacterial infections (skin surface infected group) and without infections (non-infected group), to assess whether PCT was a valuable indicator for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 42 inpatients with SJS/TEN were retrospectively analysis. The receiver?operator curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of PCT for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that PCT levels in the systemic infected group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CRP between the three groups. The cut-off PCT level of 0.65 ng/mL calculated by ROC had optimal diagnostic efficacy, with sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 89.7%, respectively. PCT and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis were positively correlated (P < 0.05). In conclusion, PCT is a valuable index and superior to CRP in detecting systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The level of PCT can partially reflect the severity of the disease.

AB  - Abstract: Bacterial sepsis remains a frequent complication after liver transplantation. We previously reported the results of a pilot study that suggested that low expression of HLA-DR on monocytes is a predictive marker for the occurrence of sepsis. We have studied the value of this marker in an additional cohort of patients, and have analyzed the relation of HLA-DR expression with the use of immunosuppressive agents. 20 adult liver transplantation patients were prospectively monitored during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. All were treated according to standard protocols. The percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR was measured by flow cytometry. In addition, the effects of incubation of monocytes with prednisolone in vitro on the expression of HLA-DR was determined in 7 healthy volunteers. Seven patients developed bacterial sepsis after a median 15 (range 10?20) days after transplantation. HLA-DR expression was significantly lower in these patients on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after transplantation compared with non-septic patients. The percentage of HLA-DR positive monocytes was 30% or less, 3 (1?8) days before onset of sepsis. On day 7 after transplantation, HLA-DR expression on 50% or less of monocytes had a positive predictive value for sepsis of 71%, whereas the negative predictive value was 85%. Patients who developed sepsis received significantly more prednisolone. Incubation with prednisolone in vitro lowered the expression of HLA-DR in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that low HLA-DR expression on monocytes is a marker for a high risk of subsequent sepsis in liver transplantation patients. This high risk may be (at least partly) related to the dose of prednisolone.

AB  - Abstract In the present study we investigated whether donor gender of the effects of sex hormones play the greater role in the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. Kidneys of male and female Fisher rats were orthotopically transplanted into castrated male Lewis recipients. Animals were treated with testosterone, estradiol, or vehicle and the kidneys were harvested 20 weeks after transplantation for histological, immunohistological, and molecular analysis. Testosterone treatment resulted in increased proteinuria and profound glomerulo-sclerosis, irrespective of donor gender. In addition, mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) and platelet-derived growth factor-A and B (PDGF-A and B) chains were enhanced in these allografts. Estradiol reduced glomerulosclerosis and mononuclear cell infiltration in allografts of both genders that paralleled a decreased mRNA expression of TGF-?1, PDGF-A and B. No donor gender-related differences were noted in vehicle-treated animals. Our findings demonstrate that sex hormones rather than donor gender have a significant impact on chronic allograft nephropathy.

AB  - Abstract Objective Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to bacterial infections, which are associated with organ failure and a high mortality rate. Reliable biomarkers are needed to identify patients who require intensified treatment. Our objective was to study the regulation and prognostic relevance of elevated concentrations of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Design, setting and participants We examined the associations between serum and ascitic fluid (AF) suPAR and liver function, bacterial infection, and short-term mortality in 162 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis undergoing diagnostic paracentesis in a tertiary health care centre in Germany. Main outcome measure Twenty-eight-day mortality. Results Circulating suPAR levels were increased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and correlated with the severity of liver dysfunction and systemic inflammation but were not indicative of bacterial infection. Circulating suPAR levels >14.4 ng mL?1 predicted 28-day mortality, even after adjustment for liver function and confounders [HR = 3.05 (1.35?6.90); P = 0.0076] equal to the MELD score (AUC = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.61?0.81; P < 0.001). Cut-off levels derived from cohorts without liver disease were not applicable due to the low specificity. AF suPAR levels were elevated during spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but not during episodes in which bacteria or bacterial DNA was translocated into the ascites. AF suPAR levels correlated poorly with systemic suPAR but were associated with a more severe course of SBP and a worse outcome. In vitro experiments revealed that monocytes, and to a lesser extent neutrophils, secrete suPAR after Toll-like-receptor ligation, which led to rapid urokinase plasminogen activator receptor cleavage followed by increased synthesis. Conclusion Blood and ascitic suPAR levels provide distinct, but relevant prognostic information on the severity of complications in patients with end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Background Keratoconus manifests as a conical protrusion of the cornea and is characterised by stromal thinning. This causes debilitating visual impairment, which may necessitate corneal transplantation. Hypothetically, many of the pathological features in keratoconus may be manifestations of defects in wound healing; however, as the pathobiology remains unclear, therapeutic targets related to disease mechanisms are currently lacking. This study investigated the protein expression of cytokines which may control stromal wound healing and the effect of an induced secondary injury (SI) on stromal cells from ex vivo human keratoconus and control corneas. Methods Total protein was extracted from stromal cells from human keratoconic and non-keratoconic central corneas (n = 12) with (+SI) and without (-SI) an ex vivo corneal incision wound. The levels of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor beta (?-NGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were quantified using chemiluminescence-based immunoarrays. Results In stromal cells from -SI keratoconic corneas (compared with -SI normal corneas), the levels of IL-1α, IGF-1, TNF-α and TGF-?1 were increased and the levels of HGF and ?-NGF were reduced. These alterations were also observed in +SI non-keratoconic corneas (compared with -SI non-keratoconic corneas). In stromal cells from +SI keratoconic corneas (compared with -SI keratoconic corneas), the quantities of IL-1α, FGF-2, TNF-a, EGF, TGF-a1 and PDGF were decreased. Conclusion The repair-modulating milieu in keratoconic corneas appears comparable to that in wounded normal corneas. Moreover, wounded keratoconic corneas may be less capable of orchestrating a normal reparative response. These novel findings may improve our understanding of the pathobiology and may facilitate the identification of potential biological targets and therapeutic agents to advance the clinical management of this disorder.

AB  - Summary All organisms are exposed constantly to a variety of infectious and injurious stimuli. These induce inflammatory responses tailored to the threat posed. While the innate immune system is the front line of response to each stimulant, it has been considered traditionally to lack memory, acting in a generic fashion until the adaptive immune arm can take over. This outmoded simplification of the roles of innate and acquired arms of the immune system has been challenged by evidence of myeloid cells altering their response to subsequent encounters based on earlier exposure. This concept of ?innate immune memory? has been known for nearly a century, and is accepted among myeloid biologists. In recent years other innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells, have been shown to display memory, suggesting that innate immune memory is a trait common to several cell types. During the last 30 years, evidence has slowly accumulated in favour of not only haematopoietic cells, but also stromal cells, being imbued with memory following inflammatory episodes. A recent publication showing this also to be true in epithelial cells suggests innate immune memory to be widespread, if under-appreciated, in non-haematopoietic cells. In this review, we will examine the evidence supporting the existence of innate immune memory in stromal cells. We will also discuss the ramifications of memory in long-lived tissue-resident cells. Finally, we will pose questions we feel to be important in the understanding of these forgotten cells in the field of innate memory.

AB  - Purpose In clinical conditions trauma is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of multiple organ failure after trauma Experimental design To have a detailed understanding of the neutrophil activation at primary stages after trauma, neutrophils are isolated from control and surgical trauma rats in this study. Extracted proteins are analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results A total of 2924 rat neutrophil proteins are identified in our analysis, of which 393 are found differentially regulated between control and trauma groups. By using functional pathways analysis of the 190 proteins up-regulated in surgical trauma, we found proteins related to transcription initiation and protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, among the 203 proteins down-regulated in surgical trauma we found enrichment for proteins of the immune response, proteasome degradation and actin cytoskeleton. Overall, enzyme prediction analysis revealed that regulated enzymes are directly involved in neutrophil apoptosis, directional migration and chemotaxis. Our observations are then confirmed by in silico protein?protein interaction analysis. Conclusions and clinical relevance Collectively, our results reveal that neutrophils drastically regulate their biochemical pathways after the early stages of surgical trauma, showing lower activity. This implies higher susceptibility of the trauma patients to infection and bystander tissues damage.
