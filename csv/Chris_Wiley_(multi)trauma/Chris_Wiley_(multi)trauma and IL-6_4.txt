AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 344?355. Abstract Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) signaling has been implicated in microglial activation and propagation of inflammation following spinal cord injury (SCI). As such, modulating microglial activation through TLR4 represents an attractive therapeutic approach to treat SCI. High molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA), a polymer with multiple therapeutic uses, has been previously shown to modulate TLR4 activation in macrophages and has shown early promise as a therapeutic agent in SCI. However, the mechanism associated with HMW-HA has not been fully elucidated or tested in microglia, a similar cell type. In the current study, we sought to determine the effects of HMW-HA on TLR4 activation in microglia and to gain insights into the mechanism of action. Rat primary microglial cultures were exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and HMW-HA, and the extent and mechanisms of inflammation were studied. HMW-HA decreased LPS mediated IL-1?, IL-6, and Tumor necrosis factor-α gene expression and IL-6 and nitric oxide production. This decrease was associated with a reduction in ERK 1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, was dependent on the continued presence of HMW-HA, and activation of Akt and A20 protein expression was reduced by HMW-HA. Together, our results show that HMW-HA can reduce LPS-mediated inflammatory signaling in microglia. We suggest that HA possibly mediates its effects by blocking the induction of inflammatory signaling through an extracellular mechanism.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are essential components of our defense and repair systems but also potentially harmful mediators of infectious and immunoinflammatory reactions. Clinically important cytokines function systemically as pleiotropic hormones with overlapping effects on many cell types. All engage in a complex network of agonists and antagonists. Some immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been found to be potent and specific regulators of cytokines. These antibodies bind interleukin (IL-1)α, IL-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interferon (IFN)-α/? with exceptional force. They neutralize their corresponding cytokines ex vivo and perhaps in vivo, although they may also function as cytokine carriers. The biological role of autoantibodies to cytokines is not yet understood, but they may provide a level of regulation not appreciated at present. Inappropriate production/function of such antibodies could be pathogenetically involved in immunoinflammatory and other diseases. Cytokine antibodies may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of human IgG therapy.

This review summarizes the known cytokine and cytokine receptor expression in primary brain tumors and derived cell lines. These expression patterns are compared with those occurring in other CNS diseases, such as virus or bacterial infections, experimental allergic encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and trauma. A variety of cytokines are expressed during CNS neoplasia; their potential involvement in tumor growth through a variety of mechanisms, such as autocrine or paracrine growth stimulation, angiogenesis, and immune surveillance evasion, are discussed. Finally, results of preliminary therapeutic approaches with cytokines are critically evaluated. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the contributions of inflammatory activation, particularly that of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in depressive illness and the specific role of stressors may have in this regard. In so doing, the authors necessarily consider the various approaches used to link cytokine functioning and depressive illness. Associations between circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and depressive disorders have provided valuable information concerning the implications of peripheral inflammation in relation to depressive illness. The relationships between elevated inflammation and depression may be moderated by stressors, or alternatively, inflammatory processes might give rise to stressor-like neurochemical changes (e.g., monoamine variations) that come to elicit depressive symptoms. Several animal studies have been conducted in an effort to describe the behavioral syndrome associated with inflammatory activation and to define the factors responsible for the behavioral and biological effects of cytokines.

AB  - Abstract The early status of strain development for the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and interferon (IFN) ? is described. The general approach to generating such strains was to amplify gene sequences encoding the mature forms of the various cytokines by PCR from commercially available cDNA sources. The design of the amplificates allowed an in-frame fusion to an MFα1 leader segment contained in two basic expression vectors, pFPMT121-MFα1 and pTPSMT-MFα1. The two vectors differ in that one harbors the methanol-inducible FMD promoter and the other the constitutive TPS1 promoter as control elements for heterologous gene expression. The most advanced process development example is that of IFNα-2a. Here, the MOX promoter derived from another key gene of methanol metabolism is used for expression control. The successful development of a production process for Hansenula polymorpha-derived IFNα-2a is summarized. This was achieved by combining genetic engineering of suitable production strains with improved processing capabilities for the secreted cytokine, and by purification procedures from cultures grown in yeast extract?peptone?glycerol-based media.

AB  - Background The magnitude of the systemic response is proportional to the degree of surgical trauma. Much has been reported in the literature comparing metabolic and immune responses, analgesia use, or length of hospital stay between laparoscopic and open procedures. In particular, metabolic and immune responses are represented by measuring various chemical mediators as stress responses. Laparoscopic procedures are associated with reduced operative trauma compared with open procedures, resulting in lower systemic response. As a result, laparoscopic procedures are now well accepted for both benign and malignant processes. Laparoscopic liver resection, specifically, is employed for symptomatic and some malignant tumors, following improvements in diagnostic accuracy, laparoscopic devices, and techniques. However, laparoscopic liver resection is still controversial in malignant disease because of complex anatomy, the technical difficulty of the procedure, and questionable indications. There are few reports describing the stress responses associated with laparoscopic liver resection, even though many studies reviewing stress responses have been performed recently in both humans and animal models comparing laparoscopic to conventional open surgery. Although this review examines stress response after laparoscopic liver resection in both an animal and human clinical model, further controlled randomized studies with additional investigations of immunologic parameters are needed to demonstrate the consequences of either minimally invasive surgery or open procedures on perioperative or postoperative stress responses for laparoscopic liver resection.

AB  - Abstract Photothermal therapy (PTT) has been extensively developed as an effective approach against cancer. However, PTT can trigger inflammatory responses, in turn simulating tumor regeneration and hindering subsequent therapy. A therapeutic strategy was developed to deliver enhanced PTT and simultaneously inhibit PTT-induced inflammatory response. 1-Pyrene methanol was utilize to synthesize the anti-inflammatory prodrug pyrene?aspirin (P-aspirin) with a cleavable ester bond and also facilitate loading the prodrug on gold nanorod (AuNR)-encapsulated graphitic nanocapsule (AuNR@G), a photothermal agent, through π?π interactions. Such AuNR@G-P-aspirin complexes were used for near-infrared laser-triggered photothermal ablation of solid tumor and simultaneous inhibition of PTT-induced inflammation through the release of aspirin in tumor milieu. This strategy showed excellent effects in?vitro and in?vivo.

AB  - Summary In mice, monocytes that exhibit a pro-inflammatory profile enter muscle tissue after muscle injury and are crucial for clearance of necrotic tissue and stimulation of muscle progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. The aim of this study was to test if pro-inflammatory capacity of classically activated (M1) monocytes relates to muscle mass and strength in humans. This study included 191 male and 195 female subjects (mean age 64.2 years (SD 6.4) and 61.9 ± 6.4, respectively) of the Leiden Longevity Study. Pro-inflammatory capacity of M1 monocytes was assessed by ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR-2/1 agonist tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteine (Pam3Cys-SK4), both M1 phenotype activators. Cytokines that stimulate M1 monocyte response (IFN-? and GM-CSF) as well as cytokines that are secreted by M1 monocytes (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-1?) were measured. Analyses were adjusted for age, height, and body fat mass. Upon stimulation with LPS, the cytokine production capacity of INF-?, GM-CSF, and TNF-α was significantly positively associated with lean body mass, appendicular lean mass and handgrip strength in men, but not in women. Upon stimulation with Pam3Cys-SK4, IL-6; TNF-α; and Il-1? were significantly positively associated with lean body mass and appendicular lean in women, but not in men. Taken together, this study shows that higher pro-inflammatory capacity of M1 monocytes upon stimulation is associated with muscle characteristics and sex dependent.

AB  - Abstract Aucubin (AU) is the main active ingredient of Aucuba japonica which has showed many positive effects such as anti-inflammation and liver protection. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. In this research, we explored the effects of AU on the tyloxapol-induced NAFLD in mice and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) induced-3T3L1 cells. Tyloxapol (300 mg/kg) was injected to C57BL/6 mice with aucubin. The differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with or without aucubin after stimulation of apoC-III (100 ?g/mL). In results, aucubin inhibited hyperlipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation by influencing the content of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumour necrosis factor receptor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and IL-6 in blood. AU activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), PPAR? and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the phosphorylation of adenosine 5?-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα), AMPK?, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and protein kinase B (AKT). In conclusion, AU performed the function of hypolipidaemic by its obvious anti-inflammation and antioxidant activity, which may become a kind of new drug targeting at NAFLD.

AB  - Abstract Haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R) may cause global ischaemia-reperfusion injury, which can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan failure (particularly liver failure) and high mortality. Hinokitiol, a bioactive tropolone-related compound, exhibits antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory activities. Targeting inflammatory responses is a potential strategy for ameliorating hepatic injury during HS/R. Whether hinokitiol prevents hepatic injury during HS/R remains unclear. In the present study, we determined the role of hinokitiol following HS/R. The in vivo assays revealed that hinokitiol markedly attenuated HS/R-induced hepatic injury. Hinokitiol could inhibited NF-?B activation and IL-6 and TNF-α upregulation in liver tissues. Moreover, hinokitiol reduced caspase-3 activation, upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2. These findings suggest that hinokitiol can ameliorate liver injury following HS/R, partly through suppression of inflammation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the in vitro data revealed that hinokitiol significantly reversed hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell death and apoptosis in the primary hepatocytes. Hinokitiol prevented H/R-induced caspase-3 activation, PPAR cleavage, Bax overexpression and Bcl-2 downregulation. Moreover, hinokitiol attenuated H/R-stimulated NF-?B activation and reduced the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α mRNAs, suggesting that hinokitiol can protect hepatocytes from H/R injury. Collectively, our data suggest that hinokitiol attenuates liver injury following HS/R, partly through the inhibition of NF-?B activation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the independent associations between measures of adiposity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with clustered cardiometabolic risk in adolescents. Methods 209 adolescents (139 boys), aged 15?17.5 years participated. Participants completed anthropometric measurements [height, weight, waist circumference (WC)] whilst the 20 m fitness test was used to assess CRF. Additional measures included systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, ratio total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin resistance (HOMA), interleukin-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and adiponectin. Results Partial correlations revealed weak to moderate negative associations for body mass index (BMI) and WC with CRF (r = ?0.295 and ?0.292, P < 0.001) and adiponectin (r = ?0.227 and ?0.262, P < 0.05). Weak to moderate positive associations were evident for BMI with CRP, and cardiometabolic risk (r = 0.274, and 0.283, P < 0.05, respectively). Weak to moderate positive associations were apparent for WC with CRP and triglycerides (r = 0.240 and 0.254, P < 0.05), whilst moderate to large associations were evident for WC with clustered cardiometabolic risk (r = 0.317, P < 0.05). Regression analyses revealed that BMI was positively associated with cardiometabolic risk (? = 0.243, P < 0.001). Further analysis whilst additionally controlling for WC and CRF strengthened this association (? = 0.352, P < 0.001). Finally, participants in the least-fit quartile for CRF had significantly poorer cardiometabolic risk scores than those in the other quartiles. Conclusion BMI and not CRF was independently associated with cardiometabolic risk. Reducing BMI appears essential to minimize cardiometabolic risk during adolescence. Am. J. Hum.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study aimed to investigate the levels of 11 oral species in plaque samples and cytokine levels in biofluid samples of patients with idiopathic uveitis (IU) and systemically healthy individuals (H) with or without gingival inflammation. Material  GCF and serum IL-6; salivary IL-17F, and salivary and serum IL-17A/F levels were higher in the IU group than the H group (p < 0.05). However, serum IL-10 and IL-17E levels were higher in the H group than the IU group (p < 0.05). A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, S. oralis, A. naeslundii, and V. dispar counts were higher in IU group compared to H group (p < 0.05). Conclusion Altered local and systemic cytokine profiles are associated with differences in the microbial plaque composition in IU. Anti-inflammatory cytokines; IL-10, IL-17E are reduced in patients with IU and Th-1 and Th-17 driven inflammatory responses in biofluids are altered.

AB  - An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions in adipose tissue is thought to contribute to chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation and consequently to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whose serum levels are elevated in such patients, have been shown to interfere with cytokine production in vitro. In order to evaluate the effects of elevated NEFA levels on cytokine production in adipose tissue in vivo we used an 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion (OFM) catheter to induce local inflammation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of healthy volunteers and to sample interstitial fluid (IF) specifically from the inflamed tissue. In two crossover studies, nine subjects received either an intravenous lipid-heparin infusion to elevate circulating NEFA levels or saline over a period of 28 h. The former increased the circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs), NEFA, glucose, and insulin over the study period. NEFA effects on locally induced inflammation were estimated by measuring the levels of a panel adipokines in the OFM probe effluent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels increased during the study period but were not affected by lipid-heparin infusion. In contrast, the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced during the final hour of lipid-heparin infusion (saline: 449.2 ± 105.9 vs. lipid-heparin: 65.4 ± 15.4 pg/ml; P = 0.02). These data provide the first in vivo evidence that elevated NEFA can modulate cytokine production by adipose tissue.

AB  - Abstract Background Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protects the lung from sepsis-induced injury through activating Nrf2-regulated multiple phase 2 detoxification genes, including NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO1). Based on the positive effect of Sirtuin 6 on Nrf2, we aim to explore the potential role of SIRT6 in the mechanism of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Methods Mouse models of sepsis were constructed by instilling intratracheal of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 4?ml/kg). After 48-hour treatment, lung tissues were collected to measure the degree of lung injury. The SIRT6, siSIRT6, and siNrf2 plasmids were cotransfected into various concentrations of LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; 0, 1, 5, 10, and 50??g/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, NQO1, and HO1 was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Results Lung tissues in the model group already had basic characteristics of ALI. Compared with the control model, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were much higher (P?<?0.01), the levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, and Nrf2-modulated detoxification factors were downregulated (P?<?0.01). SIRT6 overexpression decreased the apoptosis below to 10% (P?<?0.01), significantly increased the Nrf2 expression, effectively inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 releases, and enhanced NQO1 and HO1 levels (P?<?0.01). siNrf2 abolished the protective effects of SIRT6 overexpression, including increasing apoptosis and inhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidative genes expressions (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Our study suggested SIRT6 positively regulated Nrf2 expression and activated Nrf2-regulated anti-inflammatory and antioxidative enzymes, which could effectively mitigate LPS-induced HUVECs inflammatory responses. This might reflect the mechanism of ALI induced by sepsis.

AB  - Small molecules were developed to attenuate proinflammatory cytokines resulting from activation of MyD88-mediated toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by Francisella tularensis. Fifty-three tripeptide derivatives were synthesized to mimic a key BB-loop region involved in toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor recognition (TIR) domain interactions. Compounds were tested for inhibition of TNF-α, IFN-?, IL-6, and IL-1? in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and primary human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to LPS extracts from F. tularensis. From 53 compounds synthesized and tested, ten compounds were identified as effective inhibitors of F. tularensisLPS-induced cytokines. Compound stability testing in the presence of human liver microsomes and human serum resulted in the identification of tripeptide derivative 7 that was a potent, stable, and drug-like small molecule. Target corroboration using a cell-based reporter assay and competition experiments with MyD88 TIR domain protein supported that the effect of 7 was through MyD88 TIR domain interactions. Compound 7 also attenuated proinflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bronchial epithelial cells challenged with a live vaccine strain of F. tularensis at a multiplicity of infection of 1:5. Small molecules that target TIR domain interactions in MyD88-dependent TLR signaling represent a promising strategy toward host-directed adjunctive therapeutics for inflammation associated with biothreat agent-induced sepsis.
