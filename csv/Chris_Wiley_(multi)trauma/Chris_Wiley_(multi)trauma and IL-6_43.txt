AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - Abstract Postoperative tissue adhesion causes serious complications and suffering in 90% of patients after peritoneum surgery, while commercial anti-adhesion agents cannot completely prevent postoperative peritoneal adhesions. This study demonstrates electrospining of a blended solution of chitosan, poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to fabricate a chitosan-based nanofibrous mat as a postoperative anti-adhesion agent. Rheological studies combined with scanning electron microscopy reveal that the spinnability of the chitosan-PLGA solution could be controlled by adjusting the blend ratio and concentration with average fiber diameter from 634 to 913 nm. Biodegradation of the nanofiber specimens showed accelerated hydrolysis by chitosan. Proliferation of fibroblasts and antimicrobial activity of nanofibers containing chitosan was analyzed. Abdominal defects with cecum adhesion in rats demonstrated that the blend nanofiber mats were effective in preventing tissue adhesion as a barrier (4 weeks after abdominal surgery) by coverage of exfoliated peritoneum and insufficient wound sites at the beginning of the wound healing process. Chitosan?PLGA?PEO blend nanofiber mats will provide a promising key as a postoperative anti-adhesion agent. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The hemopoietic growth factors are peptide hormones that are known to be responsible for the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of bone marrow progenitor cells into mature differentiated cells. These cytokines have had a major impact on the management of patients with cytopenias and have been extensively used as an adjunct to the management of patients with hematologic malignancies, with or without prior intensive chemotherapy. Other potential uses, being rigorously studied, include the potential mobilization of stem cells as well as recruitment phase-specific cells into the cell cycle, thus providing a more sensitive environment for targeting specific chemotherapeutic agents.

AB  - Background Lidocaine, an amide anesthetic, has been used in the treatment of a wide variety of pain disorders for over 75 years. In addition to pain control, lidocaine is an anti-arrhythmic agent and has anti-inflammatory properties. Lidocaine's unique properties, including nonlinear pharmacokinetics, have limited its modern-day use. Objective The purpose of this review is to offer a better understanding of the properties of this unique treatment, which we hope will allow more practitioners to offer this to their patients. Methods An analysis of the history, pharmacokinetics, and relevant uses of lidocaine in headache medicine based on a synthesis of the medical literature and clinical experience. Results Lidocaine is an amide anesthetic that inhibits voltage gated sodium channels, and lidocaine metabolism occurs exclusively in the liver. One lidocaine metabolite has its own unique properties and may be an active form of the drug. Conclusion Open label and retrospective studies have investigated the use of lidocaine in many headache disorders, primarily via injection or infusion. Further research into the active metabolite of lidocaine may allow for its use as a novel nonopiate treatment of chronic pain.

AB  - Background ?? In this article, current scientific knowledge on the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is reviewed. The US case definition of CFS (the CDC-definition) is most widespread in research and clinical practice. Estimates of prevalence vary from 0.2% to above 2%. The female?male ratio is approximately 3:1. Clinical Features ?? Severe fatigue is the dominating complaint; it is worsened from exertions and not substantially relieved by rest. In addition, the patients might have a varying combination of accompanying symptoms. Clinical evaluation should be based upon standardized guidelines, including an assessment of functional impairments. Pathophysiology ?? The pathophysiology should be interpreted within a biopsychosocial framework. Present knowledge suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms and personality traits might be regarded as predisposing factors, some infections and severe psychosocial stress constitute precipitating factors, whereas disturbances of immunity, skeletal muscle, cognitive abilities, endocrine control and cardiovascular homeostasis are possible perpetuating factors. Treatment ?? Cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy are of proven value in randomized controlled trials. Several pharmaceutical measures have been explored and found to have no beneficial effect. Most patients might expect long-term improvement, but full recovery is rare; however, the prognosis is better among adolescents.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review the human and veterinary literature on the biology of apoptosis in health and disease. Data Sources ? Data were examined from the human and veterinary literature identified through Pubmed and references listed in appropriate articles pertaining to apoptosis. Human Data Synthesis ? The role of apoptosis in health and disease is a rapidly growing area of research in human medicine. Apoptosis has been identified as a component of human autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and sepsis. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Research data available from the veterinary literature pertaining to apoptosis and its role in diseases of small animal species is still in its infancy. The majority of veterinary studies focus on oncologic therapy. Most of the basic science and human clinical research studies use human blood and tissue samples and murine models. The results from these studies may be applicable to small animal species. Conclusions ? Apoptosis is the complex physiologic process of programmed cell death. The pathophysiology of apoptosis and disease is only now being closely evaluated in human medicine. Knowledge of the physiologic mechanisms by which tissues regulate their size and composition is leading researchers to investigate the role of apoptosis in human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disease and sepsis. Because it is a multifaceted process, apoptosis is difficult to target or manipulate therapeutically. Future studies may reveal methods to regulate or manipulate apoptosis and improve patient outcome.
