AB  - Summary:? During the past several years, there has been increasing interest in the role of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) in epilepsy. Advances in neuroradiology have enhanced our ability to image and study the human cerebrovasculature, and further developments in the research of metabolic deficiencies linked to seizure disorders (e.g., GLUT1 deficiency), neuroinflammation, and multiple drug resistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have amplified the significance of the BBB's relationship to epilepsy. ?Prior to 1986, BBB research in epilepsy focused on three main areas: ultrastructural studies, brain glucose availability and transport, and clinical uses of AEDs. However, contrast-based imaging techniques and medical procedures such as BBB disruption provided a framework that demonstrated that the BBB could be reversibly disrupted by pathologic or iatrogenic manipulations, with important implications in terms of CNS drug delivery to ?multiple drug resistant? brain. This concept of BBB breakdown for therapeutic purposes has also unveiled a previously unrecognized role for BBB failure as a possible etiologic mechanism in epileptogenesis. Finally, a growing body of evidence has shown that inflammatory mechanisms may participate in the pathological changes observed in epileptic brain, with increasing awareness that blood-borne cells or signals may participate in epileptogenesis by virtue of a leaky BBB. In this article we will review the relationships between BBB function and epilepsy. In particular, we will illustrate consensus and divergence between clinical reality and animal studies.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, chromosomal alterations have been extensively investigated for their pathophysiological relevance in haematological malignancies. In particular, epigenetic modifications of intra-nuclear histones are now known as key regulators of healthy cell cycles that have also evolved into novel therapeutic targets for certain blood cancers. Thus, for most haematologists, histones are DNA-chained proteins that are buried deep within chromatin. However, the plot has deepened with recent revelations on the function of histones when unchained and released extracellularly upon cell death or from activated neutrophils as part of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Extracellular histones and NETs are increasingly recognized for profound cytotoxicity and pro-coagulant effects. This article highlights the importance of recognizing this new paradigm of extracellular histones as a key player in host defence through its damage-associated molecular patterns, which could translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in various haematological and critical disorders.

AB  - A decrease in serum albumin concentrations is an almost inevitable finding in disease states, and is primarily mediated in the acute phase by alterations in vascular permeability and redistribution. This change is not disease specific but marked changes that persist are generally associated with a poorer prognosis. Critical appraisal of long-standing practices and the availability of alternative colloid solutions have led to a reduction in albumin replacement therapy, and a widespread tolerance of lower albumin concentrations in patients. The factors determining serum albumin concentrations, their measurement and the implications of hypoalbuminaemia are reviewed. The clinical value of serum albumin measurement is discussed.

AB  - Abstract 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (18F-fluoride PET) is a functional imaging modality used primarily to detect increased bone metabolism. Increased 18F-fluoride PET uptake suggests an association between increased bone metabolism and load stress at the subchondral level. This study therefore examined the relationship between equivalent stress distribution calculated by finite element analysis and 18F-fluoride PET uptake in patients with hip osteoarthritis. The study examined 34 hips of 17 patients who presented to our clinic with hip pain, and were diagnosed with osteoarthritis or pre-osteoarthritis. The hips with trauma, infection, or bone metastasis of cancer were excluded. Three-dimensional models of each hip were created from computed tomography data to calculate the maximum equivalent stress by finite element analysis, which was compared with the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) examined by 18F-fluoride PET. The SUVmax and equivalent stress were correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ??=?0.752), and higher equivalent stress values were noted in higher SUVmax patients. The correlation between SUVmax and maximum equivalent stress in osteoarthritic hips suggests the possibility that 18F-fluoride PET detect increased bone metabolism at sites of stress concentration. This study demonstrates the correlation between mechanical stress and bone remodeling acceleration in hip osteoarthritis. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Complement fragment (C)5a is a 74 residue pro-inflammatory polypeptide produced during activation of the complement cascade of serum proteins in response to foreign surfaces such as microorganisms and tissue damaged by physical or chemical injury. C5a binds to at least two seven-transmembrane domain receptors, C5aR (C5R1, CD88) and C5L2 (gpr77), expressed ubiquitously on a wide variety of cells but particularly on the surface of immune cells like macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. C5aR is a classical G protein-coupled receptor that signals through Gαi and Gα16, whereas C5L2 does not appear to couple to G proteins and has no known signalling activity. Although C5a was first described as an anaphylatoxin and later as a leukocyte chemoattractant, the widespread expression of C5aR suggested more general functionality. Our understanding of the physiology of C5a has improved significantly in recent years through exploitation of receptor knockout and knockin mice, C5 and C5a antibodies, soluble recombinant C5a and C5a analogues and newly developed receptor antagonists. C5a is now also implicated in non-immunological functions associated with developmental biology, CNS development and neurodegeneration, tissue regeneration, and haematopoiesis. Combined receptor mutagenesis, molecular modelling, structure-activity relationship studies and species dependence for ligand potency on C5aR have been helpful for identifying ligand binding sites on the receptor and for defining mechanisms of receptor activation and inactivation. This review will highlight major developments in C5a receptor research that support C5aR as an important therapeutic target. The intriguing possibilities raised by the existence of a non-signalling C5a receptor are also discussed.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, expected outcomes, equipment, fluoroscopic procedure, special considerations, alternative uses, and the complication examples for pleural space disease. Pneumothorax and pleural effusions are common causes of respiratory distress in companion animals. A surgical approach is used for placement of the port associated with permanent pleural drainage and a basic surgical pack and sterile drapes are needed. Temporary drainage of the thoracic cavity can be easily achieved through the placement of an intra-thoracic catheter. Port placement is always performed with the patient under general anesthesia and controlled ventilation. Thoracic drainage catheters can also be used for infusion. Alternatively, cases of pyothorax, in which medical management is being pursued, may require thoracic lavage and drainage. The temporary thoracic drainage catheters can be used for this purpose; however, ports should not be used as they may become occluded or infected after suction.
