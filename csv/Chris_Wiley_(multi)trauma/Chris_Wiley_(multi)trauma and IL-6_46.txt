AB  - Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (immune TRALI) is now recognized as the most common cause of transfusion-associated major morbidity and death in the Western world. Among the implicated leucocyte antibodies, these ones directed against the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) class II, human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA)-3a and HLA-A2 antigens are frequently associated with severe (artificial ventilation required) and fatal cases. There is accumulating evidence that preventive measures such as transfusion of plasma-rich blood components from male donors or from donors tested negative for leucocyte antibodies are effective in the reduction of severe and fatal immune TRALI.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD), considered the second most common cause of cognitive impairment after Alzheimer disease in the elderly, involves the impairment of memory and cognitive function as a consequence of cerebrovascular disease. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is a common pathophysiological condition frequently occurring in VaD. It is generally associated with neurovascular degeneration, in which neuronal damage and blood-brain barrier alterations coexist and evoke beta-amyloid?induced oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammasome- promoted neuroinflammation, which contribute to and exacerbate the course of disease. Vascular cognitive impairment comprises a heterogeneous group of cognitive disorders of various severity and types that share a presumed vascular etiology. The present study reviews major pathogenic factors involved in VaD, highlighting the relevance of cerebrocellular stress and hormetic responses to neurovascular insult, and addresses these mechanisms as potentially viable and valuable as foci of novel neuroprotective methods to mitigate or prevent VaD. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The cecum contains a high concentration of microbes, which are a combination of Gram-negative and Gram-positive flora. These bacteria range from anaerobic to facultative aerobic to aerobic organisms. In the procedure described in this unit, the ligation of the cecum produces a source of ischemic tissue as well as polymicrobial infection. This combination of ischemic/necrotic tissue and microbial infection distinguishes this multifactorial model from a number of other bacterial sepsis models, including but not limited to: bacteremia secondary to intravenous or intraperitoneal administration; fecal administration or intraperitoneal administration of fecal or bacterial plugs; colonic stents; and bacterial abscess formation.

AB  - Abstract Bone and tooth, fundamental parts of the craniofacial skeleton, are anatomically and developmentally interconnected structures. Notably, pathological processes in these tissues underwent together and progressed in multilevels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-released small organelles and transfer proteins and genetic information into cells and tissues. Although EVs have been identified in bone and tooth, particularly EVs have been identified in the bone formation and resorption, the concrete roles of EVs in bone and tooth development and diseases remain elusive. As such, we review the recent progress of EVs in bone and tooth to highlight the novel findings of EVs in cellular communication, tissue homeostasis, and interventions. This will enhance our comprehension on the skeletal biology and shed new light on the modulation of skeletal disorders and the potential of genetic treatment.

AB  - Summary Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) are the most frequent musculoskeletal pain syndromes. These conditions are often not distinct entities and may overlap. There is significant comorbidity of FMS with other functional somatic syndromes and mental disorders. Clinical assessment should therefore focus on the whole range of physical and somatic distress and associated disability. The clinical diagnosis of FMS and MPS is based on history (typical cluster of symptoms), complete physical examination and the exclusion of other somatic disease as cause of local, regional or widespread pain. There is strong evidence for the efficacy of aerobic exercise, balneotherapy, multidisciplinary therapy (exercise and psychological therapy) and specific pharmacological agents (amitriptyline, duloxetine, fluoxetine, milnacipran, paroxetine, pregabalin) in reducing some of the key symptoms of FMS. There is strong evidence for short term pain relief in MPS by needling and laser therapy; however, the role for these treatments in long term therapy awaits further research.

AB  - The present review aimed to summarize the effectiveness and features of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of infectious diseases and to discuss the limitation of the development of TCM. The personalized medicine with TCM exerts a curative effect on viral and bacterial infectious diseases with unique advantages on the improvement of clinical manifestation, pathogen inhibition, and organ recovery during severe and drug-resistant infection. The deficiency of personalized medicine with TCM lies in that the current research design of TCM primarily focuses on the study of the effective components and material basis of Chinese herbs at the cellular, molecular, and genetic level, while ignoring the guidance of the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, which is the core concept of individualized treatment. Personalized medicine with TCM has a broad prospective for infectious diseases due to the specific efficacy and advantages. While the curative effect of individualized treatment with TCM cannot be excluded from the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, the study of personalized medicine with TCM for infectious diseases urgently requires a unified standardization of the clinical syndrome differentiation and the evolution rule of infectious diseases by TCM theory.
