AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Histological differentiation between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms such as trichoepithelioma and trichoblastoma can be difficult on small biopsies. Therefore, several attempts have been made to identify immunohistochemical differences between these entities. Recent studies showed androgen receptor expression in a number of mature epithelial structures in the skin and in epithelial neoplasms including basal cell carcinoma. In contrast, androgen receptor expression was absent in mature hair follicles or the few trichogenic neoplasms studied to date. These findings suggested that androgen receptor expression might be a useful adjunct in the histological differential diagnosis between basal cell carcinoma and benign trichoblastic neoplasms. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of androgen receptor expression in 32 basal cell carcinomas and 10 benign trichoblastic tumors (6 trichoepitheliomas and 4 trichoblastomas). In our study, expression of androgen receptor was detected in 78% of basal cell carcinomas. None of the trichoblastic tumors showed any androgen receptor immunoreactivity. These results confirm the lack of androgen receptor expression in benign trichoblastic neoplasms and indicate that finding of androgen receptor expression points to basal cell carcinoma as the most likely diagnosis.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Keeping a small stock of liquid plasma readily available for transfusion is common practise in Sweden. We report data on complement activation markers in plasma components during storage in the liquid state and the kinetics of C3a-desArg after transfusion of autologous plasma with high content of C3a-desArg. Material and Methods? Plasma components were prepared by apheresis or from whole blood. C3 fragments (C3a-desArg, C3d,g, iC3), and soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9) were investigated. C3a-desArg kinetics was investigated in regular apheresis donors. Results? Apheresis plasma prepared by membrane centrifugation had significantly higher level of C3a-desArg, C3d,g and sC5b-9 from day 0 and low iC3, than plasma prepared by other methods. By storage day 7, C3a-desArg -levels were above the reference value in 88% of all components. After re-infusion of autologous plasma with high C3a-desArg content, there were rapid a1 and a2-distribution followed by a slower b-elimination phase. Conclusion? Plasma components prepared by different methods and stored in the liquid phase differ significantly in the amount and timing of complement activation. C3a-desArg present in plasma is rapidly eliminated after transfusion. Autologous plasma could be used to study complement kinetics in different clinical situations.

AB  - The treatment of acute hepatic failure has developed rapidly over the last 40 years, reducing morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. Whilst this has been partly attributed to significant improvements in the specialist medical management of these patients, advances in surgical techniques and pharmaceutical developments have led to the establishment of successful liver transplantation programmes, which have improved mortality significantly. This review will examine the clinical impact of alternative methods that have been used to provide extra-corporeal hepatic support. Non-biological, bio- logical and hybrid hepatic extra-corporeal support will be explored, offering a comprehensive historical overview and an appraisal of present and future advances.

AB  - Abstract The study was aimed to explore the functions of circulating fibrocytes (CFs) on injury repair in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) mice model and its clinical value as a biomarker for ALI/ARDS. ALI/ARDS mice model was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood of ALI/ARDS model and flow cytometry was used to measure CFs defined as cells positive for CD45 and collagen-1. Histological changes of lung tissues were evaluated by H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. The correlations of CFs counts with damnification of lung tissue and the severity of pulmonary fibrosis were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of collagen-1. ELISA was applied to determine cytokine CXCL12 concentration. Clinical relevance between CFs and ALI/ARDS was investigated. The greater number of CFs in the ALI/ARDS group implied higher degree of lung injury and more severe pulmonary fibrosis. The protein expression of collagen-1 and concentration of cytokine CXCL12 in ALI/ARDS group were higher than that in control group. Clinical and prognostic analysis revealed the higher injury degree and death rates in ALI/ARDS group than those in control group, and identified a greater severity and mortality for patients with ARDS than those with ALI. ROC curve analysis indicated the counts of CFs greater than 5.85% can predict death rates with AUC?=?0.928. CFs had an inhibitory effect on injury repair in ALI/ARDS mice model. This might be unfavorable as a clinical marker for progression of ALI/ARDS.

AB  - SUMMARY Allogeneic blood transfusions expose a patient to many soluble and cell-bound antigens, expressed on viable and decaying cells. In particular, contaminant leukocytes are presumed to play an important role interacting with the recipient's immune system. This immune response to transfusions is influenced by the condition of the patient, and a patient in steady state will respond differently to a patient in hemorrhagic shock, under anesthesia or after surgical tissue injury. Blood transfusions affect both the innate immediate defense immune system and the adaptive immune response, the latter often resulting in antibodies and (less well characterized) cellular immunity. Removal of allogeneic leukocytes by filtration of red cells and platelet products significantly reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and the formation of leukocyte antibodies, causing refractoriness to platelet transfusions. However, an effect of leukocyte-containing transfusions on cellular immune functions relevant to transplant tolerance, cancer surveillance, viral replication or susceptibility to nosocomial infections is less obvious. Randomized studies showed a significant effect of removal of allogeneic leukocytes in blood transfused to cardiac surgery patients, reducing postoperative mortality. As for the other reported clinical effects of (passenger) leukocytes in blood transfusions, there is not yet sufficient evidence.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissue. Current diagnostics have low sensitivity or specificity to incremental progression of mineralization, especially at early time points. Without accurate and reliable early diagnosis and intervention, HO progression often results in incapacitating conditions of limited range of motion, nerve entrapment, and pain. We hypothesized that non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging can detect HO at early time points and monitor heterotopic bone turnover longitudinally. C57BL6 mice received an Achilles tenotomy on their left hind limb in combination with a dorsal burn or sham procedure. A calcium-chelating tetracycline derivative (IRDye 680RD BoneTag) was injected bi-weekly and imaged via NIR to measure accumulative fluorescence for 11?wk and compared to in vivo microCT images. Percent retention of fluorescence was calculated longitudinally to assess temporal bone resorption. NIR detected HO as early as five days and revealed a temporal response in HO formation and turnover. MicroCT could not detect HO until 5?wk. Confocal microscopy confirmed fluorophore localization to areas of HO. These findings demonstrate the ability of a near-infrared optical imaging strategy to accurately and reliably detect and monitor HO in a murine model. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Background Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a bone metabolism disorder involving systematic inflammation activation. Blood routine examination is easily available in clinical practice and contains abundant information reflecting the systematic inflammation level. Thus, it is attractive to achieve early diagnosis of PMOP and predict osteoporotic fracture risk just based on the biomarkers in blood routine examination. Methods A multi-centric prospective cohort study was designed and enrolled postmenopausal women from two independent institutions. All participants underwent the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning for diagnosing PMOP. Blood routine examination was conducted, and the key inflammatory biomarkers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were calculated. PMOP patients were followed up to observe osteoporotic fracture and identify the related risk predictors. Results A total of 92 participants out of 238 enrolled postmenopausal women were diagnosed with PMOP, with a prevalence of 38.66%. The main risk factors identified for PMOP included older age (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.14-3.72), longer menopause duration (OR = 3.14, 95% CI = 2.06-4.79), higher NLR (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.37-3.25), and higher SII (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.98-4.61). Besides age and menopause duration, SII ≥834.89 was newly identified as a prominent risk factor for discriminating osteoporotic fracture risk in PMOP patients (HR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.249-10.71). Conclusion As an easy and economical biomarker calculated from blood routine examination, SII not only acts as a good risk predictor for PMOP diagnosis but also well discriminates the osteoporotic fracture risk, which deserves further investigation and application in clinical practice.

AB  - The recent clinical availability of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) opens the door for potential therapeutic repurposing for non-oncological indications. Considering (a) the preclinical efficacy data with PARP inhibitors in non-oncological diseases and (b) the risk?benefit ratio of treating patients with a compound that inhibits an enzyme that has physiological roles in the regulation of DNA repair, we have selected indications, where (a) the severity of the disease is high, (b) the available therapeutic options are limited, and (c) the duration of PARP inhibitor administration could be short, to provide first-line options for therapeutic repurposing. These indications are as follows: acute ischaemic stroke; traumatic brain injury; septic shock; acute pancreatitis; and severe asthma and severe acute lung injury. In addition, chronic, devastating diseases, where alternative therapeutic options cannot halt disease development (e.g. Parkinson's disease, progressive multiple sclerosis or severe fibrotic diseases), should also be considered. We present a preclinical and clinical action plan for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors.
