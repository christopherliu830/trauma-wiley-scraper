AB  - Abstract The term ?catastrophic? antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is defined as an accelerated form of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) usually resulting in multiorgan failure. These patients have in common: (i) clinical evidence of multiple organ involvement developing in a very short time period; (ii) histopathological evidence of multiple small vessel occlusions (a minority also have large vessel thrombosis); and (iii) laboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), usually in high titres. Although less than 1% of patients with the APS develop this complication, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine.

AB  - Abstract Background Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a bone metabolism disorder involving systematic inflammation activation. Blood routine examination is easily available in clinical practice and contains abundant information reflecting the systematic inflammation level. Thus, it is attractive to achieve early diagnosis of PMOP and predict osteoporotic fracture risk just based on the biomarkers in blood routine examination. Methods A multi-centric prospective cohort study was designed and enrolled postmenopausal women from two independent institutions. All participants underwent the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning for diagnosing PMOP. Blood routine examination was conducted, and the key inflammatory biomarkers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were calculated. PMOP patients were followed up to observe osteoporotic fracture and identify the related risk predictors. Results A total of 92 participants out of 238 enrolled postmenopausal women were diagnosed with PMOP, with a prevalence of 38.66%. The main risk factors identified for PMOP included older age (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.14-3.72), longer menopause duration (OR = 3.14, 95% CI = 2.06-4.79), higher NLR (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.37-3.25), and higher SII (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.98-4.61). Besides age and menopause duration, SII ≥834.89 was newly identified as a prominent risk factor for discriminating osteoporotic fracture risk in PMOP patients (HR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.249-10.71). Conclusion As an easy and economical biomarker calculated from blood routine examination, SII not only acts as a good risk predictor for PMOP diagnosis but also well discriminates the osteoporotic fracture risk, which deserves further investigation and application in clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Many years of research have resulted in the successful examples of immunotherapies for many diseases including cancers and inflammatory diseases. These new treatments are referred to as biological therapies-such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine therapies. The recent technological advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) development have caused significant investment and interest in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. Therefore, this chapter will highlight these new advances in the biological therapy arena.

AB  - Summary Neutrophil influx is essential for corneal regeneration (Gan et al. 1999). KM+, a lectin from Artocarpus integrifolia, induces neutrophil migration (Santos-de-Oliveira et al. 1994). This study aims at investigating a possible effect of KM+ on corneal regeneration in rabbits. A 6.0-mm diameter area of debridement was created on the cornea of both eyes by mechanical scraping. The experimental eyes received drops of KM+ (2.5??g/ml) every 2?h. The control eyes received buffer. The epithelial wounded areas of the lectin-treated and untreated eyes were stained with fluorescein, photographed and measured. The animals were killed 12?h (group 1, n?=?5), 24?h (group 2, n?=?10) and 48?h (group 3, n?=?5) after the scraping. The corneas were analysed histologically (haematoxylin and eosin and immunostaining for proliferation cell nuclear antigen, p63, vascular endothelial growth factor, c-Met and laminin). No significant differences were found at the epithelial gap between treated and control eyes in the group 1. However, the number of neutrophils in the wounded area was significantly higher in treated eyes in this group. Three control and seven treated eyes were healed completely and only rare neutrophils persisted in the corneal stroma in group 2. No morphological distinction was observed between treated and control eyes in group 3. In treated corneas of group 2, there was an increase in immunostaining of factors involved in corneal healing compared to controls. Thus, topical application of KM+ may facilitate corneal epithelial wound healing in rabbits by means of a mechanism that involves increased influx of neutrophils into the wounded area induced by the lectin.

AB  - Abstract The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

AB  - Abstract The mechanism by which trauma initiates healing remains unclear. Precise understanding of these events may define interventions for accelerating healing that could be translated to the clinical arena. We previously reported that addition of low-dose recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) at the fracture site augmented fracture repair in a murine tibial fracture model. Here, we show that local rhTNF treatment is only effective when administered within 24 h of injury, when neutrophils are the major inflammatory cell infiltrate. Systemic administration of anti-TNF impaired fracture healing. Addition of rhTNF enhanced neutrophil recruitment and promoted recruitment of monocytes through CCL2 production. Conversely, depletion of neutrophils or inhibition of the chemokine receptor CCR2 resulted in significantly impaired fracture healing. Fragility, or osteoporotic, fractures represent a major medical problem as they are associated with permanent disability and premature death. Using a murine model of fragility fractures, we found that local rhTNF treatment improved fracture healing during the early phase of repair. If translated clinically, this promotion of fracture healing would reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed patient mobilization.
