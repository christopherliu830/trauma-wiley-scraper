AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract Objectively Tendinopathy is a common problem in sports medicine which can lead to severe morbidity. Aspirin, as the classical representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, has been commonly used in treating tendinopathy. While its treatment effects on injury tendon healing are lacking, illuminating the underlying mechanism may provide scientific basis for clinical treatment. Materials and methods Firstly, we used immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect changes in CD14, CD206, iNOS, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-3, TIMP-3, Col-1a1, biglycan, Comp, Fibronectin, TGF-?1?ACAN?EGR-1 and FMOD. Next, Western blot was used to measure the protein levels (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-?1, COMP, TIMP-3, STAT-3/P-STAT-3 and JNK/P-JNK) in TSCs. Then, migration and proliferation of TSCs were measured through wound healing test and BrdU staining. Finally, the mechanical properties of injury tendon were detected. Results After aspirin treatment, the inflammation and scar formation in injury tendon were significantly inhibited by aspirin. Still, tendon's ECM was positively balanced. Increasing migration and proliferation ability of TSCs induced by IL-1? were significantly reversed. JNK/STAT-3 signalling pathway participated in the process above. In addition, biomechanical properties of injury tendon were significantly improved. Conclusions Taken together, the findings suggested that aspirin inhibited inflammation and scar formation via regulation of JNK/STAT-3 signalling and decreased rerupture risk of injury tendon. Aspirin could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the perioperative systemic immunity of laparoscopy-assisted and open radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proven by endoscopy and biopsy were eligible, while patients with preoperative staging of T4, N2?3, or M1 were excluded. Eligible patients willing to undertake laparoscopic surgery in the consecutive cohort were assigned to the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) group, while concurrent patients were assigned to the conventional open gastrectomy (OG) group. All operations were performed with the intention of radical resection. Various immunological parameters were tested in peripheral venous blood collected at preoperative 1st day and postoperative 2nd day (POD2) and 7th day (POD7). SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty patients were included, 15 each in the LAG and OG groups. The general characteristics and short-term outcomes (harvested lymph nodes number, hospital stay, complications, and mortality rate) of the two groups were comparable, but the operation time was significantly longer in LAG (P = 0.001). Moreover, intergroup comparisons indicated no significant differences between the groups in levels of neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, interleukin-6, or interleukin-10 at any time point (P?>?0.05). However, there was a gradual decrease in natural killer cell count in the LAG group up to POD7 (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The changes in systemic immunity markers were comparable between laparoscopy-assisted and open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. However, there was a trend of suppression of natural killer cells in the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy group.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study tested the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer (PU) prevention bundle in reducing the incidence of PUs in critically ill patients in two Saudi intensive care units (ICUs). Design A two-arm cluster randomized experimental control trial. Methods Participants in the intervention group received the PU prevention bundle, while the control group received standard skin care as per the local ICU policies. Data collected included demographic variables (age, diagnosis, comorbidities, admission trajectory, length of stay) and clinical variables (Braden Scale score, severity of organ function score, mechanical ventilation, PU presence, and staging). All patients were followed every two days from admission through to discharge, death, or up to a maximum of 28 days. Data were analyzed with descriptive correlation statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Poisson regression. Findings The total number of participants recruited was 140: 70 control participants (with a total of 728 days of observation) and 70 intervention participants (784 days of observation). PU cumulative incidence was significantly lower in the intervention group (7.14%) compared to the control group (32.86%). Poisson regression revealed the likelihood of PU development was 70% lower in the intervention group. The intervention group had significantly less Stage I (p = .002) and Stage II PU development (p = .026). Conclusions Significant improvements were observed in PU-related outcomes with the implementation of the PU prevention bundle in the ICU; PU incidence, severity, and total number of PUs per patient were reduced. Clinical Relevance Utilizing a bundle approach and standardized nursing language through skin assessment and translation of the knowledge to practice has the potential to impact positively on the quality of care and patient outcome.

AB  - Abstract Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a condition that can develop in about half of the patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of lower limbs. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of inflammatory biomarkers in the early phases of DVT and their correlation with the onset of PTS. Patients were enrolled after the first episode of DVT and were followed up for 1, 4, 8, 12 and 18 months. At each visit, blood sample was collected to evaluate plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1,-2,-3,-7,-8 and -9 MMP inhibitors, TIMP-1,-2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Analysis included 201 patients [86 males (42·79%) and 115 females (57·21%); average age 56 ± 7 years]. Of the 201 patients, 47 (23·38%; 21 males, 26 females) developed PTS during the follow-up period. The control group was made up of 60 individuals without DVT (22 males and 38 females). High plasma levels of MMPs, NGAL and cytokines were recorded during the acute phase after DVT. Moreover, patients with PTS showed higher levels of MMP-1 and MMP-8 with respect to patients without PTS. There is a close relationship between DVT, the individual risk of PTS and specific biomarkers such as MMPs and other related molecules, which may help guide prevention and therapy based on the patient's individual risk profile, and has to be studied in future.

AB  - Abstract Liver injuries can trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses and as a result, initiate the process of hepatic regeneration and fibrogenesis. Resveratrol (RSV) has multiple health-promoting benefits. This study evaluated the potential protective effects and mechanism of RSV as related to cholestatic liver injury. RSV was given (4?mg/kg/day, i.p.) for either 3 days or 7 days after bile duct ligation (BDL) injury. RSV significantly reduced serum ALT, AST but not T-bil on Day 3. At this early stage of injury, RSV significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA and decreased the number of Kupffer cells (CD68+) recruited in the injured liver. RSV decreased hepatic fibrosis and reduced collagen Iα1 and TIMP-1 mRNA on Day 7. At the later stages of injury, RSV increased the number of Ki67+ hepatocytes indicating that RSV promoted hepatocyte proliferation. Additionally, it resulted in decreased expression of 4-hydroxynonenal and increased expression of the hepatocyte growth factor protein and mRNA in the RSV-treated BDL group. Meanwhile, RSV reduced the mortality rate of BDL mice. In conclusion, RSV attenuated inflammation and reduced Kupffer cells activation. RSV decreased fibrosis and promoted hepatocyte regeneration, which increased the survival of BDL mice. RSV was beneficial for the treatment of cholestatic liver injury.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To develop a novel in vitro model for the study of bladder and kidney epithelial cell injury akin to stent movement, as ureteric stents are associated with urinary tract complications that can significantly add to patient morbidity. These sequelae may be linked to inflammation triggered by stent-mediated mechanical injury to the urinary tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS T24 bladder and A498 kidney cell line monolayers were damaged mechanically by segments of either Percuflex Plus? (PP) or Triumph? (triclosan-eluting) stents (both from Boston Scientific Corporation Inc. Natick, MA, USA) and the resulting expression profiles of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors were analysed. RESULTS After control injury using the PP stent, supernatants of both cell lines had significantly increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor BB, and A498 cells also had increased tumour necrosis factor α. In almost all cases, the presence of triclosan within the media abrogated the pro-inflammatory cytokine increases, while its effects on growth factors varied. CONCLUSION This study suggests that stent-related symptoms in the bladder and kidney may be partially due to a local inflammatory response to epithelial damage caused by the presence and movement of the stent. Future stent design should take these inflammatory responses, with respect to physical injury, into consideration, using either more biocompatible materials or anti-inflammatory compounds such as triclosan.

AB  - Abstract Background: Proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be elevated in individuals experiencing chronic stress as well as in those with major depressive disorder. Much less is known about cytokines in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD). We hypothesized that PD and PTSD would be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. Method: We utilized Luminex technology to examine 20 cytokines and chemokines in serum from 48 well-characterized individuals with a primary DSM-IV PD or PTSD diagnosis, and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We conservatively employed a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (α=.05/20=.0025). Results: Individuals with primary PTSD or PD had significantly elevated median peripheral cytokine levels for 18 of 20 different cytokines compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (all P<.0025). To assess for the presence of a generalized proinflammatory state, we also examined the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of at least six of nine common proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, and IFN-α). For men and women, 87% of anxiety patients had six or more detectable levels of these proinflammatory cytokines, compared with only 25% of controls (Fisher's Exact Test (FET) P=.000). Confirmatory analysis of the subset of individuals without current psychiatric medication use or comorbid depression was of comparable significance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a generalized inflammatory state may be present in individuals with PD or PTSD. Depression and Anxiety, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy remain at increased risk for developing febrile neutropenia (FN). For this heterogeneous population, a biomarker based risk stratification of FN patients may be a useful clinical tool. We hypothesized that serum biomarkers during initial presentation of an FN event could be predictive of subsequent clinical outcome. Procedure Eighty-nine FN events from 36 non-consecutive subjects were analyzed. ?High-risk? FN criteria included prolonged hospitalization (≥7 days), admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or a microbiology confirmed bacteremia. Patients with ?low risk? FN had none of the above. Biomarkers measured during the first 2 days of FN hospitalization were analyzed and correlated with respective clinical outcome. Results Of the 89 FN events, 44 (49%) fulfilled pre-defined high-risk criteria and 45 (51%) were low-risk. Procalcitonin level (>0.11?ng/ml) was found to be associated with the high-risk FN outcome with sensitivity of 97%. With an increase in log scale by 1, the odds of being high-risk FN increased twofold. Hs-CRP >100?mg/L had sensitivity of 88% in predicting high-risk FN. The odds of a high-risk FN event increased by approximately 1.8-fold with an increase in the log scale of hs-CRP by 1 (10-fold). In univariate analysis, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were statistically significant and associated with high-risk FN. However, no statistically significant difference was found for IL-1α, sIL-2Ra, IL-3, or TNF-α. Conclusions Biomarkers with appropriate critical threshold values may be a useful clinical tool for appropriate risk stratification of children with FN.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Chitosan (CS), a polysaccharide derived from chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide, is widely used in the medical world because of its natural and nontoxic properties and its innate ability for antibacterial and hemostasis effects. In this study, the novel composites containing CS and cellulose (CEL) (i.e., [CEL?+?CS]), which we have previously synthesized using a green and totally recyclable method, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity, absorption of anticoagulated whole blood, anti-inflammatory activity through the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the biocompatibility with human fibroblasts. The [CEL?+?CS] composites were found to inhibit the growth of both Gram positive and negative micro-organisms. For examples, the regenerated 100% lyophilized chitosan material was found to reduce growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739 and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51299) by 78, 36, and 64%, respectively. The composites are nontoxic to fibroblasts; that is, fibroblasts, which are critical to the formation of connective tissue matrix were found to grow and proliferate in the presence of the composites. They effectively absorb blood, and at the same rate and volume as commercially available wound dressings. The composites, in both air-dried and lyophilized forms, significantly inhibit the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by stimulated macrophages. These results clearly indicate that the biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic [CEL?+?CS] composites, particularly those dried by lyophilizing, can be effectively used as a material in wound dressings. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - SUMMARY Glutamine is the most abundant amino-acid in the extra- and intracellular compartments of the human body, which accounts for over 50% of its free amino-acid content. Utilization of glutamine peptides is explicitly useful, resulting in a decrease in the number of postoperative infectious complications, period of hospitalization, and therapeutic costs. This article aims to study the effects of glutamine on systemic inflammatory response, morbidity, and mortality after esophagectomy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled trial was used. Following sealed-envelope block randomization, the patients were divided into two groups. Members of the glutamine group (group G) received glutamine (Dipeptiven, Fresenius) as continuous infusion for 6 hours at 0.5?g/kg for 3 days prior to, and 7 days following surgery; while patients of the control group were given placebo. We examined 30 patients in group G, and 25 patients as controls. In both patient groups, the levels of total protein, albumin, pre-albumin, retinol binding protein, transferrin, transferring-saturation, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lymphocte, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum lactate were determined prior to surgery (t0), directly after surgery (tu), following surgery on day 1 (t1), day 2 (t2), and day 7 (t7). For statistical analysis Mann?Whitney U test and chi-square test were used. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding age, male/female ratio, and SAPS II scores. Intensive care unit morbidity and mortality was similar in both groups (group G: 24 survivors/6 nonsurvivors; Control: 17 survivors/8 nonsurvivors; P= 0.607). Daily Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score did not differ significantly between the two groups. The observed inflammatory markers followed the pattern we described without significant difference. Based on our study, the glutamine supplementation that we used had no influence on morbidity, mortality, or postoperative inflammatory response after esophagectomy.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in young individuals worldwide. However, the understanding of TBI at secondary phase remained obscure, and more knowledge of the pathophysiology of TBI is necessary. In this study, we examined the influence of bone fracture (BF) on TBI and investigated whether blocking high mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein, an inflammatory mediator, could be effective to alleviate TBI. We found neurological severity was significantly increased by BF at 4 days post-TBI with longer removal time of adhesive tape and higher percentage of left turn in the corner test compared to TBI treatment alone. Additionally, higher brain lesion volume and severer brain oedema in TBI + BF mice supports the negative effect of BF on TBI. HMGB1 level was significantly stimulated by BF, suggesting the important role of HMGB1 in the development of secondary TBI. Notably, ablation of HMGB1 significantly reduced this negative influence of BF on TBI. These results suggest that HMGB1 can be massively induced by the systemic immune activation triggered by BF, which in turn aggravates inflammation. Blocking HMGB1 reduced the inflammatory effect of BF and therefore helps lessen the severity of secondary TBI. In conclusion, these results provided the evidence that anti-HMGB1 may be an effective and feasible method to alleviate TBI.

AB  - ABSTRACT The current experiments examined the impact of early-life immune activation and a subsequent mild immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 25µg/kg) on hippocampal-dependent learning, proinflammatory cytokine expression in the brain, and peripheral immune function in juvenile male and female rats at P24, an age when hippocampal-dependent learning and memory first emerges. Our results indicate that neonatal infection did not produce learning deficits in the hippocampal-dependent context pre-exposure facilitation effect paradigm in juvenile males and females, contrary to what has been observed in adults. Neonatal infection produced an increase in baseline IL-1? expression in the hippocampus (HP) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of juvenile rats. Furthermore, neonatally infected rats showed exaggerated IL-1? expression in the HP following LPS treatment as juveniles; and juvenile females, but not males, showed exaggerated IL-1? expression in the mPFC following LPS treatment. Neonatal infection attenuated the production of IL-6 expression following LPS treatment in both the brain and the spleen, and neonatal infection decreased the numbers of circulating white blood cells in juvenile males and females, an effect that was further exacerbated by subsequent LPS treatment. Together, our data indicate that the consequences of neonatal infection are detectable even early in juvenile development, though we found no concomitant hippocampal-dependent learning deficits at this young age. These findings underscore the need to consider age and associated on-going neurodevelopmental processes as important factors contributing to the emergence of cognitive and behavioral disorders linked to early-life immune activation. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Quantum dots (QDs) are novel tools with multiple biological and medical applications because of their superior photoemission and photostability characteristics. However, leaching of toxic metals from QDs is of great concern. Therefore, for the successful application of QDs in bioscience, it is essential to understand their biological fate and toxicity. We investigated toxicological effects and tissue distribution of mercaptopropionic acid-conjugated cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS-MPA) QDs after repeated intraperitoneal injection into BALB/c mice. The mice were injected every 3?days with various doses of QDs (0, 5, 10 and 25?mg?kg?1). The subsequent effects of QDs on plasma levels of various biomarkers were evaluated at different time points (at 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 15?days). Various tissue samples (spleen, liver, lung, kidneys, brain, heart and thymus) were collected for toxicity analysis, distribution testing, histopathological examination and inflammation assessment. No abnormal clinical signs or behaviors were recorded but the body weight of mice treated with 25?mg?kg?1 QDs was significantly decreased from day 7 compared with control mice. QDs were observed in the liver, spleen, lung and kidneys, but not in brain or heart. Significantly higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase were found in the plasma, liver and spleen. Histopathological examination did not show any tissue toxicity but the levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory marker, were increased in the plasma, liver and spleen. All of these findings provide insight into the observed toxicological effect levels and tissue-specific distribution of CdSe/CdS-MPA QDs. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptaminei agonist (sumatriptan). Methods: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan: 0.01 mg·kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg·kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg·kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg·kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro. Results: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro. Conclusion: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.

AB  - Aim To analyze the prognostic impact of short-term changes in the intensity of delirium in association or not with sepsis. We also aimed to analyze if s100B, a serum protein derived from astrocytes related to cerebral damage, could be a marker of delirium or sepsis. Methods We included 47 patients with acute delirium and sepsis, 36 with delirium and no evidence of infection, and 36 patients with sepsis without delirium. The diagnosis of delirium was established by the Confusion Assessment Method. To evaluate delirium, we recorded the following characteristics on the first and third day after admission: level of consciousness, orientation, attention, hallucinations, psychomotor activity, language and disorganized thinking. Results In 53 patients, delirium improved during hospitalization with 3.8% of mortality, whereas in the 30 patients in which delirium did not improve or worsened, 50% died during hospitalization. The improvement on the third day of consciousness, orientation, attention and disorganized thinking was related to a better long-term survival. s100B and inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and interferon-? were increased in patients with sepsis and confusion when compared with control participants; furthermore, s100B, interleukin-6 and interferon-? were increased in septic patients without confusion, but also in delirious patients without sepsis. Conclusions The main factor related to mortality was the recovery from delirium during hospitalization. We found increased s100B serum levels in patients with delirium, but also in septic patients without delirium. This increase was not related to mortality. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 1161?1167.

AB  - Abstract Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) play a crucial role in dental pulp inflammation. Pannexin 3 (Panx3), a member of Panxs (Pannexins), has been recently found to be involved in inflammation. However, the mechanism of Panx3 in human dental pulp inflammation remains unclear. In this study, the role of Panx3 in inflammatory response was firstly explored, and its potential mechanism was proposed. Immunohistochemical staining showed that Panx3 levels were diminished in inflamed human and rat dental pulp tissues. In vitro, Panx3 expression was significantly down-regulated in HDPCs following a TNF-α challenge in a concentration-dependent way, which reached the lowest level at 10 ng/ml of TNF-α. Such decrease could be reversed by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Unlike MG132, BAY 11-7082, a NF-?B inhibitor, even reinforced the inhibitory effect of TNF-α. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to investigate the role of Panx3 in inflammatory response of HDPCs. TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-6, were significantly lessened when Panx3 was overexpressed in HDPCs. Conversely, Panx3 knockdown exacerbated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, Western blot, dual-luciferase reporter assay, immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR and ELISA results showed that Panx3 participated in dental pulp inflammation in a NF-?B-dependent manner. These findings suggested that Panx3 has a defensive role in dental pulp inflammation, serving as a potential target to be exploited for the intervention of human dental pulp inflammation.
