AB  - Abstract Several recent studies have demonstrated that the activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) by thrombin and activated protein C (APC) on cultured vascular endothelial cells elicits paradoxical proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses, respectively. Noting that the protective intracellular signaling activity of APC requires the interaction of the protease with its receptor, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), we recently hypothesized that the occupancy of EPCR by protein C may also change the PAR-1-dependent signaling specificity of thrombin. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that EPCR is associated with caveolin-1 in lipid rafts of endothelial cells and that the occupancy of EPCR by the Gla-domain of protein C/APC leads to its dissociation from caveolin-1 and recruitment of PAR-1 to a protective signaling pathway through the coupling of PAR-1 to the pertussis toxin sensitive Gi-protein. Thus, when EPCR is bound by protein C, a PAR-1-dependent protective signaling response in cultured endothelial cells can be mediated by either thrombin or APC. This article will briefly review the mechanism by which the occupancy of EPCR by its natural ligand modulates the PAR-1-dependent signaling specificity of coagulation proteases. ? 2011 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 63(6): 390?396, 2011

AB  - Abstract Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in the United States. The majority of these deaths are due to metastasis, with the liver easily accounting as the most common site of deposit. While there are multiple steps in the CRC hepatic metastatic cascade, this review attempts to summarize the different processes involved, focusing on the most recent discoveries, as well as the associated effects in relation to prognosis.

AB  - Studies on HIV acquisition and transmission in women exposed to sexual trauma throughout their life cycle are lacking, but some findings suggest that rates of HIV acquisition through coercive sex are significantly higher than that seen in consensual sex. Sexual trauma can also occur as a result of female genital mutilation, which makes sex extremely painful and can cause increased abrasions, lacerations, and inflammation, which enhances the risk of HIV acquisition. This review presents an overview of the immune system in the human female reproductive tract (FRT) from adolescence, through puberty to pregnancy and menopause. What is clear is that the foundation of information on immune protection in the FRT throughout the life cycle of women is extremely limited and at some stages such as adolescence and menopause are grossly lacking. Against this backdrop, forced or coercive sexual intercourse as well as genital mutilation further complicates our understanding of the biological risk factors that can result in transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a devastating disease with very poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and resistance to traditional chemotherapies and radiotherapies. Herein, thioacetamide (TAA)-induced rat CCA model and CGCCA cell line were used; we aim to study the cytogenetic features during tumoral development of CCA and uncover the mystery regarding carcinogenesis of CCA. The Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis, in silico method, gene knockdown, Western blot, cell count proliferation assay, clonogenecity assay, and IHC staining were applied in this study. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis was performed on all different TAA-induced phases of rat tissues to reveal the certain pattern, +2q45, +Xq22, ?12p12, have been identified for the tumor early stage, where involve the gene TNNI3K. In addition, 16 genes and 3 loci were associated with rapid tumor progression; JAK-STAT signaling pathway was highly correlated to late stage of CCA. In silico database was used to observe TNNI3K was highly express at tumor part compared with normal adjacent tissue in CCA patients from TCGA dataset. Furthermore, the growth of TNNI3K-knockdown SNU308 and HuCCT1 cells decreased when compared with cells transfected with an empty vector cell demonstrated by proliferation and colonogenecity assay. Besides, over expression of TNNI3K was especially confirmed on human CCA tumors and compared with the intrahepatic duct stone bile duct tissues and normal bile duct tissues (P?<?0.001). Our findings might uncover the mystery regarding carcinogenesis of CCA, and provide the potential genetic mechanism to the clinicians some ideas for the patients? treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is difficult to manage and can result in significant patient morbidity. Currently, the clinical use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for painful tendons has received attention, but its efficacy remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of PRP and its biological components. A total of 156 patients with LE were randomly divided into group 1, treated with a single injection of 2-ml autologous PRP, and group 2, treated with a control received only physical therapy without injection. Both groups used a tennis elbow strap and performed stretching and strengthening exercises during 24 weeks? follow-up. Pain and functional improvements were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), Modified Mayo Clinic Performance Index for the elbow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). White blood cell count, platelet count, and levels of platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), PDGF-BB, transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and interleukin-1 ? in PRP were measured and investigated for statistical correlation with the clinical score. At 24 weeks, all pain and functional variables, including VAS score, Mayo Clinic performance scores, and MRI grade, improved significantly in group 1 (p?<?0.05). PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-? levels were more significantly increased in PRP than in whole blood. TGF-? level significantly correlated with Mayo Clinic performance score and MRI grade improvement. Thus, TGF-? level in PRP is considered to play a pivotal role in tendon healing. These results may contribute to identifying the best protocol for PRP application in tendinopathies. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is an important problem that remains undertreated, even by rheumatologists. We present a case of an elderly patient with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed more than 40?years ago, who suffered from recurrent fractures and attendant complications despite a bone mineral density (BMD) score in the osteopenic range and treatment with bisphosphonates. With improved treatment and outcome of lupus, an increasing number of elderly patients who are susceptible to osteoporotic fractures are expected. This case serves to highlight that rheumatic disease patients on steroids should be screened for GIO, as effective treatment and preventive measures are available. Teriparatide is a promising treatment for patients who have failed bisphosphonate treatment or who are at high risk for fracture. We should also bear in mind that BMD scores alone are not indicative of fracture risk, and other tools such as the WHO-FRAX (Fracture risk assessment tool), serum vitamin D3 levels and bone turnover markers should be used where appropriate. Other measures including attention to factors that contribute to falls should also be considered, necessitating a multi-disciplinary approach.

Am J Reprod Immunol 2011; 65: 212?219 For many years, the focus of attention in the study of semen has been on spermatozoa, its major cellular component, given their importance in the process of reproduction, and the role of the seminal fluid as their transport medium. More recently, evidence has accumulated of the complexity of seminal fluid, its components that perturb the female reproductive tract in ways promoting both survival of spermatozoa there-in and facilitating the implantation of embryos within the endometrium, hence initiating pregnancy. These same factors, however, may also make the female reproductive tract susceptible to invasion not only by spermatozoa but viruses, playing a significant role in the male-to-female transmission of HIV. Knowledge of the histology, anatomy, and immunology of the male reproductive tract is essential in understanding its role in HIV pathogenesis.
