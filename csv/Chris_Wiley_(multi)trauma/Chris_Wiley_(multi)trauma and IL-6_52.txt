AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) in older persons is a common medical problem that is seen in both the ambulatory and institutional settings. It affects older women and men with a gender prevalence ratio of 2:1, respectively. UTI in older persons can be a complex problem in terms of the approach to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In this report the discussion will begin with the unique aspects of UTI in older persons, particularly as they relate to UTI in the younger, general population. The remaining discussion will then focus on three complicated clinical circumstances and conditions of UTI in the geriatric population: non-catheter recurrent UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and catheter-related bacteriuria and UTI.

AB  - Summary Functional foods fall into two broad categories: plant origin and animal origin. A review conducted in 1992 proves that plant-based foods have some components that act against lethal diseases, such as cancer. A vast number of components, such as fish oil and dairy products naturally present in animal sources are potentially beneficial to health. Nutraceuticals deliver a concentrated form of a biologically active component from a food to enhance health in dosages that exceed those that could be obtained from regular food. The use of probiotics in combination with prebiotic has been very effective against several chronic diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics provide an alternate source for the management of different intestinal disorders. The major contributions associated with the work of probiotics on human health are proper colonic function and increased metabolism. Research indicates that there is an estimated global market for functional foods of US$33 billion.

AB  - Background: Multiple idiopathic root resorption (MIRR) is a rare condition in man characterized by cervical resorption leading to significant tooth loss. A similar condition, feline osteoclastic resorptive lesions (FORL), affects up to 70% of domestic cats and thus provides a valuable model for investigating the etiopathogenesis of MIRR. The aim of the present study was to establish changes in the surface microanatomy of the tooth in late stage FORL and to identify whether its location has a surface bias. Methods: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the surface features of enamel and cementum of feline teeth affected with advanced FORL. Results: Resorption involved the coronal root at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) in 95% of teeth and focal resorption of intact enamel was observed in 14% of teeth. In 55% of teeth, the main lesion was on the buccal surface and a distinct circumferential resorption ?front? was present at the apical margin of resorption. The root surfaces of most affected teeth either lacked extrinsic fibers or cellular lacunae or featured evidence of cementum remodeling. Woven bone-like tissue was found within lesions, on resorbed dentin, or on the root surface in 27% of teeth. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that most FORL involve the CEJ, and the presence of focal lesions at this site suggests that this is where resorption is initiated. This implies that local factors in the oral microenvironment play a role in the etiopathogenesis of this condition. The study also shows that FORL are more likely to occur on buccal surfaces and are associated with changes in the microarchitecture of the root surface consistent with destruction of the normal periodontal attachment and stimulation of a reparative response. These findings may be relevant to understanding the etiopathogenesis of multiple idiopathic resorption areas in man. J Periodontol 2005;76:1106-1112.

AB  - Abstract Keloid scars are described as benign fibro-proliferative dermal outgrowths that commonly occur in pigmented skin post cutaneous injury, and continue to grow beyond the boundary of the original wound margin. There is a lack of thorough understanding of keloid pathogenesis and thus keloid therapeutic options remain ill-defined. In view of the poor response to current therapy and high recurrence rates, there is an unmet need in improving our knowledge and therefore in identifying targeted and effective treatment strategies in management of keloids. Keloid research however, is hampered by a lack of relevant animal models as keloids do not spontaneously occur in animals and are unique to human skin. Therefore, developing novel animal models and nonanimal models for functional evaluation of keloid cells and tissue for better understanding their pathobiology and response to putative candidate therapies are essential. Here, we present the key concepts and relevant emerging research on two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell and tissue models for functional testing of keloid scars. We will describe in detail current models including in vitro mono- and co-cultures, multi-cellular spheroids (organoids) and organotyopic cultures, ex vivo whole skin keloid tissue organ culture models as well as in vivo human patient models. Finally, we discuss the role played by time as the fourth dimension in a novel model that involves sequential temporal biopsies of human patients with keloids (a so called 4D in vivo human model). The use of these unique models will no doubt prove pivotal in identification of new drug targets as well as biomarkers, in functional testing of emerging novel therapeutics, and in enhancing our understanding of keloid disease biology.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disease with multifactorial etiology caused by risk factors. The degradation of aggrecan by upregulated ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) is the key event in the development of OA. ADAMTS-4 contributes to aggrecan degradation in human OA. Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61), which is associated with diseases related to chronic inflammation, is found in articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis and appears to suppress ADAMTS-4 activity, possibly leading to chondrocyte cloning. Herein, we first revealed that Cyr61 and ADAMTS-4 protein levels were remarkably increased in OA cartilage tissues and OA chondrocytes, and verified Cyr61 regulation of ADAMTS-4 in normal and OA chondrocyte. Further, we revealed that Cyr61 could promote OA chondrocyte proliferation through inhibiting ADAMTS-4. Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines plays a vital role in the pathological development of OA; herein, we demonstrated that IL-1? inhibited Cyr61, while promoted ADAMTS-4 expression. By using online tools and luciferase assays, we confirmed that miR-34a, a regulatory miRNA of chondrocyte proliferation, could directly bind to the 3?-UTR of Cyr61 to inhibit its expression; further, IL-1? regulated Cyr61 and ADAMTS-4 expression through miR-34a. In OA cartilage tissues, miR-34a, and IL-1? mRNA expression was up-regulated and positively correlated; miR-34a and Cyr61 mRNA was positively correlated, further indicating that suppressing miR-34a expression might rescue IL-1?-induced Cyr61 suppression, and promote OA chondrocyte proliferation. Taken together, we provided novel experimental basis for rescuing OA chondrocyte proliferation through miR-34a/Cyr61 axis.

AB  - Purpose:?? The multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) has been widely adopted as standard of care for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there is little evidence to support the MDM, and individual clinician attitudes have not been studied. Methods:?? Clinicians involved in patients with CRC patients completed a questionnaire. The study was conducted in 2008 at 5 institutions, including MDM naïve (NG) and experienced groups (EG), with repetition in 6?months. The impact of the MDM was prospectively studied at a hospital from 7/7/08 to 22/12/08. The initial plan and the final consensus were recorded. Results:?? 22 clinicians completed the survey. The clinicians in the NG stated that there was an influence of MDM on routine patient management in 40% of patients. After 6?months, in both the EG and the NG, the MDM was felt to have an impact on the patients? management in >70% of cases (p = 0.16). 115 cases (91 patients) were discussed at the MDM. The median age was 65?years (range 26 to 101) with 48% males. The locations were colonic 53 (46%), rectum 40 (35%), anus 6 (5%) and other 16 (14%). 80 (69%) were discussed at the time of initial diagnosis. In 79 (69%) the main issue was chemotherapy and/or radiation administration. In 17 (52%) patients it was decided that further investigations were required. There was an impact on the management in 33 (29%) patients. A change in treatment intent occurred, either curative or palliative, in 5 (15%) patients. Conclusion:?? Clinicians involved in an MDM believe that this influences management in majority of patients with impact on management of almost a third of patients discussed. The multidisciplinary meeting is valuable in the treatment of colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - Purpose:?? Significant pain and discomfort are reported by a proportion of patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids. Several nerve blocks have been trialled with varied results. The aim of this study was to determine whether an anal intersphincteric nerve block may reduce post-operative pain and analgesic requirements in these patients. Methodology:?? One hundred sequential patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids were randomised to either an anal intersphincteric nerve block using 0.5% Marcaine with adrenaline or to the control group. The procedures were performed by a single surgeon using the KilRoid (TM) rubber band ligator (Astratech ? Sweden). Patients were assessed for pain and analgesic use in the immediate post operative period and at 24?hours. Both the patient and data collector were blinded to whether a nerve block had been administered. Results:?? There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in median post operative pain (3.0 vs. 2.0 p > 0.0.29), median post operative analgesic use (1.6 vs. 3.3 p = 0.62), median pain score at 24 hour (4.14 vs. 4.22 p = 0.9) and median analgesic use at 24 hours (1.0 vs. 1.0 p = 0.13). Conclusions:?? There is no benefit from performing an intersphincteric nerve block in patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes have demonstrated significant reduction in hospital stay for patient undergoing colonic surgery, however their impact on long term outcomes such as Post Operative Fatigue (POF) has not been fully established. Aim: To assess the impact of an ERAS programme on POF and recovery following elective open colonic surgery. Method:?? In a prospective study, 26 consecutive patients undergoing open colonic surgery under a conventional care plan were compared to 26 consecutive patients in an ERAS programme. Results:?? Demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable at baseline. The median duration of total hospital-stay (4 v 7?days p < 0.001), rates of urinary-tract infections (p = 0.028) and ileus (p = 0.042) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Postoperatively, POF significantly increased in both groups. However peak POF score was significantly lower in the ERAS group (p = 0.001). In the first 30?days after surgery, Fatigue Consequence scores were also significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Overall, the total fatigue experience (p = 0.035) and the total fatigue impact (p = 0.005) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Conclusion:?? The impact of ERAS programmes may extend beyond the commonly reported short term outcomes and ERAS may accelerate overall recovery and return to normal function.

AB  - Purpose:?? The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge relating to risk factors, tumorigenesis and survival of patients with metachronous colorectal cancer to address potential advances in surveillance and management of patients with colorectal cancer. Methodology:?? The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Ovid databases were searched from 1966 to December 2008 for both published reviews and published articles on metachronous colorectal cancer regarding incidence, carcinoma sequence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, detection, treatment, surveillance and survival. Further articles were obtained by a manual review of the reference lists of all retrieved articles. All publications relevant to this study were included. Results:?? Factors likely to increase the risk of developing metachronous colorectal cancer include; age, personal and family history of multiple malignancies, synchronous polyps, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and microsatellite instability. Conclusion:?? Pre-operative colonoscopic polyp status and biopsy analysis regarding microsatellite instability are essential in identifying patients at risk of metachronous colorectal cancer. A rapid adenoma-carcinoma sequence less than the accepted 2 to 5?years would warrant stringent colonoscopic surveillance. Thus, frequent colonoscopic surveillance is recommended, within the first 5?years post-operatively, for the detection of metachronous colorectal cancer.

AB  - Introduction:?? Post-operative fatigue (POF) is an important indicator of recovery after major surgery. Recent data have suggested a relationship between the post-operative peritoneal cytokine response and development of POF. Glucocorticoids decrease the production of cytokines and thus we hypothesised that administration of dexamethasone to patients undergoing colonic surgery may decrease peritoneal cytokine production and POF. Aim:?? To assess the influence of 8?mg of pre-op IV Dexamethasone on peritoneal cytokine and POF in patients undergoing elective colonic surgery. Method: In a double blinded RCT, 70 consecutive patients undergoing elective, open colonic resection were administered 8?mg I.V. Dexamethasone or saline (Placebo) prior to surgery. All patients were treated within a structured Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program. Results:?? After exclusions there were 31 patients in the Placebo group and 29 in the Dex group. At baseline there were no differences in the age, ASA, BMI or CR-POSSUM scores. Dexamethasone was associated with a significant reduction in Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-13 in the peritoneum and IL-6 and IL-8 in plasma. Subsequently, patients in the Dex group had lesser POF and fatigue impact scores at days 3 and 7. Patients in the Dex group had less post-op nausea and vomiting. There was no significant increase in complications. Conclusion:?? Preoperative Dexamethasone administration is associated with a significantly diminished post-operative pro-inflammatory reaction which is associated with clinical benefits in POF and its impact. This intervention may be an effective method of improving outcomes for patients undergoing major colonic surgery within a multimodal enhanced peri-operative care pathway.
