AB  - Purpose:?? Rectal mucosal advancement flaps (RMAF) and fistula plugs (FP) are techniques used to manage complex anal fistulas. The purpose of this study was to review and compare the results of these methods of repair. Methodology:?? A retrospective review of all complex anal fistulas treated, by either a RMAF or a FP, at Auckland City Hospital from 2004 to 2008. Comparisons were made in terms of successful healing rates, time to failure and the use of MRI. Results:?? Overall, 70 operations were performed on 55 patients (55.7% male). The mean age was 44.9?years. 21 patients (30%) had had at least 1 previous unsuccessful repair. Indications for repair included 57 high cryptoglandular anal (81%), 4 Crohn's anal (6%), 7 rectovaginal (10%), 1 rectourethral (1%) and 1 pouch-vaginal fistula (1%). All patients were followed up with a mean of 4.5?months. 48 RMAF's (69% of total) were performed with 16 successful repairs (33%). 22 FP's (31% of total) were performed with 7 successful repairs (32%, p = 0.9). In failed repairs, there was no difference in terms of mean time to failure (RMAF 4.8?months vs. FP 4.1?months, p = 0.62). MRI was performed in 21 patients (37%) before the repair. The success rate in these patients was 20%. Conclusion:?? The results of treatment of complex anal fistulas are disappointing. The choice of operation of either a RMAF or a FP did not alter the poor healing rates of about one third of patients in each group.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cause of cancer deaths in Australia. Some studies recently reported disturbing rates of metachronous colorectal cancer occurring early after curative treatment of the index tumour. Poor bowel preparation and polypectomy during colonoscopy may increase the risk of metachronous cancer, by causing cancerous lesions to be missed and tumour seeding respectively. This study examines these two factors in association with the timing of metachronous recurrence. Methods:?? This is a retrospective audit utilising a database of all patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy at Flinders Medical Centre and Repatriation General Hospital. Patients were identified using the database, with subsequent case note review. Patients with familial disorders or disease recurrence at anastomotic sites within 12?months were excluded. This audit has been approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of both hospitals. Results:?? Colorectal cancers were identified in 569 patients, of whom 15 (2.6%) had metachronous cancers. There were 10 men and 5 women with average age of 74?years. Bowel preparation was categorised as good (7 patients), moderate (1 patient) and poor (1 patient). Quality of bowel preparation was not available for 6 patients (4 had no comments documented and 2 had colonoscopies performed elsewhere). Of the 4 patients who had biopsy of polyps found during the initial colonoscopy, 1 developed metachronous cancer in the same area at 60?months. Conclusion:?? Poor bowel preparation may contribute to missed lesions presenting as early metachronous cancers. Seeding into polypectomy sites does not appear to be a problem.

AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic anterior resection for rectal cancer remains controversial due to the possibility of a positive circumferential margin with the laparoscopic approach. The ?hybrid procedure? has been performed with laparoscopic colonic mobilization but rectal dissection is through a Pfannenstiel incision. Methods:?? Data from a prospective single institution rectal cancer database was used to compare hybrid, converted and open anterior resections for mid and low rectal cancer from February 2003 to August 2008. Results:?? There were 253 patients found. There were 66 (26%) hybrid (H), 5 (2%) converted (C) and 182 (72%) open (O) cases. The median follow up all 3 groups was similar. 30 (h), 28 (C), 34 (O)?months. The median length of stay (days) was shorter in the (H) group. [6.5 (H), 10 (C), 9 (O), p = 0.001. There was a trend to a higher ASA score, age, median BMI, more wound infections and higher stage in the (O) group. The circumferential margin was involved in 6 (O) group compared with 0 in H) or (C) group (p = 0.5). There were no significant differences in local recurrences [1.1% (O) vs. 1.5% (H&C)] or T stage. There was no difference in neoadjuvant radiation, (48 (26%) (O), 20 (30%) (H), 1 (20%), p = 0.9. The median lymph node count was 11 in each group. The 2?year overall survival was the same both groups, 90% (H), 89% (O) 100% (C) (p = 0.65) as was the progression free survival 76% (H), 64%(O), 80% (C), (p = 0.32). Conclusion:?? The hybrid procedure results in improved short term outcomes for patients with rectal cancer compared to open cases. The hybrid approach did not compromise circumferential margins or lymph node yield, and has no effect in short term progression free or overall survival.

AB  - Introduction:?? Follow up after curative resection for colorectal cancer has been demonstrated to improve survival and failure to attend (FTA) may compromise patient outcomes. The incidences of FTA and the causes have not been documented. Methods:?? Patients were identified from a prospective clinical database and a hospital based appointment system. FTA follow up was defined as non-attendance of at least one appointment, within 5?years post operatively. A phone interview was used to evaluate the cause. Patients from a non-English speaking background (NESB) were contacted with interpreters. Results:?? From January 2003 to May 2008 622 patients with stage I-III cancer were identified, including 202 from a NESB. 125 non-attendees were identified. 61 patients (70%) were contacted from 87 surviving patients. 26 could not be located and 38 patients were deceased. Of the 61 patients studied, 32(52%) were male. The mean age was 68?years (range 33, 102). 14 patients (23%) were from a NESB. Each non-attendant averaged 16 appointments, and 1.7 failed attendances. A median of > 13?months elapsed from diagnosis to 1st missed appointment. The main reasons for non attendance were: unaware of the appointment (n = 21), inconvenience due to time or travel (n = 14), poor health (n = 10), long waiting times (n = 8), forgetting (n = 6) and other (n = 2). Age, sex and number of booked appointments were not associated with non-attendance. Conclusion:?? Failure to attend follow-up appointments is common. Overall, access to follow up was prevented by structural factors more than disease/patient factors. A common reason for non-attendance was that patients were unaware of the appointment. Opportunities for significantly improving attendance include a reminder system.

AB  - Introduction:?? The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHSBCSP) has been running since September 2006. Its impact on the workload of colorectal units has not currently been assessed. Aims: To determine the initial increased in workload resulting from screen detected cancers detected by the NHSBCSP. Methods:?? Cancers detected by the local NHSBCSP were reviewed with respect to: operative intervention, Dukes? stage, post operative complications, and neo-adjuvant therapy. Results: Between September 2006 to Jan 2008 100 screen detected cancers were identified. Twenty eight were located in the rectum, 38 sigmoid colon, 2 descending colon, 9 transverse colon, 10 ascending colon, and 13 within the caecum. Of the 100 cases 18 were polyp cancers, 3 of which proceed to a subsequent resection, (2 anterior resections and 1 right hemicolectomy). Of the remaining 82 cases 38 patients had an anterior resection, 26 right hemicolectomy, 5 abdominal perineal resection, 3 sigmoid colectomy and 1 subtotal colectomy. Nine patients had no operative intervention; 5 due to metastatic disease and 4 as a result of patient choice. Thirty five patients had Dukes? stage A, 31 Dukes? B, 17 Dukes? C, and 5 Dukes? D. There were 8 major post operative complications: 6 anastomotic leaks, 1 colo-pouch-vaginal fistula, and one death. Two patients who underwent resections for polyp cancers failed to have the polyp scar removed at the time of surgery. Conclusion:?? The local NHS colorectal cancer screening programme has resulted in a significant shift towards Dukes? stage A and B cancers at time of presentation. However it has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of colorectal resections, 76 between September 06 to Jan 2008.

AB  - Purpose:?? We investigated the use of ?Surgisis? anorectal fistula plug in the treatment of anorectal fistula. Success rates quoted have been variable. There is no known data regarding when to reattempt the ?Surgisis? plug if failure occurs. We assessed our success rate and looked at any pattern for reinsertion of the ?Surgisis? anorectal plug. Methodology:?? We retrospectively collected patient/fistula characteristics, procedure details, and follow-up information for all patients treated with the anal fistula plug at our institution over the past 5?years. The outcome was considered successful if the external and internal opening were closed and if the patient had no drainage at the last follow-up. Results:?? Of 16 patients, 21 fistulae were treated with the ?Surgisis? anorectal fistula plug. 28.5% had complete healing after the first attempt at insertion of the ?Surgisis? plug, while 28.5% required a reinsertion of the ?Surgisis? plug for complete healing to occur. 43% failed to heal with the insertion of the ?Surgisis? plug or were awaiting follow-up. The period of time between insertion of seton, subsequent failure and insertion of ?Surgisis? plug was extremely variable. Median time taken was 220 (41?553)?days. Following this the median time taken for reinsertion was 303 (151?495)?days. Conclusion:?? Collectively our success rate for ?Surgisis? plug insertion is 57% however only 28.5% after first insertion. There is no clear relationship between the time period and the success of reinsertion of the ?Surgisis? plug. More data is required to give clear guidelines for timing of ?Surgisis? plug reinsertion.

AB  - Parastomal hernia can be a difficult clinical scenario to manage and a significant technical challenge to repair. The reported incidence of parastomal hernia formation varies depending on type of ostomy created. Reported rates vary between 6% for loop ileostomy and 48% for end colostomy. Indications for repair include parastomal or abdominal pain, obstructive symptoms and appliance failure. Techniques for repair include direct closure of parastomal defects, mesh repair and relocation. These techniques will be presented for discussion.

AB  - Purpose:?? Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) is an essential skill that newly qualified doctors are expected to have, but what are they like in reality? Methods:?? Newly qualified doctors were asked to complete a questionnaire. Their responses to clinical scenarios, diagnosis of anal conditions as well as confidence in DRE were assessed. Results:?? 90 (52 F, 38 M) newly qualified doctors responded to our questionnaire (response rate of 90%). 69 (77%) of doctors have never felt a rectal tumour, many felt uncomfortable diagnosing anal and rectal cancers and two thirds of respondents had only performed up to ten DREs before graduation. Although 78 (87%) had been taught how to perform a DRE, a third of doctors were not confident in performing this examination, and the vast majority (91%) did not have their findings checked by a senior colleague. Seven (8%) doctors do not routinely perform a DRE in a patient presenting with rectal bleeding; reasons included that there was no time to perform the examination, it was unfair to subject the patient to multiple examinations or that there was no chaperone to do the examination. 74 (82%) of doctors felt that better training at an undergraduate level would improve their confidence and abilities. In comparison with other forms of examination, these same doctors were less comfortable with PV and testicular examinations but most confident in groin hernia examinations. Conclusion:?? DRE is an important skill but despite being taught at medical school, many newly qualified doctors felt that they lacked confidence in this. More attention to developing this competency should be included in the junior doctor inductions.

AB  - Purpose:?? Perineal procedures, despite high recurrence (pooled published series 18%) and poor function, are gold standard for external rectal prolapse (ERP) in the elderly for safety. Abdominal rectopexy has lower recurrence (<5%), but performed posteriorly induces constipation in 50% and open has higher morbidity. Laparoscopic anterior rectopexy (LAR) overcomes these limitations, improving constipation with low recurrence. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of LAR for ERP in the elderly. Methodology:?? Data on LAR for ERP >80 from 2 tertiary colorectal pelvic floor services in Oxford and Bristol were collected prospectively and analysed. End-points were mortality, morbidity, length of stay (LOS). A subgroup was analysed for change in bowel function (Wexner constipation score and Faecal Incontinence Severity Index [FISI]). A comparison was made with a cohort of patients <80?years. Results:?? 81 patients (1 Delorme's in this period) 80?years or more (28% of total) were compared with 149 patients under 80 (98% vs. 86% female, age median 84 vs. 60?years, range 80?97 vs. 16?79?years). 30-day mortality (0% vs. 0%), morbidity (11% vs. 3%+), LOS (2 vs. 2?days) and recurrence (2% vs. 0%) was acceptably low and similar in both age cohorts. Functional results were excellent, both cohorts showing improvement in constipation (median Wexner pre-op 10 to post-op 3 vs. 10 to 4, new-onset constipation negligible) and incontinence (median FISI 31 to 0 vs. 34 to 8, resp.). Conclusions:?? LAR is safe and can be offered to all fit elderly ERP patients. Perineal procedures should be restricted to the very frail.

AB  - Purpose:?? The multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) has been widely adopted as standard of care for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there is little evidence to support the MDM, and individual clinician attitudes have not been studied. Methods:?? Clinicians involved in patients with CRC patients completed a questionnaire. The study was conducted in 2008 at 5 institutions, including MDM naïve (NG) and experienced groups (EG), with repetition in 6?months. The impact of the MDM was prospectively studied at a hospital from 7/7/08 to 22/12/08. The initial plan and the final consensus were recorded. Results:?? 22 clinicians completed the survey. The clinicians in the NG stated that there was an influence of MDM on routine patient management in 40% of patients. After 6?months, in both the EG and the NG, the MDM was felt to have an impact on the patients? management in >70% of cases (p = 0.16). 115 cases (91 patients) were discussed at the MDM. The median age was 65?years (range 26 to 101) with 48% males. The locations were colonic 53 (46%), rectum 40 (35%), anus 6 (5%) and other 16 (14%). 80 (69%) were discussed at the time of initial diagnosis. In 79 (69%) the main issue was chemotherapy and/or radiation administration. In 17 (52%) patients it was decided that further investigations were required. There was an impact on the management in 33 (29%) patients. A change in treatment intent occurred, either curative or palliative, in 5 (15%) patients. Conclusion:?? Clinicians involved in an MDM believe that this influences management in majority of patients with impact on management of almost a third of patients discussed. The multidisciplinary meeting is valuable in the treatment of colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - Purpose:?? Significant pain and discomfort are reported by a proportion of patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids. Several nerve blocks have been trialled with varied results. The aim of this study was to determine whether an anal intersphincteric nerve block may reduce post-operative pain and analgesic requirements in these patients. Methodology:?? One hundred sequential patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids were randomised to either an anal intersphincteric nerve block using 0.5% Marcaine with adrenaline or to the control group. The procedures were performed by a single surgeon using the KilRoid (TM) rubber band ligator (Astratech ? Sweden). Patients were assessed for pain and analgesic use in the immediate post operative period and at 24?hours. Both the patient and data collector were blinded to whether a nerve block had been administered. Results:?? There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in median post operative pain (3.0 vs. 2.0 p > 0.0.29), median post operative analgesic use (1.6 vs. 3.3 p = 0.62), median pain score at 24 hour (4.14 vs. 4.22 p = 0.9) and median analgesic use at 24 hours (1.0 vs. 1.0 p = 0.13). Conclusions:?? There is no benefit from performing an intersphincteric nerve block in patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes have demonstrated significant reduction in hospital stay for patient undergoing colonic surgery, however their impact on long term outcomes such as Post Operative Fatigue (POF) has not been fully established. Aim: To assess the impact of an ERAS programme on POF and recovery following elective open colonic surgery. Method:?? In a prospective study, 26 consecutive patients undergoing open colonic surgery under a conventional care plan were compared to 26 consecutive patients in an ERAS programme. Results:?? Demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable at baseline. The median duration of total hospital-stay (4 v 7?days p < 0.001), rates of urinary-tract infections (p = 0.028) and ileus (p = 0.042) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Postoperatively, POF significantly increased in both groups. However peak POF score was significantly lower in the ERAS group (p = 0.001). In the first 30?days after surgery, Fatigue Consequence scores were also significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Overall, the total fatigue experience (p = 0.035) and the total fatigue impact (p = 0.005) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Conclusion:?? The impact of ERAS programmes may extend beyond the commonly reported short term outcomes and ERAS may accelerate overall recovery and return to normal function.

AB  - Purpose:?? The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge relating to risk factors, tumorigenesis and survival of patients with metachronous colorectal cancer to address potential advances in surveillance and management of patients with colorectal cancer. Methodology:?? The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Ovid databases were searched from 1966 to December 2008 for both published reviews and published articles on metachronous colorectal cancer regarding incidence, carcinoma sequence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, detection, treatment, surveillance and survival. Further articles were obtained by a manual review of the reference lists of all retrieved articles. All publications relevant to this study were included. Results:?? Factors likely to increase the risk of developing metachronous colorectal cancer include; age, personal and family history of multiple malignancies, synchronous polyps, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and microsatellite instability. Conclusion:?? Pre-operative colonoscopic polyp status and biopsy analysis regarding microsatellite instability are essential in identifying patients at risk of metachronous colorectal cancer. A rapid adenoma-carcinoma sequence less than the accepted 2 to 5?years would warrant stringent colonoscopic surveillance. Thus, frequent colonoscopic surveillance is recommended, within the first 5?years post-operatively, for the detection of metachronous colorectal cancer.

AB  - Introduction:?? Post-operative fatigue (POF) is an important indicator of recovery after major surgery. Recent data have suggested a relationship between the post-operative peritoneal cytokine response and development of POF. Glucocorticoids decrease the production of cytokines and thus we hypothesised that administration of dexamethasone to patients undergoing colonic surgery may decrease peritoneal cytokine production and POF. Aim:?? To assess the influence of 8?mg of pre-op IV Dexamethasone on peritoneal cytokine and POF in patients undergoing elective colonic surgery. Method: In a double blinded RCT, 70 consecutive patients undergoing elective, open colonic resection were administered 8?mg I.V. Dexamethasone or saline (Placebo) prior to surgery. All patients were treated within a structured Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program. Results:?? After exclusions there were 31 patients in the Placebo group and 29 in the Dex group. At baseline there were no differences in the age, ASA, BMI or CR-POSSUM scores. Dexamethasone was associated with a significant reduction in Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-13 in the peritoneum and IL-6 and IL-8 in plasma. Subsequently, patients in the Dex group had lesser POF and fatigue impact scores at days 3 and 7. Patients in the Dex group had less post-op nausea and vomiting. There was no significant increase in complications. Conclusion:?? Preoperative Dexamethasone administration is associated with a significantly diminished post-operative pro-inflammatory reaction which is associated with clinical benefits in POF and its impact. This intervention may be an effective method of improving outcomes for patients undergoing major colonic surgery within a multimodal enhanced peri-operative care pathway.

AB  - Allostatic load (AL) is a complex clinical construct, providing a unique window into the cumulative impact of stress. However, due to its inherent complexity, AL presents two major measurement challenges to conventional statistical modeling (the field's dominant methodology): it is comprised of a complex causal network of bioallostatic systems, represented by an even larger set of dynamic biomarkers; and, it is situated within a web of antecedent socioecological systems, linking AL to differences in health outcomes and disparities. To address these challenges, we employed case-based computational modeling (CBM), which allowed us to make four advances: (1) we developed a multisystem, 7-factor (20 biomarker) model of AL's network of allostatic systems; (2) used it to create a catalog of nine different clinical AL profiles (causal pathways); (3) linked each clinical profile to a typology of 23 health outcomes; and (4) explored our results (post hoc) as a function of gender, a key socioecological factor. In terms of highlights, (a) the Healthy clinical profile had few health risks; (b) the pro-inflammatory profile linked to high blood pressure and diabetes; (c) Low Stress Hormones linked to heart disease, TIA/Stroke, diabetes, and circulation problems; and (d) high stress hormones linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Post hoc analyses also found that males were overrepresented on the High Blood Pressure (61.2%), Metabolic Syndrome (63.2%), High Stress Hormones (66.4%), and High Blood Sugar (57.1%); while females were overrepresented on the Healthy (81.9%), Low Stress Hormones (66.3%), and Low Stress Antagonists (stress buffers) (95.4%) profiles. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cause of cancer deaths in Australia. The Australian NHMRC guideline recommends regular surveillance colonoscopy every 3?5?years after curative surgery. Some studies recently reported disturbing rates of metachronous colorectal cancer occurring early after curative treatment of the index tumour. There are concerns that performing surveillance colonoscopy only 3?5?years after curative surgery may miss a significant proportion of metachronous cancers. This study looks at the rate and timing of metachronous cancer in two institutions, and examines factors which may be associated. Methods:?? This is a retrospective audit utilising a database of all patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy at Flinders Medical Centre and Repatriation General Hospital. Patients were identified using the database, with subsequent case note review. Patients with familial disorders or disease recurrence at anastomotic sites within 12?months were excluded. This audit has been approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of both hospitals. Results:?? Colorectal cancers were identified in 569 patients, of whom 15 (2.6%) had metachronous cancers and were included in our study. There were 10 men and 5 women with average age of 74?years. The median time interval to detection of metachronous cancer was 36?months (range 13?202?months). 8 (53%) patients had metachronous cancer identified at between 13?36?months after diagnosis of the primary tumour. Conclusion:?? Our study showed that a significant proportion (53%) of patients who had metachronous colorectal cancer presented within 13?36?months. Early surveillance colonoscopy may be warranted to detect earlier stage disease relapse.

AB  - We report a case of massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage in a traveller who presented to a tertiary hospital emergency department in Melbourne, Australia. An 18?year-old man from India presented with two weeks of malaise, anorexia, fever and generalised abdominal pain and had massive rectal bleeding on presentation. He underwent computed tomography angiography before urgent laparotomy and ileocolic resection of a bleeding ulcer in the terminal ileum. Blood cultures subsequently grew Salmonella typhi. Histopathology showed multiple areas of ulceration centred on Peyer's patches, transmural mononuclear cell infiltrates and focal non-necrotizing granulomas. A diagnosis of enteric fever causing massive bleeding from an ulcer in the terminal ileum was made and the Health Department notified. The patient had four weeks of antibiotic therapy and made a full recovery. Surgery was once thought contraindicated in enteric fever complicated by bleeding, citing a tendency for the bowel to be friable and difficulty locating the site of bleeding in multiple ulcers. Bleeding and perforation occur from necrosis of Peyer's patches. However, evidence shows this is limited to the terminal ileum and proximal colon, allowing directed surgical excision. In the current age of international travel, surgeons must be increasingly aware of relevant diseases that may have had their origins overseas. Enteric fever should be considered in patients with rectal bleeding who are travellers and immigrants from endemic areas with a compatible illness.

AB  - Purpose:?? Anastomotic leak (AL) from colorectal surgery is a common and potentially fatal complication that is currently diagnosed clinically with the aid of imaging studies. It has been hypothesized that portal sepsis occurs earlier than clinical signs of peritonism. The present study analysed liver function tests (LFTs) and white cell count (WCC) in patients with AL from colorectal procedures involving primary anastomosis, with the aim of identifying serum parameters that could provide an early indication of AL to allow timely surgical intervention. Materials and Methods:?? Between November 2003 and December 2008, 1243 consecutive colorectal procedures involving primary anastomosis from our institution were retrospectively screened for AL. LFTs and WCC of the identified patients were extracted from a central database for analysis. Results:?? From our database, we found thirty-four patients who required operative intervention and had confirmed AL according to their operation reports. Elevated levels of GGT above 115 and ALP above 55 were found in 71% and 61% of patients, respectively, prior to clinical anastomotic leakage. WCC appeared to remain on the upper border of the normal range in the majority of patients. Conclusion:?? Elevated median levels of GGT and ALP in this group of patients after the initial colorectal procedure is suggestive that LFTs may be a useful biomarker for anastomotic leaks. Further research in prospective trials should be performed to evaluate its usefulness.

AB  - Purpose:?? This study was designed to determine whether blue dye injections in the resected specimen increased lymph node yield and ease of identification of lymph nodes in the resected specimen. Methods:?? A prospective randomized control trial was performed on all colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery at the Alfred Hospital for the calendar year of 2008. Specimens were randomised to either receiving or not receiving patent blue V dye. All specimens were pathologically examined in a standardised manner. The number of lymph nodes identified in the specimen was recorded, both containing and not containing blue dye. All specimens were soaked in Carnoy's solution, and re-examined for additional lymph nodes. Results:?? 67 patients randomized, 33 patients received blue dye and 34 patients received no blue dye. In the Blue dye group the median number of blue nodes identified was 4, and the median number of all nodes pre Carnoy's was 11. In the blue dye group the median combined post Carnoy's lymph node count was 15. In the non-blue dye group the median number of lymph nodes pre Carnoy's was 12, the median combined post Carnoy's lymph node count was 16. The percentage of specimens having less than 12 nodes was 37% in the blue dye group and 27% in the non-blue dye group. Conclusion:?? The injection of patent blue dye did not increase the lymph node count or the percentage of specimens has less than 12 lymph nodes.
