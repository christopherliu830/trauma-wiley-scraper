AB  - Abstract Periodontitis is a ubiquitous and irreversible inflammatory condition and represents a significant public health burden. Severe periodontitis affects over 11% of adults, is a major cause of tooth loss impacting negatively upon speech, nutrition, quality of life and self-esteem, and has systemic inflammatory consequences. Periodontitis is preventable and treatment leads to reduced rates of tooth loss and improved quality of life. However, successful treatment necessitates behaviour change in patients to address lifestyle risk factors (e.g. smoking) and, most importantly, to attain and sustain high standards of daily plaque removal, lifelong. While mechanical plaque removal remains the bedrock of successful periodontal disease management, in high-risk patients it appears that the critical threshold for plaque accumulation to trigger periodontitis is low, and such patients may benefit from adjunctive agents for primary prevention of periodontitis. Aim The aims of this working group were to systematically review the evidence for primary prevention of periodontitis by preventing gingivitis via four approaches: 1) the efficacy of mechanical self-administered plaque control regimes; 2) the efficacy of self-administered inter-dental mechanical plaque control; 3) the efficacy of adjunctive chemical plaque control; and 4) anti-inflammatory (sole or adjunctive) approaches. Methods Two meta-reviews (mechanical plaque removal) and two traditional systematic reviews (chemical plaque control/anti-inflammatory agents) formed the basis of this consensus. Results Data support the belief that professionally administered plaque control significantly improves gingival inflammation and lowers plaque scores, with some evidence that reinforcement of oral hygiene provides further benefit. Re-chargeable power toothbrushes provide small but statistically significant additional reductions in gingival inflammation and plaque levels. Flossing cannot be recommended other than for sites of gingival and periodontal health, where inter-dental brushes (IDBs) will not pass through the interproximal area without trauma. Otherwise, IDBs are the device of choice for interproximal plaque removal. Use of local or systemic anti-inflammatory agents in the management of gingivitis has no robust evidence base. We support the almost universal recommendations that all people should brush their teeth twice a day for at least 2 min. with fluoridated dentifrice. Expert opinion is that for periodontitis patients 2 min. is likely to be insufficient, especially when considering the need for additional use of inter-dental cleaning devices. In patients with gingivitis once daily inter-dental cleaning is recommended and the adjunctive use of chemical plaque control agents offers advantages in this group.

AB  - Abstract Bacterial translocation (BT) is a phenomenon in which live bacteria or its products cross the intestinal barrier. Gut translocation of bacteria has been shown in both animal and human studies. BT and its complications have been shown clearly to occur in animal models, but its existence and importance in humans has been difficult to ascertain. We review the mechanisms of BT and its clinical impact based on the current literature.

AB  - Abstract Background IL-1? is a primary mediator of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and it may lead to shock septic. Our aim was to analyse whether IL-1B rs16944 polymorphism is associated with the onset of septic shock and death after major surgery. Materials and methods We performed a case?control study on 467 patients who underwent major cardiac or abdominal surgery. Of them, 205 patients developed septic shock (cases, SS group) and 262 patients developed SIRS (controls, SIRS group). The primary outcome variables were the development of septic shock and death within 90 days after diagnosis of septic shock. The IL-1B rs16944 polymorphism was genotyped by Sequenom's MassARRAY platform. The association analysis was performed under a recessive genetic model (AA vs. GG/GC). Results The frequency of septic shock was higher in patients with IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype than in patients with IL-1B rs16944 GG/AG genotype when all patients were taken into account (63·6% vs. 41·8%; P = 0·006), cardiac surgery (52·2% vs. 33·3%; P = 0·072) and abdominal surgery (76·2% vs. 50·2%; P = 0·023). However, the IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype was only associated with higher likelihood of septic shock in the analysis of all population [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2·26 (95%CI = 1·03; 4·97; P = 0·042], but not when it was stratified by cardiac surgery (P = 0·175) or abdominal surgery (P = 0·467). Similarly, IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype was also associated with higher likelihood of septic shock-related death in all population [aOR = 2·67 (95%CI = 1·07; 4·97); P = 0·035]. Conclusions IL-1B rs16944 AA genotype seems to be related to the onset of septic shock and death in patients who underwent major surgery.

AB  - Abstract Transient ischaemia leads to tolerance to subsequent protracted ischaemia. This ?ischaemia pre-conditioning? results from the induction of numerous protective genes, involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and survival, in antioxidant capacity, angiogenesis, vascular tone and erythropoiesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) play a pivotal role in this transcriptional adaptive response. HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), serving as oxygen sensors, control HIFα degradation. HIF-mediated ischaemic pre-conditioning can be achieved with the administration of PHD inhibitors, with the attenuation of organ injury under various hypoxic and toxic insults. Clinical trials are currently under way, evaluating PHD inhibitors as inducers of erythropoietin. Once their safety is established, their potential use might be further tested in clinical trials in various forms of acute ischaemic and toxic organ damage. Repeated transient limb ischaemia was also found to attenuate ischaemic injury in remote organs. This ?remote ischaemic pre-conditioning? phenomenon (RIP) has been extensively studied recently in small clinical trials, preceding, or in parallel with an abrupt insult, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or radiocontrast administration. Initial results are promising, suggesting organ protection. Large-scale multi-centre studies are currently under way, evaluating the protective potential of RIP in cardiac surgery, in the management of myocardial infarction and in organ transplantation. The mechanisms of organ protection provided by RIP are poorly understood, but HIF seemingly play a role as well. Thus, Inhibition of HIF degradation with PHD inhibitors, as well as RIP (in part through HIF), might develop into novel clinical interventions in organ protection in the near future.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. Recognition of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), intensive care, shifting away from early surgical treatment, and monitoring of the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is important in the management of SAP. The aim of our study was retrospective evaluation and critical assessment of the experience with SAP management protocol involving new strategy in the university hospital. Methods. Protocols of 274 SAP patients treated in our institution during the last eight years were reassessed. APACHE II, CRP and SOFA score, IAP, pulmonary complications, ventilatory support and infection rate were evaluated. The success of the conservative treatment, surgical interventions and mortality was analysed comparing period 1 from 1999 to 2002 and period 2 from 2003 to 2006. Results. More patients with necrotising SAP were treated in period 2. The average CRP and SOFA score was higher in period 2, p=0.018; p=0.011. A total of 139 patients underwent continuous veno-venouse haemofiltration (CVVH) as a component of fluid resuscitation and IAP control. Application of CVVH increased in period 2, p<0.005. Only 5?8% of patients were managed with ventilatory support. The overall infection rate decreased in period 2 comprising 21%, p<0.005. Success rate of the conservative therapy reached 69% in period 2, p<0.01. Surgical treatment was performed in 41% of patients in period 1 vs. 19% in period 2, p<0.001. Overall mortality was 19%, with a reduction to 12% in year 2006. Conclusion. The conservative protocol-based approach is a rational treatment strategy for the management of SAP and can be successfully implemented in the setting of the university hospital.

AB  - Abstract Developmental and trauma-induced mechanism(s) that modify inflammation and immune responses in blood cells were recently found to be regulated by acetylcholine. Here, we report corresponding blood cell-specific changes in acetylcholinesterase splice variants. Plasmon resonance and flow cytometry using acetylcholinesterase variant-specific antibody probes, revealed a progressive increase in myeloid cell fractions expressing the apoptosis-related acetylcholinesterase-S variant from newborns to adult controls and post-delivery mothers. Hematopoietic cell fractions positive for the myeloproliferative acetylcholinesterase-R variant, were similarly high in post-partum blood, both intracellular and on the cell surface. Moreover, intracellular acetylcholinesterase-S protein amounts as reflected by fluorescence intensity measurements remained unchanged in myeloid cells from post-partum mothers as compared with matched controls. Unlike brain neurons, which over-express intracellular acetylcholinesterase-R under stress, lymphocytes from post-partum mothers presented increased surface acetylcholinesterase-S and pronounced decreases in both the expression and contents of surface acetylcholinesterase-R. Peripheral stimuli-induced modulations in acetylcholine regulation may hence reflect blood cell lineage-dependent acetylcholinesterase splice variations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma in 1948, it has been investigated as a non-invasive screening tool for many diseases, especially solid tumours and foetal genetic abnormalities. However, to date our lack of knowledge regarding the origin and purpose of cfDNA in a physiological environment has limited its use to more obvious diagnostics, neglecting, for example, its potential utility in the identification of predisposition to disease, earlier detection of cancers, and lifestyle-induced epigenetic changes. Moreover, the concept or mechanism of cfDNA could also have potential therapeutic uses such as in immuno- or gene therapy. This review presents an extensive compilation of the putative origins of cfDNA and then contrasts the contributions of cellular breakdown processes with active mechanisms for the release of cfDNA into the extracellular environment. The involvement of cfDNA derived from both cellular breakdown and active release in lateral information transfer is also discussed. We hope to encourage researchers to adopt a more holistic view of cfDNA research, taking into account all the biological pathways in which cfDNA is involved, and to give serious consideration to the integration of in vitro and in vivo research. We also wish to encourage researchers not to limit their focus to the apoptotic or necrotic fraction of cfDNA, but to investigate the intercellular messaging capabilities of the actively released fraction of cfDNA and to study the role of cfDNA in pathogenesis.

AB  - SUMMARy There is a general agreement that blood and blood components all deteriorate from the moment they are removed from the donor's vein. Clinicians have expressed their concern for decades about the potential of the storage lesions having adverse effects on patients. However, this has been difficult to prove in clinical studies due to the multifactorial nature and complexity of many transfusion settings, especially hemorrhagic shock and trauma. The role of transfusion as a contributor to adverse consequences that are only possible and multifactorial such as those potentially due to storage lesions can only be identified by large, well-conducted and controlled trials. If transfusion can be identified as a significant contributory factor to a specific complication its role is considered more as a risk factor rather than a direct 1:1 causal factor. Nevertheless, it is of interest to underline that many of the changes occurring during storage are related to the presence of leukocytes (especially granulocytes) and can be minimized by pre-storage leukoreduction. Pre-storage leukoreduction is now standard practice in many countries. Although its introduction has been for reasons other than the minimization of storage lesions, it is of interest to note hat it is probably the most effective intervention to improve the survival and the quality of red cell and platelet concentrates.

Journal of Advanced Nursing?66(11), 2450?2459. Abstract Aim.? This paper is a report of a study of the effect of family caregivers? needs on the functional recovery of elders with a hip fracture during the first 6?months after discharge. Background.? Family members are closely involved in the postdischarge care of older Chinese patients. However, the influence of family caregiving-related variables, such as caregiver?s needs, on recovery after hip fracture has not been explored. Methods.? Data were collected between 2002 and 2005 with elders with hip fracture and their family caregivers at a medical centre in Taiwan. Data were collected at 1, 3 and 6?months after discharge, and 120 people completed all follow-ups. The effect of caregiver needs on elders? recovery was analysed using the generalized estimating equations approach. Findings.? Elders whose caregivers reported a need for information on caregiving and related health care were more likely (odds ratio?=?1·93, confidence interval?=?1·08?3·46) to recover their walking ability than those whose caregivers did not report such need. However, elders whose caregivers reported a need for social services were less likely to recover their walking ability (odds ratio?=?0·38, confidence interval?=?0·18?0·78), and activities of daily living (odds ratio?=?0·40, confidence interval?=?0·17?0·94) than those whose caregivers did not report such need. Conclusion.? Healthcare providers should include caregivers? needs in their clinical assessment of Chinese elders after surgery for hip fracture. Given the rapidly increasing population of Asian elders in Western countries, the results of this study may be applicable to other countries with Chinese populations.
