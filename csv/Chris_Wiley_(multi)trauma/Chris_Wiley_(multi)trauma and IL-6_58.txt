AB  - Abstract Macrophages are critically involved in wound healing, from dampening inflammation to clearing cell debris and coordinating tissue repair. Within the wound, the complexity of macrophage function is increasingly recognized, with adverse outcomes when macrophages are inappropriately activated, such as in fibrosis or chronic non-healing wounds. Recent advances in in vivo and translational wound models, macrophage-specific deletions and new technologies to distinguish macrophage subsets, have uncovered the vast spectrum of macrophage activation and effector functions. Here, we summarize the main players in wound-healing macrophage activation and function, including cytokines, apoptotic cells, nucleotides and mechanical stimuli. We highlight recent studies demonstrating cooperation between these factors for optimal wound healing. Next, we describe recent technologies such as cell tracking and single-cell RNA-seq, which have uncovered remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity in blood-derived or tissue-resident macrophages and discuss the implications for wound healing. Lastly, we evaluate macrophage dysfunction in aberrant wound healing that occurs in aging, diabetes and fibrosis. A better understanding of the longevity and plasticity of wound-healing macrophages, and identification of unique macrophage subsets or specific effector molecules in wound healing, would shed light on the therapeutic potential of manipulating macrophage function for optimal wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and complex clinical condition involving proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide toxicity that produces a predictable pattern of progressive injury entailing neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination at the site of impact. The involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in exacerbation of SCI pathology is well documented. We have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor; LP) treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Immunohistochemical detection and real-time PCR analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1? (IL-1?) after SCI. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was detected 24 hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ED1-positive inflammatory infiltrates, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by 1 week after SCI relative to control. LP treatment attenuated the SCI-induced iNOS, TNFα, and IL-1? expression. LP also provided protection against SCI-induced tissue necrosis, neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, rats treated with LP scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI (19.13 ± 0.53) than did untreated rats (9.04 ± 1.22). This study therefore reports the beneficial effect of atorvastatin for the treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The skin is a highly complex organ, responsible for sensation, protection against the environment (pollutants, foreign proteins, infection) and thereby linked to the immune and sensory systems in the neuro-immuno-cutaneous (NIC) system. Cutaneous innervation is a key part of the peripheral nervous system; therefore, the skin should be considered a sensory organ and an important part of the central nervous system, an ?active interface? and the first connection of the body to the outside world. Peripheral nerves are a complex class of neurons within these systems, subsets of functions are conducted, including mechanoreception, nociception and thermoception. Epidermal and dermal cells produce signalling factors (such as cytokines or growth factors), neurites influence skin cells (such as via neuropeptides), and peripheral nerves have a role in both early and late stages of the inflammatory response. One way this is achieved, specifically in the cutaneous system, is through neuropeptide release and signalling, especially via substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Cutaneous, neuronal and immune cells play a central role in many conditions, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, UV-induced immunosuppression, herpes and lymphomas. Therefore, it is critical to understand the connections and interplay between the peripheral nervous system and the skin and immune systems, the NIC system. Relevant in vitro tissue models based on human skin equivalents can be used to gain insight and to address impact across research and clinical needs.

AB  - Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are important for the induction of primary T-cell responses and may serve as ?biologic adjuvants? in therapeutic protocols. However, given the ?plasticity? of this antigen-presenting cell, it remains unclear which DC type (source, subtype, and stage of differentiation) should be applied clinically. To provide additional insight in this selection process, we have, for the first time, analyzed the in vitro differentiation of CD34+ precursor-derived and monocyte-derived DCs for ultrastructure, phenotype, and function. The ultrastructural intracytoplasmic differentiation of DCs correlated with increasing T-cell stimulatory activity of these cells. ?Early-stage?-DCs proliferate, exhibit high levels of soluble antigen uptake, and moderate T-cell stimulatory capacity, and are characterized by centrally located nuclei and numerous enlarged mitochondria. ?Intermediate-stage?-DCs are enlarged cells with enhanced T-cell stimulatory activity and pronounced cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery. ?Late-stage? (LS)-DCs exhibit a mature secretory cell phenotype and low proliferative index. They express high levels of the HLA-DR, CD40L, B7-1, and B7-2 molecules and CD83, a specific marker of mature DCs, and appear maximally stimulatory to T cells. Ultrastructurally, LS-DCs feature an accentric nucleus, an enlarged cytoplasm, containing numerous secretory storage vesicles, along with a fully developed Golgi complex. LS-DCs exhibited numerous multivesicular and multilaminar structures containing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, consistent with the MIIC (peptide-loading) compartment. In extended studies, cultured CD14+ monocyte-derived DCs displayed a similar, but accelerated, temporal differentiation staging pattern.

AB  - Abstract Osteomyelitis often causes functional impairment due to tissue destruction. This report demonstrates a novel previously unappreciated role of osteoblasts. Samples of osteomyelitic bone and bacterially challenged osteoblasts produce increased amounts of antimicrobial peptides in order to combat bacterial bone infection. An osteomyelitis mouse model confirmed the osseous induction of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, suggesting a central role in the prevention of bacterial bone infection. Antimicrobial peptides are effectors of the innate defence system and play a key role in host protection at cellular surfaces. Some of them are produced constitutively, whereas others are induced during infection. Human ?-defensins represent a major subclass of antimicrobial peptides and act as a first line of defence through their broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity. The aim of the present in-vitro and in-vivo investigations was to study the expression and regulation of human ?-defensin-2 in the case of bacterial bone infection and to analyse the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on bone-derived antimicrobial peptide expression. Samples of healthy human bone, osteomyelitic bone and cultured osteoblasts (hFOB cells) were assessed for the expression of human ?-defensin-2. Regulation of human ?-defensin-2 was studied in hFOB cells after exposure to bacterial supernatants, proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppressive drugs (glucocorticoids and methotrexate) and was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An osteomyelitis mouse model was performed to demonstrate the regulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, named murine ?-defensin-3, by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Healthy human bone and cultured osteoblasts are able to produce human ?-defensin-2 under standard conditions. Samples of infected bone produce higher levels of endogenous antibiotics, such as human ?-defensin-2, when compared with samples of healthy bone. A clear induction of human ?-defensin-2 was observed after exposure of cultured osteoblasts to Gram-positive bacteria or proinflammatory cytokines. Additional treatment with glucocorticoids or methotrexate prevented bacteria-mediated antimicrobial peptide induction in cultured osteoblasts. The osteomyelitis mouse model demonstrated transcriptional upregulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, namely murine ?-defensin-3, in bone after intraosseous contamination of the tibia. Human and murine bone have the ability to produce broad-spectrum endogenous antibiotics when challenged by micro-organisms in vitro and in vivo. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids or methotrexate, may increase the susceptibility to bone infection by decreasing antimicrobial peptide expression levels in case of microbial challenge. The induction of human ?-defensin-2 following bacterial contact suggests a central role of antimicrobial peptides in the prevention of bacterial bone infection.

AB  - Summary Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have reduced numbers and frequencies of dendritic cells (DCs) in blood, and there is also evidence for defective activation through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Collectively, these observations may point to a primary defect in the generation of functional DCs. Here, we measured frequencies of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) in peripheral blood of 26 CVID patients and 16 healthy controls. The results show that the patients have reduced absolute counts of both subsets. However, the decreased numbers in peripheral blood were not reflected in reduced frequencies of CD34+ pDC progenitors in the bone marrow. Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-α or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9. The study represents the most thorough functional characterization to date, and the first to assess bone marrow progenitor output, of naturally occurring DCs in CVID. In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.

AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that neutrophils are essential for the protection from invading pathogens, hyperactive neutrophils may elicit detrimental cerebral damage after severe trauma. The neutrophil interactions with the neurovascular unit entail endothelial dysfunction involving endothelial leakage, formation of edema, coagulation abnormalities, disturbed hemodynamics, tissue infiltration etc. These elements of the ?whole body inflammation,? designated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in conjunction with intracerebral proinflammatory activities, are important triggers of post-traumatic cerebral damage and mortality according to the ?second hit? concept. From the immunologic point of view, the brain is an immune privileged site, known to resist autodestructive inflammatory activity much more efficiently than other organs because of the highly efficient diverse functions of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). However, both the underlying strategy of the BBB to maintain cerebral protecting functions against the post-traumatic neutrophil-mediated ?second hit? and how activated neutrophils may overcome the BBB are currently unknown. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of the ?second hit,? the BBB physiology, and its role in the maintenance of cerebral immune privilege, and discusses recent findings that may explain the pathophysiologic neutrophil?BBB interactions occurring after severe trauma, thus offering novel therapeutic options to protect from post-traumatic brain damage. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
