AB  - Abstract Alexander Disease (AxD) is a degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the GFAP gene, which encodes the major intermediate filament of astrocytes. As other cells in the CNS do not express GFAP, AxD is a primary astrocyte disease. Astrocytes acquire a large number of pathological features, including changes in morphology, the loss or diminution of a number of critical astrocyte functions and the activation of cell stress and inflammatory pathways. AxD is also characterized by white matter degeneration, a pathology that has led it to be included in the ?leukodystrophies.? Furthermore, variable degrees of neuronal loss take place. Thus, the astrocyte pathology triggers alterations in other cell types. Here, we will review the neuropathology of AxD and discuss how a disease of astrocytes can lead to severe pathologies in non-astrocytic cells. Our knowledge of the pathophysiology of AxD will also lead to a better understanding of how astrocytes interact with other CNS cells and how astrocytes in the gliosis that accompanies many neurological disorders can damage the function and survival of other cells.

AB  - Abstract Wound healing is an inherent response resulting in the restoration of tissue integrity. It is a complex process involving cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The dermal tissue is an important component of skin that acts as a connecting link between the epidermis and hypodermis. The appearance of scars and contractures after autologous split-thickness skin transplantation or single epidermis diaphragm transplantation for full skin defects indicates that the dermal tissue plays an important role in skin regeneration. Theoretically, dermis cannot regenerate like the liver, bone and epidermis after being destroyed by burns or avulsion. Scarring is hard to avoid during the process of natural healing. However, if the dermis could be reconstructed perfectly, this would be a breakthrough in the methods used for wound healing. In this review, we summarize recent research about dermal regeneration and discuss the probability of advances in the field. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary: There is compelling evidence that epithelial cells (ECs) at mucosal surfaces, beyond their role in creating a physical barrier, are integral components of innate and adaptive immunity. The capacity of these cells to license the functions of specific immune cell populations in the airway and gastrointestinal tract offers the prospect of novel therapeutic strategies to target multiple inflammatory diseases in which barrier immunity is dysregulated. In this review, we discuss the critical functions of EC-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 in the development and regulation of T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine-dependent immune responses. We first highlight recent data that have provided new insights into the factors that control expression of this triad of cytokines and their receptors. In addition, we review their proinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions in models of mucosal infection and inflammation. Lastly, we discuss new findings indicating that despite their diverse structural features and differential expression of their receptors, TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 cross-regulate one another and share overlapping properties that influence Th2 cytokine-dependent responses at mucosal sites.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common sports-related knee injuries that increase the risk of developing post-traumatic osteoarthritis. ACL tears are rarely an isolated injury but are often associated with traumatic bone marrow lesions (BMLs). While early loss of bone mass following the ACL injury has been previously described, to date, microarchitectural information has not been reported due to the limited resolution of clinical imaging systems. In this study, we provide the first evidence of detailed bone mass and microarchitectural changes in the first 10 months following an acute ACL tear, and localized to traumatic BMLs. Fifteen participants with an acute unilateral ACL tear were assessed at four-time points using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and traumatic BMLs were identified with magnetic resonance imaging. Loss of bone mass was localized to the injured knee (?4.6% to ?15.8%, depending on bone and depth) and was accelerated immediately following the injury before suggesting a recovery phase. This loss of bone was accelerated even greater in traumatic BMLs (?18.2% to ?20.6%, depending on bone). Bone loss was accompanied by microstructural degeneration of trabecular bone. For example, in the lateral femur of the injured knee, the subchondral bone plate decreased in thickness (?9.0%). This study confirmed loss of bone mass in the months following ACL tears and described the underlying bone microstructural changes. The presented bone changes were accelerated in regions of traumatic BMLs. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 37:2325?2336, 2019

AB  - An improved understanding and characterization of glial activation and its relationship with white matter injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination after brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public healthcare burden and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Particularly, traumatic white matter (WM) injury or traumatic axonal injury has been reported as being associated with patients' poor outcomes. However, there is very limited data reporting the importance of glial activation after TBI and its interaction with WM injury. This article presents a systematic review of traumatic WM injury and the associated glial activation, from basic science to clinical diagnosis and prognosis, from advanced neuroimaging perspective. It concludes that there is a disconnection between WM injury research and the essential role of glia which serve to restore a healthy environment for axonal regeneration following WM injury. Particularly, there is a significant lack of non-invasive means to characterize the complex pathophysiology of WM injury and glial activation in both animal models and in humans. An improved understanding and characterization of the relationship between glia and WM injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Health, disease, and immune function are key areas of research in studies of ecology and evolution, but work on free-ranging primates has been inhibited by a lack of direct noninvasive measures of condition. Here, we evaluate the potential usefulness of noninvasive measurement of three biomarkers, the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin, and neopterin, a by-product of macrophage activity. Materials and Methods We took advantage of veterinary checks on captive rhesus (24) and long-tailed (3) macaques at the German Primate Center (DPZ) to analyze serum marker measures, before measuring concentrations in feces and urine, and evaluating relationships between matched serum, urine, and fecal concentrations. In a second study, we monitored excretion of these markers in response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and surgical tissue trauma, undertaken for a separate study. Results We found that each biomarker could be measured in each matrix. Serum and urinary concentrations of neopterin were strongly and significantly correlated, but neither haptoglobin nor CRP concentrations in excreta proxied circulating serum concentrations. Our infection study confirmed that urinary neopterin, in particular, is a reliable marker of viral infection in macaques, but also indicated the potential of urinary and fecal CRP and haptoglobin as indicators of inflammation. Discussion We highlight the potential of noninvasive markers of immune function, especially of urinary neopterin, which correlates strongly with serum neopterin, and is highly responsive to infection.
