AB  - HLA alloimmunization induced by pregnancy, multiple transfusions or transplantation is responsible for some of the serious complications seen in patients receiving blood and blood products. These complications are primarily the result of antibody and antigen triggering an acute immunological reaction, which in some cases can be fatal e.g. TRALI. Some adverse reactions are triggered by HLA antibodies present in the patient whereas others are initiated by antibodies or HLA reactive cells present in the transfused product. The introduction of universal leucodepletion for the prevention of vCJD transmission has resulted in a significant reduction in these reactions by eliminating the main source of alloimmunization, but residual cellular components or platelets are still able to activate the immune system and induce the development of HLA reactive antibodies or T cells. However, the use of more sensitive and specific techniques to detect HLA antibodies and antigens has not only improved the investigation of transfusion reactions and their subsequent diagnosis, but it has also facilitated the implementation of a number of measures such as the use of HLA antibody negative products to further reduce their development.

AB  - Summary:? The caspase family of cysteine proteases becomes activated in response to diverse cellular insults and coordinates apoptosis through proteolysis of hundreds of cellular substrates. Cytotoxic lymphocytes are adept at promoting apoptosis of virally infected or transformed cells through delivery of cytotoxic enzymes, such as granzyme B, into target cells via the granule exocytosis pathway. Granzyme B promotes apoptosis of target cells through direct processing of certain caspases, which leads to their autoactivation. Granzyme B can also activate caspases indirectly through proteolysis of Bid, a protein that promotes mitochondrial permeabilization and consequent activation of the apoptosome pathway to caspase activation. Evidence also indicates that granzyme B may contribute to antiviral immunity by directly suppressing viral replication through direct proteolysis of viral proteins that are essential for pathogenicity. Recent reports also suggest that granzyme B may have additional non-cytotoxic roles under certain circumstances and may also function in the extracellular space. Here, we discuss the cytotoxic and putative non-cytotoxic functions of granzyme B within the immune system.

AB  - ABSTRACT Rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures, and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), are examples of chronic (RCT and CTS) and acute (ACL ruptures) musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. These injuries are multifactorial in nature, with several identified intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Previous studies have implicated specific sequence variants within genes encoding structural and regulatory components of the extracellular matrix of tendons and/ligaments to predispose individuals to these injuries. An example, includes the association of sequence variants within the apoptotic regulatory gene, caspase-8 (CASP8) with other musculoskeletal injury phenotypes, such as Achilles tendinopathy. The primary aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate previously implicated DNA sequence variants within CASP8: rs3834129 (ins/del) and rs1045485 (G/C), and the rs13113 (T/A) identified using a whole exome sequencing approach, with risk of musculoskeletal injury phenotypes (RCT, ACL ruptures, and CTS) in three independent studies. In addition, the aim was to implicate a CASP8 genomic interval in the modulation of risk of RCT, ACL ruptures, or CTS. It was found that the AA genotype of CASP8 rs13113 (T/A) was independently associated with increased risk for CTS. In addition, it was found that the del-C haplotype (rs3834129?rs1045485) was significantly associated with non-contact ACL ruptures, which is in alignment with previous research findings. Collectively, the results of this study implicate the apoptosis pathway as biologically significant in the underlying pathogenesis of musculoskeletal injury phenotypes. These findings should be repeated in larger sample cohorts and across different populations. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 38:680?688, 2020

AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) with resistance to local anesthetic block: a case report. (State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY) J Clin Anesth 2000;12:67?71. A case of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) Type 1 in a 12-year-old girl is presented. The patient did not respond to the usual therapeutic modalities used to treat CRPS including physical therapy, lumbar sympathetic block, epidural local anesthetic block, intravenous lidocaine infusion, or other oral medications. Of note is the fact that during epidural block the patient demonstrated a resistance to local anesthetic neural blockade in the area of the body involved with the pain problem. The mechanism of this resistance could be related to the changes in the dorsal horn cells of the spinal cord, secondary to activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of this pain syndrome.

AB  - Epidural catheter tip cultures: results of a 4-year audit and implications for clinical practice. (Royal Adelaide Hospital and University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:360?367. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of routine microbiological culture of epidural catheter tips after use in acute pain management, and to identify patterns of culture result with respect to both indications for, and duration of, epidural catheterization. Over a 4-year period, when acute pain service (APS) protocol required epidural catheter tips to be sent for microbiological culture on removal, APS saw 1,810 patients who had received epidural analgesia. The records of the patients were reviewed. Culture results were available for 1,443 (79.7%) patients: 1,027 catheter tips (71.2%) were sterile, while 416 (28.8%) were positive for at least 1 type of microorganism. Clinically, no epidural space infections were identified. The highest positive culture rates were found from epidural catheters used in treatment of pain from fractured ribs or fractured pelves. The lowest incidences occurred in elective orthopedic and thoracic surgery. The proportion of epidural catheters with positive culture results steadily increased with the duration of catheterization, but there were no clinically significant differences for catheters left in situ for either 3 or 4 days. Conclude that a significant proportion of epidural catheter tips may be ?culture positive? after removal. It is suggested that this probably represents colonization of the skin at the catheter insertion site and subsequent contamination of the catheter tip on removal of the catheter. The large number of ?culture positive? tips in the absence of clinically identifiable epidural space infection suggests that routine culture of epidural catheter tips is clinically irrelevant in the vast majority of cases, and that it is not a good predictor of the presence of an epidural space infection. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. Clinically relevant epidural catheter-induced infection is quite rare with the largest study on this topic revealing 1/505,000 catheter placements. This retrospective study involved the insertion of 1810 epidural catheters. At the time of insertion, full aseptic precautions were employed. When the catheters were removed, they were cultured and it was revealed that 28.8% were positive for at least 1 organism. This prevalence is relatively consistent with other published studies. The most common organism found was coagulase negative staphylococcus. Interestingly, not one of these patients developed an epidural abscess. The authors speculate that the relatively common prevalence of organism positive cultures was related to poor sterile technique at the catheter insertion site at the time of placement and/or removal. The authors conclude that epidural catheter contamination in the vast majority of cases is clinically irrelevant. In as much as epidural abscess can have vital clinical implications, it behooves the practitioner to adhere to strict sterile techniques even though the likelihood of infection is extremely low. Certainly, this study reinforces the fact that routine culture of epidural catheter tips is not a good predicator of epidural space infection.

AB  - A deltoid motor response is a satisfactory endpoint for successful block. (Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:356?359. This study investigates the notion that a deltoid twitch may be just as effective as one in the biceps for predicting a successful motor block. Patients (N = 160) scheduled for shoulder surgery were studied prospectively. Interscalene blocks (ISBs) were performed using neurostimulation according to our standard technique. Twitches of the deltoid or biceps or both, whichever appeared first, were accepted and used as the endpoint for needle placement and injection of local anesthetic. Motor block success, i.e., patient inability to lift the arm against gravity, and minutes to motor block onset were recorded. Of the 160 ISBs performed, a biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients. In 54 patients, a deltoid twitch was elicited and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid contraction were elicited simultaneously. The failure rate did not differ widely among the groups; there was 1 failed motor block in the deltoid group and none in the other groups. There was no statistically significant difference in onset times between the 3 muscle twitch groups. Conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as a biceps twitch in determining accurate needle placement for ISB and in predicting successful motor block. Acceptance of a deltoid twitch during ISB eliminates the need for further probing and may translate into better patient acceptance and in a smaller risk of needle-induced nerve damage. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. Interscalene brachial plexus block provides a valuable technique for shoulder surgery. The literature is in agreement with elicitation of paresthesias versus peripheral nerve stimulation. The literature is somewhat unclear regarding deltoid muscle versus biceps twitch as a satisfactory endpoint, prior to injection of local anesthetic. This prospective study involved 160 patients presenting for elective shoulder surgery. A biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients; 54 had a deltoid twitch, and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid twitch were elicited. There was no statistically different onset time in the 3 groups; however, the failure rate did not differ in the 3 groups either (only 1 patient in the deltoid group had a failed block). The authors conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as one in the biceps at ensuring a successful interscalene brachial plexus block and that repositioning is not warranted if either muscle group is elicited. The authors should be applauded for this study because it strongly suggests that essentially any elicitation of deltoid or biceps twitch will result in a highly successful and clinically useful block.

AB  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. (Hospital Morvan, Brest, France) Ophthalmology 2000;107:1507?1511. This randomized, double-blinded study compared the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir in immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. One hundred ten immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus diagnosed within 72 h of skin eruption were treated; 56 were allocated to the valaciclovir group and 54 to the acyclovir group. Patients randomized to the valaciclovir group received 2 500-mg tablets of valaciclovir 3 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo twice daily. Patients in the acyclovir group received 1 800-mg tablet of acyclovir 5 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo 3 times daily for 7 days. Main outcome measures included the frequency, severity, and duration of ocular complications, patient records of zoster-associated pain, and the outcome of skin lesions. Tolerance was also assessed on the incidence and types of adverse effects and changes in laboratory parameters. The analysis was mainly descriptive and performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus were similar in the valaciclovir and acyclovir treatment groups. The main complications were conjunctivitis (54% and 52%, respectively), superficial keratitis (39% and 48%, respectively for punctate keratitis; 11 in each group for dendritic keratitis), stromal keratitis (13% in each group) and uveitis (13% and 17%, respectively). The long-term outcomes of these ocular complications were favorable and similar in both treatment groups. Pain duration, severity, and outcome of skin lesions were similar between groups. Most patients reported prodromal pain. After 1 month, 25% of the patients in the valaciclovir group and 31% in the acyclovir group still reported pain. The percentage of patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia decreased during follow-up. The tolerance to acyclovir and valaciclovir was comparable and considered good. The most frequent adverse events were vomiting and edema of the eyelids or face (3%?5%). Three serious adverse events not linked to the study drugs occurred. Valaciclovir is as effective as acyclovir in preventing ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, including conjunctivitis, superficial and stromal keratitis, and pain. Tolerability of the 2 drugs is similar, but the dosing schedule of valaciclovir is simpler. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study comparing the efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and its ophthalmologic complications and sequelae between valaciclovir and acyclovir. The initial review of the incidence and the associated ophthalmologic complications of untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus is concise and educational for physicians who do not interact with these kind of patients frequently. As pain physicians, it is part of our daily practice to deal with patient compliance to the medication treatment we prescribe. In this sense, this article provides comparison between 2 medications that are very similar in the efficacy profiles as well as their control of complications, but with acyclovir there is question of whether patients might be more compliant to the lower dosing frequency of valaciclovir. Results overall are similar between both drugs, but in terms of complications, although not statistically significant, the percentage is consistently lower with valaciclovir than acyclovir. The fact stated in this article regarding the bioavailability of valaciclovir being similar to that of intravenous acyclovir may account for this. The high incidence of irreversible ophthalmic complications such as anatomical loss of an eye (50%?70%) in untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus makes the question of patient compliance with treatment a crucial one. As physicians, we may not realize that for a patient there might be a significant difference between interrupting their daily life 3 times to take a medication instead of 5 times. In summation, this is a well-designed study with valid conclusions that would impact our practice of medicine.
