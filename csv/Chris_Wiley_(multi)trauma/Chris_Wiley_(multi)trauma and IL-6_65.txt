AB  - Bruno Guignard, Anne Elisabeth Bossard, Carole Coste, et al:Intraoperative remifentanil increases postoperative pain and morphine requirement. (Hôpital Ambroise Paré, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) Anesthesiology 2000;93:409??417. The study tested the hypothesis that intraoperative remifentanil administration results in acute opioid tolerance that is manifested by increased postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Fifty adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to 2 anesthetic regimens: (1) the remifentanil group or (2) the desflurane group. All patients were given a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg morphine 40 min before the end of surgery. Morphine was initially titrated to need by postanesthesia care nurses blinded to group assignment. Subsequently, patients?who were blinded to group assignment?controlled their own morphine administration. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded for 24 postoperative h. The results indicated that the mean remifentanil infusion rate was 0.3 ± 0.2 ?g · kg?1· min?1 in the remifentanil group, which was significantly greater than in the desflurane group. Intraoperative hemodynamic responses were similar in each group. Postoperative pain scores were significantly greater in the remifentanil group. These patients required morphine significantly earlier than those in the desflurane group and needed nearly twice as much morphine in the first 24 postoperative h: 59 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 43?71) versus 32 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 19?59; P<0.01). Conclude that relatively large-dose intraoperative remifentanil increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption. These data suggest that remifentanil causes acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia.

AB  - Valaciclovir: a review of its use in the management of herpes zoster. (Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) Drugs 2000;59:1317?1340. This study compared the effectiveness of valaciclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily for 7 days) and aciclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was found to alleviate zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. A 14-day regimen of valaciclovir showed no significant advantage over the 7-day regimen. A smaller trial in Japanese patients focusing primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster confirmed the similar efficacy of valaciclovir and aciclovir in the 7-day regime. Valaciclovir and aciclovir demonstrated similar efficacy for the control of cutaneous lesions and ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Starting treatment later than 72 h after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of valaciclovir on the duration of zoster-associated pain, suggesting that valaciclovir might be effective when given later than previously thought. However, valaciclovir should ideally be given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. Valaciclovir was well tolerated with nausea and headache as being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of the agent was similar to that seen with aciclovir or famciclovir. Conclude that the efficacy of valaciclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster has been confirmed and extended by follow-up studies in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in Japanese patients, and in the wider primary care setting. Valaciclovir is at least equivalent to, and better in certain parameters than, aciclovir and appears to have similar efficacy to famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a review article on the antiviral drug valaciclovir. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is commonly treated with the antiviral drug aciclovir. However, aciclovir has a low oral bioavailability that limits its efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was developed in order to have a more readily absorbed oral antiviral drug. When valaciclovir was compared to aciclovir in a large study, it was noted that valaciclovir was as effective in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. It was also noted valaciclovir alleviated zoster associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. Also, there was no significant advantage of treating valaciclovir 14 days versus 7 days; therefore, a 7-day regimen is recommended. In a smaller trial from Japan that focused primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster, there was also confirmation of similar efficacy of aciclovir and valaciclovir in a 7-day regimen. The similarity in efficacy was not only for cutaneous lesions but also for ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. In a large controlled trial, they compared valaciclovir and famciclovir. This showed similar efficacy in resolution of acute herpes zoster rashes shortening the duration of postherpetic neuralgia. It was purposed in the article that the therapeutic window for beneficial treatment with valaciclovir and zoster associated pain may be wider that previously though. It is still recommended that valaciclovir be ideally given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. However, starting treatment after 72 hours after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of the valaciclovir on duration of zoster associated pain. Valaciclovir is known to be well tolerated with nausea and headache being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of valaciclovir is similar to aciclovir or famciclovir. The purpose of this review was to present an overview of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in the assessment of pain in herpes zoster in comparison with known agents of aciclovir, famciclovir, and/or placebo. It is concluded that valaciclovir is an efficacious agent in the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. It's at least as efficacious as aciclovir and has similar efficacy to famciclovir. It is well tolerated with a similar side effect profile as aciclovir and famciclovir.

AB  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine: results of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (Center for Headache Management, Springfield, PA) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:782?789. This clinical trial determined the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace productivity loss. Adult migraine sufferers self-injected 6 mg of sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the first 4 h of a minimum of an 8-h work shift. Outcome measures included productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2 h after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work performance, and time to headache relief. A total of 206 patients underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the workplace. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median productivity loss 2 h after injection compared with placebo (25.2 versus 29.9 min, respectively) (P = 0.14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo (36.8 versus 72.6, respectively) (P = 0.001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients experienced shorter return to normal work performance at 2 h and across the work shift. Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients experienced headache relief 1 h after injection compared with placebo-treated patients. Conclude that across an 8-h work shift, sumatriptan was superior to the placebo in reducing productivity loss due to migraine.

AB  - Ethical considerations in the treatment of pain in a hospice environment. (Hospice Rozenheuvel, Rozendaal, The Netherlands) Patient Education and Counseling 2000;41:47?53. This article discussed some specific ethical problems encountered in hospice practice. Patient's autonomy with all its advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Ethical considerations with regard to risk taking and the treatment of pain are discussed. The needs of the patients are central to the discussion. Myths regarding opioids and pain therapy goals are addressed, as are approaches to treating intractable pain and dealing with patients who request assisted death. Acceptance of death may result in an active and creative attitude. Conclude that although scientific evidence of the processes taking place is still lacking, the modern hospice may be seen as a complementary, mainstream institution contributing to the development of whole medicine.

(North Tees Hospital, Hardwick, Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, UK) Anaesthesia 2000;55:659?665. This study assessed the ability of tonometry to measure differential effects of opiate and epidural analgesia on splanchnic blood flow. Forty patients for elective colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to receive epidural infusion or intravenous morphine. Gastric mucosal PCO2, pHi, standard pHi, PCO2 gap, and pH gap were measured after induction and on termination of surgery. These parameters were within normal limits at the end in most cases and there was no significant difference between the groups. The complication rate was similar in both groups and was not correlated with low pHi, but was correlated with blood loss. A difference in splanchnic perfusion was not demonstrated between the two groups. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. This study concerns the assessment of splanchnic blood flow measured indirectly and noninvasively in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The tonometer is a modified gastric tube terminating in a silicone balloon, which can be filled intermittently with either air or saline. With this technique, it is possible to measure gastric mucosal CO2 (PgCO2) and intramucosal pH and pH gap using a modified Henderson-Hasellbach equation, thus indirectly providing an estimate of splanchnic blood flow. These parameters were measured after induction and upon termination of surgery in 2 groups of patients randomly allocated to receive either intravenous morphine (10 mg) or epidural bupivacaine to achieve a T5 sensory level of blockade. The authors were unable to demonstrate a difference in splanchnic perfusion as assessed with tonometry between the 2 groups.

AB  - Spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) N Engl J Med 2000;343:618?624. This randomized trial involved patients who had had reflex sympathetic dystrophy for at least 6 months. Thirty-six patients were assigned to receive treatment with spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy, and 18 were assigned to receive physical therapy alone. The spinal cord stimulator was implanted only if test stimulation was successful. The intensity of pain was assessed (on a visual-analogue scale from 0 cm [no pain] to 10 cm [very severe pain]), as well as the global perceived effect (on a scale from 1 [worst ever] to 7 [best ever]), functional status, and the health-related quality of life. The test stimulation of the spinal cord was successful in 24 patients; the other 12 patients did not receive implanted stimulators. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the group assigned to receive spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy had a mean reduction of 2.4 cm in the intensity of pain at 6 months, as compared with an increase of 0.2 cm in the group assigned to receive physical therapy alone (P < 0.001 for comparison between the 2 groups). In addition, the proportion of patients with a score of 6 (?much improved?) for the global perceived effect was much higher in the spinal cord stimulation group than in the control group (39% vs. 6%, P = 0.01). There was no clinically important improvement in functional status. The health-related quality of life improved only in the 24 patients who actually underwent implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Six of the 24 patients had complications that required additional procedures, including removal of the device in 1 patient. Conclude in carefully selected patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy, electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life. Conmment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a well-written article describing a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which is also known as complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I). The results show clearly that in carefully selected patients suffering from this pain syndrome, SCS can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life compared to patients treated only with physical therapy. Functional status did not improve in either group of patients as SCS treats pain, but not the disease itself. The authors note that the improvement in the overall score for health-related quality of life was derived mainly from the alleviation of pain as in the study population, pain was the primary source of distress. This study represents a major reference for pain doctors and neurosurgeons treating CRPS and chronic pain.

AB  - The impact of spinal problems on the health status of patients: have we underestimated the effect? (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire) Spine 2000;25:1509?1514. This prospective study involved 17,774 patients who consulted spine centers and aimed to qualify the effect that spinal diagnoses have on patient's physical functional status (SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score) compared with other common conditions and to qualify the effects of comorbidities on physical functional status in spine patients. The study patients were a mean of 47.5 years of age, 54.7% were female, 52.3% had lumbosacral diagnoses, and 82% has had 3 or more months of pain. The population had a mean PCS score of 30.4 ± 9.95 (SD) compared with 50.0 ± 10.00 for the general United States population. The more comorbidities in a patient, the lower the PCS score (Spearman rank correlation = ?0.27). The 5 comorbid conditions that lowered the PCS the most included congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Conclude the PCS score is greatly affected in patients with spinal problems. The study population's OCS was lower or similar to the PCS for patients with other illnesses reported in the literature. Further, the presence of comorbidity in spine patients adds to the burden of spinal conditions on functional status.

AB  - Endocrine consequences of long-term intrathecal administration of opioids. (University of Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium) J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2000;85:2215?2222. This study involved 73 patients (29 men and 44 women) receiving opioids intrathecally for nonmalignant pain who were enrolled for extensive endocrine investigation. At the time of hormonal determination, the mean duration of opioid treatment was 26.6 ± 16.3 months; the mean daily dose of morphine was 4.8 ± 3.2 mg. The control group consisted of 20 patients (11 men and 9 women) with a comparable pain syndrome, but not treated with opioids. Decreased libido or impotency was present in 23 of 24 men receiving opioids. The serum testosterone level was below 9 nmol/L in 25 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The free androgen index was below normal in 18 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The serum LH level was less than 2 U/L in 20 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). Serum FSH was comparable in both groups. Decreased libido was present in 22 of 32 women receiving opioids. All 21 premenopausal females developed either amenorrhea or an irregular menstrual cycle, with ovulation in only 1. Serum LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were lower in the opioid group. In all 18 postmenopausal females significantly decreased serum LH (P < 0.001) and FSH (P = 0.012) levels were found. The 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion was below 20 ?g/day in 14 of 71 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.003). The peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was below 180 ?g/L in 9 of 61 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the nonopioid group (P = 0.002). The insulin-like growth factor I sd score was below ?2 sd in 12 of 73 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.002). The peak GH response to hypoglycemia was below 3 ?g/L in 9 of 62 subjects and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.010). Thyroid function tests and PRL levels were considered normal. No metabolic disturbances were recorded, apart from significantly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.041) and elevated total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P = 0.008) in the opioid group compared to the control group. Supplementation with gonadal steroids improved sexual function in most patients. Conclude of all patients receiving intrathecal opioids, the large majority of men and all women developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, about 15% developed central hypocorticism, and about 15% developed GH deficiency. These findings suggest that further investigations are required to determine the need for systematic endocrine work-up in these patients and the necessity for substitutive therapy.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Use of computed tomography for maxillary nerve block in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. (Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Mibu, Tochigi, Japan) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:417?419. A report of a 90-year-old woman who had a 30-year history of episodic pain in her right maxillary region is presented. An attempt to block the nerve with classic technique was made, but eliciting paresthesia could not identify the nerve. In addition, bleeding was noted after repeated attempts. To minimize complications and confirm the correct position of the needle tip, the block was planned with a suprazygomatic approach using computed tomography (CT) guidance. The needle was inserted without paresthesia. The CT scan showed the needle tip was placed at the entrance of the pterygopalatine fossa and the distribution of contrast medium spread appropriately around the pterygopalatine fossa. After confirming the clinical effect and lack of complications of the block using the local anesthetic, 0.5 mL of 7% phenol was injected. The technique resulted in complete sensory loss in the area innervated by the maxillary nerve and did so without complications. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article in which the authors describe their technique for treating trigeminal neuralgia. The authors were faced with a significant problem, which was to perform a maxillary nerve block in a patient with difficult anatomy. The approach and technique were clearly thought out with an excellent result. The axial cuts demonstrate needle position under CT scan and the appropriate spread of contrast material through the pterygopalatine fossa.

AB  - The addition of dilute epinephrine produces equieffectivenes of bupivacaine enantiomers for cutaneous analgesia in the rat. (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:410?416. This study investigated the effectiveness for cutaneous analgesia of bupivacaine (Bup) stereoisomers in male rats. As a model of infiltration anesthesia, inhibition of a nocifensive reflex by subcutaneous injection of 0.6mL of different concentrations of R-, S-, and racemic-Bup was evaluated quantitatively by the fraction of times a pinprick failed to evoke a nocifensive motor response. R-Bup was more potent in the extent of the block; however, S-Bup had a longer-lasting action at smaller doses. This significant difference was apparent when R-Bup and S-Bup were administered in equipotent doses of 0.06% and 0.075%, respectively. Co-injection of epinephrine (Epi) with these equipotent doses enhanced and prolonged the blocking effects of both Bup stereoisomers, although the dilutions of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 Epi itself induced partial, transient analgesia. At 1:2,000,000 dilution, Epi alone had no analgesic effect; however, when co-injected with the shorter-acting R-Bup (0.06%), Epi prolonged its blocking effect to equal the duration of the block evoked by equipotent S-Bup (0.075%). Conclude that R-Bup is more potent for cutaneous analgesia and that the longer duration of the block by S-Bup probably originates from vasoconstrictor activity.

AB  - Sympathetic-sensory coupling after L5 spinal nerve lesion in the rat and its relation to changes in dorsal root ganglion blood flow. (Christian-Albrechts-Universität, Kiel, Germany) Pain 2000;87:335?345. In rats 3-56 days after L5 spinal nerve lesion, the authors of this study tested the responses of axotomized afferent fibers recorded in the dorsal root of the lesioned segment to norepinephrine (NE, 0.5 ?g/kg) injected intravenously and to selective electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST). In some experiments, blood flow was measured in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by laser Doppler flowmetry. The majority of lesioned afferent fibers with spontaneous activity responded to neither LST stimulation (82.4%) nor NE (71.4%). In those that did react to LST stimulation, responses occurred only at high stimulation frequencies and they could be mimicked by nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor drugs (angiotensin II, vasopressin). Excitatory responses to LST stimulation were closely correlated with the stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG. Therefore, the activation of lesioned afferents might be brought about indirectly by an impaired blood supply to the DRG. To test this hypothesis, a strong and sustained baseline vasoconstriction in the DRG was induced by blocking endothelial nitric oxide synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) applied systemically. L-NAME enhanced baseline vascular resistance in the DRG about threefold and also increased stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions. After L-NAME, the majority of axotomized neurons with spontaneous activity were activated by LST stimulation (76%) or NE (75%). Again, activations closely followed stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG provided that a critical level of vasoconstriction was exceeded. Inhibitory responses to LST stimulation were generally rare and could be reversed to activation by prolonged stimulation or after L-NAME. These results show that sympathetic-sensory coupling occurs only in a minority of axotomized afferents after L5 spinal nerve injury. Like previous studies, they cast doubt on the notion that L5 spinal nerve lesion is a good model for sympathetically maintained pain. Since responses of lesioned afferent neurons to LST stimulation and NE could be provoked with high reliability after inducing vasoconstriction in the DRG, and since they mirrored stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions in the DRG, it appears that in this model the association of sympathetic activity with afferent discharge occurs mainly when perfusion of the DRG is impaired. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Animal research has revealed that massive ectopic afferent discharge is generated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following nerve injury. This source of ectopic firing is in addition to activity that may be generated at the nerve injury site (Tinel sign). The combined impulse barrage is almost certainly an important cause of neuropathic pain. It has been discovered recently that the intensity of the ectopic DRG barrage is modulated by sympathetic efferent activity. This is a potential link between sympathetic activity and symptomatology in sympathetic related pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy. But what is the mechanism of the sympathetic-sensory coupling? Considerable evidence indicates that axotomized DRG neurons become abnormally adrenosensitivity. Habler et al now point out an additional, indirect, coupling mechanism ? modulation of intrinsic DRG blood flow. That is, sympathetic activity may reduce DRG blood flow inducing partial ischemia, with the ischemia causing neural excitation. This finding may also have broader implications as spinal pathology can also compromise DRG blood flow. Might low back pain and sciatica, for example, derive from this same process? It is surprising that ectopic firing in the DRG has played so little part in clinical thinking and practice in patients with neuropathic pain. So far.

AB  - Perfusion of the mechanically compressed lumbar ganglion with lidocaine reduces mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in the rat. (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR) J Neurophysiol 2000;84:798?805. This study used an animal model of lumbar radiculopathy to investigate the neurological mechanisms of cutaneous hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. The rat L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was chronically compressed by inserting a hollow perforated rod into the intervertebral foramen. The DRG was constantly perfused through the hollow rod with either lidocaine or normal saline delivered by a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Behavioral evidence for neuropathic pain after DRG compression involved measuring the incidence of hindlimb withdrawals to both punctate indentations of the hind paw with mechanical probes exerting different bending forces and to light stroking of the hind paw with a cotton wisp. Behavioral results showed that for saline-treated control rats: the withdrawal thresholds for the ipsilateral and contralateral paws to mechanical stimuli decreased significantly after surgery and the incidence of foot withdrawal to light stroking significantly increased on both ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws. Local perfusion of the compressed DRG with 2% lidocaine for 7 days at a low flow-rate (1 ?l/h), or for 1 day at a high flow-rate (8 ?l/h) partially reduced the decrease in the withdrawal thresholds on the ipsilateral foot, but did not affect the contralateral foot. The incidence of foot withdrawal in response to light stroking with a cotton wisp decreased significantly on the ipsilateral foot and was completely abolished on the contralateral foot in the lidocaine treatment groups. Conclude that compression of the L5 DRG induced central pain syndrome that included bilateral mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Results also suggest that a lidocaine block, or a reduction in abnormal activity from the compressed ganglia to the spinal cord, could partially reduce mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Tonic compression of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in animal preparations, and presumably also in man, causes sensory cells to become electrically hyperexcitable. The resulting spontaneous discharge is a cause of ongoing paresthesias and pain. Many believe that in addition, this ectopic activity can trigger and maintain central sensitization in the spinal cord, resulting in tactile hypersensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in the body parts innervated by the ganglion. This second effect of ectopic DRG activity, however, is controversial. Zhang and collaborators now provide strong new support for this idea by showing that lidocaine infusion into the DRG, with consequent block of the ectopic DRG firing, considerably reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia for the duration of the infusion (weeks). Here is a novel therapeutic approach that deserves a try.

AB  - Effect of peripheral morphine in a human model of acute inflammatory pain. (Hvidovre University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark) BR J Anaesth 2000;85:228?232. This study used a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design in a human model of acute inflammatory pain (heat injury). Eighteen healthy volunteers were studied who each received morphine locally (2 mg), morphine systemically (2 mg), or placebo on three separate study days. The subjects received morphine infiltration subcutaneously (s.c.) 1 h before heat injury (47°C, 7 min) and naloxone infiltration s.c. (0.2 mg) 2.5 h after the heat injury. Hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli were examined using von Frey hairs and thermodes, and pain was rated using a visual analogue scale. The burns produced significant hyperalgesia, but local morphine infiltration neither reduced pain during the burn, nor primary or secondary hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli after the burn. Conclude peripherally applied morphine had no acute antinociceptive effects in this human model of acute inflammatory pain. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. This study is well controlled for placebo effect and the systemic effect of subcutanuously injected morphine. One of the few criticisms that can be made is the amount of narcotic injected. This may not be enough to bind to a sufficient number of receptors. One would expect some role for peripheral opioid receptors. The other comment would be that this type of injury (mainly small fiber involvement in this case) does not represent all types of nociception and, therefore, the peripheral action of morphine can not be excluded for different types of nociception. But overall this is a convincing study, consistent with the literature.

AB  - Prospects for the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia in herpes zoster patients. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S90?100. This review discussed the results of recent studies that have identified risk factors for the development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and have implicated several peripheral and central mechanisms in its pathophysiology. These risk factors and mechanisms of PHN provide a basis for hypothesizing that combining antiviral therapy with analgesic treatment beginning as soon as possible after the onset of herpes zoster would reduce the risk of PHN beyond that achieved by antiviral therapy alone. Conclude this treatment approach would be expected to reduce the risk of PHN in herpes zoster patients by attenuating acute pain and thereby preventing the initiation of central mechanisms of chronic pain.

AB  - Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: an update. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Drugs 2000;59:1113?1126. This article provided an update on recent developments in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also been demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated. Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred antidepressant for treatment of PHN. The topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as effective as tricycline antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments for patients with PHN.

AB  - A validated, practical classification procedure for many persistent low back pain patients. (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) Pain 2000;87:89?97. This article discussed the development of a simple procedure for assigning persistent low back pain (LBP) patients to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive, hierarchically organized classes. This procedure relies on the spatial distribution of a patient's pain and the results of straight leg raise tests to make the assignment. The procedure was applied to a large group of patients who sought treatment for persistent LBP at several university affiliated tertiary care clinics, and found that the resulting 4 classes of patients were significantly different from one another in their presentation, and in the way they were evaluated and treated by physicians. Conclude that the procedure may have practical research and clinical applications.

AB  - Simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness. (University of California, Sacramento, CA) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:938?943. This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects, and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. Measurement of 3 tasks was performed on a work simulation device on 2 different days separated by 1 week. Associations between work task performance and previously reported strength measures in 6 muscle groups by hand-held dynamometry (HHD) were examined. This study was conducted in the human performance laboratory of a university and consisted of a convenience sample of ambulatory outpatients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, type I (n = 9), myotonic muscular dystrophy (n = 10), and able-bodied controls (n = 11). Mean between-session differences for work simulation tasks ranged from ?11% to +4% for peak torque and from ?12% to +12% for total work; test sessions did not differ significantly for either patient or control groups. All groups had between-session intraclass correlation coefficients usually> 0.80, which indicated good consistency. In general, correlations between peak torque during work simulation and HHD were strongest in the control group. Conclude that persons with neuromuscular weakness reliably performed the simulated work tasks examined in this investigation. Work simulation tasks may be a useful tool to assess muscular performance in persons with neuromuscular weakness. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article addresses something that is very important when evaluating patient progress during rehabilitation. It is common in rehab to evaluate muscle groups and to determine a muscular performance by using isolated muscle group testing. The problem with this is that it doesn't necessarily correlate with tasks that patients perform on a day-to-day basis. The purpose of the study was to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. The work simulation tasks included knob-turning (alternating pronation and supination), linear motion (alternating push/pull motion), and lever arm (push-down motion). This study did accomplish its goals. The peak torque and total work measured in work simulation tasks did not differ significantly between test and retest sessions for either the patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness or the control groups. This study addresses an issue that other studies have not. Just because a patient shows improvement in strength measure by hand held dynamometry does not necessarily mean that he or she will be able to accomplish tasks that are performed at home. The main goal of rehabilitation is for patients to be able to perform activities of daily living around the house and at work. If this is not accomplished then their rehabilitation is for naught.
