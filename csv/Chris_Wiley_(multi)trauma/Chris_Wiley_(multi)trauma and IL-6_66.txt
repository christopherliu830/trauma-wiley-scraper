AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the importance of diabetes as a major complication of obesity, starting with examining the epidemiological relationship between diabetes and obesity. It is clear from the epidemiological data reported that obesity is strongly associated with onset and, in particular, the premature onset, of type 2 diabetes. However, in established heart disease and heart failure, obesity is associated with lower mortality. The chapter considers the epidemiological evidence linking adiposity with the development of cancer, and describes the proposed mechanisms by which excess body fat may impact on cancer risk. The global prevalence of osteoarthritis continues to rise, both because of an ageing population as well as because of the current obesity epidemic, with obesity in the elderly becoming an increasing problem. The chapter explains individual psychosocial factors and views them as part of a vicious circle, including personal beliefs. The combination of binge eating and obesity is particularly problematic with regard to comorbidity and risk.

AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) with resistance to local anesthetic block: a case report. (State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY) J Clin Anesth 2000;12:67?71. A case of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) Type 1 in a 12-year-old girl is presented. The patient did not respond to the usual therapeutic modalities used to treat CRPS including physical therapy, lumbar sympathetic block, epidural local anesthetic block, intravenous lidocaine infusion, or other oral medications. Of note is the fact that during epidural block the patient demonstrated a resistance to local anesthetic neural blockade in the area of the body involved with the pain problem. The mechanism of this resistance could be related to the changes in the dorsal horn cells of the spinal cord, secondary to activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of this pain syndrome.

AB  - Epidural catheter tip cultures: results of a 4-year audit and implications for clinical practice. (Royal Adelaide Hospital and University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:360?367. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of routine microbiological culture of epidural catheter tips after use in acute pain management, and to identify patterns of culture result with respect to both indications for, and duration of, epidural catheterization. Over a 4-year period, when acute pain service (APS) protocol required epidural catheter tips to be sent for microbiological culture on removal, APS saw 1,810 patients who had received epidural analgesia. The records of the patients were reviewed. Culture results were available for 1,443 (79.7%) patients: 1,027 catheter tips (71.2%) were sterile, while 416 (28.8%) were positive for at least 1 type of microorganism. Clinically, no epidural space infections were identified. The highest positive culture rates were found from epidural catheters used in treatment of pain from fractured ribs or fractured pelves. The lowest incidences occurred in elective orthopedic and thoracic surgery. The proportion of epidural catheters with positive culture results steadily increased with the duration of catheterization, but there were no clinically significant differences for catheters left in situ for either 3 or 4 days. Conclude that a significant proportion of epidural catheter tips may be ?culture positive? after removal. It is suggested that this probably represents colonization of the skin at the catheter insertion site and subsequent contamination of the catheter tip on removal of the catheter. The large number of ?culture positive? tips in the absence of clinically identifiable epidural space infection suggests that routine culture of epidural catheter tips is clinically irrelevant in the vast majority of cases, and that it is not a good predictor of the presence of an epidural space infection. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. Clinically relevant epidural catheter-induced infection is quite rare with the largest study on this topic revealing 1/505,000 catheter placements. This retrospective study involved the insertion of 1810 epidural catheters. At the time of insertion, full aseptic precautions were employed. When the catheters were removed, they were cultured and it was revealed that 28.8% were positive for at least 1 organism. This prevalence is relatively consistent with other published studies. The most common organism found was coagulase negative staphylococcus. Interestingly, not one of these patients developed an epidural abscess. The authors speculate that the relatively common prevalence of organism positive cultures was related to poor sterile technique at the catheter insertion site at the time of placement and/or removal. The authors conclude that epidural catheter contamination in the vast majority of cases is clinically irrelevant. In as much as epidural abscess can have vital clinical implications, it behooves the practitioner to adhere to strict sterile techniques even though the likelihood of infection is extremely low. Certainly, this study reinforces the fact that routine culture of epidural catheter tips is not a good predicator of epidural space infection.

AB  - A deltoid motor response is a satisfactory endpoint for successful block. (Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:356?359. This study investigates the notion that a deltoid twitch may be just as effective as one in the biceps for predicting a successful motor block. Patients (N = 160) scheduled for shoulder surgery were studied prospectively. Interscalene blocks (ISBs) were performed using neurostimulation according to our standard technique. Twitches of the deltoid or biceps or both, whichever appeared first, were accepted and used as the endpoint for needle placement and injection of local anesthetic. Motor block success, i.e., patient inability to lift the arm against gravity, and minutes to motor block onset were recorded. Of the 160 ISBs performed, a biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients. In 54 patients, a deltoid twitch was elicited and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid contraction were elicited simultaneously. The failure rate did not differ widely among the groups; there was 1 failed motor block in the deltoid group and none in the other groups. There was no statistically significant difference in onset times between the 3 muscle twitch groups. Conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as a biceps twitch in determining accurate needle placement for ISB and in predicting successful motor block. Acceptance of a deltoid twitch during ISB eliminates the need for further probing and may translate into better patient acceptance and in a smaller risk of needle-induced nerve damage. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. Interscalene brachial plexus block provides a valuable technique for shoulder surgery. The literature is in agreement with elicitation of paresthesias versus peripheral nerve stimulation. The literature is somewhat unclear regarding deltoid muscle versus biceps twitch as a satisfactory endpoint, prior to injection of local anesthetic. This prospective study involved 160 patients presenting for elective shoulder surgery. A biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients; 54 had a deltoid twitch, and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid twitch were elicited. There was no statistically different onset time in the 3 groups; however, the failure rate did not differ in the 3 groups either (only 1 patient in the deltoid group had a failed block). The authors conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as one in the biceps at ensuring a successful interscalene brachial plexus block and that repositioning is not warranted if either muscle group is elicited. The authors should be applauded for this study because it strongly suggests that essentially any elicitation of deltoid or biceps twitch will result in a highly successful and clinically useful block.

AB  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. (Hospital Morvan, Brest, France) Ophthalmology 2000;107:1507?1511. This randomized, double-blinded study compared the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir in immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. One hundred ten immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus diagnosed within 72 h of skin eruption were treated; 56 were allocated to the valaciclovir group and 54 to the acyclovir group. Patients randomized to the valaciclovir group received 2 500-mg tablets of valaciclovir 3 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo twice daily. Patients in the acyclovir group received 1 800-mg tablet of acyclovir 5 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo 3 times daily for 7 days. Main outcome measures included the frequency, severity, and duration of ocular complications, patient records of zoster-associated pain, and the outcome of skin lesions. Tolerance was also assessed on the incidence and types of adverse effects and changes in laboratory parameters. The analysis was mainly descriptive and performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus were similar in the valaciclovir and acyclovir treatment groups. The main complications were conjunctivitis (54% and 52%, respectively), superficial keratitis (39% and 48%, respectively for punctate keratitis; 11 in each group for dendritic keratitis), stromal keratitis (13% in each group) and uveitis (13% and 17%, respectively). The long-term outcomes of these ocular complications were favorable and similar in both treatment groups. Pain duration, severity, and outcome of skin lesions were similar between groups. Most patients reported prodromal pain. After 1 month, 25% of the patients in the valaciclovir group and 31% in the acyclovir group still reported pain. The percentage of patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia decreased during follow-up. The tolerance to acyclovir and valaciclovir was comparable and considered good. The most frequent adverse events were vomiting and edema of the eyelids or face (3%?5%). Three serious adverse events not linked to the study drugs occurred. Valaciclovir is as effective as acyclovir in preventing ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, including conjunctivitis, superficial and stromal keratitis, and pain. Tolerability of the 2 drugs is similar, but the dosing schedule of valaciclovir is simpler. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study comparing the efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and its ophthalmologic complications and sequelae between valaciclovir and acyclovir. The initial review of the incidence and the associated ophthalmologic complications of untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus is concise and educational for physicians who do not interact with these kind of patients frequently. As pain physicians, it is part of our daily practice to deal with patient compliance to the medication treatment we prescribe. In this sense, this article provides comparison between 2 medications that are very similar in the efficacy profiles as well as their control of complications, but with acyclovir there is question of whether patients might be more compliant to the lower dosing frequency of valaciclovir. Results overall are similar between both drugs, but in terms of complications, although not statistically significant, the percentage is consistently lower with valaciclovir than acyclovir. The fact stated in this article regarding the bioavailability of valaciclovir being similar to that of intravenous acyclovir may account for this. The high incidence of irreversible ophthalmic complications such as anatomical loss of an eye (50%?70%) in untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus makes the question of patient compliance with treatment a crucial one. As physicians, we may not realize that for a patient there might be a significant difference between interrupting their daily life 3 times to take a medication instead of 5 times. In summation, this is a well-designed study with valid conclusions that would impact our practice of medicine.

AB  - Bruno Guignard, Anne Elisabeth Bossard, Carole Coste, et al:Intraoperative remifentanil increases postoperative pain and morphine requirement. (Hôpital Ambroise Paré, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) Anesthesiology 2000;93:409??417. The study tested the hypothesis that intraoperative remifentanil administration results in acute opioid tolerance that is manifested by increased postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Fifty adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to 2 anesthetic regimens: (1) the remifentanil group or (2) the desflurane group. All patients were given a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg morphine 40 min before the end of surgery. Morphine was initially titrated to need by postanesthesia care nurses blinded to group assignment. Subsequently, patients?who were blinded to group assignment?controlled their own morphine administration. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded for 24 postoperative h. The results indicated that the mean remifentanil infusion rate was 0.3 ± 0.2 ?g · kg?1· min?1 in the remifentanil group, which was significantly greater than in the desflurane group. Intraoperative hemodynamic responses were similar in each group. Postoperative pain scores were significantly greater in the remifentanil group. These patients required morphine significantly earlier than those in the desflurane group and needed nearly twice as much morphine in the first 24 postoperative h: 59 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 43?71) versus 32 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 19?59; P<0.01). Conclude that relatively large-dose intraoperative remifentanil increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption. These data suggest that remifentanil causes acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia.

AB  - Valaciclovir: a review of its use in the management of herpes zoster. (Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) Drugs 2000;59:1317?1340. This study compared the effectiveness of valaciclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily for 7 days) and aciclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was found to alleviate zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. A 14-day regimen of valaciclovir showed no significant advantage over the 7-day regimen. A smaller trial in Japanese patients focusing primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster confirmed the similar efficacy of valaciclovir and aciclovir in the 7-day regime. Valaciclovir and aciclovir demonstrated similar efficacy for the control of cutaneous lesions and ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Starting treatment later than 72 h after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of valaciclovir on the duration of zoster-associated pain, suggesting that valaciclovir might be effective when given later than previously thought. However, valaciclovir should ideally be given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. Valaciclovir was well tolerated with nausea and headache as being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of the agent was similar to that seen with aciclovir or famciclovir. Conclude that the efficacy of valaciclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster has been confirmed and extended by follow-up studies in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in Japanese patients, and in the wider primary care setting. Valaciclovir is at least equivalent to, and better in certain parameters than, aciclovir and appears to have similar efficacy to famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a review article on the antiviral drug valaciclovir. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is commonly treated with the antiviral drug aciclovir. However, aciclovir has a low oral bioavailability that limits its efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was developed in order to have a more readily absorbed oral antiviral drug. When valaciclovir was compared to aciclovir in a large study, it was noted that valaciclovir was as effective in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. It was also noted valaciclovir alleviated zoster associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. Also, there was no significant advantage of treating valaciclovir 14 days versus 7 days; therefore, a 7-day regimen is recommended. In a smaller trial from Japan that focused primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster, there was also confirmation of similar efficacy of aciclovir and valaciclovir in a 7-day regimen. The similarity in efficacy was not only for cutaneous lesions but also for ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. In a large controlled trial, they compared valaciclovir and famciclovir. This showed similar efficacy in resolution of acute herpes zoster rashes shortening the duration of postherpetic neuralgia. It was purposed in the article that the therapeutic window for beneficial treatment with valaciclovir and zoster associated pain may be wider that previously though. It is still recommended that valaciclovir be ideally given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. However, starting treatment after 72 hours after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of the valaciclovir on duration of zoster associated pain. Valaciclovir is known to be well tolerated with nausea and headache being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of valaciclovir is similar to aciclovir or famciclovir. The purpose of this review was to present an overview of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in the assessment of pain in herpes zoster in comparison with known agents of aciclovir, famciclovir, and/or placebo. It is concluded that valaciclovir is an efficacious agent in the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. It's at least as efficacious as aciclovir and has similar efficacy to famciclovir. It is well tolerated with a similar side effect profile as aciclovir and famciclovir.

AB  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine: results of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (Center for Headache Management, Springfield, PA) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:782?789. This clinical trial determined the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace productivity loss. Adult migraine sufferers self-injected 6 mg of sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the first 4 h of a minimum of an 8-h work shift. Outcome measures included productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2 h after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work performance, and time to headache relief. A total of 206 patients underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the workplace. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median productivity loss 2 h after injection compared with placebo (25.2 versus 29.9 min, respectively) (P = 0.14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo (36.8 versus 72.6, respectively) (P = 0.001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients experienced shorter return to normal work performance at 2 h and across the work shift. Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients experienced headache relief 1 h after injection compared with placebo-treated patients. Conclude that across an 8-h work shift, sumatriptan was superior to the placebo in reducing productivity loss due to migraine.

AB  - Ethical considerations in the treatment of pain in a hospice environment. (Hospice Rozenheuvel, Rozendaal, The Netherlands) Patient Education and Counseling 2000;41:47?53. This article discussed some specific ethical problems encountered in hospice practice. Patient's autonomy with all its advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Ethical considerations with regard to risk taking and the treatment of pain are discussed. The needs of the patients are central to the discussion. Myths regarding opioids and pain therapy goals are addressed, as are approaches to treating intractable pain and dealing with patients who request assisted death. Acceptance of death may result in an active and creative attitude. Conclude that although scientific evidence of the processes taking place is still lacking, the modern hospice may be seen as a complementary, mainstream institution contributing to the development of whole medicine.

(North Tees Hospital, Hardwick, Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, UK) Anaesthesia 2000;55:659?665. This study assessed the ability of tonometry to measure differential effects of opiate and epidural analgesia on splanchnic blood flow. Forty patients for elective colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to receive epidural infusion or intravenous morphine. Gastric mucosal PCO2, pHi, standard pHi, PCO2 gap, and pH gap were measured after induction and on termination of surgery. These parameters were within normal limits at the end in most cases and there was no significant difference between the groups. The complication rate was similar in both groups and was not correlated with low pHi, but was correlated with blood loss. A difference in splanchnic perfusion was not demonstrated between the two groups. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. This study concerns the assessment of splanchnic blood flow measured indirectly and noninvasively in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The tonometer is a modified gastric tube terminating in a silicone balloon, which can be filled intermittently with either air or saline. With this technique, it is possible to measure gastric mucosal CO2 (PgCO2) and intramucosal pH and pH gap using a modified Henderson-Hasellbach equation, thus indirectly providing an estimate of splanchnic blood flow. These parameters were measured after induction and upon termination of surgery in 2 groups of patients randomly allocated to receive either intravenous morphine (10 mg) or epidural bupivacaine to achieve a T5 sensory level of blockade. The authors were unable to demonstrate a difference in splanchnic perfusion as assessed with tonometry between the 2 groups.

AB  - Spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) N Engl J Med 2000;343:618?624. This randomized trial involved patients who had had reflex sympathetic dystrophy for at least 6 months. Thirty-six patients were assigned to receive treatment with spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy, and 18 were assigned to receive physical therapy alone. The spinal cord stimulator was implanted only if test stimulation was successful. The intensity of pain was assessed (on a visual-analogue scale from 0 cm [no pain] to 10 cm [very severe pain]), as well as the global perceived effect (on a scale from 1 [worst ever] to 7 [best ever]), functional status, and the health-related quality of life. The test stimulation of the spinal cord was successful in 24 patients; the other 12 patients did not receive implanted stimulators. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the group assigned to receive spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy had a mean reduction of 2.4 cm in the intensity of pain at 6 months, as compared with an increase of 0.2 cm in the group assigned to receive physical therapy alone (P < 0.001 for comparison between the 2 groups). In addition, the proportion of patients with a score of 6 (?much improved?) for the global perceived effect was much higher in the spinal cord stimulation group than in the control group (39% vs. 6%, P = 0.01). There was no clinically important improvement in functional status. The health-related quality of life improved only in the 24 patients who actually underwent implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Six of the 24 patients had complications that required additional procedures, including removal of the device in 1 patient. Conclude in carefully selected patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy, electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life. Conmment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a well-written article describing a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which is also known as complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I). The results show clearly that in carefully selected patients suffering from this pain syndrome, SCS can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life compared to patients treated only with physical therapy. Functional status did not improve in either group of patients as SCS treats pain, but not the disease itself. The authors note that the improvement in the overall score for health-related quality of life was derived mainly from the alleviation of pain as in the study population, pain was the primary source of distress. This study represents a major reference for pain doctors and neurosurgeons treating CRPS and chronic pain.

AB  - The impact of spinal problems on the health status of patients: have we underestimated the effect? (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire) Spine 2000;25:1509?1514. This prospective study involved 17,774 patients who consulted spine centers and aimed to qualify the effect that spinal diagnoses have on patient's physical functional status (SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score) compared with other common conditions and to qualify the effects of comorbidities on physical functional status in spine patients. The study patients were a mean of 47.5 years of age, 54.7% were female, 52.3% had lumbosacral diagnoses, and 82% has had 3 or more months of pain. The population had a mean PCS score of 30.4 ± 9.95 (SD) compared with 50.0 ± 10.00 for the general United States population. The more comorbidities in a patient, the lower the PCS score (Spearman rank correlation = ?0.27). The 5 comorbid conditions that lowered the PCS the most included congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Conclude the PCS score is greatly affected in patients with spinal problems. The study population's OCS was lower or similar to the PCS for patients with other illnesses reported in the literature. Further, the presence of comorbidity in spine patients adds to the burden of spinal conditions on functional status.

AB  - Endocrine consequences of long-term intrathecal administration of opioids. (University of Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium) J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2000;85:2215?2222. This study involved 73 patients (29 men and 44 women) receiving opioids intrathecally for nonmalignant pain who were enrolled for extensive endocrine investigation. At the time of hormonal determination, the mean duration of opioid treatment was 26.6 ± 16.3 months; the mean daily dose of morphine was 4.8 ± 3.2 mg. The control group consisted of 20 patients (11 men and 9 women) with a comparable pain syndrome, but not treated with opioids. Decreased libido or impotency was present in 23 of 24 men receiving opioids. The serum testosterone level was below 9 nmol/L in 25 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The free androgen index was below normal in 18 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The serum LH level was less than 2 U/L in 20 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). Serum FSH was comparable in both groups. Decreased libido was present in 22 of 32 women receiving opioids. All 21 premenopausal females developed either amenorrhea or an irregular menstrual cycle, with ovulation in only 1. Serum LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were lower in the opioid group. In all 18 postmenopausal females significantly decreased serum LH (P < 0.001) and FSH (P = 0.012) levels were found. The 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion was below 20 ?g/day in 14 of 71 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.003). The peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was below 180 ?g/L in 9 of 61 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the nonopioid group (P = 0.002). The insulin-like growth factor I sd score was below ?2 sd in 12 of 73 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.002). The peak GH response to hypoglycemia was below 3 ?g/L in 9 of 62 subjects and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.010). Thyroid function tests and PRL levels were considered normal. No metabolic disturbances were recorded, apart from significantly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.041) and elevated total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P = 0.008) in the opioid group compared to the control group. Supplementation with gonadal steroids improved sexual function in most patients. Conclude of all patients receiving intrathecal opioids, the large majority of men and all women developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, about 15% developed central hypocorticism, and about 15% developed GH deficiency. These findings suggest that further investigations are required to determine the need for systematic endocrine work-up in these patients and the necessity for substitutive therapy.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Detrimental effects of oral infections on general health have been known for almost 3000?years. Modern studies, however, have cast new light on the pathogenic mechanisms by which oral infections appear to link with morbidity and mortality. In particular, among the elderly, poor dental health seems to associate with all-cause mortality. This review aims to provide an overview of present knowledge of these issues, starting from dental bacteraemia, oral mucosal infections and problems of drug resistance and, briefly, discussing what is known about the link between oral health and some systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis and type-2 diabetes. The main conclusions are that scientific evidence is still weak on these interactions and that the elderly should be better taken into account when planning future studies. Functions of the body differ in the frail and diseased from those of the young. Consequently, novel prevention and treatment strategies should be developed and properly tested for combating oral infections in elderly populations. Specific suggestions for further research are outlined.

AB  - Lateral cervical epidural catheter placement for continuous unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:313?317. This article discussed the use of a laterally directed cervical epidural catheter for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. The technique was used in a series of 30 patients to produce unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. A case report of a patient treated with this technique and a description of the technique as well as the results from the series are presented. The method included placement of an epidural catheter at the C6-7 vertebral interspace; the needle bevel and catheter were directed to the affected side in a woman with a history of complex regional pain syndrome of the right upper extremity. A unilateral block was shown with the technique by anatomic parameters (unilateral contrast dye spread), physiologic parameters (unilateral Horner's syndrome), and symptomatic parameters (unilateral, subjective neural block). One patient treated with the technique had bilateral effects; however, no patient had a predominant block on the contralateral side and no complications developed. The case report showed results that were typical of the series of 30 patients. Conclude that the laterally directed cervical epidural catheter was an effective technique to produce continuous unilateral analgesia and sympathetic block.

AB  - The effects of intrathecal morphine encapsulated in l- and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline liposomes on acute nociception in rats. (University of California, San Diego, CA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:423?428. This study evaluated the antinociceptive effects of morphine encapsulated in liposomes of two isomeric phospholipids, l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (l-DPPC) and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (d-DPPC), in comparison with morphine in saline. Sprague-Dawley rats with chronic lumbar intrathecal catheters were tested for their acute nociceptive response using a hindpaw thermal escape test. Their general behavior, motor function, pinna reflex, and corneal reflex were also examined. The duration of antinociception was longer in both liposomal morphine groups than in the free morphine group. The peak antinociceptive effects were observed within 30 min after intrathecal morphine, l-DPPC or d-DPPC morphine injection. The rank order of the area under the effect-time curve for antinociception was l-DPPC morphine> d-DPPC morphine> morphine. The 50% effective dose was: 2.7 ?g (morphine), 4.6 ?g (l-DPPC morphine), and 6.4 ?g (d-DPPC morphine). d-DPPC morphine had fewer side effects for a given antinociceptive AUC than morphine. Conclude that l-DPPC and d-DPPC liposome encapsulation of morphine prolonged the antinociceptive effect on acute thermal stimulation and could decrease side effects compared with morphine alone. Comments by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. One would intuitively expect that encapsulation of a drug would prolong its duration of action and reduce systemic side effects. However, the results of this study taken in the context of studies with the encapsulation of other opioids indicate that the physical/chemical properties of the opioid can have an important influence on the results of encapsulation. For example, the investigators have demonstrated that encapsulation of alfentanyl had only a modest effect on its duration of action, presumably because of the ability of the lipophilic alfentanyl to rapidly defuse through the membranes of the liposomes. One question the study leaves open is whether or not the material used for encapsulation has consistent effects on its own. The investigators previously found that intrathecal delivery of l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline resulted in a steroid-sensitive allodynia. However, in the present study the investigators did not observe this. Thus, there is much to be learned about the science and art of drug encapsulation for therapeutic purposes in humans.
