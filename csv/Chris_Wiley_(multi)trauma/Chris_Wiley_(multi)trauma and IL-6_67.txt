AB  - A deltoid motor response is a satisfactory endpoint for successful block. (Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:356?359. This study investigates the notion that a deltoid twitch may be just as effective as one in the biceps for predicting a successful motor block. Patients (N = 160) scheduled for shoulder surgery were studied prospectively. Interscalene blocks (ISBs) were performed using neurostimulation according to our standard technique. Twitches of the deltoid or biceps or both, whichever appeared first, were accepted and used as the endpoint for needle placement and injection of local anesthetic. Motor block success, i.e., patient inability to lift the arm against gravity, and minutes to motor block onset were recorded. Of the 160 ISBs performed, a biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients. In 54 patients, a deltoid twitch was elicited and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid contraction were elicited simultaneously. The failure rate did not differ widely among the groups; there was 1 failed motor block in the deltoid group and none in the other groups. There was no statistically significant difference in onset times between the 3 muscle twitch groups. Conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as a biceps twitch in determining accurate needle placement for ISB and in predicting successful motor block. Acceptance of a deltoid twitch during ISB eliminates the need for further probing and may translate into better patient acceptance and in a smaller risk of needle-induced nerve damage. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. Interscalene brachial plexus block provides a valuable technique for shoulder surgery. The literature is in agreement with elicitation of paresthesias versus peripheral nerve stimulation. The literature is somewhat unclear regarding deltoid muscle versus biceps twitch as a satisfactory endpoint, prior to injection of local anesthetic. This prospective study involved 160 patients presenting for elective shoulder surgery. A biceps twitch was elicited in 61 patients; 54 had a deltoid twitch, and in 45 patients, both a biceps and deltoid twitch were elicited. There was no statistically different onset time in the 3 groups; however, the failure rate did not differ in the 3 groups either (only 1 patient in the deltoid group had a failed block). The authors conclude that a deltoid twitch is as effective as one in the biceps at ensuring a successful interscalene brachial plexus block and that repositioning is not warranted if either muscle group is elicited. The authors should be applauded for this study because it strongly suggests that essentially any elicitation of deltoid or biceps twitch will result in a highly successful and clinically useful block.

AB  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. (Hospital Morvan, Brest, France) Ophthalmology 2000;107:1507?1511. This randomized, double-blinded study compared the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir in immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. One hundred ten immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus diagnosed within 72 h of skin eruption were treated; 56 were allocated to the valaciclovir group and 54 to the acyclovir group. Patients randomized to the valaciclovir group received 2 500-mg tablets of valaciclovir 3 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo twice daily. Patients in the acyclovir group received 1 800-mg tablet of acyclovir 5 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo 3 times daily for 7 days. Main outcome measures included the frequency, severity, and duration of ocular complications, patient records of zoster-associated pain, and the outcome of skin lesions. Tolerance was also assessed on the incidence and types of adverse effects and changes in laboratory parameters. The analysis was mainly descriptive and performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus were similar in the valaciclovir and acyclovir treatment groups. The main complications were conjunctivitis (54% and 52%, respectively), superficial keratitis (39% and 48%, respectively for punctate keratitis; 11 in each group for dendritic keratitis), stromal keratitis (13% in each group) and uveitis (13% and 17%, respectively). The long-term outcomes of these ocular complications were favorable and similar in both treatment groups. Pain duration, severity, and outcome of skin lesions were similar between groups. Most patients reported prodromal pain. After 1 month, 25% of the patients in the valaciclovir group and 31% in the acyclovir group still reported pain. The percentage of patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia decreased during follow-up. The tolerance to acyclovir and valaciclovir was comparable and considered good. The most frequent adverse events were vomiting and edema of the eyelids or face (3%?5%). Three serious adverse events not linked to the study drugs occurred. Valaciclovir is as effective as acyclovir in preventing ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, including conjunctivitis, superficial and stromal keratitis, and pain. Tolerability of the 2 drugs is similar, but the dosing schedule of valaciclovir is simpler. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study comparing the efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and its ophthalmologic complications and sequelae between valaciclovir and acyclovir. The initial review of the incidence and the associated ophthalmologic complications of untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus is concise and educational for physicians who do not interact with these kind of patients frequently. As pain physicians, it is part of our daily practice to deal with patient compliance to the medication treatment we prescribe. In this sense, this article provides comparison between 2 medications that are very similar in the efficacy profiles as well as their control of complications, but with acyclovir there is question of whether patients might be more compliant to the lower dosing frequency of valaciclovir. Results overall are similar between both drugs, but in terms of complications, although not statistically significant, the percentage is consistently lower with valaciclovir than acyclovir. The fact stated in this article regarding the bioavailability of valaciclovir being similar to that of intravenous acyclovir may account for this. The high incidence of irreversible ophthalmic complications such as anatomical loss of an eye (50%?70%) in untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus makes the question of patient compliance with treatment a crucial one. As physicians, we may not realize that for a patient there might be a significant difference between interrupting their daily life 3 times to take a medication instead of 5 times. In summation, this is a well-designed study with valid conclusions that would impact our practice of medicine.

AB  - Bruno Guignard, Anne Elisabeth Bossard, Carole Coste, et al:Intraoperative remifentanil increases postoperative pain and morphine requirement. (Hôpital Ambroise Paré, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) Anesthesiology 2000;93:409??417. The study tested the hypothesis that intraoperative remifentanil administration results in acute opioid tolerance that is manifested by increased postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Fifty adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to 2 anesthetic regimens: (1) the remifentanil group or (2) the desflurane group. All patients were given a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg morphine 40 min before the end of surgery. Morphine was initially titrated to need by postanesthesia care nurses blinded to group assignment. Subsequently, patients?who were blinded to group assignment?controlled their own morphine administration. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded for 24 postoperative h. The results indicated that the mean remifentanil infusion rate was 0.3 ± 0.2 ?g · kg?1· min?1 in the remifentanil group, which was significantly greater than in the desflurane group. Intraoperative hemodynamic responses were similar in each group. Postoperative pain scores were significantly greater in the remifentanil group. These patients required morphine significantly earlier than those in the desflurane group and needed nearly twice as much morphine in the first 24 postoperative h: 59 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 43?71) versus 32 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 19?59; P<0.01). Conclude that relatively large-dose intraoperative remifentanil increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption. These data suggest that remifentanil causes acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia.

AB  - Valaciclovir: a review of its use in the management of herpes zoster. (Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) Drugs 2000;59:1317?1340. This study compared the effectiveness of valaciclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily for 7 days) and aciclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was found to alleviate zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. A 14-day regimen of valaciclovir showed no significant advantage over the 7-day regimen. A smaller trial in Japanese patients focusing primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster confirmed the similar efficacy of valaciclovir and aciclovir in the 7-day regime. Valaciclovir and aciclovir demonstrated similar efficacy for the control of cutaneous lesions and ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Starting treatment later than 72 h after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of valaciclovir on the duration of zoster-associated pain, suggesting that valaciclovir might be effective when given later than previously thought. However, valaciclovir should ideally be given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. Valaciclovir was well tolerated with nausea and headache as being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of the agent was similar to that seen with aciclovir or famciclovir. Conclude that the efficacy of valaciclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster has been confirmed and extended by follow-up studies in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in Japanese patients, and in the wider primary care setting. Valaciclovir is at least equivalent to, and better in certain parameters than, aciclovir and appears to have similar efficacy to famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a review article on the antiviral drug valaciclovir. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is commonly treated with the antiviral drug aciclovir. However, aciclovir has a low oral bioavailability that limits its efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was developed in order to have a more readily absorbed oral antiviral drug. When valaciclovir was compared to aciclovir in a large study, it was noted that valaciclovir was as effective in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. It was also noted valaciclovir alleviated zoster associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. Also, there was no significant advantage of treating valaciclovir 14 days versus 7 days; therefore, a 7-day regimen is recommended. In a smaller trial from Japan that focused primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster, there was also confirmation of similar efficacy of aciclovir and valaciclovir in a 7-day regimen. The similarity in efficacy was not only for cutaneous lesions but also for ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. In a large controlled trial, they compared valaciclovir and famciclovir. This showed similar efficacy in resolution of acute herpes zoster rashes shortening the duration of postherpetic neuralgia. It was purposed in the article that the therapeutic window for beneficial treatment with valaciclovir and zoster associated pain may be wider that previously though. It is still recommended that valaciclovir be ideally given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. However, starting treatment after 72 hours after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of the valaciclovir on duration of zoster associated pain. Valaciclovir is known to be well tolerated with nausea and headache being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of valaciclovir is similar to aciclovir or famciclovir. The purpose of this review was to present an overview of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in the assessment of pain in herpes zoster in comparison with known agents of aciclovir, famciclovir, and/or placebo. It is concluded that valaciclovir is an efficacious agent in the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. It's at least as efficacious as aciclovir and has similar efficacy to famciclovir. It is well tolerated with a similar side effect profile as aciclovir and famciclovir.

AB  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine: results of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (Center for Headache Management, Springfield, PA) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:782?789. This clinical trial determined the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace productivity loss. Adult migraine sufferers self-injected 6 mg of sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the first 4 h of a minimum of an 8-h work shift. Outcome measures included productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2 h after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work performance, and time to headache relief. A total of 206 patients underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the workplace. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median productivity loss 2 h after injection compared with placebo (25.2 versus 29.9 min, respectively) (P = 0.14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo (36.8 versus 72.6, respectively) (P = 0.001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients experienced shorter return to normal work performance at 2 h and across the work shift. Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients experienced headache relief 1 h after injection compared with placebo-treated patients. Conclude that across an 8-h work shift, sumatriptan was superior to the placebo in reducing productivity loss due to migraine.

AB  - Ethical considerations in the treatment of pain in a hospice environment. (Hospice Rozenheuvel, Rozendaal, The Netherlands) Patient Education and Counseling 2000;41:47?53. This article discussed some specific ethical problems encountered in hospice practice. Patient's autonomy with all its advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Ethical considerations with regard to risk taking and the treatment of pain are discussed. The needs of the patients are central to the discussion. Myths regarding opioids and pain therapy goals are addressed, as are approaches to treating intractable pain and dealing with patients who request assisted death. Acceptance of death may result in an active and creative attitude. Conclude that although scientific evidence of the processes taking place is still lacking, the modern hospice may be seen as a complementary, mainstream institution contributing to the development of whole medicine.

AB  - P.A. Mallinder, J.E. Hall, F.G. Bergin, P. Royle, D.J. Leaper: A comparison of opiate- and epidural-induced alterations in splanchnic blood flow using intraoperative gastric tonometry. (North Tees Hospital, Hardwick, Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, UK) Anaesthesia 2000;55:659?665. This study assessed the ability of tonometry to measure differential effects of opiate and epidural analgesia on splanchnic blood flow. Forty patients for elective colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to receive epidural infusion or intravenous morphine. Gastric mucosal PCO2, pHi, standard pHi, PCO2 gap, and pH gap were measured after induction and on termination of surgery. These parameters were within normal limits at the end in most cases and there was no significant difference between the groups. The complication rate was similar in both groups and was not correlated with low pHi, but was correlated with blood loss. A difference in splanchnic perfusion was not demonstrated between the two groups. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. This study concerns the assessment of splanchnic blood flow measured indirectly and noninvasively in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The tonometer is a modified gastric tube terminating in a silicone balloon, which can be filled intermittently with either air or saline. With this technique, it is possible to measure gastric mucosal CO2 (PgCO2) and intramucosal pH and pH gap using a modified Henderson-Hasellbach equation, thus indirectly providing an estimate of splanchnic blood flow. These parameters were measured after induction and upon termination of surgery in 2 groups of patients randomly allocated to receive either intravenous morphine (10 mg) or epidural bupivacaine to achieve a T5 sensory level of blockade. The authors were unable to demonstrate a difference in splanchnic perfusion as assessed with tonometry between the 2 groups.

AB  - Spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) N Engl J Med 2000;343:618?624. This randomized trial involved patients who had had reflex sympathetic dystrophy for at least 6 months. Thirty-six patients were assigned to receive treatment with spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy, and 18 were assigned to receive physical therapy alone. The spinal cord stimulator was implanted only if test stimulation was successful. The intensity of pain was assessed (on a visual-analogue scale from 0 cm [no pain] to 10 cm [very severe pain]), as well as the global perceived effect (on a scale from 1 [worst ever] to 7 [best ever]), functional status, and the health-related quality of life. The test stimulation of the spinal cord was successful in 24 patients; the other 12 patients did not receive implanted stimulators. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the group assigned to receive spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy had a mean reduction of 2.4 cm in the intensity of pain at 6 months, as compared with an increase of 0.2 cm in the group assigned to receive physical therapy alone (P < 0.001 for comparison between the 2 groups). In addition, the proportion of patients with a score of 6 (?much improved?) for the global perceived effect was much higher in the spinal cord stimulation group than in the control group (39% vs. 6%, P = 0.01). There was no clinically important improvement in functional status. The health-related quality of life improved only in the 24 patients who actually underwent implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Six of the 24 patients had complications that required additional procedures, including removal of the device in 1 patient. Conclude in carefully selected patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy, electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life. Conmment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a well-written article describing a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which is also known as complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I). The results show clearly that in carefully selected patients suffering from this pain syndrome, SCS can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life compared to patients treated only with physical therapy. Functional status did not improve in either group of patients as SCS treats pain, but not the disease itself. The authors note that the improvement in the overall score for health-related quality of life was derived mainly from the alleviation of pain as in the study population, pain was the primary source of distress. This study represents a major reference for pain doctors and neurosurgeons treating CRPS and chronic pain.

AB  - The impact of spinal problems on the health status of patients: have we underestimated the effect? (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire) Spine 2000;25:1509?1514. This prospective study involved 17,774 patients who consulted spine centers and aimed to qualify the effect that spinal diagnoses have on patient's physical functional status (SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score) compared with other common conditions and to qualify the effects of comorbidities on physical functional status in spine patients. The study patients were a mean of 47.5 years of age, 54.7% were female, 52.3% had lumbosacral diagnoses, and 82% has had 3 or more months of pain. The population had a mean PCS score of 30.4 ± 9.95 (SD) compared with 50.0 ± 10.00 for the general United States population. The more comorbidities in a patient, the lower the PCS score (Spearman rank correlation = ?0.27). The 5 comorbid conditions that lowered the PCS the most included congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Conclude the PCS score is greatly affected in patients with spinal problems. The study population's OCS was lower or similar to the PCS for patients with other illnesses reported in the literature. Further, the presence of comorbidity in spine patients adds to the burden of spinal conditions on functional status.

AB  - Endocrine consequences of long-term intrathecal administration of opioids. (University of Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium) J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2000;85:2215?2222. This study involved 73 patients (29 men and 44 women) receiving opioids intrathecally for nonmalignant pain who were enrolled for extensive endocrine investigation. At the time of hormonal determination, the mean duration of opioid treatment was 26.6 ± 16.3 months; the mean daily dose of morphine was 4.8 ± 3.2 mg. The control group consisted of 20 patients (11 men and 9 women) with a comparable pain syndrome, but not treated with opioids. Decreased libido or impotency was present in 23 of 24 men receiving opioids. The serum testosterone level was below 9 nmol/L in 25 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The free androgen index was below normal in 18 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The serum LH level was less than 2 U/L in 20 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). Serum FSH was comparable in both groups. Decreased libido was present in 22 of 32 women receiving opioids. All 21 premenopausal females developed either amenorrhea or an irregular menstrual cycle, with ovulation in only 1. Serum LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were lower in the opioid group. In all 18 postmenopausal females significantly decreased serum LH (P < 0.001) and FSH (P = 0.012) levels were found. The 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion was below 20 ?g/day in 14 of 71 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.003). The peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was below 180 ?g/L in 9 of 61 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the nonopioid group (P = 0.002). The insulin-like growth factor I sd score was below ?2 sd in 12 of 73 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.002). The peak GH response to hypoglycemia was below 3 ?g/L in 9 of 62 subjects and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.010). Thyroid function tests and PRL levels were considered normal. No metabolic disturbances were recorded, apart from significantly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.041) and elevated total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P = 0.008) in the opioid group compared to the control group. Supplementation with gonadal steroids improved sexual function in most patients. Conclude of all patients receiving intrathecal opioids, the large majority of men and all women developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, about 15% developed central hypocorticism, and about 15% developed GH deficiency. These findings suggest that further investigations are required to determine the need for systematic endocrine work-up in these patients and the necessity for substitutive therapy.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Detrimental effects of oral infections on general health have been known for almost 3000?years. Modern studies, however, have cast new light on the pathogenic mechanisms by which oral infections appear to link with morbidity and mortality. In particular, among the elderly, poor dental health seems to associate with all-cause mortality. This review aims to provide an overview of present knowledge of these issues, starting from dental bacteraemia, oral mucosal infections and problems of drug resistance and, briefly, discussing what is known about the link between oral health and some systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis and type-2 diabetes. The main conclusions are that scientific evidence is still weak on these interactions and that the elderly should be better taken into account when planning future studies. Functions of the body differ in the frail and diseased from those of the young. Consequently, novel prevention and treatment strategies should be developed and properly tested for combating oral infections in elderly populations. Specific suggestions for further research are outlined.

AB  - Lateral cervical epidural catheter placement for continuous unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:313?317. This article discussed the use of a laterally directed cervical epidural catheter for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. The technique was used in a series of 30 patients to produce unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. A case report of a patient treated with this technique and a description of the technique as well as the results from the series are presented. The method included placement of an epidural catheter at the C6-7 vertebral interspace; the needle bevel and catheter were directed to the affected side in a woman with a history of complex regional pain syndrome of the right upper extremity. A unilateral block was shown with the technique by anatomic parameters (unilateral contrast dye spread), physiologic parameters (unilateral Horner's syndrome), and symptomatic parameters (unilateral, subjective neural block). One patient treated with the technique had bilateral effects; however, no patient had a predominant block on the contralateral side and no complications developed. The case report showed results that were typical of the series of 30 patients. Conclude that the laterally directed cervical epidural catheter was an effective technique to produce continuous unilateral analgesia and sympathetic block.

AB  - The effects of intrathecal morphine encapsulated in l- and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline liposomes on acute nociception in rats. (University of California, San Diego, CA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:423?428. This study evaluated the antinociceptive effects of morphine encapsulated in liposomes of two isomeric phospholipids, l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (l-DPPC) and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (d-DPPC), in comparison with morphine in saline. Sprague-Dawley rats with chronic lumbar intrathecal catheters were tested for their acute nociceptive response using a hindpaw thermal escape test. Their general behavior, motor function, pinna reflex, and corneal reflex were also examined. The duration of antinociception was longer in both liposomal morphine groups than in the free morphine group. The peak antinociceptive effects were observed within 30 min after intrathecal morphine, l-DPPC or d-DPPC morphine injection. The rank order of the area under the effect-time curve for antinociception was l-DPPC morphine> d-DPPC morphine> morphine. The 50% effective dose was: 2.7 ?g (morphine), 4.6 ?g (l-DPPC morphine), and 6.4 ?g (d-DPPC morphine). d-DPPC morphine had fewer side effects for a given antinociceptive AUC than morphine. Conclude that l-DPPC and d-DPPC liposome encapsulation of morphine prolonged the antinociceptive effect on acute thermal stimulation and could decrease side effects compared with morphine alone. Comments by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. One would intuitively expect that encapsulation of a drug would prolong its duration of action and reduce systemic side effects. However, the results of this study taken in the context of studies with the encapsulation of other opioids indicate that the physical/chemical properties of the opioid can have an important influence on the results of encapsulation. For example, the investigators have demonstrated that encapsulation of alfentanyl had only a modest effect on its duration of action, presumably because of the ability of the lipophilic alfentanyl to rapidly defuse through the membranes of the liposomes. One question the study leaves open is whether or not the material used for encapsulation has consistent effects on its own. The investigators previously found that intrathecal delivery of l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline resulted in a steroid-sensitive allodynia. However, in the present study the investigators did not observe this. Thus, there is much to be learned about the science and art of drug encapsulation for therapeutic purposes in humans.

AB  - D. Sheffield, P.L. Biles, H. Orom, W. Maixner, D.S. Sheps: Race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC) Psychosomatic Medicine 2000;62:517?523. The purpose of this study was to determine race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. Pain perception was measured using a suprathreshold evaluation of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli in 27 whites (14 men and 13 women) and 24 African-Americans (12 men and 12 women). Blood pressure, depressive symptoms, anxiety state levels, and negative mood were assessed before pain testing to examine whether they might account for any sex or race differences in pain perception that emerged. African-Americans rated the stimuli as more unpleasant and showed a tendency to rate it as more intense than whites. Women showed a tendency to rate the stimuli as more unpleasant and more intense than men. In addition, systolic blood pressure was inversely related to pain intensity. After statistically adjusting for systolic blood pressure, sex differences in pain unpleasantness were reduced and sex differences in pain intensity were abolished; race differences were unaltered. These differences in pain perception may be associated with different pain mechanisms: in the case of sex, differences in opioid activity and baroreceptor-regulated pain systems; in the case of race, unmeasured psychological characteristics are suggested by the larger differences in ratings of pain unpleasantness than pain intensity. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study where the authors look to elucidate whether there was a difference in cutaneous pain perception determined by race or sex. In general, it is a very well-designed study where 2 different groups were evaluated, 1 of 27 whites and 1 of 24 African-Americans with close to half and half distribution of men and women. Pain perception was measured using pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli. Five different temperatures were used on each subject ranging from 45°C to 49°C. The pain scoring was carried upon a scale from 0 to 150 represented as a line where the evaluated subject had to mark the line at a certain height according to their pain perception. The conclusions reached in the study show that, in general, whites rated the thermal stimuli less painful than African-Americans. The results show a tendency for men to rate the thermal stimuli as less painful than women did. One of the interesting findings in this study was that the pain differences between men and women were diminished after statically adjusting for systolic blood pressure level. However, the pain intensity and the pain differences after adjusting for systolic blood pressure were unaltered for race differences. In addition, it was also found that pain perception and pain rating was inversely proportional to systolic blood pressure. The hypoalgesia caused by increased systolic blood pressure is a poorly understood mechanism. Several studies have shown that in hypertensive rats there is increased opioid activity in brain tissue. These studies have suggested that at the increase of the pain threshold in subjects who have elevated blood pressure may be related to opioid activity. It is important to mention that in order to establish a definite correlation between systolic blood pressure elevation and the decreased pain perception more studies have to be done. Another important point in this study is the influence of psychological factors on pain perception. In general, it was seen that individuals that were psychologically rated as depressive had a higher rating of the pain compared to individuals that tested as high for anxiety.

AB  - Regional pain syndrome: a distinct clinical entity associated with HLA-DR13. (Leiden University Medical center. Leiden, The Netherlands) Ann Neurol 2000;48:113?116. This report discussed 26 patients with a distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome that progressed toward a multifocal or generalized tonic dystonia. The dystonia initiated distally, involved mainly flexor muscles, and was associated with sensory and autonomic symptoms. Dryness of the eyes or mouth and bladder and bowel disturbances were frequently reported. There was no increase in the familial prevalence of autoimmune-mediated disease. Compared with controls, a significant elevation of HLA-DR13 was found in the patients. Thus, HLA-DR13 may be a factor indicating susceptibility to this distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathic pain: from mechanisms to symptoms. (Christian-Albrechts-Univerität Kiel, Kiel, Germany) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S12?20. This review concentrates on the several independent pathophysiological mechanisms in both the peripheral and central nervous system that are responsible for sensory symptoms as well as spontaneous and evoked pains in peripheral neuropathies. These mechanisms can operate in concert in a single disease entity and also in a single patient. Distinct pathophysiological mechanisms lead to specific sensory symptoms, for example, dynamic mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. It is also possible that the pain-generating mechanism and the symptoms change during the course of the disease. A thorough analysis of sensory symptoms may reveal the underlying mechanisms that are mainly active in a particular patient. The treatment of neuropathic pain is currently unsatisfactory. In the future, drugs will be developed that address specifically the relevant combination of mechanisms. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This is an excellent article, which will be a landmark in the approach to the treatment of neuropathic pain. There are several pathophysiological mechanisms, which can cause sensitive symptoms and spontaneous or evoked pain. Mechanical or thermal hyperalgesia is caused by peripheral sensitization. Pinprick hyperalgesia is correlated to the ?wind-up? phenomenon. Allodynia has multiple triggering factors: central sensitization, central reorganization and loss of inhibitory control. Paresthesia is explained by ectopic discharges due to the accumulation of Na+ channels, as with stabbing or paroxysmal pain. A hot or burning pain can be explained by peripheral sensitization and loss of inhibitory mechanisms. This explains why not all painful syndromes respond with the same efficacy to a given treatment. Neuropathic pain can occur in very different forms. For instance, a diabetic neuropathy can be associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia, or with burning and paroxysmal pain. A different treatment is required for each of these symptoms. From now on, we must use a different criterion to label painful neuropathic syndromes. Keeping to the above example, we shall distinguish between diabetic neuropathy with allodynia and diabetic neuropathy with burning pain.

Advice on the development of a palliative care plan and on working with parents and children is also provided. Barriers to the provision of effective pediatric palliative care and potential solutions are identified. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the development and broad availability of pediatric palliative care services based on child-specific guidelines and standards. Such services will require widely distributed and effective palliative care education of pediatric health care professionals. The Academy offers guidance on responding to requests for hastening death, but does not support the practice of physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia of children.

AB  - Intertester reliability of the McKenzie evaluation in assessing patients with mechanical low back pain. (Sunny Brook 30:368?389. In this study, patients were assessed simultaneously by 2 physical therapists trained in the McKenzie evaluation system. The therapists were randomly assigned as examiner and observer. Agreement was estimated by Kappa statistics. Forty-five subjects (47 ± 14 years), composed of 25 women and 20 men with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain were examined. The agreement between raters for selection of the McKenzie syndromes was K = 0.70, and for the derangement subsyndromes was K = 0.96. Interrater agreement for the presence of lateral shift, relevance of lateral shift, relevance of lateral component, and deformity in the sagittal plane was K = 0.52, 0.85, 0.95, and 1.00, respectively. Intertester agreement on syndrome categories in 17 patients under 55 years of age was excellent with K = 1.00. Conclude that a form of low back evaluation, using patterns of pain response to repeated end range spinal test movements, was highly reliable when performed by 2 properly trained physical therapists. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This article intends to address the ability for therapists to agree on a low back pain diagnosis using the McKenzie technique of classification. It is important for this study to select a clear clinical diagnosis in order to establish rationale for patient management and determine a prognosis. Another purpose for this study was to agree on the relevance of sagittal and frontal plane deformities using McKenzie methods in assessing patients with back pain. The subjects included adult patients with a history of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain. Patients were referred by general practitioners or specialists for treatment at an outpatient department where the study was conducted. The examination consisted of taking a history, observational evaluation of the range of motion, and completion of a specified tests movements in the sagittal, frontal, and combined planes. Subjects were allowed to communicate only with the assessor. A total of 46 patients with a history of low back pain agreed to complete the assessment. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those 55 years of age and older and those younger than 55. McKenzie identifies only 3 mechanical syndromes: 1. Postural, 2. Dysfunction, 3. Derangement. Each of these syndromes were divided into separate subsyndromes according to location of the pain and presence or absence of spinal deformities. The study concluded that therapists trained in use of the McKenzie evaluation system can be highly reliable in reaching the same conclusion in respect to classifying patients into diagnostic syndromes and subsyndromes, especially in patients under the age of 55. In contrast to other published studies, the importance of advanced training for interpretation of symptom behavior definitely leads to selection of the correct diagnosis.
