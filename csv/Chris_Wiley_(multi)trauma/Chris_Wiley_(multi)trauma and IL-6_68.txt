AB  - Can discography cause long-term back symptoms in previously asymptomatic subjects? (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) Spine 2000;25:1803?1808. This prospective controlled study aimed to determine whether discography might cause long-term low back symptoms in selected patients. Twenty-six patients without preexisting low back pain were observed for 1 year after lumbar discography to determine the effects of lumbar discography in 3 experimental groups: 10 patients who had remote cervical spine surgery with excellent results (pain-free group); 10 patients who had the same surgery with poor results (chronic pain group); and 6 patients who had primary somatization disorders. Two control groups were also observed: a group of patients with somatization disorder who were similarly evaluated but without discography and a group of patients with low back pain observed for 1 year after discography without surgery. In the 3 experimental groups (no back pain before discography) no subject with normal psychometric testing had persistent pain after discography (0/11), whereas 6 (40%) of the 15 with abnormal psychometric tests results reported significant new low back pain. None of the pain-free group (0/10), 20% of the chronic neck pain group (2/10), and 66% of the somatization group (4/6) continued to have significant back pain 1 year after injection. Psychological testing and occupational disability strongly predicted continued pain after discography. The control groups had no significant change in low back symptomatology during the year of observation. Conclude that discography in a subject group without low back pain, but with significant emotional and chronic pain problems may result in reports of significant back pain for at least 1 year after injection. Subjects with normal psychometric test results had no reports of significant long-term back pain after discography.

AB  - Complications of fluoroscopically guided transformational lumbar epidural injections. (Florida Spine Institute, Clearwater, FL) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:1045?1050. This retrospective cohort design study assessed the incidence of complications of fluoroscopically guided lumbar transformational epidural injections at a multidisciplinary spine care center. Patients presenting with radiculopathy caused by either lumbar spinal stenosis or herniated nucleus pulposus confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scanning received transformational epidural steroid injections as part of a conservative care treatment plan. All injections were performed consecutively over a 4-month period by 5 physiatrists. An independent observer reviewed medical charts, which included a 24-h postprocedure telephone call by an ambulatory surgery center nurse who had asked questions from a standardized questionnaire about complications following the injections. Physician follow-up office notes 1 to 3 weeks after the injection, along with epiduragrams, were also reviewed. Two hundred seven patients who received 322 injections were reviewed. Complications per injection seen included 10 transient nonpositional headaches that resolved within 24 h (3.1%), 8 increased back pain (2.4%), 2 increased leg pain (0.6%) 4 facial flushing (1.2%), 1 vasovagal reaction (0.3%), 1 increased blood sugar (258 mg/dL) in an insulin-dependant diabetic (0.3%), and 1 intraoperative hypertension (0.3%). No dural punctures occurred. Conclude there were no major complications. The incidence of minor complication was 9.5% per injection. All reactions resolved without morbidity, and no patient required hospitalization.

AB  - Comparison of the University of California (Los Angeles) shoulder scale and the simple shulder test with shoulder pain and disability index: Single-administration reliability and validity. (Texas Woman's University, Houston, TX) Phys Ther. 2000;80:759?768. This study compared 2 shoulder measures?the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale and the Simple Shoulder Test (SST)?with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). One hundred ninety-two patients with shoulder disorders were recruited from one physician's office to complete the self-report sections of the 3 scales. Cronbach alpha values and standard errors of measurements (SEM) were calculated for each of the multi-item subscales. Validity was examined through calculation of correlation coefficients among the 3 scales. Factor analysis was completed to assess the underlying constructs of the SPADI and SST. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. The SEM values for the multi-item scales ranged from 4.75 to 11.65. Evidence for validity to reflect function was indicated by the correlation between the SST and the SPADI disability subscale. The factor analysis of the SPADI revealed loading on 1 factor, whereas the SST loaded on 2 factors. Conclude that all scales demonstrated good internal consistency, suggesting that all items for each scale measure the same constract. However, SEMS for all scales were high. Factor loading was consistent, suggesting that patients may not distinguish between pain and function. Comment by Philip S. Sizer Jr., MED, PT. Clinical practitioners are leaning toward evaluating functional status versus a pure-impairment-based approach to appraising shoulder limitations. Several scales have been developed for the evaluation of shoulder function, including the University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Scale (UCLA), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Investigations demonstrating the psychometric properties of these scales are limited in number. These investigators attempted to assess those properties, including internal consistency, reliability, and validity for all 3 scales. The analyses demonstrated internal consistency and construct homogeneity for the SPADI. However, all 3 scales demonstrated rather large standard errors of measure, which questions the reliability of the scales for measurement of an individual's progress. Regarding construct validity, the SPADI does not appear to distinguish between pain and dysfunction, disqualifying its use as a gold standard for comparison with other scales. While the SST purports to measure a single construct, the data suggests that it appears to measure 2 different constructs namely function and comfort. Additionally, the analyses appear to demonstrate that, while the scales may attempt to measure the same constructs, they apparently do not. Finally, the authors suggest that the precision of the UCLA scale is inferior to the other 2 scales and insufficient for following the progress of individual patients in the clinical setting.

AB  - Involvement of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 but not IL-8 in the development of heat hyperalgesia: effects on heat-evoked calcitonin gene-related peptide release from rat. (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany) J Neurosci 2000;20:6289?6293. In this study, the rat skin model was used to investigate the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on the basal and heat-evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CCRP) from nociceptors in vivo. In contrast to the excitatory effects of cytokines observed in vivo, none of the cytokines tested evoked any CCRP release at normal skin temperature of 32°C. However, the cytokines IL-1?, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 but not IL-8 induced a pronounced and transient sensitization of the heat-evoked CGRP release from nociceptors in vitro. This heat sensitization was dose dependent, with EC50 for IL-1? of 2.7 ng/mL and for TNF-α of 3.1 ng/mL. The maximum IL-1? effect reached almost 600% of the heat-evoked release, and the maximum TNF-α effect induced a rise in CGRP release of 350%. In contrast to IL-1? and TNF-α, IL-6 did not induce heat sensitization when applied alone, but was only effective in the presence of soluble IL-6 receptor. This suggests a constitutive expression of signaling receptors for TNF and IL-1? and the signal transduction molecule gp 130, but not IL-6 receptor or IL-8 receptor. Furthermore, the acute cytokine signaling observed was independent of transcriptional pathways because sensitization occurred on short latency in vitro and under conditions that excluded chemotactic accumulation of immune cells from blood vessels. Conclude that interleukins may play an important role in the initiation of heat hyperalgesia in inflammation and neuropathy. Comment by Marshall Devor, PhD. Impulses in nociceptive afferents signal pain to a conscious brain, but in addition, they have an efferent, effector role in peripheral tissue. Specifically, impulses arriving at a sensory ending may cause the release of various peptides and other potential inflammatory mediators, affecting local tissue circulation and the trophic state of the tissue. Oprée and Kress show that specific cytokines can facilitate this release by lowering the temperature required to evoke release of the calcitonin gene-related peptide. If the temperature required were lowered to basal tissue temperature, a real possibility, then the peptides would be released on a tonic basis at normal body temperature. This could be a mechanism for the disruption of normal tissue integrity in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - Pain relief in complex regional pain syndrome due to spinal cord stimulation does not depend on vasodilation. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) Anesthesiology 2000;92:1653?1660. This study aimed to assess whether pain relief in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS after spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is, in fact, dependent on vasodilation. In addition, the study attempted to determine which of the potential mechanisms may cause the vasodilatory effect that is generally found after SCS. Twenty-four of 36 patients with unilateral CRPS responded to the test of SCS. Twenty-two of the 24 responders (hand, n = 14; foot, n = 8) who had undergone previous sympathectomy were enrolled in the study. In addition, 20 control subjects (10 controls for each extremity) were studied. By means of laser Doppler flowmetry, the skin microcirculation of the patients was measured bilaterally while the SCS system was switched off and while it was activated. Control subjects were tested only once. The ratio of the rest flow at heart level and the dependent position was defined as the vasoconstricted index. Both in affected hands and feet, patients were found to have lower vasoconstriction indices (P < 0.01) as compared with controls, indicating a decreased sympathetic tone. Applying SCS did not result in any microcirculatory change as compared with the baseline or the contralateral clinically unaffected side. Conclude that the study failed to show that SCS influences skin microcirculation in patients with CRPS and a low sympathetic tone. Therefore, it was also concluded that pain relief in CRPS due to SCS is possible without vasodilation. Because sympathetic activity was greatly decreased in the patients, these results support the hypothesis that the vasodilation that is normally found with SCS is due to an inhibitory effect on sympathetically maintained vasoconstriction. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. SCS probably provides pain relief independent of increases in blood flow to the affected area. There may be several weaknesses in this study. All patients underwent prior sympathectomy. As every pain management specialist knows, the results of these procedures are variable. That leaves a group of pain patients with CRPS I that is either predominantly sympathetically mediated or sympathetically independent, with variable degrees of sympathetic blockade. In addition, only part of the peripheral circulation is measured with a device which accuracy has not yet been confirmed. Many variables are introduced in this study making a statement that there are no differences between the treatment group and the control somewhat strong. In my opinion: pain relief in complex regional pain syndrome due to spinal cord stimulation may not depend on vasodilatation.

AB  - Phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees: an epidemiological study. (University Hospital Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands) Pain 2000;87:33?41. This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees in The Netherlands. Additionally, the relationship between phantom pain, phantom sensations, and prosthesis use in upper limb amputees was investigated. One hundred twenty-four upper limb amputees participated in the study. Subjects were asked to fill out a self-developed questionnaire scoring the following items: date, side, level, and reason of amputation, duration of experienced pain before amputation, frequencies with which phantom sensations, phantom pain, and stump pain are experienced, amount of trouble and suffering experienced, respectively, related to these sensations, type of phantom sensations, medical treatment received for phantom pain and/or stump pain, and the effects of the treatment, self medication, and prosthesis use. The response rate was 80%. The prevalence of phantom pain was 51%, of phantom sensations 76%, and of stump pain 49%; 48% of the subjects experienced phantom pain a few times per day or more. Moderate to severe suffering from phantom pain was experienced by 64% of the respondents. A significant association was found between phantom pain and phantom sensations (relative risk 11.3) and between phantom pain and stump pain (relative risk 1.9). No other factors associated with phantom pain or phantom sensations could be determined. Only 4 patients received medical treatment for their phantom pain. Phantom pain is a common problem in upper limb amputees that causes considerable suffering for the subjects involved. Only a small number of subjects are treated for phantom pain. Conclude that further research is needed to determine factors associated with phantom pain.

AB  - Use of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for the documentation of synergy between tramadol and metamizol. (Hospital Universitario del Mar, Barcelona, Spain) Br J Anaesth 2000;85:217?223. This study involved 101 posthysterectomy patients who received at the time of analgesia request (TAR) tramadol (100 mg, Group I) or metamizol (1.2 g, Group II) alone, or combined in 1:1 (Group III), 1:0.3 (Group IV), or 1:3 (Group V) ratio. After 15 min, they received the same treatment by IV patient-controlled analgesia. Pain intensity (VAS-PI), analgesic consumption, and adverse effects were assessed at TAR, and periodically for 24 h. Data were analyzed using interaction indexes and isobolograms. All treatments produced equivalent VAS-PI, percent efficacy, and adverse effects; all other treatments were addictive. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. Synergistic interactions either beneficial or adverse between analgesic drugs remains to be studied quantitatively. The authors propose a new method to quantitate such interactions; this is based on analgesic requirements (IV-PCA) and pain intensity (VAS-PI). Data were analyzed using interaction indexes and isobolograms. Isobols are graphic representations of equally effective doses of 2 or more agents. The mean doses of each drug that produces a given response are plotted on the axes of the graph. A zero interaction line (isobol) connects these isoeffective doses in the axis. Using this approach the authors studied 101 posthysterectomy patients. Patients received at the time of analgesia request (TAR) tramadol (100 mg, Group I) or metamizol (1.2 g, Group II), alone or combined 1:1 (Group III), 1:0.3 (Group IV) or 1:3 (Group V). All treatments produced equivalent VAS-PI, percent efficacy, and adverse effects. Drugs combined in 1:1 ratio synergy became evident both for the analgesic and adverse effects; all other treatments were additive.

This study describes the treatment of a 49-year-old woman who received a kidney transplant from a cadaver donor and was treated with tacrolimus. Three months later, the patient complained of severe pain in her lower limbs that affected both knees and ankles. Bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance were consistent with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. Laboratory tests that included creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, calcium, phosphate, urate, alkaline phosphatase, and parathormone were normal or near normal. Tacrolimus levels were around 13 ?g/mL. Clinical improvement appeared slowly and spontaneously during the following 3 months, without appreciable changes in the tacrolimus level. Conclude that in kidney transplant patients, tacrolimus could be a risk factor for the development of a reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.

AB  - Neurovascular decompression for idiopathic tarsal tunnel syndrome: technical note. (Fuji Brain Institute and Hospital, Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2000;69:87?90. This study evaluates the efficacy of neurovascular decompression for patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS). Twelve feet from 9 patients with idiopathic TTS were treated. The patients were aged 52?78 years (mean 64.6 years), and all of them complained of pain or dysaesthesia of the sole of the foot. The posterior tibial nerve was freed from the attached arteriovenous complex (posterior tibial artery and veins). The dissected nerve had a flattened appearance in all of the patients, suggesting nerve compression by the adjacent arteriovenous complex and superficially by the flexor retinaculum. A graft of fat was inserted as both a cushion and an antiadhesive between the vessels and the nerve to achieve neurovascular decompression. Patients on whom neurovascular decompression was performed had resolution or lessening of symptoms in their feet. Neither wound infection nor recurrence of symptoms was found during the follow-up period (mean 26.8 months). Conclude neurovascular compression syndrome plays a part in idiopathic TTS, and adding neurovascular decompression to resection of the flexor retinaculum is effective. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. The surgical outcome of idiopathic tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) has been reported less than ideal and worse than that attributable to tarsal coalition tumor or ganglion. The authors considered necessary the development of a new technique in the surgical treatment of this syndrome assuming that neurovascular compression plays a part in idiopathic TTS. They treated 12 feet from 9 patients on whom neurovascular depression with a graft of fat adding resection to the flexor retinaculum was effective for the resolution or lessening of pain and paresthesia in all cases during a mean follow-up period of 26.8 months without complications.

AB  - Pain experience of children with headache and their families: a controlled study. (University of Turku, Turku, Finland) Pediatrics 2000;106:270?275. This study reported the pain sensitivity of children with headache and their family members as well as the prevalence of recurring aches, psychosocial life, and family environment of children with headache at preschool age. A representative population-based sample of 1443 families expecting their first child was followed over 7 years. A screening questionnaire relating to the child's headache was sent to parents of a representative sample of 1132 6-year-old children. Of 144 children suffering from headache, 106 (76%) were examined and interviewed clinically. Ninety-six children (58 migraine and 38 tension-type headache children) with primary headache and matched controls were included in further examinations. Children with headache were more often extremely sensitive to pain according to their parents, were more excited about physical examinations, cried more often during blood sampling or vaccination, avoided play or games more often because they were afraid of hurting themselves, and had recurring abdominal and growing pains more often than did control children. The fathers of children with headache were more often extremely sensitive to pain. Children with headache reacted with somatic symptoms, usually with pain and functional intestinal disorders in stress situations, felt more tired, and had more ideations of death during the previous month. More mothers of tension-type headache children than those of migraine children reported that they were considerably sensitive to pain. Tension-type headache children had a poorer family environment; the family atmosphere was more often unhappy and the relationship between parents was more often distant than in families of children with migraines. Conclude that in addition to somatic factors, it is important to consider the child's pain sensitivity, reaction to various stress situations, and family functioning when studying childhood headache. The child's coping mechanisms can be supported by information given by the parents. School entry can be considered a suitable period for careful investigation into possible occurrence of headache and also for giving information about headache and its management

AB  - The effects of the single or multiple injection technique on the onset time of femoral nerve blocks with 0.75% ropivacaine. (University of Milan and IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy) Anesth Analg 2000;91:181?184. This study evaluated the effect of the injection technique on the onset time and efficacy of femoral nerve block performed with 0.75% ropivacaine. A total of 30 patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery were randomly allocated to receive femoral nerve blocakade with 0.75% ropivacaine by using either a single injection (Single group, n = 15) or multiple injection (Multiple group, n = 15). Nerve blocks were placed by using a short-beveled, Teflon-coated, stimulating needle. The stimulation frequency was set at 2 Hz, and the intensity of the stimulating current, initially set at 1 mA, was gradually decreased to <0.5 mA after each muscular twitch was observed. In the Single group, 12 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine was slowly injected, as soon as the first muscular twitch was observed. In the Multiple group, the stimulating needle was inserted and redirected, eliciting each of the following muscular twitches: contraction of vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis. At each muscular twitch, 4 mL of the study solution was injected. Placing the block required 4.2 ± 1.7 min in the Multiple group and 3.4 ± 2.2 min in the Single group (P = 0.02). Onset of nerve block required 10 ± 3.7 min in the Multiple group and 30 ± 11 min in the Single group (P < 0.0005). Propofol sedation was never required to complete surgery; although 0.1 mg fentanyl at trocar insertion was required in 2 patients of the Multiple group (13%) and 9 patients of the Single group (60%) (P = 0.02). Conclude that searching for multiple muscular twitches shortened the onset time and improved the quality of femoral nerve block performed with small volumes of 0.75% ropivacaine. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. This study is concerned with the onset of femoral nerve block utilizing 0.75% ropivacaine in 2 groups of 15 patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. The optimal site for injection was identified by the electrically evoked muscular twitch at the quadriceps. In 1 group, 12 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine was injected as soon as a muscle twitch was evoked. In the second group, 4 mL of local anesthetic was injected only after a specific response was elicited at the vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus laterallis. Onset of the nerve block required 10 ± 3.7 min. in the multiple injection group, whereas in the single group, onset of the nerve block took 30 ± 11 min. The authors concluded that searching for multiple twitches shortened the surgical anesthesia and improved the quality of neural blockade.

AB  - Nonsurgical treatment for radicular pain of zygoapophyseal joint cyst origin: therapeutic selective nerve root block. (Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81;1119?1122. This report discusses the first case of zygoapophyseal joint cyst-induced radicular pain successfully treated with therapeutic selective nerve root block. A 56-year-old dentist presented with pain involving the lateral thigh, lateral calf, and foot dorsum that worsened with standing and walking. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine showed a cyst emanating from the right L4-L5 zygoapophyseal joint, resulting in central canal and lateral recess stenosis. The patient was treated with 2 fluoroscopically guided therapeutic L5 selective nerve root blocks. The patient remained pain free at 18-month follow-up.

AB  - Shoulder pain as an unusual presentation of pneumonia in a stroke patient: a case report. (University of Chicago Hospitals, Chicago, IL) Arch Med Phys Rehabil 2000;81:827?829. An 89-year-old woman with right hemiparesis secondary to ischemic lacunar infarction who developed sudden onset of right shoulder pain on the fifth day of inpatient rehabilitation is discussed in this case study. The pain was severe, limiting range of motion (ROM) and participation in therapy. Extensive investigations to rule out subluxation, fracture, connective tissue disease, RSD, and pulmonary embolism were negative. Ultimately, her shoulder pain and decreased ROM completely resolved with antibiotic treatment for right lower lobe pneumonia. Conclude that her symptoms were possibly referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation transmitted via right C4 sensory axons in the phrenic nerve, which shares the same dermatome as the right acromion area. This case was an unusual presentation of pneumonia in an elderly woman with hemiplegia. The authors recommend that pneumonia be considered in differential diagnoses of shoulder pain.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces adrenalitis in BALB/c mice but does not compromise adrenal function, assessed by levels of circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the response to challenge with synthetic ACTH. Levels of corticosterone increased 2 days after infection in mice of this strain, consistent with previously established interactions between mediators of acute inflammation and activation of the hypothalmus?pituitary?adrenal axis. Moreover, an adrenocortical response was critical to survival of BALB/c (but not C57BL/6) mice 3 days after infection, as pharmacologically or surgically adrenalectomized BALB/c mice died when given doses of virus up to fivefold lower than they could normally tolerate. However, death could not be prevented by the administration of soluble cytokine receptors to inhibit the action of interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The corticosteroid response did not mediate MCMV-induced thymic atrophy. As the above traits were all less evident in C57BL/6 mice, a common genetic basis is discussed.

AB  - Computed tomography?guided pudendal nerve block. A new diagnostic approach to long-term anoperineal pain: a report of two cases. (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:420?423. This report showed the value of computed tomography (CT) in selectively blocking the pudendal nerve in patients with long-term anogenital pain of uncertain etiology. In 1 patient, a competitive cyclist, blocking the nerve under CT substantiated the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia. The procedure relieved the pain for approximately 24 h. In the other patient, pudendal nerve block produced perineal analgesia, but no pain relief. Superior hypogastric plexus block relieved the pain significantly for about 4 weeks on 2 separate occasions, suggesting sympathetically maintained pain. Conclude that the use of CT to guide the procedure allowed precision in performing the procedure and in making a differential diagnosis.
