AB  - Gabapentin enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in healthy volunteers. (Dr. Margarete Fischer Bosch Institut fuer Klinische Pharmakologie, Stuttgart, Germany) Anesth Analg 2000;91:185?191. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study investigated the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction of Gabapentin (GBP) and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Morphine (60 mg, controlled release) or placebo was administered at 8:00 a.m., and GBP (600 mg) or placebo was administered at 10:00 a.m., thus comparing the analgesic effect of placebo + GBP (600 mg) with placebo + placebo and morphine (60 mg) + GBP in comparison to morphine plus placebo by using the cold pressor test. The duration and intensity of the side effects were assessed by using visual analog scales. The analgesic effect was evaluated by the change in the area under the curve of pain tolerance. Placebo + GBP did not present any significant analgesic effect compared with placebo + placebo. A siginificant increase in pain tolerance was observed comparing the combination of morphine and GBP with morphine and placebo. The observed adverse events after placebo + GBP were not significantly different compared with placebo + placebo. Morphine + placebo led to the expected opioid-mediated side effects. They were significantly more pronounced compared with placebo + placebo, but did not differ significantly compared with the combination of morphine + GBP. Concerning the pharmacokinetic variables of morphine and its glucuronides, no significant difference between morphine + placebo and morphine + GBP was observed, whereas the area under the curve of GBP significantly increased, and apparent oral clearance and apparent renal clearance of GBP decreased when morphine was administered concomitantly. These results suggest 2 different sites for the pharmacokinetic interaction?1 at the level of absoption and the other at the level of elimination. The study reveals both a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between morphine and GBP, leading to an increased analgesic effect of morphine + GBP. These results and the good tolerability of GBP should favor clinical trials investigating the clinical relevance of the combination of morphine and GBP for treating severe pain.

AB  - Pure trigeminal motor neuropathy: a case report. (Korea University Medical Center, Guro-gu, Korea) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:995?998. A 38-year-old man complaining of progressive weakness and wasting of the right masticatory muscles after a bout of mild cold symptoms is presented in this case report. No sensory symptoms were present. History, neurologic examination, electrophysiologic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain led to the diagnosis of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The cause may have been an autoimmune reaction to a viral infection. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article is a case report of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. Trigeminal motor neuropathy is defined as a trigeminal motor paralysis accompanied by no trigeminal sensory signs or other cranial nerve involvement. The author described the history of the patient and their work up including examination, laboratory tests, and electro diagnostic examinations, which all pointed to the pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The strength of this case report is the detailed description of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve and the muscular innervations of the mandubular branch. The authors attributed the motor neuropathy to a possible post viral infection autoimmune response that predominantly affected the motor division of the trigeminal nerve. They have stressed that all other potential causes of motor neuropathy should be ruled out including malignancy in mass lesions.

AB  - Glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in hemiplegic patients. (Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1999; 81:944?946. This is a case-controlled study of the relationship between glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) in hemiplegic patients set in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Thirty-five hemiplegic patients with RSD (RSD group) and 35 hemiplegic patients without RSD (non-RSD group) were included in this study. Patients with rotator cuff rupture, brachial plexus injury, or spasticity greater than stage 2 on the Ashworth scale were excluded. Both the RSD and non-RSD groups were assessed for presence and grade of subluxation from radiographs using a 5-point categorization. The degree of shoulder pain of the non-RSD group was assessed by a visual analogue scale of 10 points. Glenohumeral subluxation was found in 74.3% of the RSD group and 40% of the non-RSD group (P = 0.004). In the non-RSD group, 78.6% of the patients with subluxation and 38.1% of the patients without subluxation reported shoulder pain (P = 0.019). No correlation was found between the degree of shoulder pain and grade of subluxation in the non-RSD group (P = 0.152). Conclude that the findings suggest that shoulder subluxation may be a causative factor for RSD. Therefore, prevention and appropriate treatment of glenohumeral joint subluxation should be included in rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. Comment by Miles Day, MD. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shoulder subluxation in hemiplegic patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. They also examined if subluxation is associated with shoulder pain and the grade of subluxation in patients with subluxation and no reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Patients with injuries to the rotator cuff of the brachial plexus, marked spasticity, and major trauma to joint structures were excluded as these can be precipitating factors for RSD. The study noted a significantly higher presence of shoulder subluxation within the RSD group and the presence of pain was significantly high in patients with shoulder subluxation in the non-RSD group. The take home message of this article is that any measure or treatment that can be applied to the glenohumeral joint should be performed to eliminate the possibility of the patient developing RSD and subsequently hindering further rehabilitation in these patients.

AB  - Paraspinal electromyography in high lumbar and thoracic lesions. (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2000;79:336?342. This study aimed to use needle electromyography in the paraspinal muscles to localize the root level of a radiculopathy. Nine cases of clinically proven, isolated high lumbar or thoracic disk herniations of patients who underwent MiniPM were collected. Four were from a prospective study of 114 persons with low back pain (MiniPM had 100% sensitivity to magnetic resonance imaging-documented high disks). In the most medial ?S? column, mean MiniPM scores were 0.7 for the level above the radiologically documented lesion (3.1 at the lesion and 1.6, 1.6, and 1.1 at the 3 spinous processes below the lesion). Similar numbers were obtained in the ?M? column (slightly lateral), with no significant differences between S and M. Differences were significant between and at the level of the lesion for S (P < 0.06) and M (P < 0.01), and between the lesion level and 3 levels below for the M column (P < 0.01). Conclude that paraspinal electromyography has a higher than previously reported sensitivity for high lumbar lesions. Electromyography using MiniPM can localize some radiculopathies. The individual cases suggest that, consistent with the anatomy of the caudi equina, thoracic lesions and lateral lumbar lesions denervate only at 1 level, but more central lumbar lesions also denervate distally innervated paraspinal muscles. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This study is designed to assess the sensitivity of many MiniPM for higher-level rediculopathies, ie, lower thoracic and high lumbar, and to determine if findings are specific to the root level involved. The MiniPM is thought to assess the multifidus portion of the paraspinal muscles that are innervated from L2 to the sacrum. The clinical protocol tests the paraspinal extensively and provides a numerica score, thus eliminating some subjectivity of the EMG. The study demonstrates that MiniPM has good sensitivity for high lumbar and thoracic lesions and provides information on the level of the lesion independent of limb EMG. After reviewing the study, I agree with the authors that MiniPM is in itself not diagnostic for radiculopathy, but is only an additional test to help support other neuro physiological studies when evaluating for radiculopathy. It is not specific for diagnosing radiculopathy.

AB  - Aerobic fitness testing in patients with chronic low back pain?Which is the best test? (New England Medical Center, Boston, MA) Spine 2000;25:1704?1710. In this study, 30 participants with chronic low back pain performed three symptom-limited maximal exercise tests: a treadmill, an upper extremity ergometer, and a bicycle ergometer. The tests were administered in randomized order. Heart rate was continuously monitored and oxygen consumption in terms of mL/kg/minute was measured by indirect calorimetry each 30 seconds. The statistical difference among the tests was highly significant (P < 0.0001). The treadmill test yielded the highest peak and predicted oxygen consumption followed by the bicycle and the upper extremity ergometer test, respectively. Conclude that the treadmill test is the best test for measuring aerobic fitness levels in patients with chronic low back pain. It yielded the highest peak oxygen consumption compared with the other tests, coming closest to measuring maximal oxygen consumption. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. Aerobic conditioning has been a component of several treatment approaches in the reduction of back pain disability. The specific contribution of aerobic fitness achieved through these approaches is not always known. Chronic pain patients tend to be inactive. As a result of this inactivity muscles become inefficient at using oxygen and this results in a loss of muscle endurance and cardiac output. The purpose of this study was, 1) to determine which testing protocol yields the highest peak values of VO2, heart rates, and respiratory changes ratio in a sample of patients with CLBP; 2) to determine whether the VO2 measures between the tests are significantly different from each other; 3) to determine which factors limit performance in each of these tests; and 4) to compare values of peak VO2 and predicted VO2 max with aerobic fitness values published for normal subjects. Chronic low back pain was defined as pain persisting for 3 months or more. Patients were excluded from this study if they were taking medications that influenced heart rate or blood pressure or if they had coexisting major medical disease, amputations of one or more extremities, or acute upper or lower extremity muscular skeletal pain that would interfere with exercise testing or acute psychiatric illness. Thirty participants with chronic low back pain performed 3 symptom limited maximal exercise tests: a treadmill, upper extremity ergometer, and a bicycle ergometer. These tests were randomly administered and heart rate was continuously monitored along with oxygen consumption. Of the 3 tests, the treadmill test is the most functional because of its uses in walking, a function of everyday life. This advantage to bicycle testing is that most Americans are unaccustomed to bicycle riding. Many of the patients reported increased burning in the thigh and buttocks for sitting on a hard saddle. Most clinics have access to a treadmill making this a practical test. The treadmill test is, thus, the best measure of cardiovascular performance; deconditioning of these patients expressed itself as early fatigue of peripheral muscles due to inactively, and limiting their performance on the bicycle and UBE test.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

(Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:420?423. This report showed the value of computed tomography (CT) in selectively blocking the pudendal nerve in patients with long-term anogenital pain of uncertain etiology. In 1 patient, a competitive cyclist, blocking the nerve under CT substantiated the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia. The procedure relieved the pain for approximately 24 h. In the other patient, pudendal nerve block produced perineal analgesia, but no pain relief. Superior hypogastric plexus block relieved the pain significantly for about 4 weeks on 2 separate occasions, suggesting sympathetically maintained pain. Conclude that the use of CT to guide the procedure allowed precision in performing the procedure and in making a differential diagnosis.

(New England Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:380?384. In this study, 12 healthy patients (age, 22 to 46 years) undergoing surgery on the knee were randomly assigned to receive either 2% lidocaine (Group L) or 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 5 ?g · mL?1 (Group E), approximately 20 mL, over 10 min via lumbar epidural catheter. Total-body oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were determined by indirect calorimetry; hemodynamic measurements were obtained by noninvasive thoracic electrical bioimpedance. Values of VO2, VCO2, heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were determined every minute and averaged every 5 min for 30 min. Comparisons were made with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (within groups) and t-tests (between groups). Differences were considered significantly different if P < 0.05. VO2 did not change in either group, while VCO2 increased significantly by 22% at 20 min in Group E. Increases in HR were apparent in both groups, with significantly greater increases in Group E. CI did not change in Group L, but increased by 41% in Group E. MAP decreased significantly by 11% in Group E, but did not change in Group L. Conclude that the addition of epinephrine, 5 ?g · mL?1, to the epidural injection of 2% lidocaine is associated with changes not only in hemodynamics, but also in respiratory gas exchange.

AB  - Norepinephrine release from spinal synaptosomes. (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) Anesthesiology 2000;93:164?172. The purpose of this study was to determine if clonidine could inhibit release of NE in a preparation of spinal cord tissue lacking synaptic circuits. Crude synaptosomes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rat spinal cord, loaded with [3H]NE, and stimulated by potassium chloride to release [3H]NE. Samples were incubated with clonidine in the absence or presence of various inhibitors. To study the effect of α2A-adrenergic receptor subtypes, some animals were pretreated with an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) composed of a sense or antisense sequence to a portion of this receptor. Potassium chloride produced a concentration-dependent increase in [3H]NE release, and this release was inhibited by clonidine with a concentration producing 50% maximal inhibition (IC50) of 1.3 ?m. The effect of clonidine was inhibited by the α2A-adrenergic antagonists, yohimbine, and idazoxan, but not by α1A-adrenergic, muscarinic, or opioid antagonists. Intrathecal pretreatment with antisense ODN to α2A-adrenergic receptors reduced α2A-adrenergic receptor protein expression compared with sense ODN control and also reduced clonidine-induced inhibition of [3H]NE release. Conclude that these data demonstrate the existence of classic autoinhibitory α2A-adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord, probably of the α2A subtype. They further suggest that clonidine-induced stimulation of spinal NE release must occur from indirect actions, presumably due to activation of a spinal circuit.

AB  - Potent analgesic effects of GDNF in neuropathic pain states. (King's College London, London, United Kingdom) Science 2000;290:124?127. Neuropathic pain arises as a debilitating consequence of nerve injury. The etiology of such pain is poorly understood, and existing treatment is largely ineffective. We demonstrate here that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) both prevented and reversed sensory abnormalities that developed in neuropathic pain models, without affecting pain-related behavior in normal animals. GDNF reduces ectopic discharges within sensory neurons after nerve injury. This may arise as a consequence of the reversal by GDNF of the injury-induced plasticity of several sodium channel subunits. Together these findings provide a rational basis for the use of GDNF as a therapeutic treatment for neuropathic pain states. Comment by Marshall Devor, PhD. Nerve injury frequently causes sensory neurons to become electrically hyperexcitable. The resulting ectopic afferent firing is thought to be the immediate cause of ongoing pain, movement-evoked pain, and allodynia in neuropathic pain states. But why do the neurons become hyperexcitable? A popular hypothesis has it that when the axon is cut, the sensory cell body in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is starved of essential neurotrophic molecules that are normally produced in the periphery and transported to the DRG via axoplasmic transport. If so, then providing an exogenous source of the critical neurotrophin should prevent, or even reverse, the hyperexcitability and the pain. Boucher et al tried this, administering 1 of 3 candidate neurotrophins (NGF, NT-3, or GDNF) by the intrathecal (i.t.) route. One of them, GDNF, worked dramatically. The authors believe that i.t. GDNF acts by diffusing into the DRG (rather than the spinal cord) where it alters the expression of the channel proteins that are responsible for electrical hyperexcitability.

AB  - How much work is required to puncture dura with Tuohy needles? (Veterans Affairs Medical Center/Jackson Memorial Medical Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL) BR J Anaesth 2000;85:238?241. This study was designed to evaluate whether bevel orientation or patient position alters the force necessary to produce dural puncture. A constant hydrostatic pressure was applied to the subdural surface, either high or low, simulating the sitting and lateral positions. A 17-gauge Tuohy needle was advanced through the dura with the bevel oriented parallel or perpendicular to dural fibres. Travel distance and peak force at which dural penetration occurred was measured under both pressure conditions. The work required to produce dural penetration was calculated. Greater force and work were required to penetrate dura in the perpendicular orientation (P < 0.05), regardless of the subdural pressure exterted. Dural displacement was similar under both pressure conditions. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. Work is the product of displacement and force (the area under the curve). The same amount of work is required whether the dura is under pressure (sitting position) or not (lying down). This is surprising. Absolute force is, therefore, not the most important factor. Penetration of the dura probably depends more on local pressure, the area of contact between needle and dura, and the structure of the dura (eg, fiber direction). A sharp needle will obviously penetrate much easier than a blunt one. Considering the shape of a Tuohy needle you would expect that the area of contact not only depends on orientation of the needle, but also strongly on the angle at which the dura is approached. Since dural puncture with a Tuohy needle in a young person almost invariably results in a ?spinal headache? most benefit will be obtained from reducing the change of dural puncture. This study supports the concept of putting the bevel of the needle perpendicular to the fiber direction to reduce this change.

AB  - Does early intervention with a light mobilization program reduce long-term sick leave for low back pain? (Central Hospital in Hedmark, Ottestad, Norway) Spine 2000;25:1973?1976. This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. Early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. In this experiment, patients were referred to a low back pain clinic and given a simple and systematic program as an outpatient treatment. Patients sick-listed 8 to 12 weeks (N = 457) for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. At 12-month follow-up assessment, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full-duty work, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Conclude that early intervention with examination, information, and recommendations to stay active showed significant effects in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patients that have been sick listed for more than 8 weeks in Norway. Comparison was between a control group that received conventional primary health care and an intervention group that was examined at a spine clinic, given information, and advised to stay active. The authors wanted to examine if an early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. This study involved 457 patients that were sick listed 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain. The inclusion criteria for the study was based on 1) 8 to 12 weeks being ?sick-listed,? 2) age (18 to 60 years), and 3) diagnosis that included back pain, low back pain, leg and thigh pain, back pain without sciatica, and sciatica. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, recent low back trauma, cauda equina symptoms, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatic low back disease, and ongoing low back treatment. The intervention used was modification of Indahl's light mobilization program where the patient was referred to a spine clinic, answered standard questionnaires, and was interviewed and examined by a treatment team consisting of a physician and a physiotherapist. Any somatic findings during the examination were explained to the patient and information was given about their importance. All radiographs were shown and explained. The idea was to educate the patient and dedramatize their problems. The patient was assured of a good prognosis and informed of the importance of remaining active to avoid development of muscle dysfunction. The physiotherapist individually advises the patient on how to train and stretch at home. They were also advised on how to manage the back pain and resume normal activity. The patients in the control group were not examined at the clinic, but were treated with primary health care, which included at least one visit to a general practitioner. The patients were reassessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The assessment was to determine if the patient had returned to full duty work. At each of the assessments, the intervention group had a higher percentage of patients that had returned to full duty work. At the 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full duty work as compared with 56.4% in a controlled group. This study demonstrates that a consultation with thorough examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement shows a significant effect in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain as compared to the conventional health care guidelines used by general practitioners that tend to recommend bed rest, caution, and reduced activities. The authors suggest that information and fear reduction when offered systematically may reduce the fear of ?doing something wrong? to the back. This may then prevent unnecessary activity and long sick leave.

AB  - Phantom limb pain as a manifestation of paclitaxel neurotoxicity. (Providence Hospital, Southfield, MI) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:740?742. This case report described 2 patients with prior amputation who experienced phantom limb pain (PLP) after receiving paclitaxel therapy. A third patient experienced disabling neurotoxicity in the extremity of a prior ulnar nerve and tendon transposition after receiving paclitaxel. This unique syndrome should be identified as a direct causal effect of paclitaxel. The pathophysiology of PLP and the treatment options are reviewed. Conclude that physicians should be aware that PLP can occur after initiation of paclitaxel.

AB  - Epidural abscess: case report and literature review. (Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:428?431. A case of a 72-year-old woman who underwent adrenalectomy and groin dissection for recurrent malignant melanoma under combined general and epidural anesthesia was presented. On the fourth postoperative day, she developed signs of localized infection at the epidural site and a band of reduced sensation. Further neurological signs developed before the diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging scans. She subsequently underwent emergency laminectomy and drainage of the epidural abscess. Conclude that delayed diagnosis allowed the development of significant morbidity before neurosurgical intervention and antibiotics were instituted.

AB  - Herpes zoster in the elderly: issues related to geriatrics. (Durham Veterans Affairs medical Center, Durham, NC) Clin Infect Dis 1999;28:736?739. This article reviews specific clinical and research issues of herpes zoster related to geriatric medicine. Salient epidemiological and clinical issues include the increasing probability of zoster and postherpetic neuralgia with aging, age-related decline in immunity to varicella-zoster virus, the functional and psychosocial impact of zoster on the quality of life of the elderly, illness behavior in elderly patients with zoster, and varicella-zoster virus transmission and control in the nursing home. The role of antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, and analgesics; the measurement and analysis of pain, health-related quality of life, and functional status; and the development of varicella vaccine in the management of zoster in the elderly are also emphasized. Fertile research opportunities exist within these areas for investigators interested in infectious diseases, geriatrics, and other zoster-related disciplines.

AB  - Can exercise therapy improve the outcome of microdiscectomy? (University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom) Spine 2000;25:1523?1532. This study determined the effects of a postoperative exercise program on pain, disability, psychological status, and spinal function. Twenty patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy were randomized into EXERCISE and CONTROL groups. After surgery, all patients received normal postoperative care that included advice from a physiotherapist about exercise and a return to normal activities. Six weeks after surgery, patients in the EXERCISE group undertook a 4-week exercise program that concentrated on strength and endurance of the back and abdominal muscles and mobility of the spine and hips. Assessments of spinal function were performed in all patients during the week before the surgery and at 6, 10, 26, and 52 weeks after. On each occasion, patients completed questionnaires that asked about pain, disability, and psychological status. Surgery improved pain, disability, back muscle endurance capacity and hip and lumbar mobility in both groups of patients. After the exercise program, the EXERCISE group showed further improvements. The only further improvement showed by the CONTROL group was an increase in back muscle endurance capacity. Conclude that a 4-week postoperative exercise program can improve pain, disability and spinal function in patients who undergo microdiscectomy.

AB  - Cervical disc herniation in a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain: a case report. (University of Pittsburg Medical center, Pittsburg, PA) Spine 2000;25:1726?1728. This report discussed the clinical manifestations and the treatment outcome of a patient with a known diagnosis of congenital insensitivity to pain who developed a herniated cervical disc. The patient had neurologic motor weakness with ?neck and shoulder pain.? A clear radicular pattern could not be elicited. The patient underwent a successful anterior discectomy and fusion with long-term clinical and radiographic results. Conclude that patients with congenital insensitivity to pain who develop a cervical disc herniation may present with atypical symptoms not manifesting in the classic radicular pattern. Higher index of suspicion by the clinician must be practiced to make the appropriate diagnosis. Successful surgical outcome may be achieved in these patients.

AB  - Pain children: a common experience. (Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) Pain 2000;87:51?57. This study analyzed the prevalence of pain in Dutch children from 0 to 18 years of age. A random sample of 1300 children 0?3 years of age was taken from the register of population in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. In the Rotterdam area, 27 primary schools and 14 secondary schools were selected to obtain a representative sample of 5336 children from 4?18 years of age. Depending on the age of the child, a questionnaire was either mailed to the parents (0?3 years) or distributed at school (4?18 years). Of 6636 children surveyed, 5424 (82%) responded; response rates ranged from 64% to 92%, depending on the subject age and who completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents, 54% had experienced pain within the previous 3 months. Overall, a quarter of the respondents reported chronic pain (recurrent or continuous pain for more than 3 months). The prevalence of chronic pain increased with age, and was significantly higher in girls (P < 0.001). In girls, a marked increase occurred in reporting chronic pain between 12 and 14 years of age. The most common types of pain in children were limb pain, headache, and abdominal pain. Half of the respondents who had reported pain reported to have multiple pain, and one-third of the chronic pain sufferers experienced frequent and intense pain. These multiple pains and severe pains were more often reported by girls (P < 0.001). The intensity of pain was higher in the case of chronic pain (P < 0.001) and multiple pains (P < 0.001), and for chronic pain the intensity was higher for girls (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that chronic pain is a common complaint in childhood and adolescence. In particular, the high prevalence of severe chronic pain and multiple pain in girls aged 12 years and over calls for follow-up investigations documenting the various bio-psycho-social factors related to this pain.

AB  - Influence of tramadol on the ventilatory response to hypoxia in humans. (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom) Br J Anaesth 2000;85:211?216. In this study, the effect of tramadol on the ventilatory response to 7 min acute isocapnic hypoxia during steady mild hypercapnia in 14 healthy volunteers (7 male, 7 female) was studied. The acute hypoxic response was measured before and 1 h after oral placebo or tramadol (100 mg). After tramadol, ventilation during mild hypercapnia (mean 11.28 liters min?1) was significantly less (P < 0.05) than during placebo baseline (13.93 liters min?1), tramadol baseline (14.63 liters min?1), or after placebo (14.9 liters min?1), confirming that tramadol has a small depressive effect on the hypercapnic ventilatory response. There was no significant difference in the hypoxic ventilation/Spo2 response measured during the placebo baseline (0.99), placebo (1.18), tramadol baseline (0.78) or tramadol (0.68) runs. These data suggest that tramadol does not depress the hypoxic ventilatory response.
