AB  - Background Shock and severe tissue injury lead to an endogenous coagulopathy mediated by activation of Protein C and hyperfibrinolysis known as acute traumatic coagulopathy. Together, hemodilution, acidosis, inflammation, and hypothermia result in a global trauma-induced coagulopathy. Coagulopathy in trauma is associated with mortality. Early and effective hemostatic resuscitation is critical in restoring perfusion, correcting coagulopathy, and saving lives in exsanguinating trauma. Lyophilized plasma (LP) provides a logistically superior alternative to fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Study Design and Methods Plasma was lyophilized following whole blood collection from anesthetized swine. A series of studies were performed using anesthetized swine subjected to a validated model of polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock including a Grade V liver injury. Animals were randomized to resuscitation using reconstituted LP fluids. Physiologic data and blood loss were measured. Coagulation status and inflammatory mediators were evaluated. Results Full volume reconstituted LP (100%LP) retains on average 86% coagulation factor activity compared to fresh plasma and when used in 1:1 ratios with red blood cells demonstrated superior hemostatic efficacy compared to FFP. Hypertonic LP reconstituted using 50% of the original plasma volume (50%LP) had higher coagulation factor concentrations, was well tolerated in swine, and equally effective compared to 100%LP with respect to physiologic and hemostatic properties. Buffering with ascorbic acid resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Conclusion By minimizing the volume of reconstituted LP and optimizing its anti-inflammatory properties, an LP resuscitation fluid may be created to provide effective hemostatic resuscitation with superior logistical properties.

AB  - Summary Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P?<?0·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.

AB  - Abstract Aim Colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy usually have elevated levels of inflammatory markers and experience numerous side effects from chemotherapy thereby leading to poor quality of life. Omega-3 fatty acid and microbial cell preparation (MCP) have been known to provide significant benefits in patients on chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid and MCP in quality of life, chemotherapy side effects and inflammatory markers in colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Methods A double-blind randomized study was carried out with 140 colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Subjects were separated into two groups to receive either placebo or MCP [30 billion colony-forming unit (CFUs) per sachet] at a dose of two sachets daily for 4 weeks, and omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 2 g daily for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were quality of life, side effects of chemotherapy and levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein. Results The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid improved the overall quality of life and alleviated certain side effects of chemotherapy. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid also managed to reduce the level of IL-6 (P = 0.002). There was a significant rise in the placebo group's serum TNF-α (P = 0.048) and IL-6 (P = 0.004). Conclusion The combined supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid may improve quality of life, reduce certain inflammatory biomarkers and relieve certain side effects of chemotherapy in colorectal patients on chemotherapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

Sepsis and polytrauma are two of the most common and complex syndromes occurring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and affect drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and elimination. Pharmacological management of ICU patients requires consideration of the unique pharmacokinetics associated with these clinical conditions and the likely occurrence of drug interaction. Rational adjustment in drug choice and dosing contributes to the appropriateness of treatment of those patients.

Qualitative clinical indices and quantitative laboratory methods were used to monitor the periodontal status of 3 pockets 5 to 7 mm deep in each subject. Patients were randomly assigned either a sonic or manual toothbrush. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, and anatomical location of the test sites. Data were collected from all sites at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Over the 8-week period, both groups showed significant improvements in the clinical indices used. Descriptive statistics indicated the sonic brush group had greater improvement than the manual group in the clinical parameters (gingival index, bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) flow was significantly lower in the sonic brush group (P = 0.018). Considerable variation was present in the levels detected for both inflammatory cytokines tested, however, concentration of interleukin-1 beta was significantly lower in the GCF of sonic group patients (P = 0.05), while concentration of interleukin-6 was significantly reduced in both groups (P ≤ 0.05) (t tests). Under these conditions, there is some evidence to suggest that the sonic toothbrush is more beneficial in resolving inflammation in patients with moderate periodontal disease.

AB  - Abstract Background Distinct gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) consistent with increased sympathetic nervous system activity have been described in different populations under chronic stress. Neuroinflammatory brain changes, possibly related to the migration of primed monocytes to the brain, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a stress-sensitive gastrointestinal disorder associated with altered brain-gut interactions and increased sympathetic/vagal tone and anxiety. Reports about immune alterations in IBS are conflicting. This pilot study aimed to test how PBMC gene expression inflammatory profiles are correlated with altered brain signatures in the salience system. Methods Sixteen IBS and 16 healthy controls (HCs) completed resting state MRI scans. Gene expression profiles in PBMCs were assessed using human transcriptome array-2. Bioinformatic analyses determined differential expression of PBMCs between IBS and HCs. Partial least squares, a multivariate analysis technique, was used to identify disease correlations between PBMC gene expression profiles and functional activity in the brain's salience network. Key Results Regions of the salience network, including the mid cingulate cortex, and mid and superior temporal gyrus were positively correlated with several pro-inflammatory genes (interleukin 6, APOL2) in IBS, but negatively correlated with several anti-inflammatory genes (KRT8, APOA4) in HCs. Conclusions & Inferences Based on rodent studies, one may speculate that chronically activated stress signaling pathways in IBS maintain a pro-inflammatory state in the periphery. Alternatively, primed monocytes may migrate to the brain during stress, inducing regional neuroinflammatory changes in salience regions involved in the modulation of visceral sensitivity.

AB  - Abstract Quercetin, a plant-derived flavonoid, is known for its antitumor and antiproliferative activities. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), as a highly aggressive cerebrum tumor, has a poor prognosis that is approximately 12?months despite standard therapy. Therefore, because of the low effectiveness of the current therapeutic strategies, additional medications in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy are needed, which could improve the prognosis of GBM patients. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that quercetin regulates many proteins involved in the cellular signal transduction in GBM. In this review, recent findings on the targeting of particular signaling pathways by quercetin and the subsequent effect on the pathogenesis of GBM are presented and discussed.

AB  - Abstract Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) plays an important role in the gastric mucosal defense mechanism and also acts as a functional gastric tumor suppressor. In this study, we examined the effect of GKN1 on the expression of inflammatory mediators, including NF-?B, COX-2, and cytokines in GKN1-transfected AGS cells and shGKN1-transfected HFE-145 cells. Lymphocyte migration and cell viability were also analyzed after treatment with GKN1 and inflammatory cytokines in AGS cells by transwell chemotaxis and an MTT assay, respectively. In GKN1-transfected AGS cells, we observed inactivation and reduced expression of NF-?B and COX-2, whereas shGKN1-transfected HFE-145 cells showed activation and increased expression of NF-?B and COX-2. GKN1 expression induced production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-8 and -17A, but decreased expression of IL-6 and -10. We also found IL-17A expression in 9 (13.6%) out of 166 gastric cancer tissues and its expression was closely associated with GKN1 expression. GKN1 also acted as a chemoattractant for the migration of Jurkat T cells and peripheral B lymphocytes in the transwell assay. In addition, GKN1 significantly reduced cell viability in both AGS and HFE-145 cells. These data suggest that the GKN1 gene may inhibit progression of gastric epithelial cells to cancer cells by regulating NF-?B signaling pathway and cytokine expression. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Fractures are one of the most common large-organ, traumatic injuries in humans, and osteoporosis-related fractures are the fastest growing health care problem of aging. Elective orthopedic surgeries of the bones and joints also represent some of most common forms of elective surgeries performed. Optimal repair of skeletal tissues is necessary for successful outcomes of these many different orthopedic surgical treatments. Research focused on post-natal skeletal repair is therefore of immense clinical importance and of particular relevance in situations in which bone tissue healing is compromised due to the extent of tissue trauma or specific medical co-morbidities. Three commonly used murine surgical models of bone healing, closed fracture with intramedullary fixation, distraction osteogenesis (DO), and marrow ablation by reaming, are presented. The biological aspects of these models are contrasted and the types of research questions that may be addressed with these models are presented. ? 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Neurological disorders occur in the central and peripheral nervous system and include Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Activation of the innate immune system inevitably occurs in all forms of neurological disorders. The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multimolecular complex that can sense danger signals associated with neurological disorders. Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes caspase-1-mediated interleukin-1? and interleukin-18 maturation in microglia, where neuroinflammation contributes to neurological disease development and progression. Thus, this review attempts to elucidate the current knowledge regarding NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Recent scientific findings with respect to neuroprotective effects of dietary phytochemicals against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neurological disorders summarized in this review suggest that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by plant-derived phytochemicals could be a potential strategy for prevention or treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract Prion infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterised by a reactive gliosis and the subsequent degeneration of neuronal tissue. The activation of glial cells, which precedes neuronal death, is likely to be initially caused by the deposition of misfolded, proteinase K-resistant, isoforms (termed PrPres) of the prion protein (PrP) in the brain. Cytokines and chemokines released by PrPres-activated glia cells may contribute directly or indirectly to the disease development by enhancement and generalisation of the gliosis and via cytotoxicity for neurons. However, the actual role of prion-induced glia activation and subsequent cytokine/chemokine secretion in disease development is still far from clear. In the present work, we review our present knowledge concerning the functional biology of cytokines and chemokines in prion infections of the CNS.

Many of these models mimic the pathophysiology of human sepsis. However, identification of mediators in animals, the blockade of which has been protective, has not translated into clinical efficacy in septic humans. We describe the shortcomings of the animal models and reasons why effective therapy for human sepsis cannot be derived readily from promising findings in animal sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Inflammation and immunity development are well recognized as responses to tumor treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). To demonstrate that another major host response effector process, acute phase response, may be also induced by this cancer treatment modality, the expression of serum amyloid P component (SAP) acknowledged as a hallmark acute phase reactant in the mouse was investigated following PDT of murine FsaR fibrosarcomas. The results reveal almost 150-fold increase in the expression of SAP gene in the liver of mice bearing tumors treated by Photofrin-mediated PDT, while serum SAP levels increased around 50-fold at the peak interval about 24 hr post PDT. The same tumor treatment induced also the liver gene upregulation and serum levels elevation of another established acute phase reactant, mannose-binding lectin A (MBL-A). Both SAP and MBL-A were found to accumulate in PDT-treated tumors, but this includes local production because their genes in these tumor tissues were upregulated as well. Gene encoding C-reactive protein (CRP) was also upregulated almost 7-fold in the same tumor tissues, suggesting a rare example of CRP participation in host response of the mouse. Interleukin-6 and glucocorticoid hormones were identified as major mediators promoting tumor PDT-induced upregulation of liver SAP gene. Moreover, glucocorticoids were found to act as critical inducers of SAP gene upregulation in PDT-treated tumors. The study definitely proves the occurrence of a strong acute phase response following tumor PDT, and reveals that glucocorticoid hormones released during this development impact the expression of host response-relevant genes in PDT-treated tumors. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - SUMMARY Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae include pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. All these are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pneumococcus can colonize the nasopharynx, and this can be a prelude to bronchopneumonia and invasion of the vasculature space. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood?brain barrier and entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where the bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The infected host may develop septicaemia and/or meningitis secondary to bronchopneumonia. Also septicaemia is a common precursor of meningitis. The mechanisms surrounding the sequence of infection are unknown, but will be dependent on the properties of both the host and bacterium. Treatment of these diseases with antibiotics leads to clearance of the bacteria from the infected tissues, but the bacteriolytic nature of antibiotics leads to an acute release of bacterial toxins and thus after antibiotic therapy the patients can be left with organ-specific deficits. One of the main toxins released from pneumococci is the membrane pore forming toxin pneumolysin. Here we review the extensive studies on the role of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases.

AB  - Abstract The central nervous system injury that can result after radiotherapy has been suggested to involve induced gene expression and cytokine production. We have previously shown that irradiation of primary cultures of rat astrocytes results in the activation of NF?B. To determine whether such an effect also occurs in vivo, NF?B activity was analyzed in the cerebral cortex of the rat brain after whole body irradiation. After a single dose of 15 Gy, NF?B activity was increased by 2 h postirradiation, returning to unirradiated levels by 8 hours. The increase was dose-dependent beginning at 2 Gy and continuing to at least 22.5 Gy. NF?B activity in the irradiated cortex was not accompanied by I?Bα degradation. When 7.5 Gy was delivered 24 h before the 15 Gy, the increase in NF?B activity after 15 Gy was significantly reduced. These results suggest that an initial exposure to radiation induced a refractory period in the brain during which the susceptibility of NF?B to activation by subsequent irradiation was significantly reduced. This period of reduced sensitivity to radiation was also apparent for the induction of the NF?B-regulated cytokines IL-1?, IL-6, and TNFα. Radiat. Oncol.

AB  - Abstract The effects of tilapia fish oil and liposomes containing fish oil on hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of rats were investigated. The activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase and lactate dehydrogenase, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 in serum of rats were determined. In addition, the malondialdehyde contents, superoxide dismutase activities, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-?B) activation and the apoptosis in hepatic tissue of rats were estimated. The results showed that the administration of tilapia fish oil and liposomes could reduce the hepatocellular damage, neutrophil infiltration and oxidative stress, decrease inflammatory cytokines, increase antiinflammatory cytokine, and attenuate NF-?B activation of hepatic I/R injury rats. Overall, the tilapia fish oil and liposomes exerted antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects on ischemic liver, thereby protecting hepatocytes against I/R injury. Practical applications Fish oil has many dietary benefits, but due to its strong odors and rapid deterioration, its application in food formulations is limited. The encapsulation of fish oil in liposomes is a good choice for reduction of fish odor smell and improvement of oxidative stability. The present study investigated the protective effects of tilapia fish oil and liposomes on hepatic I/R injury of rat. The results showed that both the free tilapia fish oil and its liposomes had antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects on the experimental rats. Therefore, liposomes containing tilapia fish oil should be considered as a prospective functional food and pharmaceuticals application.

AB  - Abstract Background We aim to study the level of inflammatory cytokines in aqueous of post-vitrectomy eyes. Methods Aqueous samples were obtained from post-vitrectomy eyes that underwent cataract surgery. Samples from age-related cataract patients were also collected as controls. The concentrations of cytokines were measured by array-based multiplex sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system and microparticle-based multiplex cytokine assay. Results Eighteen post-vitrectomy eyes from 18 patients were included; all received one vitrectomy with gas injection for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The mean interval between vitrectomy and cataract surgery was 22.33?months (range 6 to 80). Primary results show that in post-vitrectomy eyes the levels of many cytokines, such as B-lymphocyte chemo-attractant, I-309, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, were higher than control. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were significantly elevated in post-vitrectomy eyes, even after the subjects were divided by their refractive state. Conclusions The concentrations of some cytokines were increased in the anterior chambers of post-vitrectomy eyes even a long time after vitreous surgery. This surge in post-operative cytokines might cause changing in the micro-environment of the anterior, and this might contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma or fasten the development of cataract in these eyes.

AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.
