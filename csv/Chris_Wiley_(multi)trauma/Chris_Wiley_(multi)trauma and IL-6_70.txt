AB  - Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: an update. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Drugs 2000;59:1113?1126. This article provided an update on recent developments in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also been demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated. Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred antidepressant for treatment of PHN. The topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as effective as tricycline antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments for patients with PHN.

AB  - A validated, practical classification procedure for many persistent low back pain patients. (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) Pain 2000;87:89?97. This article discussed the development of a simple procedure for assigning persistent low back pain (LBP) patients to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive, hierarchically organized classes. This procedure relies on the spatial distribution of a patient's pain and the results of straight leg raise tests to make the assignment. The procedure was applied to a large group of patients who sought treatment for persistent LBP at several university affiliated tertiary care clinics, and found that the resulting 4 classes of patients were significantly different from one another in their presentation, and in the way they were evaluated and treated by physicians. Conclude that the procedure may have practical research and clinical applications.

AB  - Simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness. (University of California, Sacramento, CA) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:938?943. This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects, and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. Measurement of 3 tasks was performed on a work simulation device on 2 different days separated by 1 week. Associations between work task performance and previously reported strength measures in 6 muscle groups by hand-held dynamometry (HHD) were examined. This study was conducted in the human performance laboratory of a university and consisted of a convenience sample of ambulatory outpatients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, type I (n = 9), myotonic muscular dystrophy (n = 10), and able-bodied controls (n = 11). Mean between-session differences for work simulation tasks ranged from ?11% to +4% for peak torque and from ?12% to +12% for total work; test sessions did not differ significantly for either patient or control groups. All groups had between-session intraclass correlation coefficients usually> 0.80, which indicated good consistency. In general, correlations between peak torque during work simulation and HHD were strongest in the control group. Conclude that persons with neuromuscular weakness reliably performed the simulated work tasks examined in this investigation. Work simulation tasks may be a useful tool to assess muscular performance in persons with neuromuscular weakness. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article addresses something that is very important when evaluating patient progress during rehabilitation. It is common in rehab to evaluate muscle groups and to determine a muscular performance by using isolated muscle group testing. The problem with this is that it doesn't necessarily correlate with tasks that patients perform on a day-to-day basis. The purpose of the study was to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. The work simulation tasks included knob-turning (alternating pronation and supination), linear motion (alternating push/pull motion), and lever arm (push-down motion). This study did accomplish its goals. The peak torque and total work measured in work simulation tasks did not differ significantly between test and retest sessions for either the patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness or the control groups. This study addresses an issue that other studies have not. Just because a patient shows improvement in strength measure by hand held dynamometry does not necessarily mean that he or she will be able to accomplish tasks that are performed at home. The main goal of rehabilitation is for patients to be able to perform activities of daily living around the house and at work. If this is not accomplished then their rehabilitation is for naught.

AB  - Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces adrenalitis in BALB/c mice but does not compromise adrenal function, assessed by levels of circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the response to challenge with synthetic ACTH. Levels of corticosterone increased 2 days after infection in mice of this strain, consistent with previously established interactions between mediators of acute inflammation and activation of the hypothalmus?pituitary?adrenal axis. Moreover, an adrenocortical response was critical to survival of BALB/c (but not C57BL/6) mice 3 days after infection, as pharmacologically or surgically adrenalectomized BALB/c mice died when given doses of virus up to fivefold lower than they could normally tolerate. However, death could not be prevented by the administration of soluble cytokine receptors to inhibit the action of interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The corticosteroid response did not mediate MCMV-induced thymic atrophy. As the above traits were all less evident in C57BL/6 mice, a common genetic basis is discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT We evaluated antibodies to different peptide regions of rat C5a in the sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) for their protective effects in rats. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were developed to the following peptide regions of rat C5a: amino-terminal region (A), residues 1-16; middle region (M), residues 17-36; and the carboxyl-terminal region (C), residues 58-77. With rat neutrophils, the chemotactic activity of rat C5a was significantly inhibited by antibodies with the following rank order: anti-C > anti-M ? anti-A. In vivo, antibodies to the M and C (but not A) regions of C5a were protective in experimental sepsis, as determined by survival over a 10-day period, in a dose-dependent manner. The relative protective efficacies of anti-C5a preparations (in descending order of efficacy) were anti-C ≥ anti-M ? anti-A. In CLP rats, a delay in infusion of antibodies, which were injected at 6 or 12 h after CLP, still resulted in significant improvement in survival rates. These in vivo and in vitro data suggest that there are optimal targets on C5a for blockade during sepsis and that delayed infusion of anti-C5a antibody until after onset of clinical evidence of sepsis still provides protective effects.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown complement activation as a possible mechanism for trichloroethylene (TCE) sensitization, leading to multi-organ damage including the kidneys. In particular, excessive deposition of C5 and C5b-9-the membrane attack complex, which can generate significant tissue damage, was observed in the kidney tissue after TCE sensitization. The present study tested the hypothesis that anaphylatoxin C5a binding to its receptor C5aR mediates renal injury in TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were sensitized through skin challenge with TCE, with or without pretreatment by the C5aR antagonist W54011. Kidney histopathology and the renal functional test were performed to assess renal injury, and immunohistochemistry and fluorescent labeling were carried out to assess C5a and C5aR expressions. TCE sensitization up-regulated C5a and C5aR expressions in kidney tissue, generated inflammatory infiltration, renal tubule damage, glomerular hypercellularity and impaired renal function. Antagonist pretreatment blocked C5a binding to C5aR and attenuated TCE-induced tissue damage and renal dysfunction. TCE sensitization also caused the deposition of major pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? in the kidney tissue (P?<?0.05); this was accompanied by increased expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05). Pretreatment with the C5aR antagonist attenuated the increase of expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05) and also consistently reduced the TCE sensitization-induced increase of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? (P?<?0.05). These data identify C5a binding to C5aR, MAP kinase activation, and inflammatory cytokine release as a novel mechanism for complement-mediated renal injury by sensitization with TCE or other environmental chemicals.

AB  - Critical-sized bone defects present a significant burden to the medical community due to their challenging treatment. However, a successful limb-salvaging technique, the Masquelet Technique (MT), has significantly improved the prognosis of many segmental bone defects in helping to restore form and function. Although the Masquelet Technique has proven to be clinically effective, the physiology of the healing it induces is not well understood. Multiple modifiable factors have been implicated by various surgical and research teams, but no single factor has been proven to be critical to the success of the Masquelet Technique. In this review the most recent clinical and experimental evidence that supports and helps to decipher the traditional Masquelet, as well as the modifiable factors and their effect on the success of the technique are discussed. In addition, future developments for the integration of the traditional Masquelet Technique with the use of alternative biomaterials to increase the effectiveness and expand the clinical applicability of the Masquelet Technique are reviewed.

AB  - Abstract We report a case of arsenic keratosis and pigmentation accompained by multiple Bowen's disease and genitourinary cancer in a 64-year-old man. He was a psoriasis patient with a history of herbal medication for about thirty years. He showed multiple hyperkeratotic plaques on the bilateral palms, soles, and multiple, brownish, scaly, elevated papules on the back in addition to diffuse hyperpigmentation. Biopsy confirmed arsenic keratosis and Bowen's disease. Transitional cell carcinoma was also detected on his ureter and bladder during follow-up. The skin lesions were treated with topical 5-fluorouracil, etretinate, and excision with improvement.
