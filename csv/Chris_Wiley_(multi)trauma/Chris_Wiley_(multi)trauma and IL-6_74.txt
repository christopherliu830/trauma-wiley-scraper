AB  - Abstract Respiratory viral infections have a major impact on health. Acute respiratory illnesses, largely caused by viruses, are the most common illness experienced by otherwise healthy adults and children. Data from the United States, collected in the 1992 National Health Interview Survey, suggest that such illnesses are experienced at a rate of 85.6 illnesses per 100 persons per year and account for 54% of all acute conditions exclusive of injuries (1). A total of 44% of these illnesses require medical attention and result in 287 days of restricted activity, 94.4 days lost from work, and 182 days lost from school per 100 persons per year. The morbidity of acute respiratory disease in the family setting is significant. The Tecumseh study, a family-based surveillance study of respiratory illness, estimated that approximately one-quarter of respiratory illnesses result in consultation with a physician (2). Illness rates for all acute respiratory conditions are highest in young children, and children below the age of 9 have been estimated to experience between five and nine respiratory illnesses per year (3).

AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - Summary Cosmetics based on traditional herbal medicine are formulated not only with herbal extracts but also using advanced bioprocessing and delivery method. This chapter explains the characteristics of Korean herbal cosmetics through examples of concepts, history, and traditions within the Korean traditional medicine industry. With the advancements in biotechnology, studies are now being conducted on the dermatological effects and processing methods of traditional medicinal ingredients, including ginseng. The enzymatic and microbial bioprocessing is used to produce novel natural compounds. Camelliaside A and B and three oxyisoflavones were isolated from the green tea seed and soybean. Using these compounds, a commercially and biologically useful new polyphenol, kaempferol, and 7,3?,4?-trihydroxyisoflavone were produced by enzymatic and microbial bioconversion. Carrier systems, such as liposomes, polymersomes, and solid lipid nanoparticles, are being developed for the stabilization and skin delivery of herbal active compounds.

AB  - Mammals harbor a complex gut-associated microbiota, comprising bacteria that provide immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits to the host, and contribute to their well-being. However, dysregulation of the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, along with the associated mucosal immune response have a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, among others. In addition, outside the gut lumen, bacteria from microbiota are the causative agent of peritoneal inflammation, abdominal sepsis and systemic sepsis. Critical care interventions during sepsis by antibiotics induce dysbiosis and present acute and long-term poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss immunomodulatory effects of the microbial molecules and products, highlighting the role of Bacteroides fragilis, a human commensal with ambiguous interactions with the host. Moreover, we also address the impact of antibiotic treatment in sepsis outcome and discuss new insights for microbiota modulation.

AB  - Abstract Epidermal keratinocytes (KCs) undergo highly orchestrated morphological and molecular changes during transition from proliferative compartment into growth arrested early and late differentiation layers, prior to dying in outermost cornified layers of normal skin. Creation of stratum corneum is vital to barrier function protecting against infection. Transcriptional events in KCs regulating complex processes of differentiation and host defense required to maintain constant epidermal thickness and resistance to infection in either young or aged skin are largely unknown. Furthermore, as terminal differentiation is characterized by irreversible loss of replicative potential culminating in dead layers at the skin surface, this process may be viewed as a form of senescence. However, a complete transcriptional profile of senescent (SN) human KCs has not been previously defined to permit delineation of molecular boundaries involving differentiation and senescence. To fill this void, we utilized global transcriptional analysis of KCs maintained in vitro as either cultures of proliferating (PR) cells, early and late confluent (LC) (accelerated senescence) cultures, or KCs undergoing replicative senescence. Global gene expression profiling revealed early confluent (EC) KCs were somewhat similar to PR KCs, while prominent differences were evident when compared to LC KCs; which were also distinct from replicatively SN KCs. While confluent KCs have in common several genes regulating differentiation with replicatively SN KCs, the latter cells expressed elevated levels of genes involved in interferon signaling and inflammatory pathways. These results provide new insights into cell autonomous transcriptional-based programs operative within KCs contributing to replicative senescence, with partial sharing of genes involved in differentiation. In addition, regulation of KC senescence may involve participation of interferon signaling pathways derived from the important role of KCs in protecting skin from infection. Integrating all of the transcriptional data revealed a key role for Notch receptor mediated signaling in the confluency induced differentiation phenotype using this model system. J. Cell.

AB  - Summary Blood transfusion in surgery has long been understood to carry a fair amount of clinical risk despite its obvious benefits. For this reason, blood loss conservation and other methods for minimization of transfusion have become of paramount importance for the advancement of ongoing safe care of the surgical patient. This chapter will serve as an overall guide to understanding the availability, cost, and usage of blood products in surgery. Additionally, we will discuss techniques used during procedures that play a role in minimization of transfusion. Further, the potential benefits of unnecessary blood transfusion in surgical patients will be explained with a goal of improving outcomes in the future.
