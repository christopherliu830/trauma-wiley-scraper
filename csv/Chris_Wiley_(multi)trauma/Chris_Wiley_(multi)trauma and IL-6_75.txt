AB  - Abstract Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes continuous neurological deficits and major sensory-motor impairments. There is no effective treatment to enhance sensory-motor function following SCI. Thus, it is crucial to develop novel therapeutics for this particular patient population. Astaxanthin (AST) is a strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. In the present study, it was tested in a severe compression SCI model with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes, signalling pathway, along with other complications. Methods A severe SCI was induced by compression of the rat thoracic spinal cord with an aneurysm clip and treatment with AST or the vehicle was carried out, 30 min after injury. Behavioural tests including open field, von Frey, hot plate and BBB were performed weekly to 28 days post-injury. Rats were assigned to measure blood glucose, weight and auricle temperature. Western blot and histological analysis also were performed at the same time points. Results AST decreased mechanical and thermal pain and also improved motor function performance, reduced blood glucose and auricle temperature increases and attenuated weight loss in SCI rats. Western blot analysis showed decreased activation of ERK1/2 and increased activation of AKT following AST treatment. The histology results revealed that AST considerably preserved myelinated white matter and the number of motor neurons following SCI. Conclusion Taken together, the beneficial effects of AST to improve sensory-motor outcomes, attenuate pathological tissue damage and modulate ERK and AKT signalling pathways following SCI, suggest it as a strong therapeutic agent towards clinical applications. Significance Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs sensory-motor function and causes complications, which astaxanthin (AST) has the potential to be used as a treatment for. The present study investigates the effects of AST in a compression model of SCI with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes alongside other complications, histopathological damage and also related signalling pathways.

AB  - Abstract As an endogenous neuroprotectant agent, adenosine is extensively distributed and is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS). Under physiological conditions, the concentration of adenosine is low intra- and extracellularly, but increases significantly in response to stress. The majority of adenosine functions are receptor-mediated, and primarily include the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R). Adenosine is currently widely used in the treatment of diseases of the CNS and the cardiovascular systems, and the mechanisms are related to the disease types, disease locations, and the adenosine receptors distribution in the CNS. For example, the main infarction sites of cerebral ischemia are cortex and striatum, which have high levels of A1 and A2A receptors. Cerebral ischemia is manifested with A1R decrease and A2AR increase, as well as reduction in the A1R-mediated inhibitory processes and enhancement of the A2AR-mediated excitatory process. Adenosine receptor dysfunction is also involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and epilepsy. Thus, the adenosine receptor balance theory is important for brain disease treatment. The concentration of adenosine can be increased by endogenous or exogenous pathways due to its short half-life and high inactivation properties. Therefore, we will discuss the function of adenosine and its receptors, adenosine formation, and metabolism, and its role for the treatment of CNS diseases (such as cerebral ischemia, AD, depression, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and sleep disorders). This article will provide a scientific basis for the development of novel adenosine derivatives through adenosine structure modification, which will lead to experimental applications.

AB  - Summary All diseases, including neurological diseases, can be broadly defined as homeostatic failures. Neuroglial cells are a major component of pathogenesis of neurological diseases. The function of neuroglia is neuroprotection. In neurological diseases, glia attempt to maintain tissue and cellular homeostasis. Reactive astrogliosis can be defined as a constitutive, graded, multi-stage and evolutionary conserved defensive astroglial reaction. It can be classified according to (a) morphological appearances, and (b) severity. This chapter focuses on Wallerian degeneration which is currently used to describe axonal degeneration in both CNS and PNS. Wallerian degeneration is a specialised active process that involves activation of localised signals in both axons and surrounding glial cells. The chapter dicusses excitotoxic vulnerability of oligodendrocytes. The main function of microglia is to detect insults to the CNS and to mount a defensive response, the activation of microglia. The activated microglia can change the repertoire and levels of expression of numerous receptors.

AB  - Summary Haemophilia is an inherited disorder of clotting factor deficiencies resulting in musculoskeletal bleeding, including haemarthroses, leading to orthopaedic complications. The pathogenesis of haemophilic joint arthropathy continues to be explored and there is evidence to suggest that iron, cytokines, and neo angiogenesis can initiate synovial and early cartilage damage resulting in molecular changes and the perpetuation of a chronic inflammatory state. This joint arthropathy has long term consequences for bone health resulting in chronic pain and quality of life issues in the individual with haemophilia. Haemarthroses can be prevented by the administration of clotting factor concentrates (prophylaxis). However, high costs and the need for venous access devices in younger children continue to complicate recommendations for universal prophylaxis. In patients who fail or refuse prophylaxis, procedures, such as synovectomy and arthroplasty, can provide relief from repeated haemarthroses. The optimal timing of these, however, is not well defined. Prevention of joint arthropathy needs to focus on prevention of haemarthroses through prophylaxis, identifying early joint disease through the optimal use of cost effective imaging modalities and the validation of serological markers of joint arthropathy. Screening for effects on bone health and optimal management of pain to improve quality of life are, likewise, important issues.

AB  - Summary Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, required for the degradation of glycosphingolipids. Clinical manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bone disease and a bleeding diathesis, frequently resulting in presentation to haematologists. Historically managed by splenectomy, transfusions and orthopaedic surgery, the development of specific therapy in the form of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in the 1990s has resulted in dramatic improvements in haematological and visceral disease. Recognition of complications, including multiple myeloma and Parkinson disease, has challenged the traditional macrophage-centric view of the pathophysiology of this disorder. The pathways by which enzyme deficiency results in the clinical manifestations of this disorder are poorly understood; altered inflammatory cytokine profiles, bioactive sphingolipid derivatives and alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment have been implicated. Further elucidating these pathways will serve to advance our understanding not only of GD, but of associated disorders.

AB  - Summary The use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) for the treatment of equine injuries and diseases holds immense potential, and is expanding from its original application in orthopedics into the treatment of ischemic, inflammatory, and neurologic disorders. The use of MSC for primary tissue regeneration was initially advocated on the basis of their ability to differentiate into various tissue types. As such, the regeneration of damaged tissues would be directly stimulated, since injected MSC colonize the injury site, differentiate into the appropriate mesenchymal tissue type, and affect repair. Since 2003, the clinical use of MSC has exploded, with thousands of horses now being treated worldwide. Demonstrating true efficacy should be a collective goal of the equine veterinary community, by performing clinical trials that include a sufficient amount of similar cases, and a consistent and standardized panel of objective outcome measures.
