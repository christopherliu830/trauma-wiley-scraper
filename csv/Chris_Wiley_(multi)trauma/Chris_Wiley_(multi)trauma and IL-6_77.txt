AB  - Recent studies suggest that increased lymphocyte apoptosis (Ao) detected in peripheral blood T?cells from burn patients appears to contribute to decreased lymphocyte immunoresponsiveness. However, while it is known that sepsis induces a marked depression in the splenocyte immune response (i.e. decreased interleukin-2, interferon-? production and proliferation) in response to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), it is unknown whether this depression is associated with an increase in inducible Ao and if so, which mediators control this process. To assess this, splenocytes were harvested from mice at 24?hr (a period associated with decreased Con A response) after the onset of polymicrobial sepsis [caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)] or sham-CLP (Sham) and then stimulated with 2·5??g Con A/ml (24?hr). Septic mouse splenocytes stimulated with Con A, while not showing a change in their phenotypic make-up, did exhibit a marked increase in the percentage of splenocyte that were Ao+ which was associated with altered cytokine release. This appears to be due to an increase in the percentage of Ao+ cells in the CD4+ CD8? population and was associated with enhanced Fas antigen expression as well as an increase in mRNA for the Fas?FasL gene family. To determine if the changes in Ao are due to either endotoxin (a product of Gram-negative bacteria seen in CLP mice) or the expression of Fas ligand (FasL; a mediator of activation-induced lymphocyte Ao), a second set of studies examining Con A-inducible Ao was performed with splenocytes harvested from septic endotoxin-tolerant C3H/HeJ and the FasL-deficient C3H/HeJ-Fasl?gld mice. The results show that increased splenocyte Ao detected following CLP is due to a FasL-mediated process and not to endotoxin. Thus the inadvertent up-regulation of FasL-mediated splenocyte Ao may contribute to the depression of splenocyte immune responses seen during polymicrobial sepsis.

AB  - Summary The haemostatic or coagulant system is designed primarily to prevent bleeding and haemorrhage following injury to blood vessels, although some of its constituent proteins have additional roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. This chapter describes the function and components of the haemostatic system and its role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It explores the effect of variants in genes coding for proteins in the haemostatic system on cardiovascular risk. The chapter describes the effect of dietary components on the haemostatic system, both directly and via the development of chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Platelets have a key function in normal haemostasis and are activated by a number of agonists, particularly thrombin, collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and also adrenaline and serotonin, some of which act synergistically in vivo with other agonists. The fibrinolytic system regulates the degradation of the fibrin matrix. It consists of fibrinolytic factors and fibrinolysis inhibitors.

AB  - Abstract Deoxynivalenol (DON, also known as vomitoxin) is a common mycotoxin found worldwide, especially in contaminated food. DON is toxic to a variety of cells and tissues in humans. Three kinds of conjugated products (DON-3-glucuronide, DON-15-glucuronide and DON-7-glucuronide) can be found as major metabolites in human urine. Females and males show different patterns of exposure levels, and human exposure to DON also shows some geographical differences because of different DON levels in cereal-based foods, food intake habits and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression. Specifically, the C12, 13-deepoxy metabolite was found predominantly in French adults but was rarely detected in UK adults. However, a cohort of Spanish individuals demonstrated even lower DON levels than the levels in the UK populations, whereas a very high DON exposure level was detected in South Africa and Linxian, China. Recent publications have further indicated that DON could be detected in the urine of pregnant women from different countries, which suggests that there is a potential risk to both mothers and foetuses. Additionally, phytochemicals have been shown to be less toxic to cells and laboratory animals in research studies and may also be used as food additives for reducing the toxic effects of DON. In this review, we provide global information on DON metabolism, human exposure and gender differences in humans. Also, control strategies for this mycotoxin are discussed.

AB  - Summary Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are stem cell populations present among the bone marrow stroma and a number of other tissues that are capable of multi-lineage differentiation into mesoderm-type cells such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. MSC provide supportive stroma for growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and hematopoiesis. These cells have been described as important immunoregulators due to their ability to suppress T cells proliferation. MSC can also directly contribute to tissue repair by migrating to sites of injury and providing a source of cells for differentiation and/or providing bystander support for resident stromal cells. This chapter discusses the cellular and molecular properties of MSC, the mechanisms by which they can modulate immune responses and the clinical applications of MSC in disorders such as graft-versus-host disease and aplastic anaemia. The role of MSC in the treatment of autoimmune disorders as well as their potential in the arena of tissue repair and a view of what the future clinical applications of MSC might be is outlined in this chapter.

AB  - Summary This review addresses the physiological background and the current status of evidence regarding ventilator-induced lung injury and lung protective strategies. Lung protective ventilatory strategies have been shown to reduce mortality from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We review the latest knowledge on the progression of lung injury by mechanical ventilation and correlate the findings of experimental work with results from clinical studies. We describe the experimental and clinical evidence of the effect of lung protective ventilatory strategies and open lung strategies on the progression of lung injury and current controversies surrounding these subjects. We describe a rational strategy, the open lung strategy, to accomplish an open lung, which may further prevent injury caused by mechanical ventilation. Finally, the clinician is offered directions on lung protective ventilation in the early phase of ARDS which can be applied on the intensive care unit.
