AB  - Abstract Reticulohistiocytoses (RH) are rare and clinically heterogeneous histiocytic disorders of dermatological interest. Three clinical entities with superimposable histopathological features are currently considered, namely: solitary reticulohistiocytoma, diffuse/generalized reticulohistiocytosis and multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. Although in the last decade RH studies have only minimally progressed, histiocytosis research has advanced considerably: the prognostic and therapeutic importance of the clinical sub-classification of histiocytosis patients as well as of the detection of genetic alterations in the genes of the ERK pathway has been highlighted. According to these insights, we previously reported the presence of molecular alteration RH and described a subset of patients with disseminated multisystem involvement lacking arthritis. In the present review, we aim to update and revise the knowledge regarding RH. We first reviewed their histopathological, immunophenotypical and ultrastructural features, discussed their histopathological differential diagnosis with other conditions characterized by infiltrates made of oncocytic or epithelioid cells (with special regard to Destombes-Rosai-Dorfman Disease (DRDD)) and finally summarized the molecular landscape of RH. We therefore tried to adjust the clinical sub-classification of Langerhans cell histiocytosis to the clinical phenotypes of RH, outlining 5 clinically different groups of patients. Finally, we reconsidered the clinical workflow to the evaluation of RH patients, in light of the 5 different clinical groups and discussed the different therapeutic approaches and the possible role of target inhibitors.

AB  - Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of acute hypoxic respiratory failure in pregnancy. This chapter discusses the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of ARDS in pregnant patients. Ware and Matthay described the pathophysiology of ARDS. Alveolar and/or capillary endothelial injury is the predominant mechanism in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Tocolytic-induced pulmonary edema (TPE) is an important cause of ARDS. Risk factors for TPE are multiple gestation, infection, and corticosteroid therapy. Management of TPE includes stopping the drug, diuresis, and supportive care. The management of ARDS in pregnancy is complicated. It requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both maternal and fetal aspects of care. There are no formal studies on the use of high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) in pregnancy, but the pregnant patient in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with baseline raised respiratory drive, fits the phenotype of the patient who might benefit from early use of HFOT.

AB  - Abstract Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is no longer used in kidney transplant recipients. However, there is no consensus regarding whether or not to ligate a well-functioning AVF after successful kidney transplantation, particularly in patients with well and stably functioning kidney transplants. Most AVFs without complications are left in situ and more than one-third of native AVFs close spontaneously. The currently accepted policy toward thrombosed AVFs is retention within the patient's extremity without treatment. These thrombosed AVFs seldom cause serious problems. However, when combined with aneurysmal dilatation of the proximal vein adjacent to the arterial anastomotic area, the AVF could act as the source of distal arterial emboli. This is very similar clinical scenario to that observed in embolization from a peripheral arterial aneurysm. Here we describe a case report of upper extremity ischemia following massage of a thrombosed aneurysmal AVF. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of catheter-directed thromboaspiration, thrombolysis, and surgical repair of the thrombosed AVF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of upper extremity embolism after massage of a thrombosed aneurysmal AVF involving this combined treatment.

AB  - Abstract The spectrum of activity of vitamin D goes beyond calcium and bone homeostasis, and growing evidence suggests that vitamin D contributes to maintain musculoskeletal health in healthy subjects as well as in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who display the combination of bone metabolism disorder, muscle wasting, and weakness. Here, we review how vitamin D represents a pathway in which bone and muscle may interact. In vitro studies have confirmed that the vitamin D receptor is present on muscle, describing the mechanisms whereby vitamin D directly affects skeletal muscle. These include genomic and non-genomic (rapid) effects, regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation. Observational studies have shown that circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels correlate with the clinical symptoms and muscle morphological changes observed in CKD patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to low bone formation rate and bone mineral density, with an increased risk of skeletal fractures. The impact of low vitamin D status on skeletal muscle may also affect muscle metabolic pathways, including its sensitivity to insulin. Although some interventional studies have shown that vitamin D may improve physical performance and protect against the development of histological and radiological signs of hyperparathyroidism, evidence is still insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Background The dearth of literature regarding how or when to intervene when an adult with intellectual disability is bereaved may impede clinical practice; this study therefore aimed to explore the current clinical psychology response, so as to enhance understanding of the role of the profession in supporting grief within this population. Method A collective case study design was used. Data for six persons with intellectual disability, including interviews with parentally bereaved persons and involved staff members, were integrated into individual case stories for cross-case synthesis. Results Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Five overarching themes illustrated that the clinical psychology role is broadly distributed and identified potentially complicating factors such as ?gatekeeping? and ?staff uncertainty.? Conclusions A model of bereavement supports reflecting that by Read (Learning Disability Practice, 8, 2005, 31) is being approximated in clinical practice; further research is required to determine how best to implement this, and whether this meets the true needs of the population.

AB  - Abstract Evidence shows that women have lower tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels and lower incidences of heart dysfunction and sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. To identify the cardioprotective effects and precise cellular/molecular mechanisms behind estrogen and estrogen receptors (ERs), we investigated the effects of 17?-estradiol (E2) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) on LPS-induced apoptosis by analyzing the activation of survival and death signalling pathways in doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Tet-On/ERα H9c2 myocardial cells and ERα-transfected primary cardiomyocytes overexpressing ERα. We found that LPS challenge activated JNK1/2, and then induced I?B degradation, NF?B activation, TNF-α up-regulation and subsequent myocardial apoptotic responses. In addition, treatments involving E2, membrane-impermeable BSA-E2 and/or Dox, which induces ERα overexpression, significantly inhibited LPS-induced apoptosis by suppressing LPS-up-regulated JNK1/2 activity, I?B degradation, NF?B activation and pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. TNF-α, active caspases-8, t-Bid, Bax, released cytochrome c, active caspase-9, active caspase-3) in myocardial cells. However, the cardioprotective properties of E2, BSA-E2 and ERα overexpression to inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis and promote cell survival were attenuated by applying LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and PI3K siRNA. These findings suggest that E2, BSA-E2 and ERα expression exert their cardioprotective effects by inhibiting JNK1/2-mediated LPS-induced TNF-α expression and cardiomyocyte apoptosis through activation of Akt.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study examined whether social and physical peer victimization in adolescence led to changes in psychological and physical health outcomes. Methods One hundred and twenty adolescents (boys = 54) and a parent completed measures of peer victimization and health approximately 2 years apart. Results Results indicated that both social and physical victimization were related to increases in the frequency and severity of health problems over the assessment period. Conclusions Increases in social, but not physical victimization, were related to more internalizing problems as well as greater frequency and severity of health problems at the second assessment. Anxious depression and severity of health problems at the first assessment were related to increases in social, but not physical forms of victimization over the 2-year period. These results continue to shed light on the notion that being peer victimized is not a normal part of life and is not necessarily something that adolescents will reconcile with time.

AB  - Summary Bladder cancer is the most common urothelial malignancy. More than 90% arise from the transitional cell lining of the urinary tract. The remainder of the histological variants include squamous cell cancer, adeno carcinoma, and other rare tumours. Urothelial cancer is associated with smoking and exposure to industrial carcinogens. This cancer generally affects people who are older and who have many comorbidities, which makes their management more challenging. More than two-thirds of the urothelial cancers are non-muscle?invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) confined to the mucosa or submucosal layers of the bladder wall and remainder are muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). NMIBC have tendency to recur, and the risk of recurrence varies between 15 and 80% and the majority of the recurrences occur within 6?12?months. Hence, intensive surveillance with cystoscopy and imaging of the urinary tract is required, which in turn incurs a high cost to the healthcare systems. The NMIBC cancers are classified based on their risk of recurrence and progression into low, intermediate, and high risk to tailor subsequent management and surveillance. In addition to the initial transurethral resection, intravesical therapies in the form of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination are used to reduce recurrence or progression of the disease. For MIBC or high-risk NMIBC, radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the mainstay of treatment. Radical cystectomy is a life-changing operation and is associated with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, experts in the field are striving to minimise the morbidity of the procedure by using minimal invasive techniques of laparoscopy or robotic surgery in combination with enhanced recovery pathways to expedite recovery. There remains a risk of recurrence even after radical cystectomy due to micrometastasis. Various chemotherapy regimens have been used to decrease this in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has so far provided 5?8% absolute survival benefit at the expense of significant morbidity. In patients unfit or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy, bladder preservation is an alternative which includes external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy after transurethral resection. There is not enough evidence to prove the equivalence of this to radical surgery. In those with advanced or metastatic disease, patients are put on palliative care pathway because the natural history of the disease is poor with four to six?months expected survival. However, some newer immuno-therapies that inhibit the interaction between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), present on the surface of tumour or antigen-presenting cells, and programmed death 1 (PD-1), present on the surface of activated lymphocytes, are offering new hope to the patients with advanced disease. In some cases of locally advanced cancer, palliative cystectomy can be performed for control of recurrent bleeding.

AB  - Essentials The lectin pathway's MASP-1/2 activates coagulation factors but the trigger of the activation is unknown. MASP-1/2 activation was assessed by quantifying complexes between MASPs and antithrombin/C1-inhibitor. Activated platelets and fibrin were demonstrated to activate MASP-1 and MASP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may represent a crossroad between the complement and the coagulation systems. Summary Background The activated forms of the complement lectin pathway (LP) proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 are able to cleave the coagulation factors prothrombin, fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in vitro. In vivo studies also show that MASP-1 is involved in thrombogenesis. Objectives To clarify the not yet identified mechanisms involved in triggering activation of the LP during thrombotic reactions. Methods Novel sandwich-ELISAs for detection of complexes between MASP-1 or MASP-2 and the serpins C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) or antithrombin (AT), were used to specifically detect and quantify the activated forms of MASP-1 and MASP-2. Results Activated platelets were shown by flow cytometry to bind Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 but not MBL, which was associated with activation of MASP-1 and MASP-2. We also demonstrated that fibrin and the plasmin-generated fibrin fragment DD in plasma, bind and activate MASP-1 and MASP-2. As demonstrated by the ELISA and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, the fibrin-associated activation was reflected in a specific inactivation by AT during clotting without the assistance of heparin. In all other cases the MASPs were, as previously reported, inactivated by C1-INH. In systemic lupus erythematosus patients with thrombotic disease and in polytrauma patients, the levels of activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 in complex with both AT and C1-INH were associated with markers of thrombotic disease and contact/coagulation system activation. Conclusions MASP-1 and MASP-2 are activated during blood clotting. This activation is triggered by activated platelets and by the generation of fibrin during thrombotic reactions in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a novel activation/amplification mechanism in thromboinflammation.
