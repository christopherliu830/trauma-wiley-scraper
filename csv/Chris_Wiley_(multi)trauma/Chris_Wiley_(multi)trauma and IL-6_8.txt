AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.

AB  - Abstract Objective Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are considered atheroprotective, and low levels have been associated with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly non-ST elevation (NSTE)-ACS. However, the functional properties as well as homeostasis of Tregs are mainly unknown in coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we investigated the composition and functional properties of naïve (n) and memory (m)Tregs in patients with NSTE-ACS and in patients 6?12 months post-ACS. Methods Based on the expression of CD25, FOXP3, CD127, CD45RA, CD39 and CTLA-4, Treg subsets were defined by flow cytometry in whole blood or isolated CD4+ T cells. The functional properties of nTregs and mTregs were examined in terms of proliferative capacity and modulation of cytokine secretion. To understand the potential consequences of Treg defects, we also investigated correlations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine secretion and ultrasound-defined carotid atherosclerosis. Results Both NSTE-ACS and post-ACS patients exhibited reduced levels of nTregs (P < 0.001) compared with healthy control subjects, but without compensatory increases in mTregs. Both nTregs and mTregs from patients showed significantly lower replicative rates and impaired capacity to modulate T-cell proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-10. The Treg defect was also associated with LPS-induced cytokine secretion and increased burden of carotid atherosclerosis. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a functional and homeostatic Treg defect in patients with NSTE-ACS and also in stabilized patients 6?12 months after ACS. Moreover, this defect was associated with a subclinical proinflammatory and atherogenic state. We believe that the failure to preserve Treg function and homeostasis reflects a need for immune-restoring strategies in CAD.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic osteolytic disease that shares pathogenic inflammatory features with other conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation. A hallmark of PD is inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. Myeloid cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages (Mac), are essential players in PD by control of gingival biofilm pathogenicity, activation of adaptive immunity, as well as nonresolving inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Despite mounting evidence of significant innate immune implications to PD progression and healing after therapy, myeloid cell markers and targets for immune modulation have not been validated for clinical use. The remarkable plasticity of monocytes/Mac in response to local activation factors enables these cells to play central roles in inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis and provides opportunities for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery for management of chronic inflammatory conditions, including osteolytic diseases such as PD and arthritis. Along a wide spectrum of activation states ranging from proinflammatory to pro-resolving, Macs respond to environmental changes in a site-specific manner in virtually all tissues. This review summarizes the existing evidence on Mac immunomodulation therapies for osteolytic diseases in the broader context of conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation, and discusses osteoimmune implications of Macs in PD.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The consequence of excessive liver resection is the inexorable development of progressive liver failure characterised by the typical stigmata associated with this condition, including worsening coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinaemia and encephalopathy. The focus of this review will be to investigate factors contributing to hepatocyte loss and impaired regeneration. Methods A literature search was undertaken of Pubmed and related search engines, examining for articles relating to hepatic failure following major hepatectomy. Results In spite of improvements in adjuvant chemotherapy and increasing surgical confidence and expertise, the parameters determining how much liver can be resected have remained largely unchanged. A number of preoperative, intraoperative and post-operative factors all contribute to the likelihood of liver failure after surgery. Conclusions Given the magnitude of the surgery, mortality and morbidity rates are extremely good. Careful patient selection and preservation of an obligate volume of remnant liver is essential. Modifiable causes of hepatic failure include avoidance of sepsis, drainage of cholestasis with restoration of enteric bile salts and judicious use of portal triad inflow occlusion intra-operatively. Avoidance of post-operative sepsis is most likely to be achieved by patient selection, meticulous intra-operative technique and post-operative care. Modulation of portal vein pressures post-operatively may further help reduce the risk of liver failure.

AB  - Background Postoperative inflammation is a common consequence of surgery and the ensuing stress response. Local anesthetics have anti-inflammatory properties. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if LA administrated intraperitoneally perioperatively might inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines. Methods This was a, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrial.gov reg no: NCT02256228) in patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. Patients were randomized to receive: intraperitoneal ropivacaine (Group IPLA) or saline (Group P) perioperatively. Except for study drug, patients were treated similarly. At the end of surgery, a multi-port catheter was inserted intraperitoneally, and ropivacaine 2 mg/mL or 0.9% saline, 10 mL was injected intermittently every other hour during 72 hours postoperatively. Systemic expression of cytokines and plasma ropivacaine were determined before and 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. Stress response was measured by serum glucose, cortisol, and insulin. Results Forty patients were recruited, 20 in each group. There was no statistical significant difference in systemic cytokine between the groups at any time point. Serum cortisol was significantly lower in the IPLA group at 6 hours, median 103 nmol/L (IQR 53-250) compared to placebo, median 440 nmol/L (IQR 115-885), P = 0.023. Serum glucose and insulin were similar between the groups. Total and free serum concentrations of ropivacaine were well below toxic concentrations. Conclusion In this small study, perioperative intraperitoneal ropivacaine did not reduce the systemic inflammatory response associated with major abdominal surgery. Total and free ropivacaine concentrations were below known toxic concentrations in humans.

AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of arthritis worldwide and represents a significant healthcare burden, particularly in the context of an ageing population. Traditionally, painkillers, injections and physiotherapy have been the mainstay of treatment, with patients being referred for joint replacement surgery (arthroplasty) when these options fail. Whilst effective in reducing pain and improving joint function, these approaches are not without potential complications. With the development of tissue-engineering techniques over recent years there has been considerable interest in applying these strategies to provide new, innovative, alternative effective means of treating OA. This review explores the unique microenvironment present within an osteoarthritic joint, highlighting the features that comprise the osteoarthritic niche and could be modulated in the development of novel treatments for OA. Existing tissue-engineering strategies for repairing bone and cartilage defects are discussed, with particular reference to how these might be modified, both to improve existing treatments, such as impaction bone grafting, as well as in the development of future treatments for OA.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Pancreatitis is a gastrointestinal disease with a worldwide sharp surge during the past decade. Pancreatitis includes acute and chronic subtypes, which are graded based on the amount of pancreatic inflammation. Phytoconstituents represent a promising class of therapeutic agents with wide acceptability not only based on folk practices but sound presence of pharmacological and molecular evidences. Growing research evidence indicates that different molecular mechanisms are involved in their protective effect. Many phytoremedies have been tried for the treatment of pancreatic injuries and have shown success in preclinical animal models of pancreatitis. The literature was largely collected through PubMed and Google scholar database. A large proportion of phytochemicals targets the inflammatory cascade and modulates the overtly acting redox balance among which nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells is the key molecule. Inhibition of apoptosis (artemisinin, embelin), inflammasome (withaferin A), neutrophil rolling (fucoidan), Ca+2 release (caffeine), mitogen activated protein kinase (guggulsterone) and many other novel mechanisms apart from antioxidant effect have been postulated behind the protective effect of phytoconstituents. The present review deals to fill the gap of hitherto unavailable comprehensive review on various plant products screened for the treatment of pancreatitis. The possible mechanistic profile of these phytochemicals is summarized. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background L-arginine (L-Arg) is deficient in sickle cell disease (SSD) during vasoocclusion. We investigated possible causal relationship between L-Arg deficiency and immune dysfunction in SSD in steady-state. Procedure Fifteen patients with SSD in steady-state and 13 controls were studied. Plasma L-Arg levels were measured using liquid chromatography. T cell subsets and CD3zeta (CD3?) chain expression were analyzed using flow cytometry. Lymphocyte proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and production of IL-6 and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) were evaluated with and without L-Arg. Results SSD patients had significantly lower L-Arg levels than controls. CD3 and CD19 cell populations were comparable for both groups, but SSD patients had above normal numbers of natural killer cells (P?=?0.06). Patients and controls exhibited significantly increased lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA after introduction of L-Arg to cultures; response of patients was significantly greater than values for control individuals. Proliferative response to candida in SSD patients was significantly lower than in controls; L-Arg supplementation did not increase this response. L-Arg had no effect on blastogenic response to PPD and candida albicans. No effect was likewise seen in production of IL-6 and IFN-? after addition of L-Arg. CD3? chain expression increased after addition of L-Arg in both groups; differences were insignificant. Conclusion L-Arg levels in steady-state SSD are significantly lower than in controls. L-Arg supplementation enhanced lymphocyte blastogenesis to PHA for both controls and patients, but not in response to antigen. There were no significant differences in CD3? chain expression although upregulation of expression occurred after L-Arg supplementation for both groups.

AB  - Inspired by the physiological events of the ?wound healing cascade?, the integration of biomaterials and growth factors is generally accepted as an emerging and powerful strategy for bone regenerative therapy. As a type of biological mediator, growth factors play a key role in functional bone regeneration. In this review, recent progress in the enhancement of bone-related growth factors via a biomaterial strategy will be discussed. Two main reinforcing mechanisms, temporal regulation and efficacy manipulation, are described in detail, highlighting the potential capability of biomaterials to harness the interactions between growth factors and specific cells. The effects of biomaterials for promoting bone formation via growth factor-mediated osteogenesis are further elucidated. Finally, an outlook of the prospects in terms of superior communication among growth factors, cells, and biomaterials in the microenvironment is presented, which might provide new directions for the design of medical devices for bone regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - ABSTRACT Low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (LFPEMF) has been shown to provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. However, there are no reports on whether LFPEMF can treat spinal cord injury (SCI) and its therapeutic mechanism. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate whether LFPEMF can promote the recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats and its therapeutic mechanism. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) score and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (tcMMEPs) were recorded to assess the recovery of neurological function. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining were performed to assess the severity of SCI. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining and western blotting (WB) were performed to assess the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes (OLs). Toluidine blue (TB) staining was performed to assess remyelination. WB and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to assess the expression of neurotrophins and inflammatory factors. Our results showed that following stimulation by LFPEMF, there were significant improvements in BBB scores, tcMMEP amplitudes, the extent of the damage, and reduced demyelination in rats after SCI. The mature OLs, the number of well-myelinated fibers, and the myelin sheath thickness significantly increased in rats stimulated by LFPEMF after SCI. The expression of neurotrophins significantly increased, and the expression of inflammatory factors significantly decreased in rats stimulated by LFPEMF after SCI. Therefore, we suggest that LFPEMF can promote the recovery of neurological function in rats after SCI by improving the differentiation of OPCs into OLs and promoting remyelination, as well as by inhibiting inflammation and promoting neurotrophic effects. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.

AB  - PGRN and its derived engineered protein, Atsttrin, were reported to antagonize TNFα and protect against inflammatory arthritis [Tang, W. et al. (2011) The growth factor progranulin binds to TNF receptors and is therapeutic against inflammatory arthritis in mice. Science 332 (6028) 478?484]. Here we found that PGRN level was also significantly elevated in skin inflammation. PGRN?/? mice exhibited more severe inflammation following induction of oxazolone (OXA). In contrast, recombinant Atsttrin protein effectively attenuated inflammation in mice dermatitis model. In addition, the protective role of PGRN and Atsttrin in dermatitis was probably due to their inhibition on NF-?B signaling. Collectively, PGRN, especially its derived engineered protein, Atsttrin, may represent a potential molecular target for prevention and treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.

AB  - The pharmacological activities of tetrahydropyridine (THP) derivatives are dependent on the substituent ring moiety. In this study, we investigate the anti-inflammatory activities of 12 newly synthesized substituted N-[3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)methyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydrobenzamide/benzene sulfonamides (9a?l) in murine BV-2 microglial cells. All compounds were initially screened for attenuation of nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1?µg/mL)-activated microglial cells. The data show that only SO2-substituted THPs were effective at sub-lethal concentrations (IC50 values of 12.92?µM (9i), 14.64?µM (9j), 19.63?µM (9k)) relative to L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine positive control (IC50?=?3.1?µM). The most potent SO2-substituted compound (9i) also blocked the LPS-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and attenuated the release of several cytokines including IL-1α, IL-10, and IL-6. These findings establish the moderate immuno-modulating effects of SO2-substituted THP derivatives.

AB  - Abstract In this study, the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rd (GS Rd) were evaluated in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Rats in SCI groups received a T8 laminectomy and a spinal contusion injury. GS Rd 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally 1 hr before the surgery and once daily for 14 days. Dexamethasone 1 mg/kg was administered as a positive control. Locomotor function was evaluated using the BBB score system. H&E staining and Nissl staining were performed to observe the histological changes in the spinal cord. The levels of MDA and GSH and the activity of SOD were assessed to reflect the oxidative stress state. The production of TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-1 was assessed using ELISA kits to examine the inflammatory responses in the spinal cord. TUNEL staining was used to detect the cell apoptosis in the spinal cord. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and MAPK proteins. The results demonstrated that GS Rd 25 and 50 mg/kg significantly improved the locomotor function of rats after SCI, reduced tissue injury and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord. Mechanically, GS Rd decreased MDA level, increased GSH level and SOD activity, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented cell apoptosis. The effects were equivalent to those of dexamethasone. In addition, GS Rd effectively inhibited the activation of MAPK signalling pathway induced by SCI, which might be involved in the protective effects of GS Rd against SCI. In conclusion, GS Rd attenuates SCI-induced secondary injury through reversing the redox-state imbalance, inhibiting the inflammatory response and apoptosis in the spinal cord tissue.

AB  - Abstract This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of cistanche on sevoflurane-induced aged cognitive dysfunction rat model. Aged (24 months) male SD rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control group, sevoflurane group, control + cistanche and sevoflurane + cistanche group. Subsequently, inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by ELISA, and the cognitive dysfunction of rats was evaluated by water maze test, open-field test and the fear conditioning test. Three days following anaesthesia, the rats were killed and hippocampus was harvested for the analysis of relative biomolecules. The oxidative stress level was indicated as nitrite and MDA concentration, along with the SOD and CAT activity. Finally, PPAR-? antagonist was used to explore the mechanism of cistanche in vivo. The results showed that after inhaling the sevoflurane, 24- but not 3-month-old male SD rats developed obvious cognitive impairments in the behaviour test 3 days after anaesthesia. Intraperitoneal injection of cistanche at the dose of 50 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days before anaesthesia alleviated the sevoflurane-induced elevation of neuroinflammation levels and significantly attenuated the hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in 24-month-old rats. Cistanche also reduced the oxidative stress by decreasing nitrite and MDA while increasing the SOD and CAT activity. Moreover, such treatment also inhibited the activation of microglia. In addition, we demonstrated that PPAR-? inhibition conversely alleviated cistanche-induced protective effect. Taken together, we demonstrated that cistanche can exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and anti-activation of microglia effects on the development of sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction by activating PPAR-? signalling.
