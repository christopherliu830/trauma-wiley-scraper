AB  - Summary.? Haemarthroses (intra-articular haemorrhages) are a frequent finding typically observed in patients with haemophilia. Diagnosis and treatment of these bleeding episodes must be delivered as early as possible. Additionally, treatment should ideally be administered intensively (enhanced on-demand treatment) until the resolution of symptoms. Joint aspiration plays an important role in acute and profuse haemarthroses as the presence of blood in the joint leads to chondrocyte apoptosis and chronic synovitis, which will eventually result in joint degeneration (haemophilic arthropathy). Ultrasonography (US) is an appropriate diagnostic technique to assess the evolution of acute haemarthrosis in haemophilia, although magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard as far as imaging techniques are concerned. Some patients experience subclinical haemarthroses, which eventually tend to result in some degree of arthropathy, especially in the ankles. Nowadays, the most effective way of protecting these patients is primary prophylaxis, which in practice changes severe haemophilia into moderate haemophilia, preventing or at least minimizing the occurrence of haemarthrosis. If primary prophylaxis is, for whatever reason not an option, secondary prophylaxis and enhanced on demand treatment should be considered. Two alternatives are available for inhibitor patients: (i) control of haemostasis using by-passing agents (rFVIIa or aPCCs) either as enhanced on demand treatment or secondary prophylaxis, as appropriate, following the same basic principles used for non-inhibitor patients and (ii) immune tolerance induction (ITI) to eradicate the inhibitor.

AB  - Abstract Primary objective: To evaluate a multicentre clinical trial design for testing powered toothbrushes. Secondary objective:? To compare the efficacy of a prototype brush head (N2.3) for the Philips Jordan Sensiflex 2000 powered toothbrush (PTB) to that of Braun Oral-B D15 PTB in removing dental plaque Material and methods:? 137 volunteers (ages 18?25?years) were recruited to this 3-centre, 2-week, 2-group, 2-treatment, single-blind trial. Plaque was recorded at screening and again 14?days later at baseline. Stratification of subjects, for gender and screening PI, occurred at baseline. Subjects were then asked to abstain from all oral hygiene measures for 48?h followed by a supervised episode of brushing for 3?min with the allocated PTB. The allocated PTB was used at home for the next 12?days before a second abstinence from all oral hygiene measures for the 48?h prior to a second supervised brushing episode. Plaque levels were scored using a modification of the Quigley & Hein plaque index (PI) at full mouth (FM), interproximal (IP) and smooth surfaces (SS). To enable the means of the within subject differences (pre to postbrushing) to be compared between groups PIs were recorded before and after the supervised brushing episodes, differences between centres, groups and visits were examined. Results: No significant differences in PI between groups at screening, baseline or prior to the supervised brushings were detected (P?>?0.05 anova). The results of the analysis of variance showed there to be a highly significant difference (P?<?0.001) between brushing groups, but, significant differences between centres (P?<?0.001) and a significant interaction effect between centre and brushing group (P?<?0.001) was also detected. Therefore the difference between groups was not present at all three centres. Further examination of the single centre data showed there to be greater levels of plaque removed by the N2.3 compared to the D15 (FM reduction in PI 1.95 vs. 1.13, respectively) at centre 3 in contrast to the other two centres where no difference was detected. The precise reason for these differences could not be established. Conclusions:? A multicentre study design is applicable for evaluating PTBs but a minimum of 3 centres should be included so that differences between centres can be identified. The prototype brush head N2.3 for the Philips Jordan Sensiflex 2000 PTB has comparable plaque removal efficacy to the Braun Oral-B D15 PTB at FM, IP and SS sites.

AB  - Aim Previous research indicates that preventive intervention is likely to benefit patients ?at risk? of psychosis, in terms of functional improvement, symptom reduction and delay or prevention of onset of threshold psychotic disorder. The primary aim of the current study is to test outcomes of ultra high risk (UHR) patients, primarily functional outcome, in response to a sequential intervention strategy consisting of support and problem solving (SPS), cognitive-behavioural case management and antidepressant medication. A secondary aim is to test biological and psychological variables that moderate and mediate response to this sequential treatment strategy. Methods This is a sequential multiple assignment randomised trial (SMART) consisting of three steps: Step 1: SPS (1.5 months); Step 2: SPS vs Cognitive Behavioural Case Management (4.5 months); Step 3: Cognitive Behavioural Case Management?+?Antidepressant Medication vs Cognitive Behavioural Case Management?+?Placebo (6 months). The intervention is of 12 months duration in total and participants will be followed up at 18 months and 24 months post baseline. Conclusion This paper reports on the rationale and protocol of the Staged Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP) study. With a large sample of 500 UHR participants this study will investigate the most effective type and sequence of treatments for improving functioning and reducing the risk of developing psychotic disorder in this clinical population.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The endothelial barrier consists of intercellular contacts localized in the cleft between endothelial cells, which is covered by the glycocalyx in a sievelike manner. Both types of barrier-forming junctions, i.e. the adherens junction (AJ) serving mechanical anchorage and mechanotransduction and the tight junction (TJ) sealing the intercellular space to limit paracellular permeability, are tethered to the actin cytoskeleton. Under resting conditions, the endothelium thereby builds a selective layer controlling the exchange of fluid and solutes with the surrounding tissue. However, in the situation of an inflammatory response such as in anaphylaxis or sepsis intercellular contacts disintegrate in post-capillary venules leading to intercellular gap formation. The resulting oedema can cause shock and multi-organ failure. Therefore, maintenance as well as coordinated opening and closure of interendothelial junctions is tightly regulated. The two principle underlying mechanisms comprise spatiotemporal activity control of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA and the balance of the phosphorylation state of AJ proteins. In the resting state, junctional Rac1 and RhoA activity is enhanced by junctional components, actin-binding proteins, cAMP signalling and extracellular cues such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). In addition, phosphorylation of AJ components is prevented by junction-associated phosphatases including vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). In contrast, inflammatory mediators inhibiting cAMP/Rac1 signalling cause strong activation of RhoA and induce AJ phosphorylation finally leading to endocytosis and cleavage of VE-cadherin. This results in dissolution of TJs the outcome of which is endothelial barrier breakdown.
