AB  - Summary Platelets play a key role in primary hemostasis. After injury, exposed subendothelium interacts with platelets to activate them through a series of steps including adhesion, aggregation, and the release reaction. Activated platelets in conjunction with the coagulation system form a stable plug to control hemorrhage. Numerous inherited and acquired conditions can lead to platelet dysfunction with variable bleeding. Although rare, the pathophysiologic basis of inherited platelet disorders is better understood than that of the more prevalent acquired conditions. This chapter briefly reviews the structure and function of normal platelets, discusses the various diagnostic tests available to evaluate platelet function, describes some of the more common inherited and acquired qualitative platelet disorders, and provides an overview of their treatment.

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Sepsis is characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection that is associated with high morbidity and mortality despite optimal care. Invariant natural killer T (iNK?T) cells are potent regulatory lymphocytes that can produce pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus shaping the course and nature of immune responses; however, little is known about their role in sepsis. We demonstrate here that patients with sepsis/severe sepsis have significantly elevated proportions of iNK?T cells in their peripheral blood (as a percentage of their circulating T cells) compared to non-septic patients. We therefore investigated the role of iNK?T cells in a mouse model of intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). Our data show that iNK?T cells are pathogenic in IAS, and that T helper type 2 (Th2) polarization of iNK?T cells using the synthetic glycolipid OCH significantly reduces mortality from IAS. This reduction in mortality is associated with the systemic elevation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 and reduction of several proinflammatory cytokines within the spleen, notably interleukin (IL)-17. Finally, we show that treatment of sepsis with OCH in mice is accompanied by significantly reduced apoptosis of splenic T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, but not natural killer cells. We propose that modulation of iNK?T cell responses towards a Th2 phenotype may be an effective therapeutic strategy in early sepsis.

AB  - Summary Analgesia, usually provided by opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIAs), can be enhanced by other classes of medication that have a different primary role but with a pharmacological mechanism of action that supports their analgesic actions. Adjunct analgesic methods/medications added to standard opioid and NSAIA analgesia has gained popularity in veterinary medicine; however, there are few veterinary clinical trials assessing efficacy. Adjunctive analgesics are frequently used in combination with other analgesics to confer a synergistic effect in a multi-modal regimen or to facilitate lower drug dosages to reduce adverse effects. Drugs currently used as adjuncts are Lidocaine systemically, Alpha2-adrenergic agonists, Gabapentin, Amitriptyline and Amantadine. This chapter discusses tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Corticosteroids inhibit cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2) gene expression, which is upregulated in inflammatory states, reduces aberrant firing originating from nerve injury and reduces inflammation at the site of injury.

AB  - The cognitive and behavioral deficits caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the immature brain are more severe and persistent than injuries to the adult brain. Understanding this developmental sensitivity is critical because children under 4 years of age of sustain TBI more frequently than any other age group. One of the first events after TBI is the infiltration and degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in the brain, releasing a range of immunomodulatory substances; inhibition of these cells is neuroprotective in other types of neonatal brain injury. This study investigates for the first time the role of MCs in mediating injury in a P7 mouse model of pediatric contusion-induced TBI. We show that various neural cell types express histamine receptors and that histamine exacerbates excitotoxic cell death in primary cultured neurons. Cromoglycate, an inhibitor of MC degranulation, altered the inflammatory phenotype of microglia activated by TBI, reversing several changes but accentuating others, when administered before TBI. However, without regard to the time of cromoglycate administration, inhibiting MC degranulation did not affect cell loss, as evaluated by ventricular dilatation or cleaved caspase-3 labeling, or the density of activated microglia, neurons, or myelin. In double-heterozygous cKit mutant mice lacking MCs, this overall lack of effect was confirmed. These results suggest that the role of MCs in this model of pediatric TBI is restricted to subtle effects and that they are unlikely to be viable neurotherapeutic targets. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
