AB  - Abstract Fibrosis and scar formation results from chronic progressive injury in virtually every tissue and affects a growing number of people around the world. Myofibroblasts drive fibrosis, and recent work has demonstrated that mesenchymal cells, including pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts, are their main progenitors. Understanding the cellular mechanisms of pericyte/fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, myofibroblast proliferation and the key signalling pathways that regulate these processes is essential to develop novel targeted therapeutics for the growing patient population suffering from solid organ fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about different progenitor cells of myofibroblasts, discuss major pathways that regulate their transdifferentiation and discuss the current status of novel targeted anti-fibrotic therapeutics in development.

AB  - Superficial bladder cancer includes tumors confined to the mucosa and lamina propria. They may be papillary or sessile. Tumors confined to the mucosa include papillomas, papillary carcinomas, or carcinoma in situ. Therapy must be individualized for each patient taking into consideration the histologic type, cytologic grade, location, number, prior history, and presence of atypia or carcinoma in situ in other areas of the bladder. Although the five-year survival rates are good (62?88 percent), the 48?70 percent incidence of subsequent tumors requires constant surveillance. This high incidence is primarily due to the multifocal origin of urothelial tumors, but implantation of tumor cells following local resection may be a contributing factor. Current efforts to reduce this recurrence rate emphasize intravesical chemotherapy. Thio-tepa and epodyl are effective in eradicating one-third of tumors when used for definitive therapy. Most studies demonstrate a reduction in the recurrence rate when they are initiated following endoscopic resection of all visible tumor. A number of other drugs are being investigated for both definitive and prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy. Surgical procedures consist of transurethral resection, transvesical radium implantation, segmental cystectomy, and cystoprostatectomy. Each procedure has its own indications, and the surgeon must be discriminating in their use.

AB  - Abstract One of the immediate eukaryotic cellular responses to DNA breakage is the covalent post-translational modification of nuclear proteins with poly(ADP-ribose) from NAD+ as precursor, mostly catalysed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Recently several other polypeptides have been shown to catalyse poly(ADP-ribose) formation. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological phenomena. Physiological functions include its participation in DNA-base excision repair, DNA-damage signalling, regulation of genomic stability, and regulation of transcription and proteasomal function, supporting the previously observed correlation of cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity with mammalian life. The pathophysiology effects are mediated through PARP-1 overactivity, which can cause cell suicide by NAD+ depletion. It is apparent that the latter effect underlies the pathogenesis of a wide range of disease states including type-1 diabetes, ischaemic infarcts in various organs, and septic or haemorrhagic shock. Therefore pharmacological modulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may prove to be an exciting option for various highly prevalent, disabling and even lethal diseases.

AB  - Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the generation of the body's blood and immune cells. This process takes place primarily in the bone marrow in specialized 'niche' microenvironments, which provide signals responsible for maintaining a balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage specification required for life-long hematopoiesis. While our understanding of these signaling mechanisms continues to improve, our ability to engineer them in vitro for the expansion of clinically relevant HSC populations is still lacking. In this review, we focus on development of biomaterials-based culture platforms for in vitro study of interactions between HSCs and their local microenvironment. The tools and techniques used for both examining HSC-niche interactions as well as applying these findings towards controlled HSC expansion or directed differentiation in 2D and 3D platforms are discussed. These novel techniques hold the potential to push the existing boundaries of HSC cultures towards high-throughput, real-time, and single-cell level biomimetic approaches that enable a more nuanced understanding of HSC regulation and function. Their application in conjunction with innovative biomaterial platforms can pave the way for engineering artificial bone marrow niches for clinical applications as well as elucidating the pathology of blood-related cancers and disorders.

AB  - Abstract Maxillofacial defects are complex lesions stemming from various etiologies: accidental, congenital, pathological, or surgical. A bone graft may be required when the normal regenerative capacity of the bone is exceeded or insufficient. Surgeons have many options available for bone grafting including the ?gold standard? autologous bone graft. However, this approach is not without drawbacks such as the morbidity associated with harvesting bone from a donor site, pain, infection, or a poor quantity and quality of bone in some patient populations. This review discusses the various bone graft substitutes used for maxillofacial and craniofacial repair: allografts, xenografts, synthetic biomaterials, and tissue-engineered substitutes. A brief overview of bone tissue engineering evolution including the use of mesenchymal stem cells is exposed, highlighting the first clinical applications of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells in craniofacial reconstruction. The importance of prevascularization strategies for bone tissue engineering is also discussed, with an emphasis on recent work describing substitutes produced using cell sheet-based technologies, including the use of thermo-responsive plates and the self-assembly approach of tissue engineering. Indeed, considering their entirely cell-based design, these natural bone-like substitutes have the potential to closely mimic the osteogenicity, osteoconductivity, osteoinduction, and osseointegration properties of autogenous bone for maxillofacial and craniofacial reconstruction.

AB  - Abstract Few treatments for human diseases have received as much investigation in the past 20 years as probiotics. In 2017, English-language meta-analyses totaling 52 studies determined the effect of probiotics on conditions ranging from necrotizing enterocolitis and colic in infants to constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy in adults. The strongest evidence in favor of probiotics lies in the prevention or treatment of 5 disorders: necrotizing enterocolitis, acute infectious diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and infant colic. Probiotic mechanisms of action include the inhibition of bacterial adhesion; enhanced mucosal barrier function; modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems (including induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells); secretion of bioactive metabolites; and regulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Future research is needed to identify the optimal probiotic and dose for specific diseases, to address whether the addition of prebiotics (to form synbiotics) would enhance activity, and to determine if defined microbial communities would provide benefit exceeding that of single-species probiotics.

AB  - Abstract Peri-implantitis is an infection of the tissue around an implant, resulting in the loss of supporting bone. Risk factors for peri-implantitis consist of a history of periodontitis, dental plaque, poor oral hygiene, smoking, alcohol consumption and diabetes. A clinical diagnosis indicates inflammatory signs including bleeding on probing with or without suppuration and a peri-implant pocket depth ≥5?mm. A radiograph shows images of marginal bone loss ≥2?mm. A differential diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis, occlusal overload, retrograde peri-implantitis and inflammatory implant periapical lesions suggests the appropriate treatment in each case. The non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, including a mechanical treatment alone or combined with antiseptics or antibiotics can improve clinical parameters in the short term but residual defects may still persist. Surgical treatment such as guided bone regeneration results in a gain of clinical attachment level and bone reconstruction in the long term. The limited effect of laser-assisted therapy needs to be further evaluated. The concept of prevention based on early detection and regular maintenance plays a principal role in reducing the occurrence of peri-implantitis.
