AB  - Abstract The oral toxicity of a single administration by gavage (10, 20 or 30 mg kg?1 body weight) of colchicine (COL) was determined in young, mature male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of COL was evaluated in the presence or absence of additional treatment variables that included vehicle and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pre-exposure. The vehicle for COL was either Half and Half cream (H & H) or saline, and each group included pretreatment with either saline or a low, minimally toxic dose (83 µg kg?1 body weight) of LPS. Colchicine toxicity in both male and female age-matched rats was characterized by progressively more severe dose-related clinical signs of toxicity. These included mortality, decreased body weight and feed intake during the first several days after dosing, with recovery thereafter in surviving animals. There were differences in the severity of the toxic response to COL between male and female rats. The most notable sex-related difference was in COL lethality. Female rats were two times more susceptible to the lethal effects of COL than male rats. Saline or H & H delivery vehicles did not result in any apparent qualitative or quantitative differences in COL toxicity. LPS pretreatment significantly potentiated COL lethality in both males and females, although the potentiation in males was greater than in females. LPS pretreatment modestly increased the COL induced anorexic effect in surviving males, but not in surviving female animals. LPS did not appear to modulate either the body weights or clinical signs of COL induced toxicity in surviving males or females. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT This review paper was written in conjunction with the 2010 National Coalition Consensus Conference: Oral Health of Vulnerable Older Adults and Persons with Disabilities. It provides an overview of specific medical considerations involved with dental diagnosis and treatment of this ?at risk population.? The role of oral inflammation is referenced within the context of the oral/systemic paradigm (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease/stroke, respiratory diseases, and cognition). Oral manifestations associated with multi-organ diseases, tobacco/alcohol use, and medications are additionally discussed. Finally, the paper encourages development of interdisciplinary approaches to positively influence health outcomes.

AB  - Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreas by an autoimmune response. Due to ethical and practical difficulties, the features of the destructive process are known from a small number of observations, and transcriptomic data are remarkably missing. Here we report whole genome transcript analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction (qRT?PCR) and correlated with immunohistological observations for four T1D pancreases (collected 5 days, 9 months, 8 and 10 years after diagnosis) and for purified islets from two of them. Collectively, the expression profile of immune response and inflammatory genes confirmed the current views on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes and showed similarities with other autoimmune diseases; for example, an interferon signature was detected. The data also supported the concept that the autoimmune process is maintained and balanced partially by regeneration and regulatory pathway activation, e.g. non-classical class I human leucocyte antigen and leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B1 (LILRB1). Changes in gene expression in islets were confined mainly to endocrine and neural genes, some of which are T1D autoantigens. By contrast, these islets showed only a few overexpressed immune system genes, among which bioinformatic analysis pointed to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) (CXCR4) chemokine pathway activation. Remarkably, the expression of genes of innate immunity, complement, chemokines, immunoglobulin and regeneration genes was maintained or even increased in the long-standing cases. Transcriptomic data favour the view that T1D is caused by a chronic inflammatory process with a strong participation of innate immunity that progresses in spite of the regulatory and regenerative mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Interdisciplinary research endeavors are directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative and chronic diseases that affect human lifestyle. Hence the potential for developing medicinal herb-derived and food plant-derived prophylactic agents directed at neurological, metabolic, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders abounds. Oligonol is a novel technology product emanating from the oligomerization of polyphenols, typically proanthocyanidin from a variety of fruits (grapes, apples, persimmons etc.) that has optimized bioavailability. It is an optimized phenolic product containing catechin-type monomers and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, the easily absorbed forms. Typically the constituents of Oligonol are 15?20% monomers, 8?12% dimers and 5?10% trimers. Supplementation of mice with Oligonol prior to the administration of ferric-nitrilotriacetic complex (a Fenton chemistry model) significantly reduced the extent of lipid peroxidation in the kidney, brain and liver. Oligonol triggers apoptosis in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through modulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, an observation suggesting its important chemopreventive effects. The senescence-accelerated strain of mice (SAM) are models of senescence acceleration and geriatric disorders which exhibit learning and memory deficits and enhanced production or defective control of oxidative stress leading to neuronal damage. Oligonol has been suggested to modulate behavioral deficits, decrease the extent of inflamma-tion scores in the SAMP8 mice as well as prolonging their life-span. Oligonol modulates the A? induced oxidative insult and dysfunction in mitochondrial membrane integrity in PC12 cells indicating potential neuroprotection functions. Safety studies indicate no adverse effects in mice with an LD50 of 5 g/kg which equates to a dose of approximately 300 g for an average human with a 60 kg body weight. The application of Oligonol in pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics, dairy, processed meat and food products, supplements and in functional beverages can be envisaged.
