AB  - Abstract This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of cistanche on sevoflurane-induced aged cognitive dysfunction rat model. Aged (24 months) male SD rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control group, sevoflurane group, control + cistanche and sevoflurane + cistanche group. Subsequently, inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by ELISA, and the cognitive dysfunction of rats was evaluated by water maze test, open-field test and the fear conditioning test. Three days following anaesthesia, the rats were killed and hippocampus was harvested for the analysis of relative biomolecules. The oxidative stress level was indicated as nitrite and MDA concentration, along with the SOD and CAT activity. Finally, PPAR-? antagonist was used to explore the mechanism of cistanche in vivo. The results showed that after inhaling the sevoflurane, 24- but not 3-month-old male SD rats developed obvious cognitive impairments in the behaviour test 3 days after anaesthesia. Intraperitoneal injection of cistanche at the dose of 50 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days before anaesthesia alleviated the sevoflurane-induced elevation of neuroinflammation levels and significantly attenuated the hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in 24-month-old rats. Cistanche also reduced the oxidative stress by decreasing nitrite and MDA while increasing the SOD and CAT activity. Moreover, such treatment also inhibited the activation of microglia. In addition, we demonstrated that PPAR-? inhibition conversely alleviated cistanche-induced protective effect. Taken together, we demonstrated that cistanche can exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and anti-activation of microglia effects on the development of sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction by activating PPAR-? signalling.

AB  - Abstract Aim Epidural analgesia reduces the surgical stress response. However, its effect on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the genesis of inflammation following major abdominal surgery remains unclear. Our main objective was to elucidate whether perioperative epidural analgesia prevents the inflammatory response following colorectal cancer surgery. Methods Ninety-six patients scheduled for open or laparoscopic surgery were randomized to epidural analgesia (group E) or patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (group P). Surgery and anaesthesia were standardized in both groups. Plasma cortisol, insulin and serum cytokines [interleukin 1? (IL-1?), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor α, interferon ?, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor] were measured preoperatively (T0), 1?6 h postoperatively (T1) and 3?5 days postoperatively (T2). Mixed model analysis was used, after logarithmic transformation when appropriate, for analyses of cytokines and stress markers. Results >There were no significant differences in any serum cytokine concentration between groups P and E at any time point except for IL-10 which was 87% higher in group P [median and range 4.1 (2.3?9.2) pg/ml] compared to group E [2.6 (1.3?4.7) pg/ml] (P = 0.002) at T1. There was no difference in plasma cortisol and insulin between the groups at any time point after surgery. A significant difference in median serum cytokine concentration was found between open and laparoscopic surgery with higher levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 at T1 in patients undergoing open surgery compared to laparoscopic surgery. No difference in serum cytokine concentration was detected between the groups or between the surgical technique at T2. Conclusions Open surgery, compared to laparoscopic surgery, has greater impact on these inflammatory mediators than epidural analgesia vs intravenous analgesia.

AB  - Hospitalization for major surgery or critical illness often associates with cognitive decline. Inflammation and dysregulation of the innate immune system can exert broad effects in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS), yet the mechanisms underlying memory impairment after surgery remain poorly understood and without effective therapy. Endogenous regulation of acute inflammation is providing novel approaches to treat several disease states including sepsis, pain, obesity and diabetes. Resolvins are potent endogenous lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation that display immunoresolvent actions. Here, using a mouse model of surgery-induced cognitive decline we report that orthopedic surgery affects hippocampal neuronal-glial function, including synaptic transmission and plasticity. Systemic prophylaxis with aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1: 7S,8R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid, as little as 100 ng dose per mouse) improved memory decline following surgery and abolished signs of synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, delayed administration 24 h after surgery also attenuated signs of neuronal dysfunction postoperatively. AT-RvD1 also limited peripheral damage by modulating the release of systemic interleukin (IL)-6 and improved other clinical markers of tissue injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role of AT-RvD1 in modulating the proinflammatory milieu after aseptic injury and protecting the brain from neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. These findings provide novel and safer approaches to treat postoperative cognitive decline and potentially other forms of memory dysfunctions.?Terrando, N., Gómez-Galán, M., Yang, T., Carlström, M., Gustavsson, D., Harding, R.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - Contents This paper reviews recent data and concepts on the development of inflammation in the reproductive tract of dairy cows during the first 2?months after calving. The incidence of metritis is typically 10?20%, with 5?15% of cows having purulent vaginal discharge (PVD), 15?40% having cervicitis approximately 1?month after calving, and 10?30% having cytological endometritis between 1 and 2?months after calving. Endometritis, cervicitis and PVD are distinct conditions, each of which is associated with significantly increased time to pregnancy, and affected cows often have more than one of these conditions. Cumulatively, 35?50% of cows have at least one form of pathological reproductive tract inflammation between 3 and 7?weeks postpartum. It is hypothesized that reproductive tract disease represents a failure of the immune system to switch fast enough or far enough from the down-regulated state necessary for maintenance of pregnancy to a heightened state of function for postpartum clearance of bacteria and tissue debris and then to a ?quiet? state 3?4?weeks later. There are numerous links between fat metabolism, inflammation and immune function, and changes in these precede reproductive tract disease by several weeks. An excessive pro-inflammatory state early in the postpartum period appears to be a key feature of cows with endometritis approximately 1?month later. Generally, worse postpartum negative energy balance (NEB) is associated with more severe or prolonged uterine inflammation. Aspects of both mononuclear cell proliferation and neutrophil oxidative burst are commonly impaired, particularly in association with elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentrations and to a lesser degree by ketosis. In summary, NEB contributes to immune dysfunction which in turn is a major component of reproductive tract inflammatory disease. The factors that initiate and sustain harmful inflammation of the reproductive tract are not yet well quantified.

AB  - Objective To compare indicators of systemic inflammatory response in the second trimester in women who developed pre-eclampsia with normal pregnancies. Design Prospective nested case control study derived from a cohort of 2190 pregnant women. Blood samples were obtained at 18 weeks of gestation. The following inflammatory parameters were measured: tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, IL-10, microCRP and tissue factor (TF). Setting Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Oslo, and Department of Medical Genetics, Ullevål University Hospital and Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aker University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Sample The cases were 71 women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia. The controls were 71 healthy, pregnant women matched for age, parity and first trimester body mass index (BMI). Methods Venous blood was drawn from fasting subjects into 5 mL test tubes containing EDTA. Samples were analysed for inflammatory parameters : IL-1-?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, PAI-1, TF (ELISA-technique) and CRP (latex-enhanced immunonephelometric assay), strictly according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Main outcome measures The matched case and control subjects were compared by the paired two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. All P values were two-tailed and P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results We found no differences in plasma concentrations of PAI-1, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, microCRP, TNF-α or TF at 18 weeks of gestation between women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia and matched control women. Conclusion In contrast to findings from women with overt pre-eclampsia, the present study indicates that there are no indications of intensified systemic inflammatory response at 18 weeks of gestation in women who later develop pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Essentials Coagulation Factor (F) XI is a safe target for the development of antithrombotics. We designed an antigen comprising the human FXI catalytic domain and diphtheria toxin T domain. Antigen immunization reduced plasma FXI activity by 54% and prevented thrombosis in mice. FXI vaccination can serve as an effective strategy for thrombosis prevention. Summary Background Coagulation factor XI serves as a signal amplifier in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Blockade of FXI by mAbs or small-molecule inhibitors inhibits thrombosis without causing severe bleeding, which is an inherent risk of currently available antithrombotic agents. Objectives To design an FXI vaccine and assess its efficacy in inhibiting FXI activity and preventing thrombosis. Methods An FXI antigen was generated by fusing the catalytic domain of human FXI to the C-terminus of the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin. The anti-FXI antibody response, plasma FXI activity and antithrombotic efficacy in mice immunized with the FXI antigen were examined. Results The antigen elicited a significant antibody response against mouse FXI, and reduced the plasma FXI activity by 54.0% in mice. FXI vaccination markedly reduced the levels of coagulation and inflammation in a mouse model of inferior vena cava stenosis. Significant protective effects were also observed in mouse models of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that FXI vaccination can serve as an effective strategy for thrombosis prevention.

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

AB  - Adult multipotent stem/progenitor cells, with remarkable regenerative potential, have been isolated from various components of the human periodontium. These multipotent stem/progenitor cells include the periodontal ligament stem/progenitor cells (PDLSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), the gingival mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (G-MSCs), and the alveolar bone proper stem/progenitor cells (AB-MSCs). Whereas inflammation is regarded as the reason for tissue damage, it also remains a fundamental step of any early healing process. In performing their periodontal tissue regenerative/reparative activity, periodontal stem/progenitor cells interact with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environmental, through their expressed receptors, which could influence their fate and the outcome of any periodontal stem/progenitor cell-mediated reparative/regenerative activity. The present review discusses the current understanding about the interaction of periodontal stem/progenitor cells with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environment, elaborates on the inflammatory factors influencing their stemness, proliferation, migration/homing, differentiation, and immunomodulatory attributes, the possible underlying intracellular mechanisms, as well as their proposed relationship to the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.

AB  - Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major microbial mediator for tissue injury and sepsis resulting from Gram-negative bacterial infection. LPS is an external factor that induces robust expression of serum amyloid A (SAA), a major constituent of the acute-phase proteins, but the relationship between SAA expression and LPS-induced tissue injury remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with inducible transgenic expression of human SAA1 are partially protected against inflammatory response and lung injury caused by LPS and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In comparison, transgenic SAA1 does not attenuate TNFα-induced lung inflammation and injury. The SAA1 expression level correlates inversely with the endotoxin concentrations in serum and lung tissues since SAA1 binds directly to LPS to form a complex that promotes LPS uptake by macrophages. Disruption of the SAA1-LPS interaction with a SAA1-derived peptide partially reduces the protective effect and exacerbates inflammation. These findings demonstrate that acute-phase SAA provides innate feedback protection against LPS-induced inflammation and tissue injury.

AB  - Abstract Patients with critical illness, and in particular sepsis, are now recognized to undergo unifying, pathogenic disturbances of immune function. Whilst scientific and therapeutic focus has traditionally been on understanding and modulating the initial pro-inflammatory limb, recent years have witnessed a refocusing on the development and importance of immunosuppressive 'anti-inflammatory' pathways. Several mechanisms are known to drive this phenomenon; however, no overriding conceptual framework justifies them. In this article we review the contribution of pro-resolution pathways to this phenotype, describing the observed immune alterations in terms of either a failure of resolution of inflammation or the persistence of pro-resolution processes causing inappropriate ?injurious resolution??a novel hypothesis. The dysregulation of key processes in critical illness, including apoptosis of infiltrating neutrophils and their efferocytosis by macrophages, are discussed, along with the emerging role of specialized cell subtypes Gr1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

AB  - Abstract Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a widely used clinical anesthetic with proven anti-inflammatory effects. Both high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and pyroptosis play an important role in the inflammatory response to infection and trauma. Thus far, there have been no studies published addressing the effect of DEX on HMGB1 and pyroptosis. In order to fill this gap in the literature, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were exposed to HMGB1 (4?µg/mL) with or without DEX (50??M) pretreatment. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1? (IL-1?), and IL-18], phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and P38, and the activation of caspase-1 were measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, confocal microscope, and flow cytometry, respectively. We found that DEX protected against HMGB1-induced cell death of BMDMs. In addition, DEX suppressed the generation of TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-18 as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. Moreover, DEX inhibited caspase-1 activation and decreased pyroptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the protective effect of DEX in mediating HMGB1-induced cellular injury, thus indicating that DEX may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of infection and trauma-derived inflammation.

AB  - Hepatic IR (ischemia reperfusion) injury is a commonly encountered obstacle in the post-operative management of hepatic surgery. Hepatic IR occurs during ?Pringle maneuver? for reduction of blood loss or during a brief period of cold storage followed by reperfusion of liver grafts. The stress induced during hepatic IR, triggers a spectrum of cellular responses leading to the varying degrees of hepatic complications which in turn affect the post operative care. Different preconditioning methods either activate or subdue different sets of molecular signals, resulting in varied levels of protection against hepatic IR injury. Yet, there is a serious lacuna in the knowledge regarding the choice of preconditioning methods and the resulting molecular changes in order to assess the efficiency and choice of these methods correctly. This review provides an update on the various preconditioning approaches such as surgical/ischemic, antioxidant, pharmaceutical and genetic preconditioning strategies published during last six years (2009?2015). Further, we discuss the attenuation or inhibition of specific inflammatory, apoptotic and necrotic markers in the various experimental models of liver IR subjected to different preconditioning strategies. While enlisting the controversies in the ischemic preconditioning strategy, we bring out the uncertainties in the existing molecular targets and their reliability in the attenuation of hepatic IR injury. Future research studies would include the novel preconditioning strategies employ i) the targeted gene silencing of key molecular targets inducing IR, ii) hyper expression of beneficial molecular signals against IR via gene transfer techniques. The above studies would see the combination of these latest techniques with the established preconditioning strategies for better post-operative hepatic management.

Over the past few years, there has been a rapid rise in the older segments of the world population, which has brought along with it a major health concern: dementia. Alzheimer?s disease, considered to be the most common cause of dementia, has become a prospect feared by the elderly. Inflammation of the brain is strongly implicated in Alzheimer?s disease which could be enhanced by systemic inflammation. Periodontitis being a chronic inflammatory condition, which can cause systemic inflammation, the question is whether chronic periodontitis can initiate or hasten the rate of progression of Alzheimer?s disease in susceptible individuals. In this article, the authors outline the proposed oral systemic link between periodontitis and Alzheimer?s disease.
