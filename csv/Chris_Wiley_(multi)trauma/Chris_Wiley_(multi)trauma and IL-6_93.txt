AB  - Abstract Tendon/ligament injuries are very common in sports and other rigorous activities. Tendons regenerate and repair slowly and inefficiently in vivo after injury. The limited ability of tendon to self-repair and the general inefficiencies of current treatment regimes have hastened the motivation to develop tissue-engineering strategies for tissue repair. Of particular interest in recent years has been the use of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to regenerate functional tendons and ligaments. Different sources of MSCs have been studied for their effects on tendon repair. However, ectopic bone and tumour formation has been reported in some special circumstances after transplantation of MSCs. The induction of MSCs to differentiate into tendon-forming cells in vitro prior to transplantation is a possible approach to avoid ectopic bone and tumour formation while promoting tendon repair. While there are reports about the factors that might promote tenogenic differentiation, the study of tenogenic differentiation is hampered by the lack of definitive biomarkers for tendons. This review aims to summarize the cell sources currently used for tendon repair as well as their advantages and limitations. Factors affecting tenogenic differentiation were summarized. Molecular markers currently used for assessing tenogenic differentiation or neotendon formation are summarized and their advantages and limitations are commented upon. Finally, further directions for promoting and assessing tenogenic differentiation of stem cells for tendon repair are discussed. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - Cerebral air embolism is a known complication of open-heart surgery with devastating consequences. Neurologic injury after CPB can be divided into 2 types: Type I: Focal injury. Type II: Intellectual deterioration/neurocognitive impairment (up to 53% at the time of hospital discharge and 42% could be impaired for up to 5 years). Increasing evidence points to cerebral embolization as the principal culprit. Since the early days of modern cardiac surgery, surgeons have attempted to limits its damage by various means. One of the early techniques propounded was carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial cavity. Carbon dioxide, was uniquely positioned for this, being denser than air, more soluble than air, and easily managed perioperatively if the blood levels were to go up beyond physiological ranges. The technique gradually went into disuse, since there was no instrumentation, in the early days of CPB to measure and establish its impact on the actual outcomes. Secondly, the devices, through which CO2 was delivered, were not effective. There has been increasing enthusiasm for the technique but no consensus on the technical considerations or on the actual benefits of the practice. Our literature search showed that if practiced properly, carbon dioxide flooding does decrease the embolic counts significantly and that, by inference, could possibly improve the neurocognitive outcome. Since, there are no studies at this point in time, which show a direct beneficial correlation, we intend to do a prospective randomized controlled trial, to put things in proper perspective.

AB  - Abstract: The etiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis ? one of the most common chronic, inflammatory, hyperproliferative skin disorders of man ? have long fascinated dermatologists, pathologists and biologists alike. Here, we have a model disease that offers to study neuroectodermal-mesenchymal interactions in the widest sense possible. Epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells as well as neurons projecting into the skin apparently all interact with each other to generate the characteristic psoriatic lesion. For decades, the ongoing controversy on the molecular nature, choreography and hierarchy of these complex interactions e.g. between epidermal keratinocytes, T cells, neurotrophils, endothelial cells and sensory nerves has served as a driving force propelling investigative dermatology to ever new horizons. This debate has not only been at the heart of our quest to develop more effective forms of therapy for this socially crippling disease, but it also has profoundly influenced how we view the skin as a whole: the numerous competing theories on the pathogenesis of psoriasis published so far also are reflections on the evolution of mainstream thought in skin biology over the last decades. These days, conventional wisdom ? infatuated with a T-cell-centered approach to inflammatory skin diseases ? portrays psoriasis as an autoimmune disease, where misguided T lymphocyte activities cause secondary epithelial abnormalities. And yet, as this CONTROVERSIES feature reminds us, some authoritative ?pockets of academic resistance? are still quite alive, and interpret psoriasis e.g. as a genetically determined, abnormal epithelial response pattern to infectious and/or physicochemical skin insults. Weighing the corresponding lines of argumentation is not only an intriguing, clinically relevant intellectual exercise, but also serves as a wonderful instrument for questioning our own views of the skin universe and its patterns of deviation from a state of homeostasis.
