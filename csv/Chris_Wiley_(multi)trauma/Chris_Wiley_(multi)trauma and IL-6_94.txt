AB  - Summary Over-nutrition and its late consequences are a dominant theme in medicine today. In addition to the health hazards brought on by over-nutrition, the medical community has recently accumulated a roster of health benefits with obesity, grouped under ?obesity paradox.? Throughout the world and throughout history until the 20th century, under-nutrition was a dominant evolutionary force. Under-nutrition brings with it a mix of benefits and detriments that are opposite to and continuous with those of over-nutrition. This continuum yields J-shaped or U-shaped curves relating body mass index to mortality. The overweight have an elevated risk of dying in middle age of degenerative diseases while the underweight are at increased risk of premature death from infectious conditions. Micronutrient deficiencies, major concerns of nutritional science in the 20th century, are being neglected. This ?hidden hunger? is now surprisingly prevalent in all weight groups, even among the overweight. Because micronutrient replacement is safe, inexpensive, and predictably effective, it is now an exceptionally attractive target for therapy across the spectrum of weight and age. Nutrition-related conditions worthy of special attention from caregivers include excess vitamin A, excess vitamin D, and deficiency of magnesium.

AB  - Abstract The murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene exerts major oncogenic activities in human cancers; it is not only the best-documented negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, but also exerts p53-independent activities. There is an increasing interest in developing MDM2-based targeted therapies. Several classes of MDM2 inhibitors have been evaluated in preclinical models, with a few entering clinical trials, mainly for cancer therapy. However, noncarcinogenic roles for MDM2 have also been identified, demonstrating that MDM2 is involved in many chronic diseases and conditions such as inflammation and autoimmune diseases, dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, heart failure and cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy, diabetes, obesity, and sterility. MDM2 inhibitors have been shown to have promising therapeutic efficacy for treating inflammation and other nonmalignant diseases in preclinical evaluations. Therefore, targeting MDM2 may represent a promising approach for treating and preventing these nonmalignant diseases. In addition, a better understanding of how MDM2 works in nonmalignant diseases may provide new biomarkers for their diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and monitoring of therapeutic outcome. In this review article, we pay special attention to the recent findings related to the roles of MDM2 in the pathogenesis of several nonmalignant diseases, the therapeutic potential of its downregulation or inhibition, and its use as a biomarker.

AB  - Abstract Managing pain in horses afflicted by laminitis is often a great challenge because it is the dreadful suffering of the animals that frequently forces the veterinarian to end the battle with this disease. This chapter highlights the mechanisms likely involved in generating and amplifying nociception in laminitis, thereby creating a state of maladaptive pain that is greatly resistant to conventional anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Based on this information, the concept of a multimodal approach to analgesia in the horse with laminitis is presented and targets for drug treatment are discussed. The chapter also discusses anti-hyperalgesic pain therapeutics, anti-neuropathic pain therapeutics, and loco-regional anesthesia. Pain therapy in acute and chronic laminitis has largely been based on the proposed etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease, and consisted predominantly of NSAID administration. Three different pharmacological classes of drugs are commonly administered systemically to treat pain in horses affected with laminitis: NSAIDs, opioids, and lidocaine.

AB  - ?? Introduction: the impaired repair capacity of cartilage and the beginning of cell therapy -? Autologous chondrocyte implantation -? Combination products -? Randomized controlled studies ?? Choice of cell types ?? Regulating cellular activities -? Influence of growth factors on chondrogenic differentiation -? Influence of growth factors on matrix deposition -? Supportive effect of biomaterials ?? Interference of inflammation with cartilage repair ?? Tracking of transplanted cells in vivo ?? Conclusion and future directions Abstract Since the first cell therapeutic study to repair articular cartilage defects in the knee in 1994, several clinical studies have been reported. An overview of the results of clinical studies did not conclusively show improvement over conventional methods, mainly because few studies reach level I of evidence for effects on middle or long term. However, these explorative trials have provided valuable information about study design, mechanisms of repair and clinical outcome and have revealed that much is still unknown and further improvements are required. Furthermore, cellular and molecular studies using new technologies such as cell tracking, gene arrays and proteomics have provided more insight in the cell biology and mechanisms of joint surface regeneration. Besides articular cartilage, cartilage of other anatomical locations as well as progenitor cells are now considered as alternative cell sources. Growth Factor research has revealed some information on optimal conditions to support cartilage repair. Thus, there is hope for improvement. In order to obtain more robust and reproducible results, more detailed information is needed on many aspects including the fate of the cells, choice of cell type and culture parameters. As for the clinical aspects, it becomes clear that careful selection of patient groups is an important input parameter that should be optimized for each application. In addition, the study outcome parameters should be improved. Although reduced pain and improved function are, from the patient's perspective, the most important outcomes, there is a need for more structure/tissue-related outcome measures. Ideally, criteria and/or markers to identify patients at risk and responders to treatment are the ultimate goal for these more sophisticated regenerative approaches in joint surface repair in particular, and regenerative medicine in general.
