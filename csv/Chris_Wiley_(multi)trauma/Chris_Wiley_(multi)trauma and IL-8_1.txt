Acta Neurol Scand: 2010: 122 (Suppl. 190): 51?57. ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objective??? To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of including the fractured vertebra in the short-segment fixation of thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. Methods A total of 32 patients with thoraco-lumbar fractures, selected between August 2013 and February 2016, were managed by short-segment fixation with screws at the level of the fracture, and decompression was performed only for patients with neurological deficits. The patients' functional outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score for neurological condition. All patients were followed up with radiographs. Results Patients with complete neurologic deficits (n = 3) did not show any neurologic recovery. All ASIA B patients improved to ASIA C. Five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA E. The remaining five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA D. All ASIA D patients improved to ASIA B. At the final follow-up examination, the mean anterior vertebral height was 21?±?5?mm, indicating no significant height loss during the follow-up period. Conclusion Short-segment fixation of TL fractures with inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers good correction of segmental kyphosis, vertebral wedging, and vertebral height loss.

AB  - Background In health, the hormones amylin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) slow gastric emptying (GE) and modulate glycaemia. The aims of this study were to determine amylin and GLP-1 concentrations in the critically ill and their relationship with GE, glucose absorption and glycaemia. Methods In fasted critically ill and healthy subjects (n?=?26 and 23 respectively), liquid nutrient, containing 100?mg 13C-sodium octanoate and 3?g 3-O-methlyglucose (3-OMG), was administered via a nasogastric tube. Amylin, GLP-1, glucose and 3-OMG concentrations were measured in blood samples taken during fasting, and 30 min and 60?min after the ?meal?. Breath samples were taken to determine gastric emptying coefficient (GEC). Intolerance to intragastric feeding was defined as a gastric residual volume of ≥?250?ml and/or vomiting within the 24?h prior to the study. Results Although GE was slower (GEC: critically ill 2.8?±?0.9 vs. health, 3.4?±?0.2; P?=?0.002), fasting blood glucose was higher (7.0?±?1.9 vs. 5.7?±?0.2?mmol/l; P?=?0.005) and overall glucose absorption was reduced in critically ill patients (3-OMG: 9.4?±?8.0 vs. 17.7?±?4.9?mmol/l.60?min; P?<?0.001), there were no differences in fasting or postprandial amylin concentrations. Furthermore, although fasting [1.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 0.7 (0.3?32.0)?pmol/l; P?=?0.04] and postprandial [3.0 (0.4?8.5) vs. 0.8 (0.4?34.3)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02] GLP-1 concentrations were increased in the critically ill and were greater in feed intolerant when compared with those tolerating feed [3.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 1.2 (0.7?4.6)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02], there were no relationships between GE and fasting amylin or GLP-1 concentrations. Conclusion In the critically ill, fasting GLP-1, but not amylin, concentrations are elevated and associated with feed intolerance. Neither amylin nor GLP-1 appears to substantially influence the rate of GE.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether a range of cytokines were detectable in the seminal plasma and urine of men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and nonspecific urethritis (NSU), and whether cytokine levels correlated with symptom severity in CP/CPPS. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 87 men participated, 33 with CP/CPPS, 31 with NSU, and 23 controls. Interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were measured in seminal plasma and first pass urine, and the results were correlated with scores for pain, urinary symptoms and quality-of-life impact using a validated symptom index, the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). RESULTS Seminal plasma levels of IL-8 were higher in men with CP/CPPS and NSU than in controls (P?<?0.001), and the levels correlated with NIH-CPSI symptom scores in men with CP/CPPS. There were no significant differences in urinary IL-8 levels in the three groups, and no significant differences in levels of the other cytokines in either semen or urine. CONCLUSION Semen IL-8 levels correlate with subjective symptoms in men with CP/CPPS. IL-8 might contribute to the pathophysiology of CP/CPPS and NSU, and elevated levels might be a useful marker of the condition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between prealbumin, nutrient intake, and indicators of inflammation for recuperative and rehabilitative care patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Recuperative Care Unit within a Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eleven men (100 white; mean age 80, range 64?93). MEASUREMENTS: Prealbumin and seven markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their soluble receptors) were measured at admission and discharge (median length of stay 23 days, interquartile range 15?40 days). Detailed calorie counts were performed daily, and intake was expressed as a percentage of estimated requirements for protein (1.5?g/kg body weight per day) and energy (Harris-Benedict equation). The study objective was examined using least-squares regression analysis. RESULTS: Discharge prealbumin and the change in prealbumin were positively correlated with protein and energy intake and inversely correlated with markers of inflammation, particularly CRP and IL-6. When all covariates were included in a multivariable regression analysis, the markers of inflammation predominantly accounted for the variance in prealbumin change (56%), whereas discharge protein intake accounted for 6%. CONCLUSION: For older recuperative care patients, prealbumin and its change during hospitalization are positively associated with protein intake, but inflammation or changes in inflammation appear to exert a much more-powerful influence on prealbumin concentration. Given the potential confounding effects of inflammation, monitoring the change in prealbumin is not an adequate substitute for a more-detailed nutritional assessment in this population.

Hepatic IL-8 release during graft procurement is associated with impaired graft function after human liver transplantation.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 29?35. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? In experimental models, brain death induces inflammatory cascades, leading to reduced graft survival. Thus far, factors prior to graft preservation have gained less attention in clinical setting. We studied pre-preservation inflammatory response and its effects on graft function in 30 brain dead liver donors and the respective recipients. Before donor graft perfusion, portal and hepatic venous blood samples were drawn for phagocyte adhesion molecule expression and plasma cytokine determinations. Donor intensive care unit stay correlated with donor C-reactive protein (R?=?0.472, p?=?0.013) and IL-6 (R?=?0.419, p?=?0.026) levels, and donor (R?=?0.478, p?=?0.016) and recipient gamma-glutamyl transferase (R?=?0.432, p?=?0.019) levels. During graft procurement, hepatic IL-8 release was observed in 17/30 donors. Grafts with hepatic IL-8 release exhibited subsequently higher alkaline phosphatase [319 (213?405) IU/L vs. 175 (149?208) IU/L, p?=?0.006] and bilirubin [101 (44?139) ?mol/L vs. 30 (23?72) ?mol/L, p?=?0.029] levels after transplantation. Our findings support the concept that inflammatory response in the brain dead organ donor contributes to the development of graft injury in human liver transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of RBC transfusion to adverse patient outcomes is controversial. There is conflicting clinical data and limited biologic data that provide an underpinning biologic rationale for any adverse impacts from RBC transfusion. This study used in-vitro measures of PMN stimulation to determine the ability of supernatant from RBCs to stimulate allogeneic WBCs and to determine the influence of residual donor WBCs and storage time on the proinflammatory potential of RBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Three types of RBCs were assessed: standard non-WBC-reduced RBCs (S-RBCs), buffy coat-poor RBCs (BCP-RBCs), and prestorage WBC-filtered RBC (LF-RBCs). Supernatant was collected weekly up to Day 42 of storage. PMN priming by supernatant from RBCs was determined by three methods: induction of CD11b expression on PMNs, induction of IL-8 release from PMNs, and the chemotactic effect of supernatant on PMNs. RESULTS: Supernatant from S-RBCs induced the expression of CD11b on PMNs, primed PMNs to release IL-8, and was chemotactic for PMNs. The magnitude of this PMN-priming progressively amplified with storage time. In contrast, supernatant from BCP-RBCs or LF-RBCs did not significantly prime PMNs. The PMN-priming effect of supernatant from RBCs correlated more closely with the level of MNCs in the RBCs than PMN content. CONCLUSION: Supernatant from stored S-RBCs prime unstimulated allogeneic PMNs in vitro. Prestorage buffy-coat WBC reduction was as effective as WBC depletion in abrogating this proinflammatory response elicited by supernatants from RBCs. The clinical consequences, if any, of these findings for transfusion recipients are unknown.

AB  - Abstract Background We aim to study the level of inflammatory cytokines in aqueous of post-vitrectomy eyes. Methods Aqueous samples were obtained from post-vitrectomy eyes that underwent cataract surgery. Samples from age-related cataract patients were also collected as controls. The concentrations of cytokines were measured by array-based multiplex sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system and microparticle-based multiplex cytokine assay. Results Eighteen post-vitrectomy eyes from 18 patients were included; all received one vitrectomy with gas injection for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The mean interval between vitrectomy and cataract surgery was 22.33?months (range 6 to 80). Primary results show that in post-vitrectomy eyes the levels of many cytokines, such as B-lymphocyte chemo-attractant, I-309, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, were higher than control. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of IL-8, interferon ??induced protein-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were significantly elevated in post-vitrectomy eyes, even after the subjects were divided by their refractive state. Conclusions The concentrations of some cytokines were increased in the anterior chambers of post-vitrectomy eyes even a long time after vitreous surgery. This surge in post-operative cytokines might cause changing in the micro-environment of the anterior, and this might contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma or fasten the development of cataract in these eyes.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to identify pressure ulcer (PU) incidence and risk factors that are associated with PU development in patients in two adult intensive care units (ICU) in Saudi Arabia. A prospective cohort study design was used. A total of 84 participants were screened second daily basis until discharge or death, over a consecutive 30-day period, out of which 33 participants with new PUs were identified giving a cumulative hospital-acquired PU incidence of 39·3% (33/84 participants). The incidence of medical devices-related PUs was 8·3% (7/84). Age, length of stay in the ICU, history of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, infrequent repositioning, time of operation, emergency admission, mechanical ventilation and lower Braden Scale scores independently predicted the development of a PU. According to binary logistic regression analyses, age, longer stay in ICU and infrequent repositioning were significant predictors of all stages of PUs, while the length of stay in the ICU and infrequent repositioning were associated with the development of stages II?IV PUs. In conclusion, PU incidence rate was higher than that reported in other international studies. This indicates that urgent attention is required for PU prevention strategies in this setting.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Abnormal activation of NF-?B signalling is a major mechanism of apoptosis resistance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Therefore, better understanding of the regulation of NF-?B signalling has a significant impact for GBM therapy. Here, we uncovered a critical role of the small GTPase RND3 in regulating the p65 subunit of NF-?B and NF-?B signalling in GBM. Materials and methods Human GBM samples, GBM cells and a human orthotopic GBM-xenografted animal model were used. The mechanisms of RND3 in regulation of NF-?B signalling and GBM cell apoptosis were examined by luciferase assay, quantitative PCR, immunostaining, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, TUNEL staining, JC-1 analysis and flow cytometry. Results Overexpression of RND3 led to reduced p65 activity in GBM-cultured cells and a GBM animal model, indicating that the NF-?B pathway is negatively regulated by RND3 in GBM. Mechanistically, we found that RND3 bound p65 and promoted p65 ubiquitination, leading to decreased p65 protein levels. Furthermore, RND3 enhanced cleaved caspase 3 levels and promoted apoptosis in GBM cells, and RND3 expression was positively correlated with cleaved caspase 3 and IL-8 in human GBM samples. The effect of RND3 on promoting apoptosis disappeared when p65 ubiquitination was blocked by protease inhibitor carfilzomib or upon co-expression of ectopic p65. Conclusions RND3 binds p65 protein and promotes its ubiquitination, resulting in reduced p65 protein expression and inhibition of NF-?B signalling to induce GBM cell apoptosis.

AB  - Abstract Effective host defense against bacterial invasion is characterized by the vigorous recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, which is dependent on the coordinated expression of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In this review, we present evidence indicating that both C-X-C and C-C chemokines are integral components of antibacterial host defense. Specifically, in vitro studies indicate that C-X-C chemokines [interleukin-8 (IL-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)] and the C-C chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α) augment the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and alveolar macrophages, respectively, to phagocytose and kill Escherichia coli. In addition, the intratracheal instillation of Klebsiella pneumoniae in CD-I mice results in time-dependent production of MIP-2 and MIP-1α, and the inhibition of MIP-2 bioactivity in vivo results in decreases in lung PMN influx, impaired bacterial clearance, and early mortality. Finally, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is also expressed within the lung during the evolution of Klebsiella pneumonia, and neutralization of IL-10 in vivo results in enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production, bacterial clearance, and increases in both short- and long-term survival. In conclusion, our studies indicate that specific chemokines are important mediators of leukocyte recruitment and/or activation in bacterial pneumonia and that the expression of these chemokines is regulated by endogenously produced IL-10.

AB  - Abstract Our objective was to investigate the initiation and course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early inflammatory response and to elucidate the cytokine system in relation to the adrenal response caused by stress. Seven blood samples were collected, pre- and postoperatively (0?72?h) after total hip replacement (THR) due to osteoarthritis. The following cytokines were measured using Cytometric Bead Array: interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 (B Wilcoxon test P?<?0.01) Repeated measurements were also significant (Friedman P?<?0.05). The concentration of IL-8 doubled the day of surgery but did not reach a significant level (Friedman test =0.069). None of the other cytokines showed any significant changes. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was interrupted after the surgery and there was a significant correlation between the cortisol secretion and IL-6 response. This study demonstrates an isolated elevation in IL-6 levels with only a minor elevation in IL-8 following THR. This pro-inflammatory response seemed to decline without activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), but cortisol seemed to play a complicated role in halting the acute inflammatory response.

AB  - Abstract: Cytokines presently known to be involved in systemic bacterial infection are tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) and the counterregulatory molecules soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra). In animal models TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? mediate organ damage, low blood pressure and fatality, whereas IL-6 is involved in infection-related manifestations, like the production of acute-phase protein and fever, and IL-8 is chemotactic to granulocytes. TNF and IL-1 increase expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and influence a number of components of the haemostatic system in favour of coagulation. The presence of cytokines in the circulation is characterized by sequential releases of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6/IL-8; however, many variations of this pattern exist during human infection. In experiments as well as in human infection TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-? have been detected, and levels of TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 have been found to be associated with the severity of the disease. Collectively, TNF, IL-1 and IFN-? emerge as mediators of systemic infection and septic shock whereas IL-6 and IL-8 are related to other manifestations of infection. Counteracting molecules like sTNFR are released after somewhat of a delay following TNF and IL-1Ra is released concomitantly with IL-1. Probably these factors modulate the cytokine effect although their true potency in natural infection has yet to be clarified. In granulocytopenic infections TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 can be detected in scrum, and levels of TNF and IL-6 are even higher than in the normal situation in experimental animals. Antibodies to TNF inhibit bacteria-induced fatality in granulocytopenic mice. Altogether, few data related to the granulocytopenic situation are available. However, it is reasonable to believe that the altered development of granulocytopenic infections is due to changes in the cellular constitution and not to changes in cytokine production.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate whether major abdominal surgery leads to complement activation and interleukin response and whether the kind of anaesthesia influence complement activation and the release of inflammatory interleukins. The study design was prospective and randomised. Fifty patients undergoing open major colorectal surgery due to cancer disease or inflammatory bowel disease were studied. Twenty-five patients were given total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil, and 25 patients were given inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl. To determine complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9) and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins (tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-8, IL-4 and IL-10), blood samples were drawn preoperatively, 60 minutes after start of surgery, 30 minutes after end of surgery and 24 hours postoperatively. Complement was activated and pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-10) were released during major colorectal surgery. There was no significant difference between TIVA and inhalational anaesthesia regarding complement activation and cytokine release. Major colorectal surgery leads to activation of the complement cascade and the release of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There are no significant differences between total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil and inhalational anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl regarding complement activation and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins.

AB  - Abstract Aim Single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) surgery is expanding, but its benefits, efficacy and safety compared with conventional laparoscopic (CL) surgery remain unclear. This pilot study examined clinical outcomes and biochemical markers of inflammation for colorectal resections by SIL and CL in a randomized controlled pilot trial. Method Fifty patients undergoing elective colorectal resection were randomized to either SIL or CL. Primary outcomes were operating time and length of stay (LoS); secondary outcomes included combined length of scars, pain scores, complications, Quality of Life EQ5D-VAS and the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline, 2, 6, 24 and 72 h. Results There was no difference in age, gender, body mass index, indications and site of surgery, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade or incidence of previous surgery between the groups. Except for one conversion from SIL to open surgery, surgery was completed as intended. No difference between SIL and CL was found for operating time [median 130 (72?220) vs 130 (90?317) min, respectively, P = 0.528], LoS [median 4 (3?8) vs 4 (2?19)days, P = 0.888] and time to first flatus [2 (1?4) vs 2 (1?5) days, P = 0.374]. The combined length of scars was significantly shorter for SIL [4 (2?18) vs 7 (5?8) cm, P < 0.001]; in each group, four postoperative complications occurred (16%). Postoperative pain scores were similar [mean 7.67 (interquartile range 4) vs 7.25 (interquartile range 3.75), P = 0.835] to day 3. EQ5D-VAS was no different for both groups at discharge [72.5 (40?90) vs 70 (30?100), P = 0.673] but slightly higher for CL at 3 months [79 (45?100) vs 90 (50?100), P = 0.033].The IL-6, IL-8 and CRP levels between both groups showed similar peaks and no significant differences. Conclusion SIL colorectal surgery by experienced laparoscopic surgeons appears to be safe and equivalent to CL, with no discernible difference in its effect on the physiological response to surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines play a crucial role in tumor initiation and progression. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin (IL)-6 is a key factor by driving tumor progression from benign to malignant, invasive tumors in the HaCaT-model of human skin carcinoma. IL-6 activates STAT3 and directly stimulates proliferation and migration of the benign noninvasive HaCaT-ras A-5 cells in vitro. Furthermore, IL-6 induces a complex, reciprocally regulated cytokine network in the tumor cells that includes inflammatory and angiogenic factors such as IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF and MCP-1. These IL-6 effects lead to tumor cell invasion in organotypic cultures in vitro and to the formation of malignant and invasive s.c. tumors in vivo. Tumor invasion is supported by the IL-6 induced overexpression of MMP-1 in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate a key function of IL-6 in the progression of skin SCCs by regulating a complex cytokine and protease network and suggest new therapeutic approaches to target this central player in skin carcinogenesis.

AB  - Abstract Organs available for solid organ transplantation are mainly procured from brain dead donors. The inflammation associated with brain death may reduce organ quality and increase organ immunogenicity, thus leading to inferior recipient outcome. We hypothesized that the extensive surgical procedure performed during multiorgan procurement enhances the levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers. We measured the levels of 27 cytokines and the terminal complement complex (TCC) in plasma samples from brain dead organ donors (n = 34) drawn before and at three specific time points during procurement surgery. Baseline levels of G-CSF, interferon-?, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), regulated upon activation T cell expressed and secreted, and tumor necrosis factor-α were significantly elevated in brain dead donors compared with normal individuals (n = 14), but they were not associated with time on ventilator or any other registered clinical variable. Notably, the secretion of G-CSF, IL1-ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1?, PDGF, and TCC, the latter reflecting ongoing complement activation, increased significantly during surgery. None of the biomarker increases were correlated with operation duration. Multiorgan procurement surgery significantly adds to the inflammatory response revealed by both pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers associated with brain death. Future studies should determine whether this is associated with inferior recipient outcome.

AB  - Background: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) evokes a systemic inflammatory response involving the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin (iL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Like IL-10, opioids downregulate the immune responses in vivo and in vitro, including the activity of the cytokine-producing monocytes and granulocytes. The proinflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of the hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate if choice of anaesthesia, based on high-dose opioids (fentanyl) versus low-dose opioids influenced the release of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Secondly, it was investigated whether serum amyloid P-component (SAP) is an acute-phase protein in man such as C-reactive protein (CRP), with which it is physically and structurally related. Methods: Sixteen patients submitted to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were randomized to either low-dose opioid anaesthesia consisting of thoracic epidural analgesia combined with inhalational anaesthesia (group I) or high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (group II). From each patient 18 blood samples were taken perioperatively. Cytokine analyses were performed with ELISA, CRP and SAP mere measured with rocket immunoelectrophoresis (REI). Results: Surgery and CPB elicited a marked, transient and almost simultaneous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response with no differences between the groups. The cytokine levels returned to preoperative levels 1?3 d after operation. Anaesthesia and surgery did not affect SAP plasma levels while patients showed a major increase in CRP concentrations preceding the cytokine responses. Conclusion: CABG performed during two different anaesthetic techniques, high-dose fentanyl versus low-dose opioid anaesthesia, elicited a well-defined cytokine response with minor variation in the time course of each cytokine. The cytokine production was not modified by type of anaesthesia. Finally, SAP is not an acute-phase protein in men.
