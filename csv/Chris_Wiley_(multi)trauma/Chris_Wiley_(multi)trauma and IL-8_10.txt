AB  - Introduction:? Early excision and closure is standard for severe burn management. Cadaver skin is generally used as temporary coverage if autograft donor sites are inadequate. However, it is associated with an inherent risk of antigenicity and infection and has a limited shelf life and availability. Use of Integra?, a dermal substitute, is well established for postburn reconstruction, but its efficacy as primary coverage for severe burns it is not well documented. Therefore the aim of the present study was to determine the short- and long-term efficacy of Integra? as an acute cover. Method:? Twenty children with >40 total body surface area (TBSA) burn, were randomized to be grafted with Integra? or with the autograft-allograft technique. Short-term outcome measures such as length of hospital stay, mortality, incidence of infection/sepsis, cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic indexes were compared between and within groups before and after Integra?/graft application. Long-term outcome measures such as number of reconstructive procedures and blinded scar scoring were performed up to 2 years postinjury. Statistical analysis was performed using paired and unpaired t-test. Values are expressed as Mean?±?SEM and significance accepted at p?<?0.05. Results:? There were no significant differences between groups, in burn size (Controls 74?±?4% and Integra? 70?±?5%), mortality (Control 30%, Integra? 40%), length of hospital stay (Control 39?±?4 days, Integra? 41?±?4 days), and metabolic rates. In addition, there was no significant incidence of infection or sepsis in the Integra? group compared to controls. Long-term follow-up (Integra n?=?5, control n?=?5) revealed a significantly improved scar, in terms of height, thickness, vascularity, and maturity, in the Integra? group compared to the control group, at 12 months and 18?24 months postburn, (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Integra? can be safely used for immediate wound coverage in children with severe burns, with better functional and aesthetic outcomes up to 2 years postinjury.

AB  - A prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded study of diabetic foot ulcers was conducted to answer questions of safety and impact on wound healing of a noncontact ultrasound device. Standard of care included moist dressings, debridement, offloading, and adequacy vascular supply for both groups. Patients were randomized to receive a saline mist or 40?KHz ultrasound therapy delivered to the wound bed using the spray as the coupler. The study was 12 weeks in duration or until the wound closed. Sixty-six patients were entered with intent to treat. Fifty-five patients were evaluable and constitute the outcomes of the study. MIST therapy resulted in 42.3% rate of healing versus 14.3% for sham treated significant at 0.028 Chi square. Kaplan Meier survival plots resulted in p?<?0.0087?log rank and p?<?0.011 Wilcoxon. Rate of wound closure was 22% faster with MIST compared to sham treated patients. There was no statistically significant difference with regard to adverse events in any category (mild, moderate, or severe) MIST ultrasound therapy is a new, safe, novel FDA-cleared device that improves diabetic foot ulcer healing compared to standard of care. Details of the study will be presented. Acknowledgments:? This study was funded by Celleration Inc. Eden Prairie, MN.

AB  - Introduction:? Cyclophilin C-associated protein (CyC-AP) expression is up-regulated during wound healing. CyC-AP deletion causes greater expression of TNFα, MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14 during cutaneous repair. Furthermore, CyC-AP is a mediator for fibronectin-fragment induced MMP-13 expression. In order to understand the effects of the deletion of CyC-AP at the cellular level, we investigated the intracellular signal transduction pathways of CyC-AP null and wild-type mice during skin wound healing. Methods:? Two-month-old CyC-AP null or wild-type mice were anesthetized and two 0.6?cm diameter excisional skin wounds were made on the dorsum of each mouse. Wounds were collected up to 10 days after injury. Total protein was purified from each wound and the protein expression of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE), integrin beta 1, ERK 1, ERK 2, p38, PCNA, and smooth muscle actin (sm-actin) was analyzed by immunoblot. Results:? TNFα expression was higher in CyC-AP null mice in unwounded skin. However, the elevated TNFα in CyC-AP null wounds was lower compared to the wild-type mice. To further understand the relationship of CyC-AP and TNFα, TACE expression was examined. TACE expression was less in the skin of CyC-AP null mice compared to wild-type mice. Expression of p38 and PCNA increased while sm-actin decreased in both unwounded and wounded CyC-AP null skin compared to wild type. PCNA expression in CyC-AP null fibroblasts was also higher compared to wild type, supporting our in vivo observations. In addition, the expression of integrin beta 1 was lower during wound healing. Conclusion:? The increased PCNA and decreased sm-actin expression suggests that CyC-AP null fibroblasts have higher proliferation and lower differentiation rates compared to wild types. These effects might be regulated through the p38 signaling pathway, which was increased in CyC-AP null mice. The decreased TACE expression in CyC-AP null skin suggests CyC-AP may also regulate TACE via the altered expression of integrin beta 1. Our data suggest CyC-AP is involved in TNFα activation.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that cyclic mechanical stretching exerts anti-inflammatory effects on rabbit chondrocytes. But whether mechanical stretching has similar effects on human tendon fibroblasts are not known. This study therefore aimed to test the hypothesis that cyclic mechanical stretching regulates IL-1? induced COX-2 gene expression in a stretching magnitude-dependent manner. In custom-made silicone dishes, human patellar tendon fibroblasts (HPTFs) were grown on microgrooved culture surfaces, with which the shape and organization of HPTFs in vivo were closely mimicked. To induce inflammatory responses in HPTFs, 10?pM of IL-1? was added to the culture medium. A 4% or 8% cyclic uniaxial stretching was then applied to silicone dishes for 4?hrs using a custom-design stretching apparatus. After the end of stretching, total RNA of stretched and nonstretched tendon fibroblasts was collected, and RT-PCR was performed for measuring COX-2?mRNA expression levels. We found that tendon fibroblasts subjected to 4% stretching decreased COX-2?mRNA expression level by 20%(p?=?0.0002; n?=?6) compared to that of nonstretched, IL-1?-treated cells. However, cells subjected to 8% stretching showed a 39% increase (p?=?0.007, n?=?6) in COX-2?mRNA expression. Thus, the results of this study suggest that small stretching (4%) has anti-inflammatory effects on HPTFs in a mildly inflammatory environment such as that induced by 10?pM of IL-1?. In contrast, large stretching (8%) may amplify inflammatory responses of tendon fibroblasts. Therefore, physical therapy with low levels of tendon stretching may be beneficial in reducing mild tendon inflammation. Supported by the Arthritis Investigator Award and NIHAR049921 (JHW)

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) continue to present a formidable challenge in terms of morbidity and healthcare costs. Increasing evidence ascertains the important role of Matrix Metallo-Proteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors TIMPS in wound healing. Imbalance of MMPs in the DFU microenvironment has been associated with poor wound healing. Current research is directed toward therapeutic agents that could redress the imbalance of MMPs?/?TIMPs. Polyhydrated Ionogens (PHIs) formulation is based on metallic ions and citric acid. PHI application aims to positively restore MMP ratios within chronic wounds. This initial multicenter pilot study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the PHI formulation in achieving stable wound closure in recalcitrant DFUs. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients with therapy resistant DFUs of at least 2?cm2 and 3 months duration were treated with PHI formulation in an acetate carrier dressing. Wound debridement, digital imaging, and wound perimeter tracing were performed weekly. Serum samples and punch biopsies were taken from random ulcers for quantitative MMP/TIMP analysis at three time points to assess feasibility of this method. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Results:? Stable wound closure with high patient satisfaction was achieved in 15 (75%) DFUs. MMP/TIMP ratios within different healing phases were delineated. Discussion:? This pilot study?s encouraging results prompt us to further investigate the PHI efficacy in DFU treatment in a Web-based, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

AB  - We are studying in the role of endogenous electric fields in mammalian skin wound healing. The epidermis generates a transepithelial potential (TEP) of 20?50?mV across itself, inside positive. Any wound or break in the epidermis creates a low resistance pathway and the TEP at the wound site is 0?mV. However, the TEP of the intact epidermis around the wound is still present, resulting in a lateral voltage gradient or electric field along the skin surrounding the wound. We have evidence that this lateral electric field stimulates keratinocytes in the area to migrate towards the wound with the optimal response occurring at a field strength of 100?mV/mm. In order to determine the actual field strength present in mammalian wounds, we have developed a new instrument called the Bioelectric Field Imager (BFI). The BFI vibrates a small sensor perpendicular to the skin about 200??m above the surface and uses the capacitance signal to determine the surface potential of the epidermis just beneath the stratum corneum. By measuring this surface potential in many positions around the wound, we generate a spatial map of the surrounding electric field. We have measured the wound field near a 1?mm long, full thickness skin wound in mice. A field of 100?200?mV/mm is present immediately following wounding and persists until wound healing is complete. The topical application of a blocker of Na+ channels (amiloride) reduces this wound field by about 50%, supporting the hypothesis that it is generated by the TEP. Preliminary measurements on human skin wounds detect lateral electric fields that are similar to those measured in mice. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Tissue repair and wound healing are complex processes that involve inflammation, granulation, and tissue remodeling. Angiogenesis plays a central role in wound healing. Previously, we have shown that picroliv, a natural product obtained from the roots of Picrorhiza kurrooa upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and insulin like growth factor (IGF) in rats during hypoxia (Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 1999; 56: 348?55). In the present study, we have investigated the effect of Picroliv in an ex vivo rat aorta ring model of angiogenesis. Picroliv enhanced the sprouting and migration of endothelial cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of picroliv in both unimpaired and dexamethasone (DX)-induced impaired cutaneous healing in a full thickness punch wound model in rats. The animals in the impaired healing group having been pretreated with DX. We studied the tissues by histology and morphometry. The data showed picroliv treatment resulted in improved reepithelialization, neovascularization, and migration of various cells such as endothelial, dermal myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts into the wound bed. Immunohistochemical localization showed an increased VEGF and alpha smooth muscle actin staining consistent with increased number of micro vessels in granulation tissue. These findings suggest that picroliv accelerated wound repair and thus could be developed as a therapeutic angiogenic agent for the wound healing.

AB  - Electrospinning is a nonmechanical processing strategy that is used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of submicron diameter, banded fibrils of collagen. In biocompatibility tests these fibers are nonimmunogenic. Fiber diameter can be manipulated over a wide range by regulating the concentration of collagen present in the starting electrospinning solutions. Table 1 illustrates average fiber diameters and pore dimensions achieved under different conditions.

Electrospun scaffolds composed of different fiber diameters were cut to fit the defects, sutured in place and then recovered at 7 and 14 days. Injuries treated with scaffolds composed of electrospun collagen fibers greater than 300?nm in diameter exhibited extensive tongue formation, dense dermal cell infiltration and functional capillary beds. Dermal regeneration was substantially complete by 14 days. Scaffolds prepared with individual fiber diameters of less than 300?nm were well epithelialized but, less densely 'populated by dermal fibroblasts and capillaries. Fibrils of electrospun gelatin, a collagen isolate that is heat denatured prior to electrospinning, lack the banded appearance of electrospun collagen. Scaffolds of electrospun gelatin were less densely infiltrated than electrospun collagen at all fiber diameters and pore dimensions, and induced inflammation. We conclude that banded fibrils of electrospun collagen have unique biological activity. Funded in part NIH R01 EB003087. US & International Patents Issued and Pending.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars can be reduced by application of silicone dressing; however, the detailed mechanism of silicone action is still unknown. It is known that silicone gel sheets cause a hydration of the epidermal layer of the skin. An in vitro coculture experiment has shown that hydration of keratinocytes has a suppressive effect on the metabolism of the underlying fibroblasts resulting in reduced collagen deposition. We tested the hypothesis that silicone gel sheeting in vivo has a beneficial effect on scar reduction by a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation, with a resulting reduction in dermal thickness. Silicone adhesive gel sheets were applied to scars in our rabbit ear model of hypertrophic scarring 14 days post wounding for a total of 14 days. Scarring was measured in this model by the Scar Elevation Index (SEI), a ratio of the scar height over normal skin, and the Epidermal Thickness Index (ETI), a ratio of the epidermal height of the scar over normal epidermis. Ultrastructural changes were investigated using electron microscopy (EM). SEIs were significantly reduced after only 2-week applications of silicone gel sheets versus untreated scars (1.18?±?0.05 vs. 1.45?±?0.09, respectively; P?<?0.05)? corresponding to a 48.8% reduction of scar hypertrophy. The epidermal layer in scars was in general thicker than in unwounded skin. However, ETIs of untreated scars increased by 103% versus 71% after silicone gel treatment ? corresponding to a significant reduction of epidermal thickness by 24.4%. EM showed a basal layer in untreated scars that was very different than normal skin with many vacuoles at the basement membrane level, while silicone gel-treated scars had a basal cell layer which resembled unwounded epidermis. Our findings demonstrate that 2 weeks of silicone gel application at a very early onset of scarring reduces dermal thickness which appears to be due to a reduction in keratinocyte stimulation. These findings are consistent with our coculture results.

AB  - Fibroblasts from a healing ligament likely have differential phenotypical expression from those in an intact ligament, because fibroblasts at the healing site need to repair/regenerate the wounded matrix around them caused by injury, whereas normal fibroblasts just maintain an intact matrix. This study was designed to determine the differences in proliferation, collagen production, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, and contraction between healing and normal fibroblasts. Transected and sham-operated rat medial collateral ligaments (MCL) were used to obtain healing and normal fibroblasts, respectively. It was noted that healing and normal MCL fibroblasts in culture were seen to have a similar morphology. However, healing fibroblasts in monolayer culture proliferated 1.4-fold faster at 48 hours and had 1.7-fold greater protein expression of α-SMA than normal fibroblasts. In addition, it was noted that the proliferation of healing fibroblasts in collagen gels was not significantly different from that of normal fibroblasts at 24 hours, but it was at 48 hours. Furthermore, in collagen gels, healing fibroblasts produced 10% more type I collagen than normal fibroblasts and generated 1.6- and 1.7-fold larger contractile forces at 15 and 20 hours, respectively, than their normal counterparts. Taken together, the results of this study show that healing fibroblasts possess a differential proliferation, α-SMA protein expression, and contraction than normal fibroblasts. This study also highlights the importance of using healing fibroblasts to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ligament healing.

AB  - Electrospinning is a nonmechanical processing strategy that is used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of submicron diameter, banded fibrils of collagen.

Electrospun scaffolds were prepared, cut into disks (150?300 microns thick), seeded with human microvascular endothelial cells and recovered at intervals. Varying fiber diameter from 100 to 2000?nm induced the expression of three distinct phenotypes. Scaffolds composed of fibers less than 300?nm in diameter exhibited a confluent layer of flat, stellate-shaped cells at all time points. The bulk of the cells were confined to the scaffold surface. At intermediate fiber diameters (300?nm?900?nm) the cells displayed a more rounded cell shape. By day 3 aggregates of these cells were clustered throughout scaffold in a capillary-like pattern. In scaffolds prepared with large diameter fibers (>1000?nm) the cells displayed an elongated, fusiform cell-shape and appeared to be uniformly scattered throughout the scaffold. These results parallel our in vivo studies that suggest fiber diameters of less than 300?nm reduce, but do not completely suppress, the infiltration of endothelial cells in a full thickness dermal injury model in the guinea pig.

AB  - The Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) system has been characterized as the principal tissue level response to hypoxia. Posttranslational regulation of HIF-1alpha has been reported to act though a Hypoxia Responsive Element (HRE) promoter region on a range of hypoxia-induced genes. A plasmid was constructed consisting of a fivefold HRE repeat conjugated to a luciferase gene, used as a marker for HRE activation. Plasmid HRE-luciferase was then transfected into a well-established ischemic rabbit ear wound healing model. Ischemia was induced using a variety of published models for interruption of arterial inflow and compared with a nonischemic control. Central artery, caudal artery and rostrocaudal artery models were tested for induction of ischemia. Tissue specimens were harvested from the transfected areas and solubilized. Luminescence of each specimen was measured using a standard luminometer to quantify luciferase induction. To provide correlation on a regional level, tissue level oxygen tension was measured directly for each wound model. Profound and statistically significant differences were found in the induced luciferase production. Marked differences in the tissue hypoxia between the various ischemic wound healing models correlated in graded fashion with the ischemia induced on an anatomic basis. The least ischemic model showed no significant difference in hypoxia readings versus control. The intermediate model showed a significant fourfold greater ischemia signaling. The most ischemic model showed a highly significant 72-fold greater ischemic response compared to controls. The use of gene transfection is described as a sensitive and effective method for quantification of tissue hypoxia at a cellular level in ischemic wounds. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Abstract Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used for most severe acute respiratory distress syndrome cases in specialized centers. Hemocompatibility of devices depends on the size and modification of blood contacting surfaces as well as blood flow rates. An interventional lung assist using arteriovenous perfusion of a low-resistance oxygenator without a blood pump (Novalung, Hechingen, Germany) or a miniaturized ECMO with reduced filling volume and a diagonal blood pump (Deltastream, Medos AG, Stolberg, Germany) could optimize hemocompatibility. The aim of the study was to compare hemocompatibility with conventional ECMO. Female pigs were connected to extracorporeal circulation for 24?h after lavage induced lung injury (eight per group). Activation of coagulation and immune system as well as blood cell damage was measured. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. Plasmatic coagulation was slightly activated in all groups demonstrated by increased thrombin-anti-thrombin III-complex. No clinical signs of bleeding or thromboembolism occurred. Thrombelastography revealed decreased clotting capacities after miniaturized ECMO, probably due to significantly reduced platelet count. These resulted in reduced dosage of intravenous heparin. Scanning electron microscopy of oxygenator fibers showed significantly increased binding and shape change of platelets after interventional lung assist. In all groups, hemolysis remained negligible, indicated by low plasma hemoglobin concentration. Interleukin 8 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentration as well as leukocyte count remained unchanged. Both devices demonstrated adequate hemocompatibility for safe clinical application, although a missing blood pump did not increase hemocompatibility. Further studies seem necessary to analyze the influence of different blood pumps on platelet drop systematically.

AB  - Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common and poses a significant problem in high-risk populations. In most cases, ICD resolves despite continued exposure in a process known as ?hardening?, allowing individuals to continue with their work. Those who cannot clear ICD develop chronic ICD, which is a significant source of emotional, physical, and financial distress for affected individuals. While hardening is well known among labourers and clinicians, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much can be learned from the study of self-healing processes like the hardening phenomenon. This overview briefly documents the pathogenesis of ICD, focuses on the latest advances pertaining to the hardening phenomenon in ICD, and then highlights potential avenues of productive research. A better understanding of the ?hardening? process in the skin will hopefully lead to advances for the treatment of ICD.

AB  - ABSTRACT Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in renal transplant recipients. Frequency of UTIs depend on many factors such as age, female gender, kidney function, co-morbidity, type and amount of immunosuppression, urological instrumentation and/or the follow-up period (short term or long term) after kidney transplantation. UTI may worsen graft and patient survival. A significant proportion of renal transplant recipients with UTIs may develop acute pyelonephritis (APN), which is an independent risk factor for deterioration of graft function. Renal transplant recipients with UTIs are often clinically asymptomatic as a consequence of immunosuppression. UTI, however, may progress to APN (particularly in the early post-transplant period), bacteraemia and the full blown picture of urosepsis. Strategies for long term prophylaxis and antimicrobial treatment of UTI in renal transplant recipients are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bone is one of the most transplanted tissues. While most bone defects heal spontaneously, critical size defects caused by major trauma/malignant tumor and osteonecrosis of femoral head in young adults pose a great challenge in treatment. While the golden standard in treating bone defects is autologous bone grafting, available bone for grafting is quite limited in an individual. To solve the dilemma, stem cell therapy has been tried as a new modality of treatment in lesions not amenable to autologous bone grafting. While successful results were reported from individual studies, the stem cell therapy is still not an established treatment modality for bone regeneration and needs further assessment. Our focus herein is to introduce stem cell sources that have been investigated so far and review the current status of stem cell reutilization for bone regeneration as well as suggesting future perspectives.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non-specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. In addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. This short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non-structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. Multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. Today, the term ?cytokine? encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. As of this writing, 33?cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. There are certainly over 100?separate genes coding for cytokine-like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. Also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. A recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being ?autoimmune? or ?autoinflammatory? thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.
