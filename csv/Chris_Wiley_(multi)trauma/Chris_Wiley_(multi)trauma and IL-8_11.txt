AB  - Abstract The intranuclear architectural protein that is termed high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) was recently identified as a potent proinflammatory mediator when present extracellularly. HMGB1 has been demonstrated to be a long-searched-for nuclear danger signal passively released by necrotic, as opposed to apoptotic, cells that will induce inflammation. Furthermore, HMGB1 can also be actively secreted by stimulated macrophages or monocytes in a process requiring acetylation of the molecule, which enables translocation from the nucleus to secretory lysosomes. Subsequenttransport out of the cells depends on a secretion signal mediated by either extracellular lysophophatidyl-choline or ATP. HMGB1 passively released from necrotic cells and HMGB1 actively secreted byinflammatory cells are thus molecularly different. Extracellular HMGB1 acts as a cytokine by signaling via the receptor for advanced glycated end-products and via members of the Toll-like receptor family. The initiated inflammatory responses include the production of multiple cytokines, chemoattraction of certain stem cells, induction of vascular adhesion molecules and impaired function of intestinalepithelial cells. Therapeutic administration of HMGB1 antagonists rescues mice from lethal sepsis, even when initial treatment is delayed for 24?h after the onset of infection, establishing a clinically relevant therapeutic window that is significantly wider than for other known cytokines.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate extended release (XR) in the treatment of Korean subjects with acute schizophrenia. Methods This was an 8-week, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine fumarate XR at a daily dose of 400?800?mg. Changes in total scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week?8 were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine XR. Additionally, the Clinical Global Impression scale and the Montgomery?Åsberg Depression Rating Scale were administered. Results The mean change in PANSS total scores was ?26.8, and the mean PANSS total score at the endpoint was significantly lower than that at baseline. The mean PANSS positive score, negative score, and general score showed statistically significant reductions at the end of the study. Statistically significant changes were also observed in Clinical Global Impression-Severity and Montgomery?Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. The most common treatment-related adverse events in the group receiving quetiapine XR were sedation (10.6%) and constipation (9.6%). Conclusions In this study of Korean patients with acute schizophrenia, quetiapine XR showed clinical efficacy and relatively good tolerability. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Conventional heart rate variability (HRV) indices comprise time domain and frequency domain HRV indices that not only reflect the autonomic control of the heart but also serve as prognostic markers of various cardiovascular disorders. These indices have been extensively investigated as prognostic factors for patients who develop coronary artery diseases including myocardial infarction (MI). Non-linear indices of HRV such as the long (?)- and short (α1 and ?2)-term fractal component indices and approximate entropy analysis have been clinically applied. In addition, heart rate turbulence (HRT) and the deceleration capacity (DC) of heart rate have been studied as potential HRV indices for predicting untoward outcomes of cardiovascular diseases. This overview examines HRV indices and their roles in the setting of cardiovascular disorders including sudden cardiac death. We describe changes in HRV indices and clarify the relationship between prognosis and the indices in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Abstract? Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a physiological gas found at low levels in the atmosphere and produced in cells during the process of aerobic respiration. Consequently, the levels of CO2 within tissues are usually significantly higher than those found externally. Shifts in tissue levels of CO2 (leading to either hypercapnia or hypocapnia) are associated with a number of pathophysiological conditions in humans and can occur naturally in niche habitats such as those of burrowing animals. Clinical studies have indicated that such altered CO2 levels can impact upon disease progression. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CO2 has shown that like other physiological gases such as molecular oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO), CO2 levels can be sensed by cells resulting in the initiation of physiological and pathophysiological responses. Acute CO2 sensing in neurons and peripheral and central chemoreceptors is important in rapidly activated responses including olfactory signalling, taste sensation and cardiorespiratory control. Furthermore, a role for CO2 in the regulation of gene transcription has recently been identified with exposure of cells and model organisms to high CO2 leading to suppression of genes involved in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation. This latter, transcriptional regulatory role for CO2, has been largely attributed to altered activity of the NF-?B family of transcription factors. Here, we review our evolving understanding of how CO2 impacts upon gene transcription.

In the first part of the chapter, the design, synthesis and chemical functionalization of RNTs with amino acid residues, peptides and other organic and inorganic moieties are highlighted. Their stability and physical properties are next examined, followed by in vivo and in vitro toxicity and biocompatibility studies. Finally, RNT applications in bone tissue engineering and in drug delivery are described. In the case of the former, this includes RNTs as 2D coatings on Ti implant materials, as well as their incorporation within currently used pHEMA hydrogels for enhanced bone cell adhesion and growth.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 112, 1415?1430. Abstract Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease increasingly recognized as one of the most important medical problems affecting the elderly. Although a number of drugs, including several cholinesterase inhibitors and an NMDA receptor antagonist, have been approved for use, they have been shown to produce diverse side effects and yield relatively modest benefits. To overcome these limitations of current therapeutics for AD, extensive research and development are underway to identify drugs that are effective and free of undesirable side effects. Certain naturally occurring dietary polyphenolic phytochemicals have received considerable recent attention as alternative candidates for AD therapy. In particular, curcumin, resveratrol, and green tea catechins have been suggested to have the potential to prevent AD because of their anti-amyloidogenic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties. These polyphenolic phytochemicals also activate adaptive cellular stress responses, called ?neurohormesis?, and suppress disease processes. In this commentary, we describe the amyloid-?-induced pathogenesis of AD, and summarize the intracellular and molecular targets of selected dietary phytochemicals that might slow the progression of AD.

AB  - Abstract Blood vessel injury results in limited oxygen tension and diffusion leading to hypoxia, increased anaerobic metabolism, and elevated production of acidic metabolites that cannot be easily removed due to the reduced blood flow. Therefore, an acidic extracellular pH occurs in the local microenvironment of disrupted bone. The potential role of acidic pH and glu-leu-arg (ELR+) CXC chemokines in early events in bone repair was studied in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) treated with medium of decreasing pH (7.4, 7.0, 6.7, and 6.4). The cells showed a reciprocal increase in CXCL8 (interleukin-8, IL-8) mRNA levels as extracellular pH decreased. At pH 6.4, CXCL8 mRNA was induced >60? in comparison to levels at pH 7.4. hMSCs treated with osteogenic medium (OGM) also showed an increase in CXCL8 mRNA with decreasing pH; although, at a lower level than that seen in cells grown in non-OGM. CXCL8 protein was secreted into the medium at all pHs with maximal induction at pH 6.7. Inhibition of the G-protein-coupled receptor alpha, Gαi, suppressed CXCL8 levels in response to acidic pH; whereas phospholipase C inhibition had no effect on CXCL8. The use of specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction inhibitors indicated that the pH-dependent increase in CXCL8 mRNA is due to activation of ERK and p38 pathways. The JNK pathway was not involved. NF-?B inhibition resulted in a decrease in CXCL8 levels in hMSCs grown in non-OGM. However, OGM-differentiated hMSCs showed an increase in CXCL8 levels when treated with the NF-?B inhibitor PDTC, a pyrrolidine derivative of dithiocarbamate. J. Cell.

AB  - Research on abnormal scarring, such as excessive scars, has been hampered by the lack of relevant animal models. Recent studies suggest that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 are stimulators of fibrosis or scarring. We developed a rabbit ear cutaneous excessive scarring model using the growth factor stimulators TGF-?1 (0.25, 0.5 or 1??g per wound), PDGF-BB (1, 2 or 3??g per wound) and FGF-2 (0.5, 1, 3 or 5??g per wound). Three 8-mm diameter wounds were created on each ear in NZW rabbits (n?=?6 wounds). The test growth factors were injected intradermally immediately after wounding. Controls consisted of PBS, BSA and wounding only without injections. Scar thickness of wounds was measured with a micrometer at days 14 and continued twice a week thereafter until sacrifice at day 28. Results showed that the greatest measurement of elevated scars was observed at day 14. Significant differences of scar thickness were observed in TGF-?1 at a dose of 0.25??g, PDGF-BB at a dose of 3??g, and FGF-2 at a dose of 3??g per wound groups when compared to PBS and wounding only groups (p?<?0.05). Interestingly, BSA, a protein stabilizer for TGF-?1 and FGF-2 proteins, also significantly elevated scar thickness at day 14 over PBS alone (p?<?0.05). Trichrome stained tissue sections on day 28 showed an increase in cellularity and thicker epithelium in all doses of TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 protein treated groups when compared to wounding only, PBS or BSA treatments. In general, FGF-2 treated wounds showed more vascularity than TGF-?1 and PDGF-BB treated wounds. By contrast, PDGF-BB treated wounds showed richer collagen deposition than TGF-?1 and FGF-2 treated wounds. Results from these studies demonstrated that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 contributed to the scar formation in the rabbit ear scar model. BSA may contribute in stimulating scar formation in the early stage of wound healing in this model. Enhancing elevated scar formation in the rabbit ear model will be useful in evaluating anti-scarring agents for excessive scars such as hypertrophic scars and keloids.

AB  - The complexity of cellular and molecular events that occur during wound healing is given by the rapid and continuous changes of matrix structure, cell population, local cytokine composition, nutrient and oxygen availabilities and overall metabolic activity. Angiogenesis is an essential event in the repair of injured tissue. Transcriptional events leading to wound neovascularization begin immediately after the injury has occurred and continue throughout the process until scar remodeling becomes quiescent. This study investigated progression of wound angiogenesis by quantitatively measuring transcripts of multiple genes that participate in wound angiogenesis. The studies were done using a murine model of bilateral 3?mm excision wounds. Wound tissues were collected from 6 hours up to 10 days post-wounding. Each time point consisted of 8 wounds pooled from four different mice. After RNA purification, the samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probe/primer sets for selected transcripts that included the following groups: a) angiogenic factors; b) anti-angiogenic factors; c) receptors; d) cytokines and enzymes; e) matrix proteins; f) signaling molecules and transcription factors; g) apoptosis and proliferation markers; and h) housekeeping genes. A total of 58 genes were profiled including four housekeeping genes. The transcripts revealed several patterns of expression. Some genes such as angiopoietin 1(Ang1), e-selecting, placental growth factor (PlGF), MMP-9 and thrombospondin 1(TSP1) had a clear biphasic pattern where early peaks were detected within the first 24 hours after wounding and were followed by dowregulation and a second increase in transcription after several days. Other transcripts appeared early and had a sustained expression and they include fibroblast growth factor two (FGF2), FGF7, hypoxia inducile factor alpha (HIF-1a) and STAT3. Examples of late transcripts included HOXD3 and alpha smooth muscle actin. Results derived from this study largely confirm previous studies profiling a small number of individual genes such as VEGF, TSP1 and 2 and others. However, the present study integrates complete transcriptional profiles of large number of genes known to have a critical role in healing progression with a particular emphasis on revascularization. A more detailed model of event sequences that lead to tissue reperfusion after injury is derived from the results.

AB  - Many silver-dressings have been recently developed to prevent infection of burn and chronic wounds. Antimicrobial therapies are usually studied in in-vitro assays, which evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy against free-floating bacteria. In a wound environment bacteria attach to tissues and establish bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are communities of colonies of bacteria and other microorganisms encased in a self produced exopolymeric substance. Biofilms help protect the bacteria from the environment and limit the effectiveness of antimicrobials. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of two silver dressings to eradicate biofilm-associated and planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells using our biofilm burn wound animal model. Three pigs were used in this study. Second-degree burn wounds were made on one-half of the animal?s back and inoculated with a burn wound isolate of P. aeruginosa. These wounds were then covered for 72 hours with a polyurethane dressing to allow biofilm formation. After 72 hours, additional burn wounds were made on the unwounded half of the animal. The new burns were then inoculated with the same P. aeruginosa strain. At this 72 hour point we had established two bacterial groups, one side of the animal had burns with planktonic bacteria and the other half with biofilm bacteria. Both sides of the animal were treated 20 minutes after inoculation of the planktonic group with the following dressings: 1) Nanocrystalline Silver, 2) Hydrocolloid Silver, or 3) untreated. Wounds were cultured from all treatment groups at 24, 48 and 72 hours post treatment. Sites were cultured quantitatively using a novel flush-scrub technique to obtain both planktonic and biofilm bacterial counts. The baseline biofilm bacterial count was 7.56 LogCFU/ml (prior to treatment). The hydrocolloid dressing significantly reduced planktonic bacteria counts as compared to untreated and nanocrystalline silver dressing at 24, 48 and 72 hours. However, biofilm bacteria counts for both dressings were similar to untreated control at all sample points. Our study demonstrates that both silver dressings showed limited effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated cells when compared to untreated wounds. Based on our results we question the effectiveness of silver dressings for infected wounds that are colonized with biofilm associated-cells. We conclude that anti-biofilm susceptibility models may improve on current antimicrobial sensitivity assays.

AB  - Biofilms are a combination of microorganisms and extrapolysaccharide matrices. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that biofilms are present in both acute and chronic wounds. Once biofilms are established, phagocytosis and diffusion of antibiotics are impaired thus contributing to antimicrobial resistance due to increased bacterial virulence. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of two topical antimicrobial agents on partial thickness wounds containing Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. All wounds were inoculated with 106?CFU/ml and covered for 48 hrs under a polyurthene film to promote biofilm formation. Wounds were divided into three treatment groups; triple antibiotic ointment (Polymyxin B sulfate, bacitracin zinc, neomycin), mupirocin cream and untreated control. Wounds were treated twice daily. Wounds were cultured for bacterial quantitation at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120?hrs. Significant reduction in CFU/ml was observed only after several days of treatments. This finding supports the antimicrobial resistance that occurs when bacteria live within biofilms. Our previous studies demonstrated that both of these agents were able to completely eliminate planktonic S. aureus(106) at the early time points. This study demonstrates that when bacterial biofilms are established in wounds there is a longer response time for topical antimicrobial activity suggesting bacterial resistance.

AB  - The inflammatory events of atherosclerosis involve monocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and several cytokines, including chemokines. Atherosclerosis begins with recruitment of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel injury. In the vessel wall, these cells are activated to become macrophages that scavenge toxic material such as oxidized LDL and transition into ?foam cells? which will eventually lead to plaque formation. Tobacco smoke is known to exacerbate cardiovascular disease but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known. The chemokine MCP-1 is involved in recruiting monocytes to the injured blood vessel wall and is commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. Our data show that both ?first-hand? and ?second-hand? cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 production in cultured primary human aortic endothelial cells (EC), suggesting that cigarette smoke may contribute to plaque formation by stimulating aortic EC to produce MCP-1 in blood vessels after smoke injury. To test whether MCP-1 links smoking and cardiovascular disease, we are studying the expression of this molecule in mice that are either transgenic for human ApoB or are null for MCP-1 or its receptor, CCR2, by exposing the mice to smoke in a way that closely resembles human smoking. Blood samples from the mice were tested for carboxyhemoglobin, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and MCP-1 at successive weeks after initiation of smoking and the aortas isolated to analyze for plaque size and MCP-1 expression in the tissue. The carboxyhemoglobin test shows that the mice are exposed to smoke. Plasma MCP-1 and HDL levels are reduced in the smoking groups, whereas LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol remain unchanged. On one hand, the decrease in circulating HDL levels suggests that the reason smokers develop atherosclerosis may be because the rate of cholesterol clearance is slowed down. On the other hand, a decrease in circulating MCP-1 level may reflect that this chemokine accumulates in blood vessel walls, conferring stronger ability for attraction of monocytes.
