AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scar is a devastating sequel to burns and other tangential skin injuries. It follows deep dermal injuries and does not occur after superficial injuries. Nitric oxide (NO) plays many important roles in wound healing from inflammation to scar remodeling. Studies have shown that expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production are decreased in human hypertrophic scar. However little is known about NO involvement in the early stages of hypertrophic scarring, because of the lack of an animal model. It was recently reported that the female red Duroc pig (FRDP) makes thick scar, which is similar to human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized that NO production in wounds on the female, red Duroc pig is similar to that of human hypertrophic scar and that NO involvement in deep wounds is different from that in superficial wounds. Methods: Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of four FRDPs. Biopsies were collected at weeks 1.5, 4, 8 and 21 post wounding including samples of uninjured skin. Nitric oxide levels were measured with the Griess reaction assay and normalized with tissue protein level. Results: Superficial wounds healed with an invisible scar whereas the deep wounds healed with scar resembling mild hypertrophic scar. The thickness of the scars from the deep wounds was significantly greater than uninjured skin and healed superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). NO levels were increased at 1.5 weeks in deep wounds compared to superficial wounds and uninjured skin (p?<?0.05). At 8 weeks, NO levels in deep wounds had returned to the level of uninjured tissue and superficial wounds. By 21 weeks, NO levels had decreased significantly when compared to superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). There were no differences in NO levels between uninjured skin and superficial wounds at any time point (p?>?0.05). Conclusions: NO production is similar in late, deep wounds on the female, red Duroc pig to that reported in the literature for human hypertrophic scar further validating this animal model. NO production is quite different after deep wounds as compared to superficial wounds in the FRDP. Early elevation in nitric oxide production might account for excessive inflammation in deep wounds that become thick scars in the FRDP. Nitric oxide regulators and effects at early stages of scar formation should be elucidated further and the FRDP appears to be a useful model.

AB  - Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection that often leaves patients with a large integumentary deficit to their penis and scrotum. Treatment of the skin defect has been described in a multitude of ways including split thickness skin grafting, burying the testes in the thighs, thigh flaps, and a variety of myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Many of the previously described techniques have worked well for smaller defects and for closure of wounds but fell short of aesthetic reconstruction of sexual organs. We describe a technique using split-thickness skin grafts with suction dressings or bolster. This was employed using the VAC?(Vacuum Assisted Closure Device, KCI?). This technique creates a natural appearing scrotum that holds the testes away from the body in a physiologic manner and surfaces the penis with a seemingly natural appearance in a functional manner. The technique provides a nearly 100% graft take and greatly decreases hospital length of stay. A case report demonstrates a patient?s full recovery to his professional, social, and sexual life within six weeks of initial reconstructive treatment. Our technique provides a reliable treatment with good functional and aesthetic outcomes to a difficult problem.

AB  - Celosia argentea is used in traditional medicine for sores, ulcers, and skin eruptions. Therefore, we investigated the healing efficiency of an ointment formulated on a alcohol extract of Celosia argentea leaves (CA) in a rat burn wound model. Wound closure occurred earlier in the treated rats (15 days versus 30 in the untreated group; P?<?0.05). Collagen and hexsoamine content of the granulation tissue increased at a faster rate in the treated wounds. To probe the cell biologic basis of this effect, we found that this extract promoted cell motility and proliferation of primary dermal fibroblasts but did not alter these responses in primary keratinocytes. In short, we demonstrate a salutary action of the Celosia argentea extract on wound healing and suggest that this may be due to mitogenic and motogenic promotion of dermal fibroblasts.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection, is considered the major cause of death among critically ill patients in the developed world. While there is a general view that this reflects contributions from both the pathogen and the host with respect to an inappropriate inflammatory response, there is a lack of agreement as to the key immune mechanisms. This has been reflected in the diverse range of immunotherapies tested in clinical trials, often with rather marginal effects. The case has been made for a pathogenic role of excessive immunity, the so-called ?cytokine storm?, and for a role of too little immunity through immune paralysis. Apoptosis is implicated as a key mechanism in both this immune paralysis and the multi-organ failure that is a feature of severe sepsis. A number of polymorphisms have been implicated in susceptibility to sepsis, including cytokine genes, HLA class II and caspase-12. In this review we focus in particular on the role of group A streptococci in severe sepsis. Here the effect of bacterial superantigens appears to be a correlate of inflammatory activation, although the precise evolutionary role of the superantigens remains unclear.

AB  - Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (immune TRALI) is now recognized as the most common cause of transfusion-associated major morbidity and death in the Western world. Among the implicated leucocyte antibodies, these ones directed against the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) class II, human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA)-3a and HLA-A2 antigens are frequently associated with severe (artificial ventilation required) and fatal cases. There is accumulating evidence that preventive measures such as transfusion of plasma-rich blood components from male donors or from donors tested negative for leucocyte antibodies are effective in the reduction of severe and fatal immune TRALI.

AB  - In order to closely mimic the actual mechanism of wound debridement by an enzymatic debriding agent, a synthetic wound eschar substrate (SWES) has been developed. The SWES is prepared by the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of fibrous bovine collagen and elastin, to form an insoluble planar matrix composed of the three major proteins present in wound eschar. Each of the proteinaceous components is uniquely labeled prior to formation of SWES with different dye, and the debridement test is conducted using a Franz Diffusion System. The debriding agent is applied to the SWES mounted on the donor compartment of the cell, and the digested hydrolysate containing dye-labeled peptide fragments is sampled from the receptor compartment. Accordingly, the progress of digestion is obtained in real time. Since the three proteins are labeled with spectrally distinct dyes, data on the hydrolysis of the substrates can be collected simultaneously. This method facilitates the testing of formulated debriding products in a manner that closely mimics application to a wound and provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of formulated enzymatic debriding agents.

AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used adjunctively to treat chronic, non-healing wounds. Increased nitric oxide (NO) production during HBO is suggested as an important mechanism that promotes enhanced wound healing. The purpose of this study is the documentation of NO production during and following HBO treatments (txs). Diabetic and non-diabetic patients receiving HBO therapy (20?txs; 2.0ATA???90?min) provided wound fluid and fasting plasma and urine specimens for nitrate (NOx) determinations. Nitrate measurements were obtained prior to HBO (baseline), after 10 and 20?txs, and at one and four weeks following HBO completion. In patients healing after HBO baseline plasma NOx ranged between 17.7 and 33.20??M. At 10?txs plasma NOx increased >50% to between 35.8?43.5??M. At 20?txs plasma NOx decreased to between 22.3?35.5??M. Healing diabetic patient plasma NOx increased after HBO reaching 170% of baseline at one month (57.8?±?0.15??M). Plasma NOx of healing non-diabetic patients decreased to baseline levels at one month after HBO. Urine NOx values mirrored those of plasma NOx; wound fluid NOx elevations were delayed compared to plasma and urine. Conversely, non-healing HBO patients did not demonstrate the early, significant elevations of plasma NOx after 10?txs. This study documents, for the first time, an early (10?txs), significant elevation of plasma and urine NOx after HBO that is associated with successful healing in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. A similar early increase in plasma and urine NOx was not observed in patients not responding to HBO therapy. These findings suggest that HBO-mediated increased NO production plays a critical role in the correction of impaired wound healing in selected patients. Furthermore, early plasma and urine NOx determinations after HBO therapy may prove valuable in the prediction of the clinical outcome of treatment.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium cultured from infected wounds. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral arterial disease would be patient predictors of severe outcomes, defined as amputation, sepsis, or death, and infections caused by resistant strains would be bacterial predictors of severe outcomes. Methods: With IRB approval, 50 S. aureus strains (45 wound, 5 central line) were isolated during routine clinical care. Investigations included antibiotic resistance (>5?mcg/ml), and PCR for STAR elements. Chart review included wound type, location, relevant comorbidities, antibiotic resistance, and outcome. Results: Outcome n(%of outcome total) Severe All others Total Diabetic 7 (70) 6 (17) 13 (29) Non-diabetic 3 (30) 29 (83) 32 (71) MRSA STAR groups 2 (20) 8 (23) 10 (22) All other STAR 8 (80) 27 (77) 35 (78) MRSA 4 (40) 8 (23) 12 (27) MSSA 6 (60) 27 (77) 33 (73) Total patients 10 (22) 35 (78) 45 No non-DM patient with arterial disease (n?=?6) had a poor outcome. Conclusions: The strongest predictor of outcome was the presence of DM. Patients with severe outcomes were slightly more likely to have MRSA infection, although only 33% of patients with MRSA had severe outcomes. Although STAR/arsRBC groups have been shown previously to predict antibiotic resistance, in this collection there was no correlation between these molecular markers and outcome. This study shows that the strongest predictor of clinical outcome in wound infection is patient-dependent, while bacterial factors appear to play a lesser role.

AB  - Caspases are a family of at least 14 highly conserved aspartate proteases that are the major effector arm of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Previous immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have implicated two of the family members, caspase 3 and caspase 14, as having a role in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation. Reepithelialization of epidermal defects after wounding requires coordination between signals that initiate growth and migration as well as signals that initiate differentiation. We therefore examined the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 14 in the epidermis of early (up to 48 hour) human wounds. Two excisional wounds were created on the inner arm using a 3?mm biopsy punch and allowed to heal via secondary intention. Wounds were excised at 24 and 48 hours using a 6?mm biopsy punch, placed in OCT, frozen, cryosectioned and immunohistochemically labeled using affinity purified antisera for caspases 3, 9 and 14. At 24 hours, the distribution of caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression was unchanged from non-wounded skin. Caspase 3 was found in the upper differentiating cells of the granular layer, while caspase 9 was expressed in scattered dendritic cells in the epidermis. At 48 hours, caspase 3 expression was lost in the epithelial tongue, while caspase 9 expression was found in keratinocytes at the tip of the migrating tongue. Caspase 14 expression at 24 hours was noted at the tip of the migrating epithelial tongue, while at 48 hours, the normal expression of caspase 14 in the granular layer was lost. These results suggest that in 48 hour wounds, loss of caspase 3 and 14 expression in the migrating epithelium reflects the activated state of this tissue. The onset of caspase 9 expression at 48 hours in the leading edge of the wound suggests a role for caspase 9 in wound remodeling, as caspase 9 is known to participate in tissue remodeling during development. Characterization of the caspases involved during wound healing may lead to future therapies utilizng caspases or caspase inhibitors in situations of poor or aberrant wound healing.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Burns have been associated with high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines which promote systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), immunosuppression and sepsis for which no effective treatment is currently available. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system and enhance adaptive immunity. We have examined the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1?-(IL-1?), gamma-interferon (IFN?) and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNFα) on human ?-defensin-2 (HBD-2) levels in cultured keratinocytes. We have also examined the effects of heat shock at 42?°C. Our results demonstrate that only TNFα shows significant induction of HBD-2 but this induction was not sustained in the long term. In addition, endogenous levels of defensin were significantly reduced by exposure to heat shock. The keratinocytes also responded to IL-1? by becoming hypertrophic. These results indicate that stress-related, pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce keratinocytes to synthesize HBD-2, while heat shock appears to reduce its production. Understanding the roles cytokines play in the continued problems associated with severe wounding, and in particular, major burn injury, is important. This study provides further insight into the role of natural anti-microbial peptides under conditions of stress.

AB  - Methods to reliably measure tissue oxygenation in situ are currently lacking. We have developed a vertically oriented, dorsal, bipedicle flap model that is easy to perform, reliably reproduces tissue ischemia, eliminates craniocaudal variation, and is amenable to studying therapeutic modalities. The effect of narrowing this flap on tissue oxygenation measured with Licox electrodes has previously been presented. In this study we utilize in situ EPR spectroscopy to demonstrate the oxygen gradient in the flap as a function of flap width and placement of a silicone sheet directly under the flap. The effect of wound healing over a 2 week period is demonstrated. Twenty four, 300?gm male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the bipedicle flap according to the following groups: 2.5?cm flap with silicone, 2.0?cm flap without silicone, 2.0?cm flap with silicone. Each group of 6 animals was injected with EMS char at 2?cm intervals along the flap and one injection in the control, non-ischemic tissue. A 4th group underwent 2.0?cm flaps with silicone and use of lithium phthalocyanin as the paramagnetic material. Wound measurements and EPR spectroscopy were performed on days 3, 7, 10 and 14. On day 14, after EPR measurements, the animals were sacrificed and their wounds excised. One flap and one control wound were preserved for histologic analysis, the other flap and control wounds were prepared for lactate measurements. EPR spectroscopy demonstrated a gradient of oxygen that was lowest in the center of the flap and greatest at either end. Changes in the oxygen gradient correlated with narrowing and placement of the intervening silicone sheet. This new technology has never been utilized in an animal model of impaired wound healing. Comparison of recently developed paramagnetic materials for optimal tissue oxygen and free radical measurements will be presented.

AB  - Keloids are scars that overgrow the original boundaries of the injury, involving aberrant functioning of the fibroblasts. We have found that during normal wound healing the ELR-negative CXC chemokines IP-9 (CXCL11) and IP-10 (CXCL10) act to limit fibroblast immigration. Our initial goal was to determine if keloid fibroblasts failed to respond to this ?stop? signal. Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical studies on keloid fibroblasts show that these lesions express excessive amounts of IP-9 and CXCR3 receptor. The protein levels of CXCR3 receptor was also not dissimilar between normal and keloid fibroblasts. Though, the expression of the protein and the receptor seems to be normal, the fibroblasts derived from these abnormal lesions did not respond to IP-9 during EGF induced cell migration. We have extended these findings to determine whether other genes are differentially expressed by keloid fibroblasts. The immediate first gene that interest us was the mRNA levels of CXCR3 receptor (GPR9) wherein, we did not find any significant difference between normal and keloid fibroblasts. Further, we also found interestingly, that genes related to tumor progression are up regulated in keloid fibroblasts than the normal fibroblasts. The marker genes like calgranulin, BCL-2 associated anthogen 4 (BAG4), and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Certain transcription factors like GATA-6 and SpiB are also increased. Apart, the classical growth factor and growth factor receptor related genes which includes, bone morphogenetic protein BMP-1, heparin binding EGF like growth factor, EGF like repeats discoidin1, IGFBP-5 and 3, EphB1&B2, tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, serine threonine kinase 6 along with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan brevican and versican and vitronectin are also up regulated. The newl identified genes will open new avenues in targeting keloid lesions by understanding the basic signaling mechanism of these specific proteins. This work was supported by grants from NIH/NIGMS and PPRTP.

AB  - Calreticulin (CRT) is a major classic Ca-binding chaperone protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, CRT has been recognized to have widespread extracellular effects as well. In the current study we show that CRT increases both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of porcine and murine wound repair. Partial thickness wounds were created on the paravertebral area of pigs (n?=?4) and 0.1% and 0.5% CRT, and PDGF (positive control) applied for 4 consecutive days. In wounds harvested at 5 days, CRT induced a 28 and 22% greater extent of reepithelialization than PDGF and Tris/Ca buffer control, respectively (% healed?=?56/CRT; 40.5/PDGF; 44/control). In addition, CRT stimulated earlier granulation tissue formation in a dose-dependent manner (cumulative dermal depth, microns: 1615/CRT; 1250/PDGF; 1325/control). A similar granulation tissue inducing effect of CRT was also observed in a steroid-impaired pig model. As a diabetic model of wound repair, two 5?mm circular full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db mice; the wounds were splinted open with silicone rings and covered with occlusive dressing (n?=?24). After 5 days of treatment with 0.1, 0.5, and 5% CRT, a dose-dependent 8-, 4.5-, and 2-fold increase in granulation tissue formation was observed (p?<?0.05). However, there was no apparent effect on wound closure. Tissue sections showed a highly cellular dermis in the CRT treated wounds. In addition, CRT (50?pg/ml) stimulated wound closure in a scratch plate assay using fibroblasts by 45%, in 48?hrs, compared to 2% for the control. Therefore, CRT may be a novel agent for wound healing by acting as a chemoattractant for cells involved in wound remodeling and in epithelial migration. Suppported by Calretex, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: We hypothesize that interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6r) blockade with IL-6r antibody will increase matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) production in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts. To test this hypothesis, MMP-3 protein levels were measured in fibroblasts cultured from normal skin and hypertrophic scar with and without IL-6 receptor blockade. Methods: Primary cell cultures of normal skin (NSF) and hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HTS) were obtained from the same patient (n?=?5) and seeded into 6 well plates (40,000?cells/cm2) in complete media. Cells were treated with and without IL-6 receptor antibody and IgG (10?ng/ml) for 6 hours. Protein concentrations of MMP-3 are determined in equal volume of supernatants by ELISA. Statistical analysis was by unpaired t-test(*P?<?0.05). Results: Blocking IL-6 receptors with its antibody showed significant increase in MMP-3 protein concentration in HTS compared to NSF. MMP-3(ng/ml) MMP-3(ng/ml) NSF 1.6?±?0.13 HTS 0.7?±?0.37 NSF?+?IL-6r 0.3?±?0.15 HTS?+?IL-6r 2.3?±?0.5* NSF?+?IgG 0.26?±?0.16 HTS?+?IgG 0.75?±?0.14 Conclusion: IL-6 receptor mediated signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar formation and its blockade may reduce hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Biocompatible matrices, such as bovine collagen, have demonstrated usefulness in delivering gene therapy vectors that express growth factors to local environments for tissue repair. Unlike animal derived matrices, we have developed a new synthetic matrix consisting of a linear cyclodextrin-polyethyleneglycol co-polymer that is non-covalently cross-linked with di-adamantane-polyethyleneglycol via inclusion complex formation between adamantane and cyclodextrin (CD-Ada). We performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments for biocompatibility and localized transgene expression using a recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vector containing either the reporter gene, GFP, or the therapeutic gene, PDGF-B. In vitro results demonstrated cell migration, adenoviral transduction, and gene expression with no visible signs of toxicity in human skin fibroblasts. Qualitative gene expression from the CD-Ada containing rAd was delayed by approximately two days when compared to collagen, but the level of expression was greater over a longer period of time. In vivo experiments demonstrated gene expression after local delivery to mouse skin using rAd-GFP in CD-Ada. Again, the expression was slightly delayed but duration of expression was comparable to collagen. Expression studies using rAd-PDGF-B, were performed in the rat polyvinyl alcohol sponge model and showed comparable quantitative DNA and RNA levels between CD-Ada and collagen (DNA: 4.1???1010 and 4.5???1010 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively; RNA: 7.0???108 and 3.2???108 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively). Additionally, we explored the use of plasmid DNA with the CD-Ada matrix and observed PDGF-B expression in vivo. Our results show that this new delivery system provides a safe, efficient, and adaptable medium for both viral and non-viral gene delivery.

AB  - Fibrin Sealant products such as TisseelR have been used over the last 25 years to reach hemostasis during surgery or to seal tissues. Moreover, there were many studies on the use of fibrin sealant in cell and bioactive substance delivery. Our In Vitro and In Vivo studies, over the last 2 years, have focused on the use of fibrin sealant to deliver human fibroblasts or keratinocytes to overcome the healing deficiency in chronic wounds. We have shown that some fibrin formulations supported a high fibroblast proliferation and other fibrin formulations supported a high proliferation of human keratinocytes. In this study, we examined the use of fibrin sealant in the co-delivery of both human ? derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The study report examined the cell proliferation of these two cell types in various formulations of fibrin sealant. Fibroblasts and keratinocytes were mixed with various dilutions of the Sealer Protein solution and added to culture plates before adding the Thrombin solution to form fibrin clots containing both cell types. We found that a low to medium sealer protein concentration (1?34?mG/mL) and a very low thrombin concentration (1?U/mL) in the final fibrin clots provided for an optimal cell proliferation for both cell types within these fibrin clots. This profile of proliferation was different from that seen when keratinocytes alone or fibroblasts alone were incorporated in the fibrin clots. Morphologically, it was difficult to determine the cell type from examining cell morphology, thus, it was difficult to determine the cell distribution. In conclusion, we found that various modified formulations of fibrin sealant may be chosen when co- delivering fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Moreover, there seems to be a positive feedback between keratinocytes and fibroblasts when they were co ? introduced in the fibrin clots. This feedback could be carried by growth factors. Future studies will determine his signaling process.

AB  - Composition and structure determine the fate of biomaterials in the body, encouraging or discouraging acceptance, cellular infiltration, and degradation or incorporation into host tissue. Most biomaterials research has been focused on composition, while structure remains a relatively uninvestigated factor in biomaterial success. Naturally derived biomaterials may provide optimal structure for cellular repopulation in certain applications. Porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix used in the clinical treatment of soft tissue injury, including pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Numerous studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. SIS consists primarily of collagen, although the presence of other proteins, growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, and proteoglycans has been reported. SEM was used to characterize the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Cryo-SEM was used to image mechanically isolated, oxidatively disinfected, lyophilized, sterilized, and rehydrated SIS. The fractured cross-sectional faces of intact intestine, oxidatively disinfected SIS, and lyophilized SIS were imaged with traditional SEM. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that SIS is a heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. There are differences in the structure of the mucosal and serosal surfaces. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse and delamination following lyophilization, much of the native structure is preserved. These changes are preserved following rehydration. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture-clearly facilitates host interaction on thecellular and subcellular levels.

AB  - Although electrical stimulation (ES) has been successful in the treatment of various types of wounds, the popularity of the treatment has waned due to a lack of optimal methods of administration. The goal of this study has been to develop and evaluate a method of delivering ES that is easy to use and suitable for delivery in a home-health environment.[0] Specifically, a novel bandage system developed to provide an electric field in a manner resembling the natural wound current was tested in vivo. In this study, a full-thickness wound model in New Zealand white rabbits was used to measure the effects of such a bandage system on healing of [0]skin defects. Different levels of current were evaluated initially, with 50 and 20??A selected for the focus of this study, along with a non-stimulated control. Using histomorphometry healing rates, cellularity, and blood vessels were quantified at one and two week time points. The study showed the ability of this ES bandage to speed the healing process. An increase in overall healing rate over non-stimulated wounds of 45%(p?=?0.04) was observed in wounds stimulated with 50??A of current for 1 week. In wounds treated for 2 weeks, contraction rate decreased as well as the ratio of contraction rate to epithelialization rate. The stimulated wounds also showed an increase in the amount of macrophages, with a 79% increase in number of macrophages in wounds stimulated with 20??A for 2 weeks and a 198% increase in macrophages in those stimulated with 50??A compared to non-stimulated wounds. The performance of the bandage in the animal model has led to a limited clinical study on pressure ulcer patients using the 50??A system.

AB  - Identifying molecular loci of impaired cutaneous healing in diabetes with an eye towards developing targeted therapy to ameliorate dysrepair continues to evolve as a promising area of study. By using an excisional wound model produced on the dorsum of female diabetic C57BL/KsJ db?+?/db+ mice as well as their normal (WT)  2)Adnull vector; 3)PBS. Postoperatively, wounds were examined & photographed on Days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 & 28. Also, tissue was harvested for histology & immunohistochemistry (PECAM), and snap frozen for protein & RNA analysis. A scoring system was used to grade re-epithelialization, granulation tissue thickness, matrix density, inflammation, vascular density, epithelial maturity. AAV-VEGF exerted minimal effect on repair in WT and HZ mice. However, pronounced neovascularization, thickened granulation tissue & increased matrix deposition was noted after VEGF treatment in the db/db mice compared to those that received PBS or adnull vector at all timepoints. While the induction of angiogenesis in VEGF treated db/db mice lagged behind the unimpaired mice by 5?7 days, a global improvement in wound healng was observed.
