AB  - Introduction: Angiogenesis is thought to be important for granulation tissue formation and for the delivery oxygen and other nutrients to the healing wound bed. We examined whether angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) such as endostatin decrease neovascularization in full-thickness wounds leading to impaired granulation tissue formation and delayed wound closure. Methods: Endostatin at tumor-inhibiting doses (20?mg/kg/BID) was injected daily starting three days prior to surgery. Two full-thickness wounds were created on the mouse dorsum using a novel wound healing model developed in our lab. A second experimental group had topical VEGF (10??g/QD) applied to these wounds. Both groups were compared to PBS-treated controls. Wounds were analyzed for closure time, granulation tissue formation, and wound vascularity using CD31. Results: Endostatin-treatment delayed wound closure compared to control mice (17.4d?±?1.51 vs. 12.8?±?0.89, P?<?0.05), resulted in decreased granulation tissue formation at all time points (P?<?0.05), and significantly reduced wound vascularity as measured by CD31+ vessel counts (P?<?0.05). VEGF application to the wound bed of endostatin-treated mice normalized wound closure despite endostatin treatment (13.8d?±?1.1 vs. 17.44d?±?1.51, P?<?0.05). Conclusion: Endostatin impairs wound angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation and delays full-thickness wound closure. Topical VEGF was able to reverse this effect and may represent a novel approach to improve wound healing in patients receiving AI. These findings may have serious implications for patients undergoing AI treatment that require surgery or who have wound healing complications.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - Background: Physiological healing in acute wounds generally occurs by granulation from the wound base and by migration of epithelium from the wound edges toward the center of the wound in a uniform, concentric fashion. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) compared this phenomenon in acute wounds treated with standard care versus acute wounds pharmacologically stimulated with growth factor therapy. Methods: With informed consent, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. The biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel Q.D., ii) rhPDGF-BB Q.O.D., iii) daily rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). Wound morphology was carefully examined and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Results: There were distinct differences in the morphological pattern of healing seen between control wounds and growth factor-stimulated wounds. Acute wounds treated with bacitracin tended to heal in circumferential fashion, as predicted. Growth factor-stimulated wounds, by contrast, exhibited accentuated angiogenesis (granulation), with non-uniform epithelial islands streaming into the wound. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that rhPDGF-BB influences acute wound healing by promoting accelerated granulation and epithelialization. Accelerated healing is manifest by different healing morphologies. The biological basis for these differences requires further histological and molecular analyses.

AB  - The importance of controlling the bioburden in wounds can not be over emphasized. Glycerine based gel sheets have been used extensively to show their bacteriostatic/fungistatic properties. Hoekstra studied animal wounds and compared glycerine dressings with water based dressings and the glycerine showed superior bioburden reduction. Vandeputte showed similar results when comparing hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings and looked at the histology of the wounds to find differences in the quantities of the types of cells present. The reduced scar formation of wounds are thought to be attributed to the influence of the glycerine on the healing process. Hoestra has reported the dramatic reduction in the inflammation reaction soon after application of the glycerine gel dressing. Studies by Oliveria-Gandia, Davis, and Mertz showed the glycerine dressings to be more effective than hydrogel or hydrocolloid dressings in reducing bioburden in animal wounds that were inoculated with microbes and also reducing biocounts in appropriate growth medium. Vandeputte conducted a diabetic study(no exclusions) that compared the glycerine dressing (n?=?15) with standard protocol(n?=?14) for diabetic foot wounds, that showed the test dressing to be far superior. He along with thousands of other nurses around the world have reported the use of glycerine dressings on superficial burns to reduce pain, reduce the chance for infection, reduce scar formation, and to protect the wound from friction and pressure. J. Baksa extensively used the glycerine gel sheets in his burn unit not only for the superficial wounds but also for 3rd and 4th degree burns on children as well as after surgical removal of hypertrophic and keloid scars to prevent reoccurrence. T.M. Baum and M.J. Busuito also reported the use of the glycerine dressing for scar prevention and treatment. The glycerine dressing has been used extensively for te treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers in hospitals, nursing homes, athletic fields, as well as, under casts, splints and braces. R. Horchner reported a >95% reduction in pressure ulcers in a direct comparison to the control and to hydrocolloids.

AB  - Delayed wound healing is a common complication of diabetes resulting in significant clinical morbidity. The diabetic wound exhibits impaired cellular infiltration and consequently inadequate granulation tissue formation. Additionally, altered patterns of apoptosis. In this study, we have evaluated the differential gene expression pattern in transgenic diabetic female mice, 5?6 weeks old, in a full thickness cutaneous punch wound model. We assessed the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and differential gene expression pattern at 4th, 7th and 11th day post wounding. Supernatants obtained from diabetic wound tissue homogenates were subjected to zymogram analysis. The data showed that MMPs were expressed at higher level by 4th day post wounding, whereas expression of MMPs were down regulated towards the 11th day post wounding suggesting their role during early phase of wound healing. The pathway specific gene array data demonstrated differential regulation of several growth factors, transcription factors and other related genes such as fibroblast growth factors and their receptors, ID3 and restin respectively. The cytokine/extracellular matrix protein osteopontin (OPN), an important component of cellular immunity and inflammation also showed higher expression after 4 days post wounding. The expression of OPN remained at higher level after 11 days post wounding in diabetic mice, whereas the expression were down regulated to basal level in normal wounded animal suggesting that the expression of OPN was concomitant with the extent of healing. Other adhesion molecules such as integrin αV and PECAM-1 were also differentially regulated. Though a single gene may not be solely responsible for any defect or impairment in healing as it is a very tightly controlled and regulated process, however, a detailed study of these gene(s) may shed some light to the delayed healing in diabetic mice.

AB  - Peptides of the innate immune system play a vital role in the protection and repair of almost all biological systems. Such peptides have been implicated in a range of activities associated with prevention of disease and modulation of innate immunity. HB107 is a derivative of one such peptide, Cecropin B, that has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing wound healing in both burn and incision animal models. HB107 has been evaluated for efficacy in a mouse incision model and for safety and efficacy in a pig burn wound model. Topical application of the peptide gives RE50(time needed for 50% re-epithelialization) values of 10.28 days for 500?ug/mL and 12.72 days for 100?ug/mL compared to control 16.45 days. Additionally the peptide was well tolerated in terms of safety both topically and in an IV acute toxicity mouse model with no adverse effects observed. HB107 not only demonstrated efficacy and safety, but due to being a relatively short synthetic peptide, costs significantly less to manufacture than the current approved therapies.

AB  - Macrophages serve as the coordinators of the wound healing process. Since 1998 following the Israeli Ministry of health authorization, macrophage suspensions have been used for the treatment of ulcers, in more than 800 elderly and paraplegic patients suffering from decubital chronic ulcers. As previously published, a significant number of genes showed increased levels of expression in hypo-osmotic shock activated cells, using DNA microarrays technique. The majority of these genes are considered to be directly involved in the macrophage function and in the wound healing process. Macrophge suspensions are prepared from a whole blood unit of healthy, young volunteer blood donors in a closed, sterile system, as previously described. The activated cells are applied to the wounds either by local injection or by direct deposition to the wound. Between January 2000 and October 2003, 112 patients with postoperative sternal wound infection were treated with macrophage suspension. Full closure of the wounds was achieved in 104 (93%) of the patients. Original wound surface area 8?175?cm2 (mean 93) Days until treatment 6?180 (mean 47) Days until 50% closure 6?60 (mean 21) Days until full closure 10?138 (mean 49) No side effects were noted. The use of macrophage suspension is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that reduces risk of complications and morbidity and improves the quality of life for long -suffering patients. Length and cost of hospital stay may be reduced, as the treatment requires no hospitalization.

AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) transiently expresses in acute wound. In non-healed wounds, MMP-9 together with other proteinases persistently elevate, which may lead excessive ECM degradation and failure of wound closure. To understand the molecular regulation of MMP-9 we investigated the signal transduction for TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9 by dermal fibroblasts. TNF-alpha initiates three major signal pathways including NF-11B, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. On the other hand, Rho-GTPase plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, angiogenesis, and mitosis. It remains unknown if the ?cross talk? of these signals having a role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we found that over expression of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) specifically attenuates TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9. However, TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-3 and proMMP-2 activation was intact. NF-?B signal is regarded as a common pathway for many MMPs. Indeed, PAK did not affect TNF-alpha mediated degradation of Ikappa B, suggesting additional signal is targeted by PAK. In contrast, MMP-3 but not MMP-9 expression is specifically blocked by p38 MAK. Thus TNF-alpha induced expression of multiple MMPs in wound healing may utilize different intracellular signal pathways.

AB  - A number of strategies have been explored for the treatment of cutaneous defects such as protein growth factor or gene therapy approaches. Alternative approaches include dermal or dermal-epidermal skin substitutes or clot substitutes such as fibrin sealants (FS?s). Here we test the fibrinogen-thrombin formulation of fibrin sealant combined with fibroblasts and PDGF in wound healing models. Four formulations varying in fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were applied to full-thickness biopsy wounds in the rabbit ear cutaneous wound-healing model with or without cultured rabbit dermal fibroblasts (RDFs; 3???105 cells/wound) embedded in the fibrinogen component. At post-wounding day 7, there was no difference in the diluted vs. non-diluted formulations for either the promotion of granulation tissue coverage of the open wounds or total granulation tissue area when tested without embedded cells. Including the RDFs, the highest degree of wound coverage by granulation tissue was observed in the combined dilution formulation (17.3?mg/ml fibrinogen, 167?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10) that was 167%(p?<?0.05) of the non-diluted FS containing cells (50?mg/ml fibrinogen, 250?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10). Inclusion of fibroblasts increased granulation tissue area within the wounds vs. FS alone (p?<?0.05) for each diluted formulation although no differences in this parameter was observed within each group (FS alone or with embedded cells). However, addition of the vulnerary growth factor PDGF-B (3??g; n?=?4) with the embedded RDFs in the combined dilution formulation increased granulation tissue area over 2-fold (p?<?0.01). Additionally, the presence of the RDFs promoted incorporation of the granulation tissue with and epithelial migration over the FS suggesting an active interaction between cells delivered to the wound by FS and the host repair cells. The findings suggest the progress of cutaneous defect repair can be enhanced by ex vivo cell delivery in Fibrin Sealant that is adjusted to balance hemostasis with promotion of wound healing processes.

AB  - Introduction: Burn depth, based on the hemodynamic alterations that occur following a thermal insult, can be assessed in a rapid, non-invasive, and nondestructive fashion using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR has the capability to determine the difference between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. Methods: Sixteen burn patients admitted to an adult regional burn center were studied and evaluated with the NIR point and imaging devices. Non-burned skin adjacent to the burn site was used as the control. NIR measurements were compared between superficial (8 wounds), full thickness (8 wounds) burn wounds and control sites. Results: NIR was able to easily detect an increase in oxyhemoglobin (68.3%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (4.8%, p?<?0.05%) and total hemoglobin (91.3%, p?<?0.05) which typically occurs with superficial burn injuries. Full thickness injuries experienced a substantial drop in oxyhemoglobin (88.8%, p?<?0.05), oxygen saturation (79.1%, p?<?0.05) and total hemoglobin (77.5%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to control sites. Conclusions: These results confirm that NIR spectroscopy can successfully distinguish between superficial and full thickness burn injuries. The second phase of this study will involve determining the depth of indeterminant burn wounds and this preliminary data will also be presented. Acknowledgement: National Research Council of Canada

AB  - Introduction: Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures at the ends of each chromosome. Due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the full length of the chromosome, up to 50?200 base pairs of the telomere are lost during each successive round of cell division. In adult human somatic cells, telomerase is not active resulting in progressive loss of telomere length and entry into replicative senescence as observed in cell culture. hTERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme which maintains telomere length. Transfection of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) by hTERT has been shown to reverse the senescent phenotype seen in aging HDFs in vitro. ERK (p44/42) is a MAP kinase which functions as a critical intermediary in the determination of cell growth and differentiation. Activation of ERK occurs through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues. ?Methods: In order to delineate some of the cellular mechanisms by which hTERT functions, we treated adenoviral hTERT (Ad-hTERT) transfected HDFs with TGFB1, and assayed phosphorylated ERK activity by Western blotting.?Results: Ad-hTERT treated HDFs demonstrated a 2?3 fold increase in phospho-ERK activity. In addition, our preliminary findings show that Ad-hTERT transfected HDFs have increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression by real-time rtPCR. ?Conclusions: Increased phosphor-ERK activity as well as increased TGFB1, TGFB1-Receptor I and II, and COL1A1 gene expression is seen in hTERT transfected HDF?s. Further studies will focus on defining other intermediary changes resulting from Ad-hTERT tranfection. Funding source: Geron Corporation

AB  - Excessive scarring is a significant clinical problem. p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, blocks cell cycle progression and attenuates proliferation of various cell types. Our in vitro rAd-p21 dose response studies of primary human dermal fibroblasts showed a 3?80 fold reduction of cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation at doses of 1???108?3???109?PN/mL, respectively. Further, rAd-p21 at 3???109 PN/mL showed a 2-fold less procollagen I (PIP) production when compared to control virus. These in vitro data demonstrate that rAd-p21 significantly attenuates fibroproliferation and procollagen production in the target cells. In vivo, a rat PVA sponge model was used. rAd-p21, at doses of 1???109, 1???1010 and 5???1010 PN was delivered into sponges that had previously been treated with a granulation tissue stimulator, rAd-PDGF-B. Results showed that sponges receiving rAd-PDGF-B alone had the highest % granulation fill (40?60% fill area). Sponges that were treated with rAd-PDGF-B for the first injection followed by rAd-p21 on a second injection showed a dose-dependent decrease in % granulation fill as rAd-p21 doses increased (p?<?0.001). On day 5 post-injection, IHC staining identified p21 protein expression only in sponges receiving rAd-p21. In addition, the quantitative measurement of cells labeled by BrdU or Ki67 demonstrated that rAd-p21 significantly attenuated cell proliferation when compared to rAd-PDGF alone in this model (p?<?0.01). In another in vivo experiment, a rabbit excessive scar model was used. rAd-p21, at a dose of 2???109?PN/wound was intradermally injected into the rabbit ear wounds that had previously been treated with PDGF-BB protein. Preliminary data showed that scar thickness in rAd-p21 treated wounds was significantly decreased in comparison to wounds treated with the control virus (p?<?0.05). These data suggest that rAd-p21 is effective in attenuating scars in the rabbit ear excessive scar model. Our in vitro and in vivo data support the further exploration of rAd-p21 as a useful therapeutic candidate for hyperproliferative diseases in patients.

AB  - Intro: Pathophysiology of hypertrophic scar formation remains unclear, potentially involving mechanical strain, burns, or infection. We sought to specifically examine the role of mechanical strain in hypertrophic scars. To do so, we developed and characterized a novel murine model which uses mechanical strain to produce hypertrophic scars in mice. Methods: Paired incisions were created on C57BL6 mice (n?=?20). After closure, mechanical strain was applied across one wound using a novel device; the other wound was a control. Starting at day 3, mechanical strain was increased every other day over 4?wks. Wounds were harvested each week, and examined histologically using Sirius red, DAPI, BrdU for proliferation, and caspase 3 for apoptosis. Results: Strained wounds showed features of hypertrophic scars: raised borders, loss of rete pegs and adnexal structures in the epidermis overlying scars, blood vessels that were perpendicular and fibrillary collagen that was parallel to skin surface. Features persisted beyond 6 months. Wound collagen deposition in strained wounds increased 6-fold at 1 wk and over 12-fold at 2?4?wks, in parallel to an increase in number of stromal cells within scar (28-fold). This resulted in an increase in number of cells per unit area of collagen (over 42%). In all wounds, there was no significant difference in proliferation. There was a significant reduction in blood vessel (4-fold) and fibroblast (3-fold) apoptosis at 1?4?wks in strained wounds. Conc: Mechanical strain alone is sufficient to produce hypertrophic scars in this model that are indistinguishable from human scars. Notably, hypertrophic scars appear to result from a marked reduction in apoptosis, rather than from a significant proliferation and upregulation of cellular collagen deposition, validating previous in vitro studies.

AB  - Previous investigations have demonstrated that cutaneous healing in red Duroc pigs (RD) differs from healing in Yorkshire pigs (Y). Specifically, RD animals heal with the formation of hypercontracted, hyperpigmented scars, features which are not observed in Y animals. Further, this abnormal scarring may be genetically mediated, as demonstrated by the partial transmission of this phenotype to RD???Y offspring (F1). To further determine the degree of transmission of this phenotype, this study examined the effect of wound depth upon the healing response of F1 animals. Ten full thickness (FT) and ten deep dermal (DD, 1.8?mm) skin wounds (2?cm???2?cm) were created on the backs of juvenile female F1 animals (N?=?8) using previously published procedures. Biopsies (4?mm) were taken from FT and DD wounds on days 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Samples were used for histology and molecular analysis using RT-PCR. There were no detectable differences between the FT and DD wounds on the gross or histologic level. However on a molecular level, there were numerous differences between the FT and DD wounds. Several genes investigated demonstrated increased expression levels in the DD wounds as compared to the FT wounds. Further, DD wounds demonstrated a unique pattern of expression for several other genes that differed from that observed in either the F1 FT wounds or in any RD or Y wounds. Given that previous investigations have shown that FT and DD wounds are nearly identical within each of the RD and Y strains, this represents a novel finding. These results indicate that the healing phenotype of the F1 animals may be regulated both by genetics and by the wound size/depth, suggesting that human wound healing may be similarly influenced by genetics, wound depth and potentially, environmental factors.

AB  - Major burn wounds are often complicated by sepsis which currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in these patients. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in body?s defence by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. They also chemoattract immature dendritic cells and T and B-lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages and act as an adjuvant and enhance adaptive immunity. Our prior studies using RT-PCR suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin-2 (HBD-2) in burn wounds. Furthermore we demonstrated remnants of HBD-2 in the dermis. Our current study, using fluorescence deconvolution microscopy, has clarified that HBD-2 is present in the surviving hair follicles. The peptide was also located in the eccrine and apocrine sweat gland acini but absent in the sweat ducts, in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns. HBD-2 was also notably absent from the vascular endothelium and fat cells. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression and sepsis.

AB  - Bone marrow is an important supply for many progenitor cells, among them endothelial precursor cells. They have been already considered as potential therapeutic angiogenesis for ischemic hindlimb. In this work we performed an unilateral chronic ischemic hindlimb model in 20 dogs, we were dissected and ligated the middle sacra artery and external right iliac artery preserving the internal iliac artery, after one week we removed de femoral artery performing a proximal and distal ligation and inserted into the gracilis muscle 3 Silastic tubes (0.8?mm diameter) in a middle circle form in order to created fibrocollagenous tunnels. Fifteen days later, we obtained bone marrow (30?mL) and mononuclear cells were separated; at the same time, all tubes were removed and bone marrow cells were transplanted into the fibrocollagenous tunnels, only in the third and fourth groups. During the 8 at 12 days we administered subcutaneously saline solution to the first and third groups and G-CSF to the second and fourth groups. Finally, after 30 days we performed contrasted angiographies from both limbs and was calculated mean angiographic score (MAS) from the number of vascular intersections, also was taken a biopsy from the central portion of right gracilis muscle for vascular assessment, as well as for vascular proliferating cells by immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated that white bone marrow cell transplantation enrichment by G-CSF administration stimulates angiogenesis in ischemic hindlimb, twice than controls, and it is better than white bone marrow cell transplantation alone. White bone marrow cell is a potential therapy for ischemic hindlimb, because stem cells are growth factor provider, as well as an important source for endothelial precursors capable to form vessels de novo, mainly when this stem cells are deposited in an appropriate extracellular matrix, such as the fibrocollagenous tunnels in this model.

AB  - The inability to experiment in humans creates a great need to develop culture systems that mimic human tissues/organs. Skin is arguably the simplest human tissue and therefore provides an excellent prototype for tissue engineering. Moreover, skin is the body?s first line of defense. Currently available skin replacements have been classified into four categories: (i) those that are composed completely of epidermal cells; (ii) those consisting of dermal components derived from processing of cadaver skin or from collagen and other matrix molecules; (iii) those containing both dermal and epidermal components and (iv) those that contain dermal, epidermal and vascular components. All of these substitutes have drawbacks. Therefore, there is a need for skin replacements that: (a) are prepared with pertinent primary human cells but yet can be ready ?off? the shelf; (b) can be prepared rapidly; (c) contain stable structures in particular microvessels that can rapidly connect with the patient?s vasculature in this manner establish circulation in the ?graft? increasing the chances of survival; (d) can be tailored for specific wound impairments (e) are long lasting. We have developed a new generation human ?skin? that can fulfil these requirements and can potentially be used as a ?living bandage?. We start with three primary human cell types and a collagen matrix that self-assemble into a connective tissue containing a network of mature microvessels, is covered with a stratified epidermis, expresses biochemical markers, matrix molecules, and cytokines characteristic of normal human skin and matures in 10?15 days. Moreover, two additional cell types, pericytes and monocytes, differentiate in situ adjacent to and within microvessels, respectively providing stability to the micriovessels and the epidermis expresses keratins that are typical of mature skin and not those characteristically produced in response to injury such as keratins 6, 16, 17. This tissue can potentially be developed into a skin replacement for patients with impaired healing. In addition, this tissue responds normally to bological stimuli, providing a powerful vehicle to investigate mechanisms of skin development and regeneration, understand pathological processes, and test drugs and treatments for skin diseases

AB  - Summary Antibodies can cause hyperacute, acute, or chronic rejection of allografts. These different types of rejection involve additional humoral mediators, including complement, coagulation factors, and cytokines, which engage cells of the innate immune system, notably platelets, granulocytes, and monocyte/macrophages. In this chapter we discuss the functional properties of antibodies that influence which humoral and cellular mediators are activated. Then the effects of complement activation and regulation are considered. The mechanisms by which antibodies and complement modulate interactions between innate immune cells and the vascular endothelium are summarized as a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of different types of graft destruction.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study was designed to explore the pathogenesis of psoriasis and to identify potential bio-targets. Genome array technology was used to analyze the gene expression profiles of lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin samples and normal skin samples. Methods Gene expression profile GSE14905 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. This included skin biopsy samples from normal healthy donors (n = 21), lesional skin biopsy samples from psoriasis patients (n = 33), and non-lesional skin biopsy samples from psoriasis patients (n = 28). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Limma package in R language. Functions of specific DEGs were predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. A protein?protein interaction network was constructed to display the interactions among common DEGs. Finally, DAVID and WebGestalt were used to achieve a functional analysis of common DEGs. Results Totals of 1020, 562, and 643 genes, respectively, were identified as being differentially expressed in normal versus lesional, normal versus non-lesional, and lesional versus non-lesional samples. The specific DEGs in the three groups were enriched for several GO terms, including mitotic cell cycle, immune response, and response to organic matter. The 40 common DEGs in the three groups may be involved in the defense response pathway in the development of psoriasis. Furthermore, three genes (RGS1, SOCS3, and NAMPT) may play key roles in distinguishing lesional and non-lesional tissues from normal tissues, and 10 genes (PTRRC, ALDH1A3, SAMSA1, C15orf48, ZC3H12A, SOD2, IL8, LTF, RHCG, and IL7R) may play key roles in distinguishing non-lesional from normal and lesional samples. Conclusions These genes may be considered as potential diagnostic markers and targets of therapeutics in psoriasis.
