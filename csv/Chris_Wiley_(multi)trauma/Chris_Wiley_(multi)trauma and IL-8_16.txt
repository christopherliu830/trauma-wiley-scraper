AB  - Abstract In the epidermal compartment of skin, keratinocytes (KC), Langerhans cells (LC), and their soluble products, i.e. cytokines, constitute a unique immunologic microenvironment. KC participate in cutaneous immune responses by producing various cytokines. LC, a member of the dendritic cell (DC) family, represent the professional antigen-presenting cells in the epidermis. Although it has been demonstrated that migration of LC from skin to lymph nodes is a critical step for the antigen presentation, molecular mechanisms for such an event remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that cytokines are able to modulate LC/DC migration. There is accumulating evidence that proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor a promote LC emigration from the skin, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is a counter-regulator. LC/DC express chemokine receptors. Chemokines generated from lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph node cells play a role in the directional migration of LC/DC into lymph nodes. This article reviews current studies on the role of cytokines in LC/DC migration. J. Leukoc. Biol. 66: 33?39; 1999.

AB  - Abstract Aim Over the past several decades, there has been a growing research interest in the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This review aims to summarize evidence in support of this relationship, to discuss biological mechanisms that might explain it, and to explore the translational impact by examining evidence from trials of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of schizophrenia. Methods This narrative review of the literature summarizes evidence from observational studies, clinical trials and meta-analyses to evaluate the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and to discuss associated implications for treatment. Results Epidemiological evidence and animal models support a hypothesis of maternal immune activation during pregnancy, which increases the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. Several biomarker studies have found associations between classical pro-inflammatory cytokines and schizophrenia. The precise biological mechanisms by which inflammatory processes might contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain unclear, but likely include the actions of microglia and the complement system. Importantly, several trials provide evidence that certain anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents show beneficial effects in the treatment of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is a need for further precision-focused basic science and translational research. Conclusions Increasing our understanding of the role of inflammation in schizophrenia will enable novel opportunities for therapeutic and preventative interventions that are informed by the underlying pathogenesis of this complex disorder.

AB  - Dental tissue infection results in immune and inflammatory responses mediated by molecular and cellular events that, if unchecked, result in tissue breakdown. The tooth, like other tissues and organs within the body, will attempt to repair and regenerate its own hard and soft tissues given the appropriate conditions and environment. However, unchecked infection and inflammation will have a significant impact on the natural regenerative responses of the dental tissues. Thus far, there have been limited studies addressing the inter-relationship between these two processes, which are clearly linked by molecular and cellular events. Indeed, locally derived growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which are all sequestrated within the dental tissue extracellular matrix and are also expressed by pulpal cells, immune cells, and/or necrotic host tissue, will have considerable impact on the cellular events within the tissue. In addition to the molecular signaling, there will be important cellular interactions that will occur as stem cells, resident or recruited to the pulp, have known immuno-modulatory activity with significant implications for regenerative events. In this review, we aim to explore how the pulpal tissue responds to the invading bacteria and the signaling mechanisms that are now being described and are important in regulating both the immune/inflammatory and regenerative responses.

AB  - Abstract ?? Biochemistry of chondrotin sulphate ?? Mechanism of action of chondroitin sulphate -? Effect of chondroitin sulphate on the chondrocyte -? Effect of chondroitin sulphate on the synovial membrane -? Effect of chondroitin sulphate on subchondral bone ?? Human use of chondroitin sulphate -? Chondrotin sulphate in osteoarthritis -? Chondrotin sulphate in psoriasis -? Chondrotin sulphate in atherosclerosis -? Chondroitin sulphate in IBD -? Chondroitin sulphate in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) -? Other autoimmune diseases that may benefit from chondroitin sulphate ?? Conclusions Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is a natural glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix and is formed by the 1?3 linkage of D-glucuronic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine. In chondrocytes, CS diminishes interleukin-1 p (IL-1p)-induced increases in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and decreases nuclear factor-KB (NF-kB) nuclear translocation and as a consequence, reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 p and TNF-a, and pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2). The mechanism of action of CS explains its beneficial effect on the cartilage, synovial membrane and subchondral bone. On the other hand, in vivo, CS given orally prevents hepatic NF-kB nuclear translocation, suggesting that systemic CS may elicit an anti-inflammatory effect in many tissues besides the articulation. There is preliminary evidence showing that in human beings, CS may be of benefit in other diseases where inflammation is an essential marker, such as psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The review of the literature suggest that CS might also be of interest for the treatment of other diseases with an inflammatory and/or autoimmune character, such as inflammatory bowel disease, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system and stroke, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - SUMMARY Allogeneic blood transfusions expose a patient to many soluble and cell-bound antigens, expressed on viable and decaying cells. In particular, contaminant leukocytes are presumed to play an important role interacting with the recipient's immune system. This immune response to transfusions is influenced by the condition of the patient, and a patient in steady state will respond differently to a patient in hemorrhagic shock, under anesthesia or after surgical tissue injury. Blood transfusions affect both the innate immediate defense immune system and the adaptive immune response, the latter often resulting in antibodies and (less well characterized) cellular immunity. Removal of allogeneic leukocytes by filtration of red cells and platelet products significantly reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and the formation of leukocyte antibodies, causing refractoriness to platelet transfusions. However, an effect of leukocyte-containing transfusions on cellular immune functions relevant to transplant tolerance, cancer surveillance, viral replication or susceptibility to nosocomial infections is less obvious. Randomized studies showed a significant effect of removal of allogeneic leukocytes in blood transfused to cardiac surgery patients, reducing postoperative mortality. As for the other reported clinical effects of (passenger) leukocytes in blood transfusions, there is not yet sufficient evidence.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aging and diabetes are known to be the major cause to affect the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been observed to accumulate in various organs especially in joint tissue and do damage to the joint tissue during aging and diabetes. Synovial angiogenesis and inflammation are observed across the full range of OA severity. The signaling pathway of AGEs on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and inflammatory responses in synoviocytes are still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and the signaling pathway involved in AGEs-induced VEGF production and inflammatory responses in human synoviocytes. Human synoviocytes were cultured and treated with AGEs (25?100?µg/ml). AGEs significantly induced the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and VEGF and the productions of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), VEGF, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) in human synoviocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, AGEs markedly activated the phosphorylations of I?B kinase (IKK)α/?, I?Bα, and nuclear factor (NF)-?B-p65 proteins in human synoviocytes in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with neutralizing antibody for RAGE statistically significantly decreased the AGEs-induced increase in COX-2, VEGF, PGE2, IL-6, and MMP13 and AGEs-activated NF-?B pathway activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that AGEs are capable of inducing VEGF production and inflammatory responses via RAGE-NF-?B pathway activation in human synoviocytes. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Despite very significant technical and software improvements in flow cytometry (FCM) since the 1980's, the demand for a cytometric technology combining both quantitative cell analysis and morphological documentation in Cytomics became evident. Improvements in microtechnology and computing permit nowadays similar quantitative and stoichiometric single cell-based high-throughput analyses by microscopic instruments, like Slide-Based Cytometry (SBC). SBC and related techniques offer unique tools to perform complex immunophenotyping, thereby enabling diagnostic procedures during early disease stages. Multicolor or polychromatic analysis of cells by SBC is of special importance not only as a cytomics technology platform but also because of low quantities of required reagents and biological material. The exact knowledge of the location of each cell on the slide permits repetitive restaining and reanalysis of specimens. Various separate measurements of the same specimen can be ultimately fused to one database increasing the information obtained per cell. Relocation and optical evaluation of cells as typical SBC feature, can be of integral importance for cytometric analysis, since artifacts can be excluded and morphology of measured cells can be documented. Progress in cell analytic: In the SBC, new horizons can be opened by the new techniques of structural and functional analysis with the high resolution from intracellular and membrane (confocal microscopy, nanoscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and tissue level (tissomics), to organ and organism level (in vivo cytometry, optical whole body imaging). Predictive medicine aims at the detection of changes in patient's state prior to the manifestation of the disease or the complication. Such instances concern immune consequences of surgeries or noninfectious posttraumatic shock in intensive care patients or the pretherapeutic identification of high risk patients in cancer cytostatic therapy. Preventive anti-infectious or anti-shock therapy as well as curative chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation may provide better survival chances for patient at concomitant cost containment. Predictive medicine-guided optimization of therapy could lead to individualized medicine that gives significant therapeutic effect and may lower or abrogate potential therapeutic side effects. The 10th Leipziger Workshop combined with the 3rd International Workshop on SBC aimed to offer new methods in Image- and Slide-Based Cytometry for solutions in clinical research. It moved towards practical applications in the clinics and the clinical laboratory. This development will be continued in 2006 at the upcoming Leipziger Workshop and the International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry. ? 2005 International Society for Analytical Cytology

AB  - Summary All organisms are exposed constantly to a variety of infectious and injurious stimuli. These induce inflammatory responses tailored to the threat posed. While the innate immune system is the front line of response to each stimulant, it has been considered traditionally to lack memory, acting in a generic fashion until the adaptive immune arm can take over. This outmoded simplification of the roles of innate and acquired arms of the immune system has been challenged by evidence of myeloid cells altering their response to subsequent encounters based on earlier exposure. This concept of ?innate immune memory? has been known for nearly a century, and is accepted among myeloid biologists. In recent years other innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells, have been shown to display memory, suggesting that innate immune memory is a trait common to several cell types. During the last 30 years, evidence has slowly accumulated in favour of not only haematopoietic cells, but also stromal cells, being imbued with memory following inflammatory episodes. A recent publication showing this also to be true in epithelial cells suggests innate immune memory to be widespread, if under-appreciated, in non-haematopoietic cells. In this review, we will examine the evidence supporting the existence of innate immune memory in stromal cells. We will also discuss the ramifications of memory in long-lived tissue-resident cells. Finally, we will pose questions we feel to be important in the understanding of these forgotten cells in the field of innate memory.

AB  - Abstract Copper is an essential micronutrient and a key catalytic cofactor in a wide range of enzymes. As a trace element, copper levels are tightly regulated and both its deficit and excess are deleterious to the organism. Under inflammatory conditions, serum copper levels are increased and trigger oxidative stress responses that activate inflammatory responses. Interestingly, copper dyshomeostasis, oxidative stress and inflammation are commonly present in several chronic diseases. Copper exposure can be easily modeled in zebrafish; a consolidated model in toxicology with increasing interest in immunity-related research. As a result of developmental, economical and genetic advantages, this freshwater teleost is uniquely suitable for chemical and genetic large-scale screenings, representing a powerful experimental tool for a whole-organism approach, mechanistic studies, disease modeling and beyond. Copper toxicological and more recently pro-inflammatory effects have been investigated in both larval and adult zebrafish with breakthrough findings. Here, we provide an overview of copper metabolism in health and disease and its effects on oxidative stress and inflammation responses in zebrafish models. Copper-induced inflammation is highlighted owing to its potential to easily mimic pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory features that combined with zebrafish genetic tractability could help further in the understanding of copper metabolism, inflammatory responses and related diseases.

AB  - Neutrophil activation and adhesion must be tightly controlled to prevent complications associated with excessive inflammatory responses. The role of the anti-inflammatory peptide chemerin15 (C15) and the receptor ChemR23 in neutrophil physiology is unknown. Here, we report that ChemR23 is expressed in neutrophil granules and rapidly upregulated upon neutrophil activation. C15 inhibits integrin activation and clustering, reducing neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis in vitro. In the inflamed microvasculature, C15 rapidly modulates neutrophil physiology inducing adherent cell detachment from the inflamed endothelium, while reducing neutrophil recruitment and heart damage in a murine myocardial infarction model. These effects are mediated through ChemR23. We identify the C15/ChemR23 pathway as a new regulator and thus therapeutic target in neutrophil-driven pathologies.
