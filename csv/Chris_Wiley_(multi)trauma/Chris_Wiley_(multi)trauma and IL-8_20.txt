AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in many tissues, is most highly concentrated in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. HA is believed to have an important role in wound healing. HA is thought to be actively produced during wound healing and tissue repair to provide a framework for ingrowth of blood vessels and fibroblasts. The present study was performed to investigate the histology, levels, and molecular weight of hyaluronan in human open dermal wounds. Methods:? Dermal wounds were created using a 4?mm punch biopsy on the buttocks of 10 healthy adult subjects. Wounds were harvested using a 6?mm punch biopsy at postwound days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Tissue was then extracted for determining hyaluronan levels using a biotin hyaluronic acid link protein assay. The molecular weight distribution of hyaluronan was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Histology was performed using HA biotinylated binding protein with hyaluronidase controls. Results:? The levels of hyaluronan were found to have a bimodal distribution within the 28-day time course. Levels of HA increased from baseline values 12.4?±?6.3 to 47.3?±?7.5 (p?<?0.05) on postwound day 1. The lowest HA levels were found on postwound day 3 (26.4?±?8.5), with levels again increasing on postwound day 7 to the highest levels 73.4?±?13.6 (p?<?0.05). Postwound days 14 and 28 showed levels gradually declining toward baseline (49.4?±?5.7, 43.9?±?6.8). Molecular weight analysis showed smaller size HA on postwound day 1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in the granulation tissue of healing wounds. Conclusion:? This is the first detailed examination of HA expression in human wounds. The bimodal display of HA levels in these wounds suggest that HA may be subject to fragmentation at times when the inflammatory index of these wounds is greatest.

AB  - Wound healing is a complicated biological process that involves interactions of multiple cell types, various growth factors, their mediators and the extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we have studied the differential regulation of angiogenic genes during wound healing in transgenic diabetic mice and non-diabetic mice. One 8?mm full thickness cutaneous wound under aseptic conditions was created on either side of the midline. Wound tissues were studied at 4, 7, and 11 days postwounding and healing was assessed by histology. The pathway specific gene expression profile of wound tissue in transgenic diabetic mice was compared with the normal mice. Profiling of these genes showed differential regulation of many angiogenic promoters, inhibitors, growth factors and cytokines. Furthermore, in our study hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1a), osteopontin (OPN) and osteonectin are induced early at day 4, in both the diabetic and nondiabetic wound. The expression was downregulated by 11-day postwounding in the nondiabetic wound, whereas diabetic wounds showed constitutively high expression of these genes. The expression patterns of these genes were concomitant with the extent of healing as assessed by histology at different time point postwounding. These results suggest wound healing is a complex process that involves cascade of interaction of various factors. Although a single gene may not be solely responsible for any impairment in healing; however, an in-depth study of these genes and precise balance between the inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis may provide an answer to the delayed healing in diabetic conditions.

AB  - Substance P(SP) modulates cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression by inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to injury. A major proinflammatory effect includes nitric oxide(NO) production. Three nitric oxide synthase(NOS) isoforms include neuronal(nNOS), inducible(iNOS), and endothelial(eNOS). In this study, we determined which NOS enzymes mediate SP-induced NO upregulation in endothelial cells. Confluent human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with SP(10?8?M) for 48?h with and without the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 4?uM) or specific inhibitors against nNOS (L-thiocitrulline;60?nM), iNOS (n-3-aminomethyl benzyl acetamidine;7?nM), eNOS (N-5-1-iminoethyl-L-ornithine; 0.5?uM). Inhibitors were added for 3?h prior to and continued throughout SP stimulation. Nitrate/nitrite levels were measured in cell extracts using Greiss reagents and standardized with protein concentration for each sample. Results are expressed as uM nitrate/mg protein. Statistical analysis was determined using ANOVA. Result are expressed as mean?±?sd; p?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. SP effectively elevated nitrate levels (2.96?uM/mg protein;p?≤?0.05) compared to control treatment (2.1?uM/mg protein). All NOS inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on substance P induced NO production. However, only L-NAME (1.9?uM/mg protein) and the specific eNOS inhibitor (2.32?uM/mg protein) demonstrated a significant decrease (p?<?0.05.) Our data suggest that SP up-regulation of NO in HMECs is primarily mediated by eNOS, but that other NOS enzymes may also contribute. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of NOS in SP signaling.

AB  - Aims:? A method to test the axial and transverse tensile properties of skin was developed in order to improve our understanding of the mechanical behavior of skin, and how it changes with the scarring response. This experimental technique was used to investigate the bidirectional mechanics of skin in the juvenile Yorkshire pig model. Methods:? Skin samples were taken upon sacrifice, and all subcutaneous tissue was carefully removed via dissection. Dumbbell-shaped specimens were obtained from the skin using a custom designed stainless steel punch, to provide consistent geometry, and to avoid stress concentrations that can result from specimen gripping. Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions. Specimens were secured in an INSTRON universal test machine with serrated soft tissue grips, elongated to a desired preload, subjected to a 10% elongation and held for a 4-min isometric period. They were then returned to the original length and failed in tension at constant velocity. Results:? This method of sample preparation indicated high repeatability in specimen geometry, showing standard deviations of 2% and 3% in gauge length and width, respectively (N?=?12). Furthermore, no slippage was observed at the skin/grip interface, and all failures occurred within the specimen gauge length. Conclusions:? This technique shows great promise for evaluating the viscoelastic and failure properties of skin, scar tissue, and pathologic scarring. Combining this biomechanical method with our parallel studies in molecular biology and biochemistry can likely produce correlations between constituent material organization and the mechanical properties of the tissue, as well as provide valuable information for the design of bioengineered tissue constructs.

AB  - Despite recent advances in wound care, chronic infected ulcers still remain a huge challenge to the modern society. Nitric oxide has been identified as a mediator for important biological processes such as vasodilation, antimicrobial, and wound repair. The aim of the present study was to explore the antimicrobial properties of exogenous nitric oxide gas (gNO) as well as its effect on skin cells in vitro. To test this, a specialized gNO chamber was designed to expose S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in saline continuously to 200?ppm gNO or air. A colony count was obtained following gNO treatment. Furthermore, fibroblast-populated collagen gel, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells were cultured in DMEM, KSFM, and M199, respectively. Endothelial migration was tested by a 3D Matrigel tubule formation assay. Fibroblast matrix production and keratinocyte differentiation were monitored by mRNA expression of procollagen type I, interstitial collagenase, and involucrin. All cells were exposed to 200?ppm gNO for 8 hours a day for 3 consecutive days. A MTT assay was used to observe cell proliferation. The results revealed 100% bacterial kill following 4 hour exposure to 200?ppm gNO. Interestingly this dose did not exhibit any significant toxic effect on fibroblast, keratinocyte, and endothelial proliferation. Dermal fibroblasts migration out of the collagen gel was not affected by gNO treatment when compared to the control. The keratinocytes in both groups were able to express involucrin, an indicator of cell?s ability to differentiate. The migration and tube formation by endothelial cells within the matrigel was not compromised following gNO treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence for potential application of gNO for reducing bacterial burden in chronic infected wounds without compromising re-epithilialization, proliferation, and angiogenesis in the wound healing process.

AB  - Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the binding and diffusion of growth factors in model extracellular matrices in order to investigate the importance of protein-matrix interactions in regulating signaling molecules within a three-dimensional matrix. Two important growth factors were studied, transforming growth factor ?1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are known to have specific affinities for fibronectin and the heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan perlecan, respectively. Collagen-based matrices were prepared by polymerizing type I collagen in the presence of fibronectin or perlecan, and we measured diffusion constants and binding constants of the two growth factors. The binding constant measured for transforming growth factor ?1 with fibronectin-containing matrices was in good agreement with that measured using affinity chromatography. However, the interactions measured between fibroblast growth factor and perlecan were significantly weaker than expected. Surprisingly, the strongest interactions by far were with monomeric collagen solutions and fibrillar collagen matrices. Our findings suggest a central role for the three-dimensional fibrillar collagen matrix in growth factor interactions, with modulatory roles for fibronectin or perlecan.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are present in saliva and may impact wound healing within the oral cavity. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that psychosocial factors such as elevated depression scores are associated with delayed oral wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between salivary levels of EGF and VEGF and depression and loneliness scores. Whole saliva was collected from 43 individuals in groups aged 18?35 years and 50+?years. On the same day, volunteers were asked to complete the Beck?s Depression Inventory (BDI) and the UCLA loneliness scale. Salivary concentrations of EGF and VEGF were determined by standard ELISA. Mean concentrations of EGF and VEGF were 2860?pg/ml and 421?pg/ml, respectively. In the younger age group, significant negative correlations were found between scores on the BDI and UCLA indices and salivary levels of EGF. A median split, based upon BDI scores, similarly revealed that more depressed or lonely individuals exhibited significantly lower EGF levels. A similar trend was observed for VEGF. These preliminary results indicate that psychosocial factors such as depression and loneliness may be related to growth factor expression in saliva. This, in turn, may play a part in the delayed mucosal wound healing observed in depressed individuals. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - Wound healing is a complex biological event orchestrated by various resident and infiltrating cell types spanning multiple stages. Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease released upon wounding, stimulates fibroblasts and macrophages at the sites of wounds to express, chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). We have used cellular and molecular approaches to investigate the mechanisms involved in thrombin induces IL-8 expression in human macrophages. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR show that thrombin stimulates IL-8 in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. Various inhibitors for signal transduction proteins were used to delineate the pathways involved. We found that, at nanomolar concentrations, inhibitors for both c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and NFÉ»B strongly inhibited the thrombin-induced production of IL-8 suggesting that they are major regulators of this stimulation. JNK was shown to be phorsphorylated in a time-dependent manner in response to thrombin treatment confirming its involvement. In order to identify the mediator of JNK and the thrombin receptor, we use affinity pull down and found that Rho GTPase was activated by thrombin suggesting that Rho may be the mediator of JNK activation. In addition, we found that PKC is a negative regulator of thrombin-induced IL-8 expression. Our study broadens the horizon of how IL-8 is regulated in wound healing and may help develop pharmaceutical methods to manipulate this process in pathological conditions.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate the effects of hibernation drugs on early wound sepsis in severely scalded rats. Methods:? Sprague-Dawley rats inflicted 30% TBSA deep thickness were randomly divided into A (immediate resuscitation) and B (immediate resuscitation and lytic cocktail). After infusion of 108?CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wound on third postburn day, survival was compared between two groups. Local tissue samples and plasma were collected and the plasma level of IL-2 mRNA, IL-4 mRNA, IL-10 mRNA, and IFN-? mRNA were assayed by fluorescence PCR. Results:? Compared with Group A, host survival significantly increased (0.663?±?0.026, P?<?0.01), viscera injury decrease in group B after infusion bacteria. The plasma Th1 cytokine mRNA (IL-2, IFN-?) levels in B group were significantly increased compared with A group. However, the plasma Th2 cytokine mRNA (IL-4, IL-10) levels in group B were not as significantly increased as group A. Conclusions:? Immediate resuscitation with hibernation drugs can decrease viscera injury after sepsis, increase host survival and improve host immune system by preventing Th1 cell from over activation and decrease Th2 cytokines.

AB  - Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process that ends with scar formation in adult skin. In contrast, fetal skin within the first and second trimesters of development heals without a scar. One of the most important aspects of scarless fetal wound repair appears to be the lack of inflammation in these wounds, suggesting that acute inflammation can promote scar formation in the skin. While it is well accepted that inflammation causes scar formation in the fetus, it is not known what specific factors produced during inflammation are responsible for these effects. The present experiments tested the possibility that oxidants released by activated inflammatory cells can contribute to scar tissue production by inducing inflammation in the fetus. Using a murine fetal wound repair model we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide increased E15 (embryonic day 15) fibroblast proliferation and ultimately interfered with scarless healing in E15 skin, possibly through the induction of TGF-?1. Defining the factors produced during the inflammatory response that contribute to scar formation could be important for the development of new therapies designed to minimize adult scarring.

AB  - An initiative to bring wound care ?back to the bedside? was introduced in a large teaching hospital. Wound consultation was available from either a nurse or physician member of a hospital-based wound team. Confusion over whom to consult coupled with multiple product options led to decreased critical thinking at the bedside. The volume of consultations precluded follow-up visits by the team, further fragmenting care. The proposed solution included partnering with a sole vendor to standardize wound products and assist with education on product selection and function. New policies and procedures were created. Each patient unit was staffed by a Nurse clinical specialist as part of a hospital-wide ?Magnet? application process. This individual assumed the role of ?skin care leader? and was required to attend two in-depth educational programs. All skin care leaders were required to become part of a hospital-wide quarterly prevalence and incidence project. The wound nurse assumed a more ?consultative? role for the skin care leaders who subsequently assisted the end user in this model; the bedside nurse. This paradigm shift in care did not result in any statistically significant changes in wound incidence and reintroduced skin care as an integral component of the assessment and care for the bedside nurse. This presentation will describe the process in detail. Acknowledgments:? This study was supported with an educational grant from Smith and Nephew, Largo, FL.

AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - Impaired wound healing is a problem for immobilized patients, diabetics, and the elderly. The 43 amino acid angiogenic peptide thymosin ?4 has previously been found to promote accelerated dermal wound repair in rats, aged mice and db/db diabetic mice, and corneal repair in normal rats. It has been found in great abundance in wound fluid. Here, we hypothesized that thymosin ?4 may regulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in cells that are involved in wound repair. Western blot analysis of keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts that were treated with increasing concentrations of thymosin ?4 showed changes in the expression of the MMP-1, ?2, and ?9. Zymographic analysis of whole excised mouse wounds taken after homogenization also showed changes in MMP-2 and-9 expression over a 3-day period. These results were confirmed in 2-day-old wounds by RT-PCR. We conclude that part of the wound healing activity of thymosin ?4 resides in its ability to increase protease activity. Since thymosin ?4-induced protease activity can be further controlled by inflammatory cytokines, a regulatory role for thymosin ?4 is proposed in wound healing. These studies suggest that thymosin ?4 may play a pivotal role in extracellular matrix remodeling during wound repair and may be effective in the treatment of chronic wounds in humans.

AB  - Sepsis remains a common and serious complication of major burn injury and currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in burn patients. Burns have been associated with high levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppression which promotes systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, for which no effective treatment is currently available. Defensins and cathelicidins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides, are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in the body?s defense by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. Our prior studies using RT-PCR and fluorescence deconvolution microscopy suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin 2 (HBD2) in burn wounds. In this study we have characterized cathelicidin (LL-37) protein levels using in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns and in unburned skin. Our results show that in unburned skin, the majority of LL-37 was located in the malphigian layer and was concentrated on the stratum corneum as well as colocalized with sweat ducts. In burned skin, in which the epidermis was destroyed, this pattern of LL-37 was absent. The surviving dermal and subcutaneous layers revealed LL-37 presence in very high concentrations colocalized with sweat duct epithelia. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression, and sepsis.

AB  - Diabetic wounds are characterized by disruption of the normal wound repair responses, particularly at the inflammatory and proliferative stages. Inadequate levels of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), play a significant role in the impaired healing of these wounds. PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemotactic agent, and is released from platelet alpha-granules during the acute inflammatory phase of wound healing. It has been shown to promote the deposition of collagen and granulation tissue, and improves healing in diabetic animals. Although previous studies have shown some success with topically applied PDGF, results in clinical practice have been moderate. In this study, we investigated whether gene therapy with lentiviral vectors carrying the gene for PDGF can improve wound healing in an animal model. Full thickness 2?cm???2?cm dermal wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vectors containing the human PDGF-beta gene (lenti-PDGF) were injected into the wound margins and along the wound base. Control experiments were performed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections. Mice were sacrificed after 21 days, and wound tissues were harvested for histological analyses. Lenti-PDGF-treated animals demonstrated significantly smaller residual epithelial gaps compared to PBS controls (0.77 +/? 0.07?cm vs. 1.22 +/? 0.30?cm; P?<?0.001), as well as a greater degree of wound closure (85 +/? 3% vs. 57 +/? 22%; P?<?0.05). Lentiviral gene therapy with PDGF is effective in promoting wound healing in genetically diabetic animals, and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Skin wound healing requires temporally and spatially coordinated motility of multiple skin cell types. The limited success of current skin wound care is due to lack of understanding about how the healing processes begin, progress, and complete. One of the most dramatic environmental changes in an acute wound is the transition from plasma to serum. The cells in the wound come into contact with serum, instead of a filtrate of plasma, for the first time. We report here that this transition differentially regulates the migration of various skin cell types. Plasma promotes dermal fibroblast and endothelia cell, but not keratinocyte and melanocyte, motility. In contrast, serum selectively promotes keratinocyte motility and inhibits fibroblast and endothelial cell motility. The key regulators are the increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in serum and the distinct TGF-beta receptor (I, II and III) profiles in different cell types. TGF-beta selectively inhibits fibroblast and endothelial cell, but not keratinocyte and melanocyte, migration. Neutralization of TGF-beta function in serum eliminates the differential effects between serum and plasma. Manipulations of the TGF-beta receptor profiles in the cells, especially TGF-beta receptor II and III, convert TGF-beta-insensitive cell types to sensitive cell types and vice versa, and their responses to plasma and serum. This is the first study that reveals a molecular mechanism for coordinating multiple skin cell-type motility in wounds.

AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) is a potent cell mitogen and chemotactic signal involved in normal wound healing. PDGF-B is present at decreased levels in diabetic wounds and has been shown to improve wound healing when applied in a topical form. However, clinical results with topical PDGF in the treatment of diabetic wounds have been equivocal. In this study, we investigated whether application of PDGF-B via gene therapy can effectively promote wound healing in the diabetic environment in an animal model. Retroviral vectors carrying the gene for human PDGF-B were constructed using the LNCX virus and the G418 resistance gene for selection (LN-PDGF-B), and transduced into mouse dermal fibroblasts. LN-PDGF-B transduced fibroblasts were seeded into alginate hydrogel scaffolds at a concentration of 25???106 cells/implant and implanted into 2?cm???2?cm full thickness excisional dermal wounds created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. At 21 days, animals treated with LN-PDGF-B transduced cells suspended in alginate hydrogel demonstrated a significantly smaller epithelial gap (0.97 +/? 0.34?cm) than animals receiving untransduced mouse dermal fibroblasts alone (1.44 +/? 0.37?cm; P?<?0.05) or animals receiving dermal fibroblasts transduced with LNCX viral vector alone (1.40 +/? 0.20?cm; P?<?0.01). These results suggest tissue-engineered retroviral gene therapy with PDGF-B specifically promotes diabetic wound healing and may yield advances in the effective treatment of diabetic wounds.

AB  - Vacuum Assisted Closure?(or V.A.C.?)* Therapy is the negative pressure wound therapy provided by the V.A.C.? System, available from KCI USA, Inc. This study was conducted in young Yorkshire swine to evaluate the effect of V.A.C.? locally and systemically on wound healing and cytokine levels in wound fluid and tissue and in serum. Two full thickness, excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of swine. In Group 1 (n?=?6), one wound received V.A.C.? Therapy using a polyurethane foam V.A.C.? dressing and 125?mm?Hg continuous negative pressure, and the second wound received DuoDERM?** without negative pressure. Group 2 animals (n?=?4) served as controls and received only DuoDERM? on both wounds. Blood, wound fluid, and biopsy samples were taken at predetermined intervals and the levels of 10 cytokines and growth factors, the acute-phase inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunoglobulins M & G were tested by ELISA. Preliminary data from the first phase of the study (n?=?2 swine/group) indicated a trend toward lower serum CRP values and higher serum IgM and IgG levels in swine treated with V.A.C.? Therapy compared to controls. The remaining swine are being evaluated to determine whether V.A.C.? Therapy moderates the local inflammatory wound healing response. In addition, testing of splenic lymphocyte and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte functions are being performed to study possible systemic effects on the immune system.

AB  - The role of proteases in chronic wounds has been the subject of many investigations in recent years. These studies have reported biochemical differences between chronic and acute wound fluids and have shown that elevated levels of proteases, in particular the matrix metalloproteinases are abundant in chronic wounds. While this has led to the hypothesis that the chronic wound environment is hostile and not conducive to wound repair, it is still unknown whether this is due to a direct or indirect defect in protease regulation or their inhibitors. We hypothesize that an excess of proteases, specifically the serine proteases present in chronic wounds, are primarily responsible for this hostile wound environment. These proteases degrade endogenous growth factors, reducing their efficacy and delaying healing. In this study, fluid and tissue from chronic and acute wounds were collected over a 24-hour period. Using ELISA, samples were assessed for protease activity (specifically elastase and typsin-like enzymes), their inhibitors and growth factors. Our results show that serine proteases, predominantly elastase, were significantly elevated in the chronic wound fluids. The serpins designed to control these proteases were not up-regulated when compared to the acute controls, resulting in excessive proteolytic activity. An increase in serine protease production without an increase in their serpins is thought to result in a reduction in growth factors, an effect, which was also observed in the chronic wound samples. This work indicates that there is an imbalance in the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme, due to an up regulation of protease production in chronic wounds. We also conclude that misregulation of serine proteases may be responsible for the observed excessive degradation of the extracellular matrix and growth factors in these chronic wounds.

AB  - Clinically the outcome of pressure ulcers is predicted by the severity/stage of the ulcer, patient health and health care options. These factors, however, cannot be used to accurately evaluate the prognosis and healing in these ulcers, thus delaying any required change in the treatment plan. Techniques are needed that can help in the assessment of healing and improve the clinical management of these ulcers. Studies of tissue health such as angiogenesis, by measuring blood flow in the ulcer at different time points, has been examined as a way to evaluate the state of healing ulcers. Although the Laser Doppler Perfusion Imager (LDPI) has been used to assess various wounds, there is a need to validate it as a predictor of wound healing. The standard clinical outcome parameter for skin wounds has been time to heal. To validate the LDPI as predictor of healing, however, a measure that gives periodic feedback such as healing rate is a more useful outcome measure. The goal of this study therefore was to determine a protocol for the LDPI and evaluate its ability to predict healing in pressure ulcers. Previous studies have indicated that perfusion values obtained after heat stress may reflect the blood flow more accurately than absolute perfusion values. It was hypothesized that the difference in the blood perfusion after heat provocation is expected to correlate with the healing rate. The selected heat provocation (increase of 20?°F) was evaluated on five spinal cord injured pressure ulcer patients. The LDPI assessment and healing rate measurements were done weekly for 5 weeks. Preliminary results suggest a relationship between the difference in the perfusion and the healing rate for the following week. Further studies will be necessary to determine the exact relationship. This tool has the potential to play a critical role in the clinical management of pressure ulcers as well as other skin ulcers. Acknowledgments:?
