AB  - Abstract Patients with heart failure (HF) are at an increased risk of stroke, sudden death and venous thromboembolism, which are all linked to thrombus formation (thrombogenesis). The present ?viewpoint? article will discuss how the prothrombotic state in HF may be perpetuated by a chronic inflammatory state that is maladaptive. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that thrombogenesis and endothelial (dys)function can be intimately linked to inflammation in HF.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - New findings ?? What is the topic of this review? This review discusses the regulation of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene and how it is uniquely set up to respond to stress signals in skeletal muscle. We propose that skeletal muscle is a ?stress sensor? that responds by releasing highly active endocrine and paracrine proteins, such as IL-6. ?? What advances does this highlight? Recent discoveries on the regulation of the IL-6 gene in various stress exposures have resulted in the emergence of a new potential role for skeletal muscle in life-threatening stress conditions. Understanding the relationship between IL-6 secretion and stress may provide new insights into normal adaptive responses to disease, deconditioning, inflammation and ageing. Skeletal muscle has been identified as an endocrine organ owing to its capacity to produce and secrete a variety of cytokines (myokines) and other proteins. To date, myokines have primarily been studied in response to exercise or metabolic challenges; however, numerous observations suggest that skeletal muscle may also release myokines in response to certain categories of internal or external stress exposure. Internal stress signals include oxidative or nitrosative stress, damaged or unfolded proteins, hyperthermia or energy imbalance. External stress signals, which act as indicators of organismal stress or injury in other cells, employ mediators such as catecholamines, endotoxin, alarmins, ATP and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1?. External stress signals generally induce cellular responses through membrane receptor systems. In this review, we focus on the regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a prototypical stress response myokine and highlight evidence that IL-6 gene regulation in muscle is inherently organized to respond to a wide variety of internal and external stressors. Given that IL-6 can initiate protective, anti-inflammatory or restorative processes throughout the organism during life-threatening conditions, we present the argument that skeletal muscle has a physiological function as a sensor and responder to stress. Furthermore, we hypothesize that it may comprise a fundamental component of the organism's acute stress response.

AB  - Abstract Elevated serum procalcitonin (PCT) level has been reported to be a diagnostic index in systemic bacterial infections, but it can also increase in some non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Stevens?Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare immune-mediated cutaneous mucosal reaction which is susceptible to bacterial infections and may have elevated PCT levels. The value of serum PCT has not been assessed in series of SJS/TEN patients. We aimed to investigate the PCT levels in SJS/TEN patients with systemic bacterial infections (systemic infected group), with skin surface bacterial infections (skin surface infected group) and without infections (non-infected group), to assess whether PCT was a valuable indicator for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 42 inpatients with SJS/TEN were retrospectively analysis. The receiver?operator curve (ROC) was used to determine the diagnostic efficacy of PCT for systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that PCT levels in the systemic infected group were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CRP between the three groups. The cut-off PCT level of 0.65 ng/mL calculated by ROC had optimal diagnostic efficacy, with sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 89.7%, respectively. PCT and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis were positively correlated (P < 0.05). In conclusion, PCT is a valuable index and superior to CRP in detecting systemic bacterial infections in SJS/TEN patients. The level of PCT can partially reflect the severity of the disease.

AB  - Abstract: Bacterial sepsis remains a frequent complication after liver transplantation. We previously reported the results of a pilot study that suggested that low expression of HLA-DR on monocytes is a predictive marker for the occurrence of sepsis. We have studied the value of this marker in an additional cohort of patients, and have analyzed the relation of HLA-DR expression with the use of immunosuppressive agents. 20 adult liver transplantation patients were prospectively monitored during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. All were treated according to standard protocols. The percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR was measured by flow cytometry. In addition, the effects of incubation of monocytes with prednisolone in vitro on the expression of HLA-DR was determined in 7 healthy volunteers. Seven patients developed bacterial sepsis after a median 15 (range 10?20) days after transplantation. HLA-DR expression was significantly lower in these patients on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after transplantation compared with non-septic patients. The percentage of HLA-DR positive monocytes was 30% or less, 3 (1?8) days before onset of sepsis. On day 7 after transplantation, HLA-DR expression on 50% or less of monocytes had a positive predictive value for sepsis of 71%, whereas the negative predictive value was 85%. Patients who developed sepsis received significantly more prednisolone. Incubation with prednisolone in vitro lowered the expression of HLA-DR in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that low HLA-DR expression on monocytes is a marker for a high risk of subsequent sepsis in liver transplantation patients. This high risk may be (at least partly) related to the dose of prednisolone.

AB  - Objective? To investigate the development of gingival hyperplasia in dogs after renal transplantation and administration of microemulsified cyclosporine A (MCsA). Study Design? Experimental study. Animals? Healthy adult mongrel dogs (n=5). Methods? As part of study on renal transplantation, dogs administered MCsA (20?mg/kg/day), azathioprine, and prednisolone to prevent graft rejection were monitored for development of gingival changes. Prednisolone was discontinued after 3 months. MCsA dose was adjusted to maintain whole blood trough concentration of 400?700?ng/mL. Gingival change was evaluated by weekly examination and photodocumentation, and gingival biopsy for histopathology was performed at 28 weeks. Results? One dog was lost because of acute graft rejection. Gingival hyperplasia developed in 3 of 4 dogs. The earliest gingival changes occurred in the interdental papillae at 20 weeks after transplantation. On histopathology, the underlying connective tissue was thickened and contained increase numbers of fibroblasts and inflammatory infiltrates. Conclusions? Long-term immunosuppression with an MCsA-based treatment likely induces substantial gingival hyperplasia when therapeutic, immunosuppressive blood levels of MCsA were maintained for 32 weeks. Clinical Relevance? MCsA is used for immune-mediated diseases and preventing rejection after transplant in dogs. MCsA blood levels, and gingival hyperplasia should be monitored by routine examination of the interdental papilla in dogs administered MCsA for long periods.

AB  - Abstract Models of sepsis have been instructive in understanding the sequence of events in animals and, to an extent, in humans with sepsis. Events developing early in sepsis suggest that a hyperinflammatory state exists, accompanied by a buildup of oxidants in tissues reflective of a redox imbalance. Development of immunosuppression and degraded innate and adaptive immune responses are well-established complications of sepsis. In addition, there is robust activation of the complement system, which contributes to the harmful effects of sepsis. These events appear to be associated with development of multiorgan failure. The relevance of animal models of sepsis to human sepsis and the failure of human clinical trials are discussed, together with suggestions as to how clinical trial design might be improved.

AB  - Summary Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are short-lived phagocytic cells that serve as cardinal early cellular effectors of innate immunity. Both oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms contribute to microbial killing by the neutrophil. Neutrophil defence mechanisms are potent but non-specific, with the result that inadvertent injury to host tissues commonly accompanies the activation of a neutrophil-mediated response; this bystander injury has been implicated in the tissue injury of sepsis. The capacity for neutrophils to cause injury to host tissues is attenuated by the relatively short in vivo lifespan of the neutrophil, a consequence of a constitutively expressed program of apoptosis. That program can be inhibited, and neutrophil survival prolonged, through the interaction of the neutrophil with a variety of mediators of both microbial and host origin. These, in turn, inhibit apoptosis by increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes within the neutrophil: interleukin (IL)1? and a novel cytokine-like molecule pre-B cell colonyenhancing factor (PBEF) are central to this inhibitory influence. Conversely, the phagocytosis of a micro-organism activates the apoptotic program, and so contributes to the resolution of acute inflammation. A complex series of interactions between the neutrophil and microorganisms or their products regulates the duration and intensity of an inflammatory response, and so provides an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation.

AB  - Abstract Respiratory viral infections have a major impact on health. Acute respiratory illnesses, largely caused by viruses, are the most common illness experienced by otherwise healthy adults and children. Data from the United States, collected in the 1992 National Health Interview Survey, suggest that such illnesses are experienced at a rate of 85.6 illnesses per 100 persons per year and account for 54% of all acute conditions exclusive of injuries (1). A total of 44% of these illnesses require medical attention and result in 287 days of restricted activity, 94.4 days lost from work, and 182 days lost from school per 100 persons per year. The morbidity of acute respiratory disease in the family setting is significant. The Tecumseh study, a family-based surveillance study of respiratory illness, estimated that approximately one-quarter of respiratory illnesses result in consultation with a physician (2). Illness rates for all acute respiratory conditions are highest in young children, and children below the age of 9 have been estimated to experience between five and nine respiratory illnesses per year (3).

AB  - Abstract The application of protein (or peptide) biomarkers in clinical studies is a dynamic, ever-growing field. The introduction of clinical proteomics/peptidomics, such as mass spectrometry?based assays and multiplexed antibody?based protein arrays, has reshaped the landscape of biomarker identification and validation, allowing the discovery of novel biomarkers at an unprecedented rate and reliability. To reflect the current status with respect to implementation of protein/peptide biomarkers, an investigation of the most recent (last 6 years) clinical studies from clinicaltrials.gov is presented. Forty-two clinical trials involving the direct use of protein or peptide biomarkers in patient stratification and/or disease diagnosis and prognosis are highlighted. Most of the clinical trials that include proteomics/protein assays are aiming toward implementation of non-invasive diagnostic tools for early detection, while many of the clinical trials are targeting to correlate the protein abundance with the risk of a disease event. Less in number are the studies in which the protein biomarkers are applied to stratify the patients for intervention. All the above areas of application are considered of great importance for improving disease management, in an era where implementation toward precision medicine is the desired outcome of proteomics biomarker research.

The efferent branch of the reflex the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which inhibits inflammation by suppressing cytokine synthesis via release of acetylcholine in organs of the reticuloendothelial system, including the spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Acetylcholine binds to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed by macrophages and other cytokine-producing cells. Receptor-ligand engagement suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and prevents tissue damage. Herein is a review of some of the experimental studies that define the inflammatory reflex and its anatomic and physiologic components.

AB  - Immunoassays have long been an important set of tools in clinical laboratories for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Over the last two decades, there has been growing interest in utilizing CE as a means for conducting immunoassays with clinical samples. The resulting method is known as a CE immunoassay. This approach makes use of the selective and strong binding of antibodies for their targets, as is employed in a traditional immunoassay, and combines this with the speed, efficiency, and small sample requirements of CE. This review discusses the variety of ways in which CE immunoassays have been employed with clinical samples. An overview of the formats and detection modes that have been employed in these applications is first presented. A more detailed discussion is then given on the type of clinical targets and samples that have been measured or studied by using CE immunoassays. Particular attention is given to the use of this method in the fields of endocrinology, pharmaceutical measurements, protein and peptide analysis, immunology, infectious disease detection, and oncology. Representative applications in each of these areas are described, with these examples involving work with both traditional and microanalytical CE systems.

Methods Study dogs were classified into non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis groups and blood was drawn on Day 1 of the patient's hospitalisation for measurement of serum homocysteine, folate and cobalamin concentrations. Homocysteine concentration was measured in 51 clinically healthy dogs to serve as the control group. Results A statistically significant difference was found between the homocysteine concentrations of the healthy group when compared to non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis groups. Homocysteine values were not correlated with folate, cobalamin or APPLEfast severity scores. Homocysteine concentrations were significantly lower in sick dogs when compared to the control group, which is dissimilar to the human population. Clinical Significance The clinical significance of homocysteine changes in critically ill dogs is currently unknown.
