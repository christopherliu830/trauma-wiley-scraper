AB  - Abstract Objective Since the initial description of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in the early 1900s, classification of this disease has been in flux. The goal of this manuscript is to review the existing literature and to revisit definitions and diagnostic criteria for AgP. Study analysis An extensive literature search was performed that included databases from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Of 4930 articles reviewed, 4737 were eliminated. Criteria for elimination included; age > 30 years old, abstracts, review articles, absence of controls, fewer than; a) 200 subjects for genetic studies, and b) 20 subjects for other studies. Studies satisfying the entrance criteria were included in tables developed for AgP (localized and generalized), in areas related to epidemiology, microbial, host and genetic analyses. The highest rank was given to studies that were; a) case controlled or cohort, b) assessed at more than one time-point, c) assessed for more than one factor (microbial or host), and at multiple sites. Results Epidemiologic studies provided insight into ethnic and societal factors affecting AgP. DNA analysis of microbes showed some consistency but significant variability. Host factor analysis was less consistent. Many genetic studies were conducted but few had either sufficient power or looked at multiple genes in AgP. Conclusions Conflicting data resulted for several reasons; 1) the classification was too broad, 2) the disease (AgP) was not studied from its inception, at differing time points (temporal), and at different locations (topographic). New technologic advances coupled with a more delimiting definition of disease will allow for genetic, host and microbial factor analyses in an unbiased manner. As such we predict that progress can be made in identifying a robust group of genetic, host, and microbial risk-markers associated with periodontal disease that can improve diagnostic capability in disease associated with juveniles, adolescents, and post-adolescent individuals.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the changes in gene expression known up to date that are associated with the application of orthodontic forces to induce orthodontic tooth movement. Histological and immunohistochemical studies have clearly demonstrated that orthodontic forces stimulate remodeling of the periodontal ligament (PDL). The application of orthodontic forces elicits a physical, cellular and molecular response from the PDL for affecting all tissues that constitute the periodontium including blood vessels. In order to achieve tooth movement, remodeling of the alveolar bone surrounding the dental roots is required. Bone remodeling in response to orthodontic forces requires the synchronized action of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and PDL cells. As expected, orthodontic tooth movement evokes a pronounced biological reaction in the dental pulp as well. The pulpal response to orthodontic force involves cell damage, inflammation and wound healing, processes that could adversely affect the dental pulp.

AB  - Abstract Many diseases caused by inflammatory processes can progress to a chronic state causing deterioration in the quality of life and a poor prognosis for long-term survival. To address inflammatory diseases effectively, early detection and novel therapeutics are required. However, this can be challenging, in part because of the lack of early predictive biomarkers and the limited availability of adequate technologies capable of the identification/characterization of key predictive biomarkers present in biological materials, especially those found at picomolar concentrations and below. This review highlights the need for state-of-the art methodologies, with high-sensitivity and high-throughput capabilities, for determination of multiple biomarkers. Although many new biomarkers have been discovered recently, existing technology has failed to successfully bring this advancement to the patient's bedside. We present an overview of the various advances available today to extend the discovery of predictive biomarkers of inflammatory diseases; in particular, we review the technology of immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE), which combines the use of antibodies as highly selective capture agents with the high resolving power of capillary electrophoresis. This two-dimensional hybrid technology permits the quantification and characterization of several protein biomarkers simultaneously, including subtle structural changes such as variants, isoforms, peptide fragments, and post-translational modifications. Furthermore, the results are rapid, sensitive, can be performed at a relatively low cost, without the introduction of false positive or false negative data. The IACE instrumentation can have relevance to medical, pharmaceutical, environmental, military, cultural heritage (authenticity of art work), forensic science, industrial and research fields, and in particular as a point-of-care biomarker analyzer in translational medicine.

AB  - Abstract Background and objectives The aim of this study was to assess cellular and peritoneal immune responses after radical laparoscopic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods Peripheral heparinized plasma and plain serum tube samples were collected preoperatively, and at 2 hr, 1 day, and 4 days postoperatively for analysis o; white blood cells, total lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-suppressor lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A. Twenty-four hours peritoneal fluid collection was performed on days 1 and 4 for TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 analysis. Results No statistical differences were observed between the two groups with respect to immunocompetent cell counts. The serum levels of plasma CRP and SAA gradually increased significantly with time in both groups, but these temporal increases were lower in the LADG group (CRP; P?=?0.03, SAA; P?=?0.01). Peritoneal TNF-α levels in the CODG group at 4 days postoperatively were significantly higher than at day 1, but remained almost unchanged in the LADG group, and this difference was significant (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Because of its association with reduced peritoneal immune activity, laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer may require careful consideration in practice. Additional, larger prospective multicenter trials are required before a consensus can be reached. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:54?59. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
