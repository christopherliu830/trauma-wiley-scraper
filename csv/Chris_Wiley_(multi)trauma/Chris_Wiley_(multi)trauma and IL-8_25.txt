AB  - Abstract Background and objectives The aim of this study was to assess cellular and peritoneal immune responses after radical laparoscopic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods Peripheral heparinized plasma and plain serum tube samples were collected preoperatively, and at 2 hr, 1 day, and 4 days postoperatively for analysis o; white blood cells, total lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-suppressor lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A. Twenty-four hours peritoneal fluid collection was performed on days 1 and 4 for TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 analysis. Results No statistical differences were observed between the two groups with respect to immunocompetent cell counts. The serum levels of plasma CRP and SAA gradually increased significantly with time in both groups, but these temporal increases were lower in the LADG group (CRP; P?=?0.03, SAA; P?=?0.01). Peritoneal TNF-α levels in the CODG group at 4 days postoperatively were significantly higher than at day 1, but remained almost unchanged in the LADG group, and this difference was significant (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Because of its association with reduced peritoneal immune activity, laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer may require careful consideration in practice. Additional, larger prospective multicenter trials are required before a consensus can be reached. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:54?59. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background and purpose:? Interleukin-1beta (IL-1?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are involved in inflammatory responses during large vessel occlusion in animal models. The aim of this study was to investigate the intrathecal levels of cytokines in patients with acute small infarcts. Methods:? Forty patients with acute minor stroke and 32 non-stroke patients (including 29 age- and gender-matched subjects) who received operations with spinal anesthesia were studied prospectively and underwent measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-1? and IL-6 levels. Results:? After an age- and gender-matched analysis of 58 patients (29 pairs), the mean intrathecal levels of IL-1? were 0.80?pg/ml in patients with small infarcts and 0.59?pg/ml in non-stroke patients (P?<?0.0001). In addition, the mean CSF levels of IL-6 were 21.54?pg/ml and 7.52?pg/ml in the stroke and control groups, respectively (P?=?0.38). These results were consistent with the data without matching. The CSF levels of IL-1? in the 40 stroke patients were significantly higher than in the 32 non-stroke controls (P?<?0.0001). Conclusions:? The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1?, but not IL-6, remained elevated in the CSF of patients in the acute stage of small infarcts.

AB  - Summary The immune system is an intricate network of specialized tissues, which protect the host from insults and infection. It can be divided into two interactive systems, innate and adaptive immunity. Neuroinflammation occurs when there is chronic activation of the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS). Alterations in the permeability of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) may also occur during neuroinflammation due to changes in local vasculature, that is increased blood flow and vascular permeability. There are several anti-inflammatory systems that play a role in regulating microglia activation, which include CD200/CD200 receptor, vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Apoptosis is a highly orchestrated form of cell death when a number of caspases are activated in a sequential manner. The distinct morphological changes of the cell undergoing apoptosis are that the cell begins to shrink and pull away from other cells, and bubble-like formations appear at its surface.

AB  - Abstract Oral mucositis (OM) as a complication of high-dose chemotherapy is frequently occurred in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) settings. Erythropoietin (EPO) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and wound-healing properties and therefore could have an important role in the prevention of OM. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the EPO mouthwash effect on OM incidence and severity in 80 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin disease (HD) or multiple myeloma, undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients received either EPO mouthwash (50?IU/ml, 15?ml four times a day) (n?=?40) or placebo (n?=?40) from the starting day of high-dose chemotherapy until day +14 after transplantation or until the day of discharge from the hospital, whichever occurred first. OM was evaluated daily for 21?days after transplantation or until resolution of OM according to World Health Organization oral toxicity scale. The incidence of OM (grades 1?4) in the EPO mouthwash group and control group was significantly different (27.5% vs 77.5%, p?<?0.001). The mean?±?SD of two other parameters of OM including maximum intensity OM score (0.60?±?1.06 vs 1.67?±?1.27) and average intensity OM score (0.47?±?0.80 vs 1.28?±?0.86) was significantly lower in the intervention group (p?<?0.001). Moreover, the mean?±?SD duration of OM was also significantly shorter among the EPO mouthwash recipients (1.92?±?3.42?days vs 5.42?±?3.86?days, P?<?0.001). Also, the duration of neutropenic fever was significantly shorter in the intervention group (2.12?±?2.42?days vs 3.95?±?4.01?days, p?=?0.016). It is concluded that EPO mouthwash can reduce the incidence and duration of OM. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Liver cell death induced by stresses such as ischemia-reperfusion, cholestasis and drug toxicity can trigger a sterile inflammatory response with activation of innate immune cells through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). A similar inflammatory response can be induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as endotoxin. Both DAMPs and PAMPs activate through toll-like receptors the resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) and recruit activated neutrophils and monocytes into the liver. Central to this inflammatory response is promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by these phagocytes. ROS are the principal toxic mediators by which inflammatory cells kill their targets, e.g. bacteria during host defense but also hepatocytes and other liver cells. The mechanism of ROS-induced cell killing during inflammation involves the promotion of mitochondrial dysfunction through an intracellular oxidant stress in hepatocytes leading mainly to oncotic necrosis and less apoptosis. The additional release of cell contents amplifies the inflammatory injury. However, an inflammatory oxidant stress insufficient to directly cause cell damage can induce transcription of stress defence genes including antioxidant genes. This preconditioning effect of ROS enhances the resistance against future inflammatory oxidant stress and promotes the initiation of tissue repair processes. Despite the substantial progress in our understanding of mechanisms of inflammatory liver injury during the last decade, more research is necessary to better understand the role of ROS in acute liver inflammation and to develop clinically applicable therapeutic strategies that selectively target the detrimental effects of oxidant stress without compromising the vital function of ROS in host defense.

AB  - SUMMARY HLA-DR expression on monocytes as marker for monocytic function is severely depressed after major trauma. The membrane enzyme aminopeptidase N/CD13 can trigger help in antigen processing by MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells. We determined the simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and CD13 on peripheral blood monocytes of patients with major trauma (injury severity score of ≥16). 1?: 1 conjugates of phycoerythrin (PE)-to-monoclonal antibody were used in combination with QuantiBRITETM PE beads for a standardized quantification in terms of antibodies bound per cell (ABC). The very low expression of HLA-DR antigen on monocytes of patients at day 1 after major trauma confirmed previous results in the literature. Monocytic HLA-DR expression increased slowly to reach values in the lower range of healthy volunteers at day 14. Monocytic CD13 expression at day 1 showed values in the range of healthy volunteers, and a strong rise afterwards. Fourteen days after trauma, the monocytic expression of CD13 was still much higher than in the control group. Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 have been shown to be involved in the depressed HLA-DR expression on monocytes in trauma patients, we studied the in vitro effects of LPS and interleukin (IL)-10 on the expression of CD13 on monocytes prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Whereas a 3-day IL-10 treatment resulted in a down-regulation of both HLA-DR and CD13 expression on monocytes, LPS caused a down-regulation of HLA-DR but a rapid up-regulation of CD13 levels. Therefore we suggest that, with respect to monocytic CD13 expression, LPS rather than IL-10 could well be the explanation for monocytic surface molecules after severe injury, although other mediators with a CD13 regulating function have to be considered.

Burn injury is a complex traumatic event with various local and systemic effects, affecting several organ systems beyond the skin. The pathophysiology of the burn patient shows the full spectrum of the complexity of inflammatory response reactions. In the acute phase, inflammation mechanism may have negative effects because of capillary leak, the propagation of inhalation injury and the development of multiple organ failure. Attempts to mediate these processes remain a central subject of burn care research. Conversely, inflammation is a necessary prologue and component in the later-stage processes of wound healing. In this review, we are attempting to present the current science of burn wound pathophysiology and wound healing. We also describe the evolution of innovative strategies for burn management.
