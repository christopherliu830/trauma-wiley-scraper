AB  - Aim To analyze the prognostic impact of short-term changes in the intensity of delirium in association or not with sepsis. We also aimed to analyze if s100B, a serum protein derived from astrocytes related to cerebral damage, could be a marker of delirium or sepsis. Methods We included 47 patients with acute delirium and sepsis, 36 with delirium and no evidence of infection, and 36 patients with sepsis without delirium. The diagnosis of delirium was established by the Confusion Assessment Method. To evaluate delirium, we recorded the following characteristics on the first and third day after admission: level of consciousness, orientation, attention, hallucinations, psychomotor activity, language and disorganized thinking. Results In 53 patients, delirium improved during hospitalization with 3.8% of mortality, whereas in the 30 patients in which delirium did not improve or worsened, 50% died during hospitalization. The improvement on the third day of consciousness, orientation, attention and disorganized thinking was related to a better long-term survival. s100B and inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and interferon-? were increased in patients with sepsis and confusion when compared with control participants; furthermore, s100B, interleukin-6 and interferon-? were increased in septic patients without confusion, but also in delirious patients without sepsis. Conclusions The main factor related to mortality was the recovery from delirium during hospitalization. We found increased s100B serum levels in patients with delirium, but also in septic patients without delirium. This increase was not related to mortality. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 1161?1167.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the dermatological consequences of bed bug bites along with the immunological basis for the reaction in humans. With the recent rise in bed bug infestations, there has also been an increase in the number of patients presenting with allergic responses, and systemic reactions that have beentreated with an immunosuppressant. The signs and symptoms developing from the bite are due to the host's response to the trauma, the subsequent inflammatory response, and immune system reaction to antigens present in the saliva. When a patient is bitten by large numbers of bed bugs, multiple separate lesions can coalesce to mimic generalized maculopapular exanthema. The lesions may be further modified by excoriations and lichenification from persistent scratching, complicating the differential diagnoses. The first step is bed bug eradication from the patient's living environment and prevention of reinfestation. Eradication can be challenging and in most cases requires a licensed and trained pest management professional (PMP).

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Highly selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5I) have been commercially available for over a decade. Our knowledge of these drugs continues to expand. Aims.? To review developments within the past 18 months on the utilization of PDE5I in preclinical studies and clinical practice. The focus of this article is on updates on regular dosing regimens of PDE5I other than the newly approved daily dose tadalafil. Methods.? PubMed search utilizing the terms ?phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor,? PDE5 inhibitor,??sildenafil,??vardenafil,? and ?tadalafil.? Articles were screened based on whether or not they addressed issues of routine dosing of PDE5I. Manuscripts on the newly approved daily dose tadalafil for erectile dysfunction (ED) were deferred for analysis in a separate manuscript in this series. Main Outcome Measures.? Peer reviewed publications on routine dosing of PDE5I published in the medical literature since 2007. Results.? There have been numerous publications in the past 2 years regarding routine dosing of PDE5I for three major urological indications; penile rehabilitation, stuttering priapism, and management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Evidence from basic science investigations has indicated that daily dose PDE5I may improve erectile function and exert a number of beneficial tissue effects on the penis. Unfortunately, data from human series of routine dose PDE5I for penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy are conflicting, with the two largest studies showing no benefit to daily dose therapy in the post-radical prostatectomy and the general ED populations. PDE5I are generally helpful at reducing symptoms of LUTS, particularly when given in conjunction with alpha blockers. Routine dosing of PDE5I has also been utilized successfully for management of stuttering ischemic priapism and several other medical indications. Conclusions.? PDE5I given as routine doses have clinical promise. Further research is required to clarify their safety and efficacy for various indications.

AB  - Abstract Several studies have reported that nature-derived antioxidants may prevent free radicals over-production and therefore control the onset and prevent the exacerbation of different kinds of diseases caused by oxidative stress and redox-derived stressors, including ageing, fundamentally by suppressing the oxidative by-products-mediated degradation. Naturally derived antioxidants exert their anti-ageing action via a panoply of signalling systems, many of which engaging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging, with the Nrf2/Keap1-ARE system and improving the many survival genes and functions (such as the pathway mTOR/Foxo/SIRT1) able to slow cellular senescence. Most of the research in this field has evaluated the regulative effects and even pathways of herbal extracts with antioxidant property in the ageing process, and various age-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, coronary and myocardial circulatory perfusion, peripheral vascular resistance, and even neurodegenerative disorders are prevented plant phytochemicals often via their antioxidant potential. A much more complex ability to interact with survival functions makes these compounds successfully active in preventing ageing-related disorders. This report aimed to discuss in more detail some selected medicinal plants including Allium sativum, Aloe vera, Crataegus spp., Cynara scolymus, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Ginkgo biloba, Hippophae rhamnoides, Panax ginseng, Rosmarinus officinalis, Schizandra chinensis, Vitis vinifera and seaweeds in the prevention of ageing-related pathologies. A systematic overview of the relevant information in the antioxidant function of the many herbal products reviewed here for the control of the ageing process is proposed, to provide a new horizon on the design of anti-ageing herbal medicines.

AB  - ABSTRACT The elevation of tissue pO2 induced by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a physiological stimulus that elicits a variety of cellular responses. These effects are largely mediated by, or in response to, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). The major consequences of elevated RONS include increased oxidative stress and enhanced antioxidant capacity, and modulation of redox-sensitive cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, these phenomena underlie both the therapeutic and potentially toxic effects of HBO. Emerging evidence indicates that supporting mitochondrial health is a potential method of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of, and preventing oxygen toxicity during, HBO. This review will focus on the cellular consequences of HBO, and explore how these processes mediate a delicate balance of cellular protection versus damage. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract First-hand and second-hand tobacco smoke are causally linked to a huge number of deaths and are responsible for a broad spectrum of pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, and eye diseases as well as adverse effects on female reproductive function. Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of different chemical species, which exert their negative effects on macromolecules and biochemical pathways, both directly and indirectly. Many compounds can act as oxidants, pro-inflammatory agents, carcinogens, or a combination of these. The redox behavior of cigarette smoke has many implications for smoke related diseases. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (both radicals and non-radicals), reactive carbonyl compounds, and other species may induce oxidative damage in almost all the biological macromolecules, compromising their structure and/or function. Different quantitative and redox proteomic approaches have been applied in vitro and in vivo to evaluate, respectively, changes in protein expression and specific oxidative protein modifications induced by exposure to cigarette smoke and are overviewed in this review. Many gel-based and gel-free proteomic techniques have already been used successfully to obtain clues about smoke effects on different proteins in cell cultures, animal models, and humans. The further implementation with other sensitive screening techniques could be useful to integrate the comprehension of cigarette smoke effects on human health. In particular, the redox proteomic approach may also help identify biomarkers of exposure to tobacco smoke useful for preventing these effects or potentially predictive of the onset and/or progression of smoking-induced diseases as well as potential targets for therapeutic strategies. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is anendotoxin-binding neutrophil leukocyte-granule protein withantibacterial and anti-endotoxin properties. A recombinant form of BPI(rBPI21) has been developed and is being tested as atherapeutic agent to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections andexposure to Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. BPI is also a targetantigen of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). BPI-ANCAare present in cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis,and primary sclerosing cholangitis; presence of BPI-ANCA appearsassociated with a higher inflammatory disease activity and greaterorgan damage. BPI-ANCA as well as ANCA directed at otherneutrophil-granule proteins may exacerbate inflammation by nonspecificeffects of extracellular and cell-associated immune complexes. BPI-ANCAmay further worsen inflammation by reducing the ability of BPI topromote clearance of Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial-associatedendotoxin.
