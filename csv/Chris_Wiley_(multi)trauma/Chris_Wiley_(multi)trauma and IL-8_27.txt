AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and lymphotoxin-α, have been described widely to play important roles in the brain in physiologic conditions and after traumatic injury. However, the exact mechanisms involved in their function have not been fully elucidated. We give some insight on their role by using animals lacking either Type 1 receptor (TNFR1KO) or Type 2 (TNFR2KO) and their controls (C57Bl/6). Both TNFR1KO and to a greater extent TNFR2KO mice showed increased exploration/activity neurobehavioral traits in the hole board test, such as rearings, head dippings, and ambulations, compared with wild-type mice, suggesting an inhibitory role of TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the elevated plus maze test, ruling out a major role of these receptors in the control of anxiety. We next evaluated the response to a freeze injury to the somatosensorial cortex. The effect of the cryolesion on motor function was evaluated with the horizontal ladder beam test, and the results showed that both TNFR1KO and TNFR2KO mice made fewer errors, suggesting a detrimental role for TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling for coping with brain damage. Expression of ?22600 genes was analyzed using an Affymetrix chip (MOE430A) at 0 (unlesioned), 1, or 4 days post-lesion in the three strains. The results show a unique and major role of both TNF receptors on the pattern of gene expression elicited by the injury but also in normal conditions, and suggest that blocking of TNFR1/TNFR2 receptors may be beneficial after a traumatic brain injury. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - There is increasing uncertainty over the potential benefits and harms of volume expansion in paediatric and adult critical care settings. In addition, there are increasing numbers of reports of adverse effects and association with RBC transfusions in neonates, including transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis. Preterm infants <28 weeks? gestation in particular are likely more vulnerable to volume shifts and changes in blood pressure due to their unique physiology. This review paper will provide an overview of the current evidence base supporting the use of RBC transfusion thresholds and the use of fluid bolus therapy in neonates. We will argue that enhanced data collection and collaborations through neonatal networks, development of international consensus definitions of transfusion adverse effects and associations, as well as haemodynamic compromise in neonates, are needed to further advance research in these areas.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is difficult to manage and can result in significant patient morbidity. Currently, the clinical use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for painful tendons has received attention, but its efficacy remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of PRP and its biological components. A total of 156 patients with LE were randomly divided into group 1, treated with a single injection of 2-ml autologous PRP, and group 2, treated with a control received only physical therapy without injection. Both groups used a tennis elbow strap and performed stretching and strengthening exercises during 24 weeks? follow-up. Pain and functional improvements were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), Modified Mayo Clinic Performance Index for the elbow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). White blood cell count, platelet count, and levels of platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), PDGF-BB, transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and interleukin-1 ? in PRP were measured and investigated for statistical correlation with the clinical score. At 24 weeks, all pain and functional variables, including VAS score, Mayo Clinic performance scores, and MRI grade, improved significantly in group 1 (p?<?0.05). PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-? levels were more significantly increased in PRP than in whole blood. TGF-? level significantly correlated with Mayo Clinic performance score and MRI grade improvement. Thus, TGF-? level in PRP is considered to play a pivotal role in tendon healing. These results may contribute to identifying the best protocol for PRP application in tendinopathies. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Background Facial wrinkles are key signs of aging which affect one's quality of life and psychological well-being. Absorbable wedge-shaped polydioxanone (PDO) sutures are popular in the esthetic clinics of Korea and may be a treatment option for static wrinkles on the upper face. Objective To describe a novel technique applicable to deep static wrinkles on the upper face and to assess its safety and efficacy. Patients and Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on the static wrinkle cases which were treated with folded, wedge-shaped PDO threads. A total of 33 Korean patients with glabellar and forehead wrinkles were included. All participants underwent a single treatment session. The results were assessed objectively using serial photography and subjectively based on the patients' satisfaction scores. Complications were also recorded. Results Our patients displayed moderate (15.2%), severe (39.4%), and very severe (45.4%) static wrinkles at baseline. The majority of patients (81.8%) considered the results satisfactory. Consensus ratings by two independent dermatologists showed that the objective outcomes at 2-month follow-up were very much improved (30.3%), much improved (30.3%), and improved (24.2%). The incidence of complications was low, and the complications were minor. Conclusion Wedge-shaped PDO sutures in a folded configuration (?solid fillers?) are a promising treatment option for deep static wrinkles on the upper face. They may be applied as an adjunct, or as an alternative to conventional therapies such as botulinum toxin and soft tissue filler injection.

AB  - Frequently used experimental models of sepsis include cecal ligation and puncture, ascending colon stent peritonitis, and the i.p. or i.v. injection of bacteria or bacterial products (such as LPS). Many of these models mimic the pathophysiology of human sepsis. However, identification of mediators in animals, the blockade of which has been protective, has not translated into clinical efficacy in septic humans. We describe the shortcomings of the animal models and reasons why effective therapy for human sepsis cannot be derived readily from promising findings in animal sepsis.

AB  - Summary Functional foods fall into two broad categories: plant origin and animal origin. A review conducted in 1992 proves that plant-based foods have some components that act against lethal diseases, such as cancer. A vast number of components, such as fish oil and dairy products naturally present in animal sources are potentially beneficial to health. Nutraceuticals deliver a concentrated form of a biologically active component from a food to enhance health in dosages that exceed those that could be obtained from regular food. The use of probiotics in combination with prebiotic has been very effective against several chronic diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics provide an alternate source for the management of different intestinal disorders. The major contributions associated with the work of probiotics on human health are proper colonic function and increased metabolism. Research indicates that there is an estimated global market for functional foods of US$33 billion.

AB  - Abstract Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) oil has been receiving increasing attention due to its nutritional and functional potentials. However, its application as a novel food ingredient has not yet been fully explored. This review summarizes the chemical composition, extraction technologies, potential health benefits, and current applications of krill oil, with the aim of providing suggestions for its exploitation. Krill oil is a unique lipid consisting of diverse lipid classes and is characterized by a high concentration (39.29% to 80.69%) of phospholipids (PLs) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It also contains considerable amounts of bioactive minor components such as astaxanthin, sterols, tocopherols, vitamin A, flavonoids, and minerals. The current technologies used in krill oil production are solvent extraction, nonsolvent extraction, super/subcritical fluid extraction, and enzyme-assisted pretreatment extraction, which all greatly influence the yield and quality of the end-product. In addition, krill oil has been documented to have various health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, women's health, neuroprotection, and anticancer activities. Although krill oil products used for dietary supplements have been commercially available, few studies have attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms to elucidate how exactly the krill oil exerts different biological activities. Further studies should focus on this to improve the development of krill oil products for human consumption.

AB  - Abstract Keloid scars are described as benign fibro-proliferative dermal outgrowths that commonly occur in pigmented skin post cutaneous injury, and continue to grow beyond the boundary of the original wound margin. There is a lack of thorough understanding of keloid pathogenesis and thus keloid therapeutic options remain ill-defined. In view of the poor response to current therapy and high recurrence rates, there is an unmet need in improving our knowledge and therefore in identifying targeted and effective treatment strategies in management of keloids. Keloid research however, is hampered by a lack of relevant animal models as keloids do not spontaneously occur in animals and are unique to human skin. Therefore, developing novel animal models and nonanimal models for functional evaluation of keloid cells and tissue for better understanding their pathobiology and response to putative candidate therapies are essential. Here, we present the key concepts and relevant emerging research on two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell and tissue models for functional testing of keloid scars. We will describe in detail current models including in vitro mono- and co-cultures, multi-cellular spheroids (organoids) and organotyopic cultures, ex vivo whole skin keloid tissue organ culture models as well as in vivo human patient models. Finally, we discuss the role played by time as the fourth dimension in a novel model that involves sequential temporal biopsies of human patients with keloids (a so called 4D in vivo human model). The use of these unique models will no doubt prove pivotal in identification of new drug targets as well as biomarkers, in functional testing of emerging novel therapeutics, and in enhancing our understanding of keloid disease biology.
