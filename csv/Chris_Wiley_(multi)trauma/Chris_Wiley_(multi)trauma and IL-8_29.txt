AB  - Background:? In the cleaning industry, the hands are exposed to water and irritants, resulting in dry skin and hand eczema. The prevalence and severity of skin changes is unknown. Objectives:? To quantify the prevalence and the severity of skin changes of the hands. To compare questionnaire-based self-reported signs of hand eczema (both current and at any occasion during the last 12 months), with skin changes revealed by clinical examination. Methods:? A random sample of 231 employees in the cleaning industry participated in the study. Most of them were immigrants. They had to answer a (translated) questionnaire about signs of hand eczema. Then all of them were examined and the severity of hand eczema was graded by a scoring system1. In the comparison only objective subvariables (desquamation, erythema, fissures, infiltration, vesicles) were used. Results:? Clinical examination of the hands detected desquamation in 38%; erythema in 29%; fissures in 24%; infiltration in 12%; vesicles in 4%. Severity scoring of hand eczema: one point in 21%; two points in 18%; three points in 9%; four points in 4%. Signs of hand eczema reported in the questionnaire based on the current situation: desquamation in 17%; erythema in 20%; fissures in 20%; infiltration in 10%; vesicles in 12%. Signs of hand eczema reported in the questionnaire based on any occasion during the last 12 months: desquamation in 18%; erythema in 17%; fissures in 22%; infiltration in 11%; vesicles in 15%. False negative self-reporting by the questionnaire: desquamation in 26%; erythema in 18%; fissures in 14%; infiltration in 11%; vesicles in 3%. False positive self-reporting by the questionnaire: desquamation in 5%; erythema in 10%; fissures in 10%; infiltration in 8%; vesicles in 11%. Conclusions:? Desquamation and erythema were the most common signs both in clinical examination and in questionnaire. The self-reported prevalence (both current and over the last 12 months) of erythema and desquamation is an underestimation of the true prevalence. Scoring hand eczema revealed that most of the employees scored one or two points; indicating that most of the clinical signs of hand eczema are minor. False negative self-reporting by questionnaire was high; indicating that these minor symptoms of hand eczema were probably not recognized by the employees. False positive self-reporting was also high; probably because they misunderstood the questions. This study illustrates the need for a consensus about the distinction between ?minor skin damage? and ?true eczema?.

AB  - Objective:? The study EPOX 2002 is performed to detect the most frequent allergens in epoxy resin systems (ES) currently in use. In particular, concomitant test reactions are analysed to identify possible ?indicator? allergens for a future ES test series. Methods:? Multicenter study within the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) with 27 ES components. Results:? From Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2003, 120 patients have been tested with the preliminary ES series. Of the 49 patients reacting to epoxy resin based on diglycidylether of bisphenol F (DGEBF), 44 also reacted to the standard epoxy resin based on diglycidylether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), i.e., 90%(95%-CI [confidence interval]: 78%-97%). Out of 21 patients positive to 1,4-butanediol diglycidylether (BDDGE), 18 also reacted to 1,6-hexanediol diglycidylether (HDDGE)(86%; 95%-CI: 64%-97%). All 8 patients with allergic reaction to cresyl glycidylether (CGE) also reacted to phenyl glycidylether (PGE). Concomitant reactions to PGE and p-tert butylphenyl glycidylether (PTBPGE) occured in 9 patients, while 5 patients reacted to PGE without reaction to PTBPGE and 6 patients vice versa. Conclusions:? Immunological cross sensitization as well as frequent concomitant exposure to DGEBA and DGEBF epoxy resins is well known. Our data support testing a DGEBA resin as an indicator. HDDGE might serve as an indicator allergen for BDDGE; however, the sample size is too small yet to make a final decision. PGE obviously is a valuable tool to detect sensitization to CGE, but not to PTBPGE.

AB  - Aims:? To estimate the incidence of hand eczema in dental technicians and to elucidate occupational risk factors. Methods:? This was a retrospective cohort study among former dental technician students (n?= 2139). Controls comprised population controls (n?=?2288) with similar distribution of age and sex as the dental technicians. A mail questionnaire asked for occurrence of hand eczema including age of onset, occupational exposure and use of protective gloves. The response rate was 58%(1210 dental technicians and 1316 controls answered the questionnaire). Results:? In dental technicians the incidence of hand eczema was 7.1 cases/1000 person years in males and 10.8 in females during acrylate-exposed time. In controls the incidence of hand eczema was 3.1 in males and 3.7 in females. The relative risk (RR) for males was 2.3 (95% CI 1.6?3.4) and for females 2.9 (95% CI 2.1?4.0). 48% of the dental technicians and 30% of the controls reported more than 10 hand-washings/day (p?<?0.001). 80% of the dental technicians reported skin exposure to uncured acrylates, 14% daily. 87% had skin contact with grinding dust from acrylates, 42% daily. 38% used protective gloves when handling uncured acrylates, males 29%, females 48%(p?<?0.001). 58% did not know for how long the normally used gloves protected the skin against uncured acrylates. Conclusions:? The risk of hand eczema is more than doubled in dental technicians. The work involves frequent and unprotected exposure to acrylates and wet work. Education regarding skin protection is important.

AB  - A 42 year old man was referred to the Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit because of a 12 month history of an inflammatory eruption affecting his neck. He was patch tested to our standard series, textile series and his own medicaments. At the 48 hour reading the patches were removed and there were large areas of unusual painful superficial erosions where the patch test tape ? Scanporä had been in contact with the skin. This appearance was difficult to explain. He denied interfering with the patches. The erosions were dressed with non-adherent dressings held in place by a different tape- Microporeä. At the 96 hour reading these dressings were removed and in the areas under the Microporeä tape there were further erosions around the edge and also some thin walled vesicles and small bullae. There were ++ allergic reactions to sodium metabisulphite, disperse blue 35, 124 and 106 all of which were felt to be relevant as he had used Trimovateâ cream and regularly wore dark nylon clothing when refereeing lacrosse matches. A biopsy was taken for histology and immunofluorescence from an area of blistering. This demonstrated suprabasal acantholysis with vesicle formation. There were occasional corps ronds. The immunofluorescence was negative. Anti-epidermal (skin) antibodieswere also negative. This striking and alarming clinical presentation after removal of patch tests had been encountered once previously in our Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit. The possibility that the disorder was artefactual either due to an irritant introduced under the tapes or perhaps due to a contaminant within the tape adhesive was considered but no conclusion was reached In this case the clue to diagnosis became apparent at the second patch test reading when small vesicles and bullae could be seen at the edge of where the Microporeâ had been. A diagnosis of Hailey Hailey disease (HHD) trigered by the trauma caused by the adhesive tapes and their removal was made. The relatively persistent nature of his presenting problem makes Grover?s disease less likely. The affected sites healed after two weeks. Allergic contact dermatitis particularly to medicaments is reported to be a frequent complication and routine patch testing has been advocated1. There has been a previous report of blistering at the site of patch testing however he was an individual already known to have HHD2. Despite having patch tested around 30 000 people in the last 22 years this complication had not been encountered until this year. We present this case whose clinical features are distinctive as we feel similar instances may have been or will be seen by colleagues. Diagnosis may be difficult if there are no blisters in association with the painful erosions.

AB  - Our review aimed to answer the question of whether exposure to PPD in the European standard series could lead to subsequent sensitisation in a significant number of patients. We aimed to achieve this by comparing the frequency of PPD sensitivity in patients who had never been patch tested compared to those who were having repeat patch testing and who therefore had been exposed to PPD in patch test conditions. From January 1990 to December 1999 14,001 patient?s with suspected contact dermatitis were tested with the European standard series in St. Johns. We selected and obtained the records of all patient?s during this time period who had a positive patch test to PPD free base 1% pet. Of the 14,001 patient?s tested, 1035 had previously been patch tested on at least one occasion representing 7.4% of the population. This proportion varied from 5.6% in 1994 to 11.1% in 1991 but there was no obvious trend during the ten year period. The total number of PPD positive reactions (+ to +++) over the ten year period in the whole population was 449 (3.2%). The number of PPD positive reactions in the first time testers was 419 (3.2%) compared to 30 (2.9)% in the repeat testers. Our figures over a ten-year period do not show an increase in the rate of PPD sensitivity in patients who have been previously patch tested. These figures suggest that PPD 1% pet. as used in the standard series is not actively sensitising patients who are repeatedly patch tested.

AB  - The aim of the work is to present the incidence and the main reasons for this illness at women who live in very bad and poor conditions, in town and in village. Material and methods:? 137 women were included, who were inspected during the time period of 8 months in 2003. A proper therapy was introduced-per os and in loco, and all of them were controled for 14 days. Results:? All together, 137 women were inspected and they were classified by their age, place of leaving and nationality. The detail anamnesis showed that 80% are housewifes who live in poverty and who are in contact with detergents everyday, becouse they do the dish-washing and the laundry with hands, without any machines. The following therapies were applicated: corticosteroid and antihystaminic therapy per os and corticosteroid therapy in loco. After 14 days, a control look over was made, and they were given the preparation with vitamin A and lanolinum, for 14 days more. All of them were adviced to use protection gloves when they are in contact with detergents, especially for the laundry. Conclusion:? One of the reasons for the appearance of chronic toxic contact dermatitis is the low standard of living when, becouse of the poverty, people can?t use machines and still in the 21th Century they wash the clothes and dishes with hands. The only help at this category of people is to give them advices for using protection gloves.

AB  - Background:? Psoriasis prevalence in the Spanish population is around 1.4%(2000). The last epidemiological enquire of the GEIDC (2001) showed that 55.11% of the patients revised in specialized units presented Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD). Concomitance of both processes has been widely studied being the opinions of the different authors controversial. Palmo-plantar psoriasis seems to be the most frequent type in patients presenting delayed hypersensitivity. Aim and methods:? A retrospective study (2002?2003) of the incidence of ACD in patients previously diagnosed of psoriasis was performed in the allergy unit of our hospital. The aim of our study was to investigate the delayed hypersensitivity among psoriatic patients as well as its clinical relevance in our influence area. 604 consecutive patients were studied. Standard batteries of the GEIDC as well as complementary series (True-Test and Chemotecnique) were performed. Allergen application and posterior evaluation were done according to the ICDRG rules. Results:? We studied 26 patients affected of Psoriasis, (4,3% of total). In contrast to the general population, 9 were female (mean age 49 years) and 17 male (mean age 48,4 years). ACD suggestive lesions were located in the hands of 15 patients, feet in three of them and in 4 patients both. Patch test was negative in 8 cases. The most detected allergens were Nickel and Fragrance-mix. Occupational origin was discussed in 6 cases. Sensitivity to formaldehyde resins was demonstrated in several patients. Medicamentous origin due to ethylendiamine and Peru Balsam was also demonstrated. Comments:? Several revisions about the relationship of ACD and psoriasis have been published in the last years and most of the authors think that there are no differences between healthy, psoriatic and atopic subjects. These studies have focused on adverse drug reactions or standard series of allergens, taking not in consideration an occupational origin. We suggest epicutaneous tests as a reliable method to diagnose ACD in psoriatic patients with chronic and/or refractory lesions in hands.

AB  - Investigations in several western countries, especially european, have shown an increase in the frequency of psoriasis. To investigate these trends in Norway, the following procedure was followed. Using four standardized interview-reports the development and the frequency of atopic dermatitis was determined. The questionnaires were conducted in the years 1968, 1975, 1985 and 1995. The results were registred electronically, and made available on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) in Windows version. In 1968 420 out of 11101 persons suffered from a skin disease, in 1975 the number had increased to 690 out of 11014 persons. These numbers still increased; in 1985 1136 out of 10576 and in 1995 1026 out of 10248 said to suffer from a skin disease. The diagnosis psoriasis was reported by 34 persons in 1968 (8% of all skin disease), increased to 97 in 1975 (14.1%), to 149 in 1985 (13.1%), and finally to 284 in 1995 (26.7%). In all, the infectious skin diseases decreased in number, whereas inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis but also atopic dermatitis increased. Connections to air pollution, indoor environment, especially smoking are at present under investigation. These results indicate that psoriasis is among the most frequent skin diseases in Norway, comparable to other western industrialized countries.

AB  - Objective: the increasing industrial use of platinum?group elements (PGEs), namely Ir, Pd, Pt and Rh and related hypersensitivity such as respiratory symptoms, urticaria and contact dermatitis, have led to a growing need to monitor selected populations of exposed workers. Our aim is to determine the prevalence and the clinical characteristics of hypersensitivity to the platinum-group elements; the levels of PGE measured in indoor airborne particulate matter and in biological samples (serum, urine and hair) taken from of employees in a platinum refining and catalyst manufacture; to correlate environmental exposure role and platinum salts concentrations in biological samples in the onset of allergy. Material and methods:? 132 subjects variable exposed were informed about the purpose of this study and gave their consent. The examination consisted of a work exposure and medical questionnaire, physical examination, skin prick test to platinum salts and to other common allergens and patch test to platinum salts. Airborne PGEs was collected by personal and area samples. Biological samples (serum, urine and hair) were collected. Analitical procedure based on sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectometry (SP-ICP-MS) for the analysis of airborne filter, serum, urine and hair was used. Results: positive prick test to platinum salts were found in 18 workers, 4 out 14 gave simultaneous positive reactions to Pt, Rh and Ir. 2 out 14 gave a positive reaction to Pt and Pd. Positive patch test reactions to Pt were found in 2 subjects, 1 out 2 gave positive reaction also to Pd Conclusion:? the preliminary results of the investigation indicate that Pt-salts are important allergens in catalyst industry and that the clinical manifestation involves both the respiratory system and the skin

AB  - Conventional models of the immune response are based on distinguishing self and non-self. However, the more recently proposed ?danger? model may be an illuminating alternative for studying allergic contact dermatitis. In the presence of a ?danger? signal, which in some cases of allergic contact dermatitis could be cutaneous ?irritancy?(ie cytokine release from non-immune/keratinocyte cells in response to chemical stimulus in a non-sensitising manner), the immune system would become activated, leading first to the induction of sensitisation and then subsequently to the elicitation of a contact hypersensitivity response. In most cases both the antigenic signal and signal for keratinocyte cytokine release will come from the hapten, although for example in an occupational setting, traumiterative dermatitis would be the source of the ?danger? signal. A further prediction of this hypothesis is that reported animal experiments demonstrating low dose tolerance with contact allergens may be explained by the loss of the ?irritant? effect at lower dilutions whilst an antigenic stimulus remains present.

AB  - Allergic reactions to arylamine dyes are well-known causes for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). These compounds are found in synthetic and natural materials, hair dyes, sun screen, photographic additives as well as temporary tattoos. Cross-reactions between different para-compounds have been frequently observed but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We investigated the immunogenic capacities of p-phenylendiamine (PPD), Bandrowski?s base (BB), 2-methyl-1,4-phenylendiammoniumsulfat (PTD), 4-aminoazobenzene (AAB), disperse orange (DO), disperse yellow (DY), 4?4-diaminophenylmethan (DDM), bismarckbrown (BBY) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) by measuring the proliferative responses of T-cells on polyclonal and monoclonal level (thymidine incorporation). T cell responses were based on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recently, we characterized PPD/BB T cell clones (TCC) as predominantly CD4+/CD45RO+ cells with a alpha/beta T cell receptor (Sieben et?al., 2002). We isolated T cell lines (TCL, n?=?16) and T cell clones (TCC, n?=?20) from totally 11 PPD-allergic persons and 5 exposed persons. We established TCLs and TCCs to 4 para-amino compounds. We found some PPD and/or BB specific TCCs with no cross-reactivity to the other compounds tested. Some TCCs showed a narrow range of cross-reactions (BB, BBY, MBT), while others reacted to 6 different para-amino compounds. We observed similiar patterns of crossreaction for the TCLs. The stimulation indices (SI) varied between 2.2 and 14.0. Our preliminary results on cross-reactions between para-amino compounds support recent findings in mice (Wulferink et?al., 2002) demonstrating a limited discriminatory capacity of T cells carrying an alpha/beta T cell receptor. Further studies on the mechanisms of cross-reactivities and the cytokine profiles are now under investigation. This study was supported by the Interdiciplinary Center for Clinical Research and Biomaterials (IZKF, Germany) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany).

AB  - TRUE Test? is the only standardized patch test system for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis based on 24 fully stable and reproducible formulations. New standardized patches are in process of development for TRUE Test? Panel 3. The allergens chosen are well-known sensitizers and include preservatives, steroids, metals and others. 14 new patches are included in an Experimental panel which is tested in several European clinics. 11 of the patches contain new allergens while 3 patches consist of improved TRUE Test? formulations with Neomycine sulphate, Fragrance mix and Potassium dichromate. A number of the patches from the Experimental panel will be selected for TRUE Test? Panel 3. The overall purpose with pharmaceutical development of patch test materials for TRUE Test? is to obtain a precise dose, bioavailability and stability in every single patch. The patches have to be chemically stable for at least 2 years at refrigerated temperature. The selected preservatives on the Experimental panel are Methyldibromoglutaronitrile, Germall 115, Germall II and Bronopol. All 4 patches have proven to be difficult to stabilize because of the natural reactivity of the allergenic substances. The steroids chosen are Budesonide, Tixocortol-21-pivalate and Hydrocortisone-17-butyrate. All 3 steroids are stable in TRUE Test? formulations. Other allergens on the Experimental panel are Ammoniated Mercury, Goldsodiumthiosulphate, Parthenolide and Disperse blue 106, where the latter consists of a complex mixture. Chemical stabilization of the patches as well as clinical studies will be presented.

AB  - Milia are small sub epidermal keratin cysts. They may be seen following bullous diseases disrupting the dermo-epidermal junction. They may occur rarely as a complication to contact allergic reactions. An oak moss allergic patient participated in a dose response ROAT with chloratranol, shown to be a potent allergen in oak moss. The patient reacted to choratranol at patch testing down to 0.0063?ppm, and started a ROAT by application of 2 drops of a 5?ppm solution to an area of 3???3 centimetres on the volar aspect of one forearm. After 1 day severe oedematous dermatitis was observed and blistering was seen at day 2. The test was stopped and the patient treated with systemic prednisolone. At a 3 month control visit milia were seen at the application site on the forearm but not on the back where the patch tests were applied. The patient had no subjective symptoms and the milia were easily removed with a sterile needle. The presence of milia as sequelae seems to reflect the depth and severity of the allergic contact dermatitis developed months earlier. This observation underlines the potency of chloratranol as a very strong allergen.

AB  - During the last two decades the incidence of contact allergy to preservatives in consumer products has increased. It is of crucial importance for the prognosis that sensitised patients avoid contact with the allergens, and they are informed how to take precautions, e.g. by reading the descriptions of contents on consumer products. Discrepancy between ?doctors orders? and patients? actions is often taken as an expressions of patients? lack of knowledge. However, sociologically inspired studies show that differences in social experiences and in social life circumstances non-consciously lead to socially different ways of coping with illness. This study investigates in a sociological perspective, how people handle contact allergy in everyday life and the social genesis of their actions. Interviews were carried out with 8 women selected according to medical and sociological criteria. The study indicates that patients with contact allergy comply with ?doctors orders? in different ways depending on patients? resources, possibilities and social class. The study also indicates, that information given by health staff to a considerable extent is directed to patients from the higher social classes, who possess the ability to read the linguistic difficult names of the preservatives and to a lesser extend to patients from lower social classes, who do not possess this ability.

AB  - Aims:? The aims were to study health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with hand eczema, and to compare two different instruments for assessment of HRQL. Methods:? 100 consecutive hand eczema patients (51 females and 49 males) at an occupational dermatology clinic completed the generic questionnaire Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the dermatology specific Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). To compare the instruments factor analysis, with a polychoric correlation matrix as input, was performed, thus taking the ordinal aspect of the data into account. Results:? HRQL was affected by hand eczema, measured with both SF-36 and DLQI. The mean (SD) sum scores of DLQI was 7.4 (5.8), no difference between genders. However, the SF-36 showed more impaired HRQL for females than for males in the mental health dimension. There was a high correlation between the instruments for physical health, but lower for mental health. Conclusions:? Hand eczema has an impact on HRQL, and both SF-36 and DLQI are suitable instruments. Our conclusion from the factor analysis is that the SF-36 measures mental health better than the DLQI. The choice of instrument to be used in a specific study depends on the purpose of the study. A generic instrument has the advantage of making comparisons with other diseases possible. The SF-36 also appears suitable for use in hand eczema studies where gender differences in HRQL are of interest.

AB  - It has been shown by series of experiments that the induction of contact allergy depends on the concentration of allergen per unit skin rather than the total dose delivered. This means that a high concentration of allergen delivered to a small area of the skin comprise a higher risk of induction than if the same total amount is applied to a larger skin area. Attempts have been made to exploit this knowledge in risk assessment models for induction of contact allergy. The concentration (dose per unit skin) applied at induction also determines the sensitivity of the individual at elicitation. It also seems that smaller concentrations of allergen are required to sensitise individuals with pre-existing contact allergy than those without.Once a person is sensitised to a substance, the sensitivity of the individual in combination with the level of exposure to the allergen, determines whether clinical symptoms will occur. These dose-response relationships can be studied in sensitised individuals by re-application of a serial dilution of the relevant allergen either under patch test conditions or by repeated open applications. Thresholds for no-response or minimum effect levels may be determined for different allergens and used systematically for preventive purposes. Practical examples of such successful prevention exist regarding nickel and chromium allergy, providing both primary and secondary preventive effects. Further understanding of the dose- response relationships is important in diagnosing contact allergy and advising the patient relevantly.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis to prepackaged disposable alcohol prep swabs is infrequently reported. A 60-year-old woman developed repeated episodes of dermatitis at sites of injections and venipunctures. History and patch testing revealed contact allergy to Kendall Webcol alchol prep swabs. There were negative patch test results to isopropyl alcohol (IPA), but positive reactions to the Webcol swab, to the inner surface of the packaging foil, to two other brands of alcohol swabs, and to bacitracin. UV absorbance profile analysis revealed the presence of UV absorbing materials at peaks of 221 and 280?nm within commercial IPA samples, including one from Kendall, which were absent from reagent grade IPA. Reports of similar cases identified IPA, propylene oxide, or both as the allergens; when swab ingredients were negative, compound allergy was proposed. A recent report from Korea identified dodecyldiaminoethylglycine and IPA as the allergens in the commercial disinfectant swab. Although the exact allergen is undetermined in our case, it may represent a chemical compound or contaminant that is used or acquired during the manufacturing of the swabs or foils.

AB  - The term baboon syndrome was introduced 20 years ago. It was proposed for a particular eruption mimicking the red gluteal area of the baboon after systemic exposure either to the contact allergens nickel and mercury or to oral ampicillin. Previously this phenomen was e.g. termed flexural exanthema to mercury. Since then similar incidences have been reported after systemic exposure to betalactam antibiotics and other drugs, sometimes under different terms. Clinically sharp demarcation of a V-shaped erythema is present in inguinal/genital and gluteal/perianal areas. Additionally papules, vesicles and hemorrhagic lesion may be found. In most patients presence of exanthema in other anatomical flexural regions (axilla, elbow, knee, ventral neck) has been identified. However, involvement of the plantar/palmar regions, face and mucosal sites has not been documented. Typically blood tests are normal and systemic symptoms are absent. Histological results vary but a predominance of superficial perivascular infiltrate with mononuclear cells has been reported. Occasional positive patch tests or stimulation of lymphocytes in the LTT may be suggestive for a type IV allergic reaction. Since the drug-related baboon syndrome shows clinically and histologically different findings to systemic contact dermatitis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), it should be seen as a separate entity. The mainstay for the diagnosis of systemic contact dermatitis requires contact sensitization and elicitation by a contact allergen. In contrast in the baboon syndrome and AGEP history for sensitization is often negative, although sometimes positive patch and LTT results can be found. AGEP, on the other hand, requires a distinct score including systemic signs and leucocytosis. In all three symptoms typically occur within 1 to 2 days. The term baboon syndrome does not reflect the whole range of symptoms and signs. And, although it is easily remembered, the comparison to an animal may be insulting. Therefore, we suggest that drug-induced baboon syndrome should be separated from the contact allergen-induced form, and should be recognized as a separate entity within the spectrum of drug eruptions. For this reason we propose the acronym SDRIFE (symmetrical drug related intertriginous flexural exanthema). This refers to the distinctive clinical pattern of this drug eruption without implicating any pathomechanism, which has not been clearly elucidated. The following criteria are proposed: 1) Exposure to a systemically administered drug, 2) Sharply demarcated erythema of the gluteal/perianal area and/or V-shaped erythema of the inguinal/perigenital area, 3) Involvement of at least one other intertriginous/flexural fold, 4) Bilaterally or symmetrically affected areas, and 5) Absence of systemic symptoms and signs.

AB  - Objectives:? The Surveillance by General Practitioners of Occupational Contact Dermatitis Project (Spot) has been designed to provide disease estimates for occupational contact dermatitis within a defined geographic area in Melbourne, Australia. Method:? Spot collected reports of occupational contact dermatitis from four separate sources: general practitioners, dermatologists, a Dermatology Outpatient clinic, and an Occupational Dermatology Clinic. Case definition was stratified into two levels, suspected and confirmed. All cases of suspected occupational contact dermatitis reported to Spot were assessed and required to undergo diagnostic confirmation, including appropriate patch testing by an occupational dermatologist. The rates generated by Spot were compared to the rates generated by Victorian workers? compensation data (Victorian Work Cover Authority) for ?Contact dermatitis and other and unspecified dermatitis.? Results:? To date, a total of 125 suspected cases have been reported to Spot. 56 cases of occupational contact dermatitis have been confirmed with an incidence rate of 12.5 per 100,000 full-time workers and a prevalence rate of 28 per 100,000. This can be compared to the rate from Victorian WorkCover Authority of 4 per 100,000 (with information not available for incidence or prevalence). Conclusions:? Although limited by resources, clinician and worker participation rates, Spot provides a better estimate for occupational contact dermatitis in an Australian urban setting than that currently available through workers? compensation statistics. The information generated by Spot will provide an important contribution towards the characterisation of occupational contact dermatitis in Australia.
