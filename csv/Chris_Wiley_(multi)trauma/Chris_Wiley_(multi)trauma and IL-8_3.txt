AB  - In adults, acute lung injury or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may complicate a wide range of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which involve direct pulmonary insult. The characteristic histological feature of ARDS is an intense inflammatory process in the lungs, which may progress to fibrosis. The earliest physiological characteristic is an increase in the protein permeability across the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lungs. This clinical syndrome is characterized by arterial hypoxaemia and bilateral radiographic infiltrates, which represent protein-rich oedema fluid. In addition there is a neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrate. ?Pulmonary endothelium is actively involved in the development of ARDS. It alters cell?cell adhesion as the initial step in leucocyte migration which, in turn, changes the permeability that allows protein-rich fluid to move into the interstitium. The quantity of this interstitial oedema may be sufficient to cause bulk flow through the epithelial barrier. There is probably independent epithelial injury. Finally, the endothelium can release and metabolize vasoactive and inflammatory substances, such as endothelins, nitric oxide and cytokines, etc. No single substance is responsible for acute lung injury, but rather a complex interplay exists between diverse pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.

AB  - Inflammatory cell recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) is a critical step in the response to diverse insults, including infection, trauma and infarction, as well as immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite considerable advances in understanding immune surveillance and antigen recognition in the CNS, the signals resulting in parenchymal inflammation are incompletely understood. Members of a novel family of chemo-attractant cytokines, the chemokines, are made in the CNS and are emerging as likely mediators of inflammatory cell migration into the CNS.

AB  - Abstract Inherent recipient factors, including pretransplant diagnosis, obesity and elevated pulmonary pressures, are established primary graft dysfunction (PGD) risks. We evaluated the relationship between preoperative lung injury biomarkers and PGD to gain further mechanistic insight in recipients. We performed a prospective cohort study of recipients in the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group enrolled between 2002 and 2010. Our primary outcome was Grade 3 PGD on Day 2 or 3. We measured preoperative plasma levels of five biomarkers (CC-16, sRAGE, ICAM-1, IL-8 and Protein C) that were previously associated with PGD when measured at the postoperative time point. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Of 714 subjects, 130 (18%) developed PGD. Median CC-16 levels were elevated in subjects with PGD (10.1 vs. 6.0, p?<?0.001). CC-16 was associated with PGD in nonidiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) subjects (OR for highest quartile of CC-16: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.37, 6.00, p?=?0.005) but not in subjects with IPF (OR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.43, 4.45, p?=?0.59). After adjustment, preoperative CC-16 levels remained associated with PGD (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.26, 7.30, p?=?0.013) in non-IPF subjects. Our study suggests the importance of preexisting airway epithelial injury in PGD. Markers of airway epithelial injury may be helpful in pretransplant risk stratification in specific recipients.

AB  - Abstract Background: Proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be elevated in individuals experiencing chronic stress as well as in those with major depressive disorder. Much less is known about cytokines in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD). We hypothesized that PD and PTSD would be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. Method: We utilized Luminex technology to examine 20 cytokines and chemokines in serum from 48 well-characterized individuals with a primary DSM-IV PD or PTSD diagnosis, and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We conservatively employed a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (α=.05/20=.0025). Results: Individuals with primary PTSD or PD had significantly elevated median peripheral cytokine levels for 18 of 20 different cytokines compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (all P<.0025). To assess for the presence of a generalized proinflammatory state, we also examined the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of at least six of nine common proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, and IFN-α). For men and women, 87% of anxiety patients had six or more detectable levels of these proinflammatory cytokines, compared with only 25% of controls (Fisher's Exact Test (FET) P=.000). Confirmatory analysis of the subset of individuals without current psychiatric medication use or comorbid depression was of comparable significance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a generalized inflammatory state may be present in individuals with PD or PTSD. Depression and Anxiety, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.

AB  - Contents This paper reviews recent data and concepts on the development of inflammation in the reproductive tract of dairy cows during the first 2?months after calving. The incidence of metritis is typically 10?20%, with 5?15% of cows having purulent vaginal discharge (PVD), 15?40% having cervicitis approximately 1?month after calving, and 10?30% having cytological endometritis between 1 and 2?months after calving. Endometritis, cervicitis and PVD are distinct conditions, each of which is associated with significantly increased time to pregnancy, and affected cows often have more than one of these conditions. Cumulatively, 35?50% of cows have at least one form of pathological reproductive tract inflammation between 3 and 7?weeks postpartum. It is hypothesized that reproductive tract disease represents a failure of the immune system to switch fast enough or far enough from the down-regulated state necessary for maintenance of pregnancy to a heightened state of function for postpartum clearance of bacteria and tissue debris and then to a ?quiet? state 3?4?weeks later. There are numerous links between fat metabolism, inflammation and immune function, and changes in these precede reproductive tract disease by several weeks. An excessive pro-inflammatory state early in the postpartum period appears to be a key feature of cows with endometritis approximately 1?month later. Generally, worse postpartum negative energy balance (NEB) is associated with more severe or prolonged uterine inflammation. Aspects of both mononuclear cell proliferation and neutrophil oxidative burst are commonly impaired, particularly in association with elevated non-esterified fatty acid concentrations and to a lesser degree by ketosis. In summary, NEB contributes to immune dysfunction which in turn is a major component of reproductive tract inflammatory disease. The factors that initiate and sustain harmful inflammation of the reproductive tract are not yet well quantified.

AB  - Background: More than 100,000 people each year are admitted to U.S. hospitals for severe burn injury. Strikingly, ethanol use prior to injury is apparent in nearly 50% of burn patients, rendering them six times more likely to die from infection than patients not exposed to ethanol. We previously reported that the kinetics and magnitude of neutrophil chemokine production and subsequent accumulation of neutrophils in the lung was dramatically altered when ethanol exposure preceded injury. Here, we tested whether burn injury and ethanol exposure combined, altered susceptibility to infection, neutrophil chemoattractant production, and neutrophil accumulation at the site of the burn wound. Methods: Male B6D2F 1 mice were administered a dose of ethanol designed to achieve 90?100 mg/dl circulating levels and 30 min later subjected to a 15% total body surface area dorsal scald injury. Susceptibility to topically applied Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined. At various times after injury, burn wound and normal tissues were collected for assessments of neutrophil counts, myeloperoxidase quantitation, and neutrophil chemoattractant (KC and MIP-2) production. Results: Ethanol exposure prior to burn injury enhanced susceptibility to infection after burn and was associated with significantly elevated production of KC, but not MIP-2, at the wound site. Despite the enhanced elevation of KC, neutrophil accumulation in the wounds of ethanol exposed, burn injured mice did not differ from those that received burn injury alone. TNFα (a potent activator of neutrophils), however, was found to be significantly elevated in the wounds of mice that received only burn injury, but not in those that received injury in combination with prior ethanol exposure. Conclusion: In the presence of ethanol, neutrophils are adequately recruited to the site of burn injury, but their host defense functions are impaired, perhaps due to the lack of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα.

AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxfylline are associated with a number of clinical benefits. These include reduction in mortality in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants or suffer peritonitis. In infants with sepsis, a reduction in mortality has also been associated with pentoxyfylline administration. The anti-inflammatory effects of pentoxyfylline, as well as its bronchodilator, diuretic and respiratory muscle stimulant effects suggest it may have a useful role in BPD. Interim analysis of a prophylactic trial suggests pentoxyfylline may reduce treatment requirements after the neonatal period and that, in established BPD, pentoxyfylline and dexamethasone may be of similar efficacy.

AB  - Biofilm infections are one of the modern medical world's greatest challenges. Probably, all non-obligate intracellular bacteria and fungi can establish biofilms. In addition, there are numerous biofilm-related infections, both foreign body-related and non-foreign body-related. Although biofilm infections can present in numerous ways, one common feature is involvement of the host response with significant impact on the course. A special characteristic is the synergy of the innate and the acquired immune responses for the induced pathology. Here, we review the impact of the host response for the course of biofilm infections, with special focus on cystic fibrosis, chronic wounds and infective endocarditis.

AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that has emerged as a prevalent source of nosocomial infections, most frequently causing ventilator-associated pneumonia. The emergence of pan-drug resistant strains magnifies the problem by reducing viable treatment options and effectively increasing the mortality rate associated with Acinetobacter infections. In light of this rising threat, research on A.?baumannii epidemiology, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis is accelerating. The recent development of both in vitro and in vivo models has enabled studies probing the host?Acinetobacter interface. Bacterial genetic screens and comparative genomic studies have led to the identification of several A.?baumannii virulence factors. Additionally, investigations into host defence mechanisms using animal models or cell culture have provided insight into the innate immune response to infection. This review highlights some of the key attributes of A.?baumannii virulence with an emphasis on bacterial interactions with the innate immune system.

AB  - Summary It is still controversial which cell types are responsible for synovial inflammation in osteoarthritic (OA) joints. The aim of this study was to quantify the mononuclear cell populations and their cytokines in patients with different knee OA subtypes. Synovial membrane (SM), synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) were harvested from patients with unicompartmental (UC) and bicompartmental (BC) knee OA. Frequencies of mononuclear cells were assessed by flow cytometry in PB and SM. Naive SF samples were analysed for a broad variety of cytokines by multiplex analysis. SM of both groups displayed a distinct mononuclear cell infiltration, with CD14+ macrophages being the major cell population, followed by CD4+ T cells and only small numbers of CD8+ T, CD19+ B and CD16+CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells. Between the two groups, SM of BC OA showed significantly higher amounts of mononuclear cells (135·7?±?180 versus 805?±?675 cells/mg, P?=?0·0009) and higher CD4+ T cell presence (3·4?±?4·6 versus 9·1?±?7·5%, P?=?0·0267). SF of BC OA displayed significantly higher concentrations for a number of proinflammatory cytokines [CXCL1, eotaxin, interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12]. UC and BC OA show significant differences in their synovial inflammatory pattern. Whereas in UC OA CD14+ macrophages are the predominant cell population, BC OA has a higher inflammatory profile and seems to be driven by CD14+ macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Inclusion of clinical information into the analysis of cellular and molecular results is pivotal in understanding the pathophysiology of OA.

AB  - Abstract Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic osteolytic disease that shares pathogenic inflammatory features with other conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation. A hallmark of PD is inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. Myeloid cells, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages (Mac), are essential players in PD by control of gingival biofilm pathogenicity, activation of adaptive immunity, as well as nonresolving inflammation and collateral tissue damage. Despite mounting evidence of significant innate immune implications to PD progression and healing after therapy, myeloid cell markers and targets for immune modulation have not been validated for clinical use. The remarkable plasticity of monocytes/Mac in response to local activation factors enables these cells to play central roles in inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis and provides opportunities for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery for management of chronic inflammatory conditions, including osteolytic diseases such as PD and arthritis. Along a wide spectrum of activation states ranging from proinflammatory to pro-resolving, Macs respond to environmental changes in a site-specific manner in virtually all tissues. This review summarizes the existing evidence on Mac immunomodulation therapies for osteolytic diseases in the broader context of conditions associated with nonresolving inflammation, and discusses osteoimmune implications of Macs in PD.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - Abstract Astrocytes become activated in response to many CNS pathologies. The process of astrocyte activation remains rather enigmatic and results in so-called reactive gliosis, a reaction with specific structural and functional characteristics. Astrocytes play a vital role in regulating aspects of inflammation and in the homeostatic maintenance of the CNS. However, the responses of different human astroglial cell-lines in viral encephalitis mediated inflammation are not well documented. We have shown that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection causes morphological and functional changes in astrocytic cell-lines. We have demonstrated that besides reactive oxygen species (ROS) JEV infection differentially regulated the induction pattern of IL-6, IL-1? and IL-8. IP-10, MCP-1, MIG and RANTES secretions in different astroglial cell-lines. The expression of different proteins such as astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the glutamate aspartate transporter/essential amino acid transporter-1 (GLAST/EAAT-1), glutamate transporter-1/essential amino acid transporter-2 (GLT-1/EAAT-2), Ceruloplasmin and Thioredoxin (TRX) expression level also differ in different human astrocyte cell-lines following infection.

AB  - SUMMARY Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae include pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. All these are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pneumococcus can colonize the nasopharynx, and this can be a prelude to bronchopneumonia and invasion of the vasculature space. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood?brain barrier and entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where the bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The infected host may develop septicaemia and/or meningitis secondary to bronchopneumonia. Also septicaemia is a common precursor of meningitis. The mechanisms surrounding the sequence of infection are unknown, but will be dependent on the properties of both the host and bacterium. Treatment of these diseases with antibiotics leads to clearance of the bacteria from the infected tissues, but the bacteriolytic nature of antibiotics leads to an acute release of bacterial toxins and thus after antibiotic therapy the patients can be left with organ-specific deficits. One of the main toxins released from pneumococci is the membrane pore forming toxin pneumolysin. Here we review the extensive studies on the role of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases.

AB  - Abstract Aim Epidural analgesia reduces the surgical stress response. However, its effect on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the genesis of inflammation following major abdominal surgery remains unclear. Our main objective was to elucidate whether perioperative epidural analgesia prevents the inflammatory response following colorectal cancer surgery. Methods Ninety-six patients scheduled for open or laparoscopic surgery were randomized to epidural analgesia (group E) or patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (group P). Surgery and anaesthesia were standardized in both groups. Plasma cortisol, insulin and serum cytokines [interleukin 1? (IL-1?), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor α, interferon ?, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor] were measured preoperatively (T0), 1?6 h postoperatively (T1) and 3?5 days postoperatively (T2). Mixed model analysis was used, after logarithmic transformation when appropriate, for analyses of cytokines and stress markers. Results >There were no significant differences in any serum cytokine concentration between groups P and E at any time point except for IL-10 which was 87% higher in group P [median and range 4.1 (2.3?9.2) pg/ml] compared to group E [2.6 (1.3?4.7) pg/ml] (P = 0.002) at T1. There was no difference in plasma cortisol and insulin between the groups at any time point after surgery. A significant difference in median serum cytokine concentration was found between open and laparoscopic surgery with higher levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 at T1 in patients undergoing open surgery compared to laparoscopic surgery. No difference in serum cytokine concentration was detected between the groups or between the surgical technique at T2. Conclusions Open surgery, compared to laparoscopic surgery, has greater impact on these inflammatory mediators than epidural analgesia vs intravenous analgesia.
