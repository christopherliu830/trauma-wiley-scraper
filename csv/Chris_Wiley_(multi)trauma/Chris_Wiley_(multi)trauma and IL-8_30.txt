AB  - Capsicum peppers are widespread both in and out the kitchen. ?Human hand? is a contact dermatitis resulting from the direct handling of peppers. Capsaicin also is found in topical agents for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and arthritis. The oleoresin of capsicum is considered a powerfull irritant capable to induce irritant contact dermatitis and non-immunological contact urticaria. A 81 year-old man with a severe itchy macular and papular rash induced by Capsidol? initially located over the shoulder and sudden spread over the thorax is presented. A dense dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate and spongiosis suggested the diagnosis of contact dermatitis. Negative open tests and a positive patch test reaction (++ 96 hours) using the trade cream Capsidol?(capsaicin 5%) led us to contact with the Pharmaceutical Company Viñas. They provided us the components of the cream: capsaicin, isopropyl myristate, estearic acid (DERVACID 3148), propylene glycol, glycerin monomyristate (ESTOL3650GMM), AMPHISOL K, Cetyl alcohol (NACOL 16?85), benzyl alcohol, diazolidinyl urea (GERMALL II), p-hydroxybenzoate?methylsodium (NIPAGIN M sódic), p-hydroxybenzoate propyl (NIPASOL M). Capsaicin in benzyl alcohol at 0,075% was open tested with negative results. Only patch test with capsaicin was positive (++) at 48/96 hours and the excipient components at the appropiate concentrations were all negative. Patch test biopsy showed an eczematous pattern. Twenty controls showed negative results. This case is probably an allergic reaction but shows how still remains difficult to distinguish among allergic and irritative cutaneous reactions.

AB  - The current spectrum of contact allergens in metalworking fluids (MWF) is illustrated based on (I) recent patch test data from the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) concerning metalworkers tested in 2002/2003 due to suspected MWF dermatitis, (II) a study on occupational contact allergies performed in the IVDK 1999?2001 (FaSt study), (III) a patch test study in five centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) with components of MWF not routinely tested, and (IV) information from the interdisciplinary task force on allergy diagnostics in the metal branch. Potential allergens are found in various MWF components, mainly in emulsifiers, rust preventing agents, preservatives, and anti-wear-additives. Various special additives also may contain potential allergens. Currently, the most important MWF allergens are: ? oxidation products from resin acids, e.g. abietic acid, in distilled tall oil, a frequently used base material of MWF. Contact allergy to these is detected by patch testing with colophony. ? monoethanolamine, diglycolamine ? used as rust preventing agents and emulsifiers. ? formaldehyde and various formaldehyde releasers, mainly oxazolidine derivatives ? used as biocides. Other biocides, e.g. Methylchloroisothiazolinone/Methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI), Benzisothiazolinone (BIT) or Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) are also used in MWF and should hence be tested routinely. While odour masks for MWF are available, little is known about the extent of their usage. However, this allergen source should be considered in cases of fragrance allergy. Cobalt apparently is a relevant MWF allergen only in carbid metal processing.

AB  - Occupationally-induced reactions to medicaments occur in two exposed groups. The group that we discuss consists of employees of pharmaceutical and chemical companies involved in the production of drugs. We describe some patients who developed allergic contact dermatitis to specific drugs. Two of them we related to occupational exposure to simvastatin and other to n-acetyl-cysteina. Also one to diphendiprone. The diagnosis of airborne contact dermatitis was confirmed by patch test in all cases. We will do a review in this aspect on occupational contact dermatitis to foccus attention on the increasing importance of this aspect in pharmaceutical workers.

AB  - For new chemicals introduced into the workplace or marketplace, and which come into contact with the skin, it is necessary, to conduct a thorough skin safety testing and risk assessment program to be certain that the exposures will be well tolerated. One vital risk assessment process involves the determination of allergic skin reactions, referred to as skin sensitization, the clinical manifestation of which is allergic contact dermatitis. The process by which low molecular weight chemicals induce and elicit skin sensitization is dependent on many factors including the ability of the chemical to penetrate the skin, react with protein, and trigger a cell-mediated immune response. Based on our chemical, cellular and molecular understanding of allergic contact dermatitis, it is possible to carry out a quantitative risk assessment. It has been well known for years that chemical allergens display dose-response characteristics regardless of whether the sensitization is induced in an experimental system or in humans. Moreover, it is well known that the critical exposure determinant for evaluating skin sensitization risk is dose per unit area of skin exposed. The skin sensitization testing and risk assessment process for new ingredients and consumer products generally follows a step-wise approach that may involve structure-activity evaluations, analytical assessments, preclinical skin sensitization testing (e.g., the mouse local lymph node assay), confirmatory clinical testing (e.g., the human repeat insult patch test), and benchmarking of resulting data against similar ingredients and product types. Essential elements for conducting a sound risk assessment involve the development of an understanding of the sensitization potential of the contact allergen and the likely dose, nature, extent and duration of exposure. With an understanding of the exposure and potency of the chemical one can assess whether the chemical, under the specific conditions of exposure, ould pose an acceptable or unacceptable risk of induction of skin sensitization. As with any test method or risk assessment approach, it is critical to understand the strengths and limitations so that one can conduct the best assessment possible and assure the skin safety of the chemical under evaluation.

AB  - A 35-year-old woman presented with a 8-month history of scaling, hyperkeratotic and fissured lesions of the fingertips of the first three fingers of both the hands. She referred the healing of the dermatitis during the summer holidays. She was employed in a small firm where she was used to glue together silver components with glass ones of decorative pieces. For this aim, she applied a glue (Loxeal UV 30?20) cured by exposition to UV light coming from a proper lamp. The material safety data sheet (MSDS) indicated that the glue contained hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA). Patch tests performed with the standard SIDAPA series gave negative results; patch tests carried out with an additional one (acrylic adhesive series) showed positive reactions towards glue components (HEMA,HPMA) and towards other acrylates (possible cross-reacting). An inspection performed in the work-place showed that the patient was in contact with the glue not only when she applied it on the components, but particularly when she handled the bottle cap (splashed with the glue) in its opening and closing. After the changing of her occupation, the patient has not presented relapse of the dermatitis. The UV-cured acrylic resins are known for some time to be a frequent cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis in dentists and in printing industry. The case reported shows a different exposition source towards these resins, i.e. from UV-cured acrylate adhesive employed for sticking metal pieces with glass ones.

AB  - Background/objectives:? Prevention of hand dermatitis among nurses can be achieved by reduction of wet work exposure. Kwodledge about the amout of wet work in nursing is import implementing hand dermatitis prevention plans. Wet work exposure in nursing can be assessed by questionnaire or observation. Method:? Duration and frequency of wet work activities were assessed by a questionnaire in a population of 1471 nurses.In addition a randomly chosen sample of 53 nurses from this population was observed on duration and frequency of wet work during 112 different morning shifts. Results:? questionnaire: wet work between 26 minutes (at a dialysis ward) and 100 minutes (in nursing homes). For frequency a range between 12 and 21 episodes of wet hands during morning shifts was reported. In nursing homes and regular wards gloves were reported to be used less than once during a shift. Observation:? A duration of wet work of 10 minutes (dialysis ward), 28 minutes (regular ward) and 19 minutes (I.C.-unit) and 45 minutes in a nursing home. Frequency: between 19 and 43 episodes of wet hands during morning shifts. Conclusions:? A questionnaire does not accurately assess the quantity of wet activities; it overestimates the duration of wet work and underestimates the frequency of wet work. On regular wards the exposure to irritants is mainly associated with the frequency of wet hands instead of the duration of wet hands. On specialised care units skin exposure is mainly a matter of occlusion by gloves.

AB  - Introduction:? Nail varnishes are well-known sensitizers, and the most frequent allergen is nowadays tosylamide/formaldehyde resin (TFR). We present 3 cases of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) due an unusual ingredient. Case reports:? The 1st patient presented with atopic dermatitis that progressively worsened, involving face and neck for several months. The 2nd patient had history of occupational allergy to glutaraldehyde, and presented with head and neck dermatitis. The 3rd patient had severe onycholysis and dermatitis of perionychium, face, neck and décolleté. European standard series was negative in all patients, as was TFR, (meth-) acrylates and cosmetic series when tested. Patch tests with patient?s own varnish(es) were ++, and breakdown identified phthalic anhydride/trimellitic anhydride/glycols copolymer (PTG) as the allergen (tested 1 to 5% pet.). Discussion:? PTG results of condensation of phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, ethylene glycol, and neopentyl glycol monomers. It belongs to the copolymer class, and is used in confection of nail polish and enamels, like TFR or phthalic anhydride/glycerine/glycidyl decanoate copolymer. Our patients had long lasting dermatitis, common in ACD to nail varnishes. Sensitivity was proved by patch testing with patient?s own cosmetics. Allergic contact dermatitis to PTG seems to be rare, but has to be considered particularly in patients with negative standard patch tests. An alternative is the use of tosylamide/formaldehyde-based nail polish.

AB  - Objective:? To examine the usefulness of the standard allergen series as a sole tool in the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis and consider the diagnostic benefits yielded by the routine use of an extended standard series in general dermatology practice. Methods:? From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003, one hundred patients attended in a general dermatology unit were recruited for patch testing. Every patient underwent testing with the standard tray recommended by the Spanish Contact Dermatitis Research Group, and simultaneously, with a supplementary series of 35 allergens. Other specific series were performed in some cases, but their results have been omitted in this study. Patients with positive allergic reactions were divided into two groups based on the clinical relevance of their reactions. These groups were subsequently stratified in four subgroups: (1) reactions only to allergens in the standard series; (2) reactions only to additional allergens; (3) reactions to both standard and additional allergens; and (4) reactions to own substances or allergens in other series. Results:? Of patients tested, 62 had at least 1 positive allergic reaction, and among these, 44 had reactions deemed clinically relevant. Of all the patients with relevant positive tests, 70.5%(31/44) reacted only to allergens in the standard tray; 11.4%(5/44) reacted to supplementary allergens exclusively; 4.5%(2/44) reacted to both standard and supplementary allergens. Finally, 6 more patients (13.6%) reacted to other sensitizers. Conclusion:? In our study, 15.9% relevant allergies would have been missed by the standard series alone. Patch testing an extended standard series increased our diagnostic capability, and might be a useful screening tool in those dermatology offices where other series are lacking.

AB  - Prompted by a recent publication on contact allergy to the fragrance mix (FM) declining with age, patch test data of the IVDK (1992?2002, http://www.ivdk.org, n?=?90824 patients) were subjected to a multifactorial logistic regression analysis, employing a finer age categorization than previously used (Uter W et al., Occup. Environ. Med. 2001; 58: 392?8), additionally adjusting for ?polysensitization?, operationalized as the number of additional positive patch test reactions to other standard series allergens. The aim was to disentangle a possible association between age and contact sensitization in general, and age and FM contact allergy in particular. The strongest of all associations observed was to the number of additional positive patch test reactions (?polysensitization?; OR for 1 vs. 0 additional reactions: 2.7 [95% CI: 2.6?2.9] steadily increasing to OR for 4+ vs. 0 additional reactions: 12.8 [11.7?13.9]). Independently from this, the well-known increase of FM contact allergy with age (OR 1.9 beyond age 60) and higher prevalence in female patch test patients, but only up to age 60, was confirmed, however, no decline beyond age 80 was observed. Moreover, it was found that not health care workers in general, but masseurs/physiotherapists, and, to a lesser extent, geriatric nurses have a high risk of FM contact allergy. In conclusion, our results confirm the profound impact of age, and partially of sex, on FM contact allergy, which makes stratification, standardization or adjustment a prerequisite for meaningful comparative analyses. The phenomenon of ?polysensitization? deserves further attention.

AB  - A 42-year?old non-atopic lady was treated with twice daily 2% clindamycin vaginal cream (Dalacin?) and ster-zac (bath antiseptic) for hidradenitis of the groins. She also had mild facial acne. She developed genital pruritus and erythema which quickly became generalised which she related to the use of ster-zac. However, when she applied clindamycin to her face a few weeks later, she developed a severe reaction which became generalised. The patient was patch tested with an extended European series, the clindamycin cream, ster-zac 1:100 and E45 which had also been used. Initially she developed an angry back picture which was difficult to assess but the standard testing was negative. Repeat patch testing to the constituents of the topical preparations used produced a reaction to clindamycin 1%, 5% and to dalacin cream ?as is?. Discussion: Coskey1 first described contact allergy to clindamycin in 1978. Since then there have been 6 further case reports. Mild local adverse reactions to topical clindamycin preparations such as burning, excessive dryness, itching and erythema are not uncommon, but more serious adverse events should prompt exclusion of a contact allergic component. Despite topical clindamycin being used for more than 25 years, sensitisation appears uncommon.

AB  - Objective:? To assess occupational dermal exposure to permanent hair dyes in hairdressers. Methods:? Dermal exposure was assessed in 31 hairdressers using a previously evaluated method, hand wash sampling with bag rinsing. The measurements were performed in hairdressing saloons during working hours. Hand wash samples were collected from each hand before start of the hair dyeing process, after application of the hair dye and after cutting the newly dyed hair. 13 of the hairdressers did not use gloves during application of the hair dye, and during cutting of the dyed hair no one used gloves. The samples were analysed for aromatic amines and resorcinol using an HPLC-method. Results:? After application of the hair dye PPD (p-phenylenediamine) was found in samples from 1 hairdressers (148?185?nmol/hand), TDA (toluenediamine) in samples from 12 hairdressers (range 10?735?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 22 individuals (range 19?769?nmol/hand). In the samples taken after cutting the dyed hair PPD was found in 2 hairdressers (range 36?358?nmol/hand), TDA in 14 (range 8?361?nmol/hand) and resorcinol in 20 (range 10?725?nmol/hand. Conclusion:? Skin exposure to aromatic amines and resorcinol was detected in more than half of the hairdressers after application of hair dye and also after cutting newly dyed hair. To reduce exposure improved skin protection is important.

AB  - Questionnaire-tools for surveying occupational skin diseases and exposure are needed for comparable epidemiological research, workplace assessments, and evaluation of workplace interventions. The Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire Group supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers has developed a standardized questionnaire-tool for surveys on work-related skin diseases and skin exposures to environmental factors. Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire (NOSQ-2002) includes two questionnaires designed for separate purposes. NOSQ-2002/short is a 4-page questionnaire for screening skin problems at workplaces. NOSQ-2002/long is an in-depth survey tool for research purposes. The questionnaire covers occupational history, atopic symptoms, self-reported hand or forearm eczema, exacerbating factors, consequences and life impact of dermatoses, self-reported contact urticaria on hands or forearms, skin symptoms, skin tests, exposures, and protective glove use. For the time being, NOSQ-2002 is available in English, Danish, Swedish, Finnish and Icelandic. Further translations are welcomed. The NOSQ-2002 report includes a review of pertinent literature on questionnaire methods for skin disease studies. Questions on work and exposure can be tailored to specific populations or occupational groups, according to the instructions and recommendations given in NOSQ-2002/INFO version of the questionnaire. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaire files can be downloaded from http://www.ami.dk/NOSQ. The Nordic Council of Ministers has the copyright to the NOSQ-2002 questionnaires. Use of the questionnaires is free of charge. The NOSQ-2002 questionnaires and their present and possible future translations cannot be used commercially.

AB  - Introduction:? Cutaneous adverse reactions from topical or systemic administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are frequently described. New cases of adverse reactions from NSAIDs are reported, but the most frequently involved are drugs as ketoprofen or piroxicam. We report a case of photoallergical contact dermatitis from diclophenac with possible cross reaction to aceclophenac. Material and methods:? A 63-year-old-man, allergic to penicillin, developed eczematous lesions on hands and face, after applying a medicament containing diclophenac. Patch test and photopatch test (5?J/cm2) were performed with a photoallergen battery (Chemotechnique diagnostics?), a NSAIDs battery (Aristegui lab.?) and aceclophenac 1%, 5% and 10% in pet. Readings were done at 48 and 96 hours in epicutaneous test and at 24 and 72 hours in photoallergic study, following the ICDRG criteria. Results:? The results of photoallergic study were as follows: diclophenac 1%, 5% and 10% in pet. and aceclophenac 10% in pet. positive at 24 and 72 hours. The remaining compounds of the NSAIDs battery were negative. Conclusions:? Diclophenac is a NAIDs derived from aryl alcanoic acid group used both topically and systemically in Spain. Some adverse reactions have been reported as exanthema, urticaria, eczema or Steven-Johnson?s syndrome. We have found only two cases reported as photosensitization from diclophenac. In one of them, the clinical lesion was described as a granuloma annular-like and photoallergic study was negative. We report a photocontact dermatitis from diclophenac with positive photopatch test. Photopatch test positive to aceclophenac may be explained as a cross reaction among group.

AB  - Classification and labeling of substances and preparations within the EU is made in accordance with the criteria as written out in Directive 67/548/EEC (?the substances directive?) and Directive 1999/45/EC (?the preparation directive? setting general concentration limits for preparations containing substances classified under 67/548). The basis for the criteria concerning hazard for skin sensitisation is based on practical experience showing that the substance or preparation is capable to induce a sensitization by skin contact in a substantial number of persons (appropriate patch testing or epidemiological data); or where positive tests from appropriate animal testing are available. Recently at the EU level and currently continued at the OECD, there is an expert discussion on the appropriateness to make potency considerations of skin sensitisers. The experts evaluate the possibility to set specific concentration limits for induction skin sensitisers contained in preparations. These limits would then give the possibility to classify such preparations better mirroring the reality than the current general limits given in the preparations directive. The first measure to prevent the hazard when a chemical or preparation fulfills the criteria to be classified as a skin sensitiser, is through the labeling indicating the standardized risk phrase: ?May cause sensitization by skin contact?, which also must be followed with an adequate safety advice. The classification of a substance has further consequences in other legal instruments on EU level leading to additional risk management measures.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to review the European legislation concerning the use of textile dyes. It is known that different dyes of different classes can be sensitizing and cause allergic contact dermatitis for both textile workers and consumers. The European Union has created restraining directives regarding the manufacture and distribution of potentially dangerous products, such as aromatic amines. A specific scientific committee of EU stated that the carcinogenic capacity of some azo dyes is related to chemical releasing of aromatic amines (groups MAK III; A1; A2). In this paper, focus will be centred on the latest European Union Directives in this matter and the prohibition of some azo dyes in textile industry.

AB  - Objective:? To study the usefulness of a trivalent gold salt, gold trichloride (GTC), as a marker for contact allergy to gold. Method: Patients patch test positive or negative to gold sodium thiosulfate (GSTS), 13 subjects of each, were patch-tested with dilution series of GTC and equimolar concentrations of GSTS; each series started at 0.03?mM and contained 5 steps. In order to avoid false positive and false negative test reactions the salts were dissolved in an alkaline buffer and placed on van der Bend? polypropene chambers. The tests were applied for 48?h; reading was blinded and performed on D3 and D7. Results:? Allergic reactions were observed in 9/13 gold-allergic patients with GSTS and in 2/13 with GTC. The sum of positive reactions was 18 with GSTS and 5 with GTC. Primary toxic reactions: 0 with GSTS and 2 with GTC among the gold-allergic patients; and 2 with GSTS and 1 with GTC among the controls. Conclusion:? GTC can elicit positive patch test reactions in patients with gold allergy but to a lesser degree than GSTS. GTC cannot be recommended for patch testing.

AB  - Background:? Several lines of evidence indicate a potential association between oral lichen-reactions and the presence of dental amalgam fillings. Aim:? We examined the relation between oral lichen reaction cases and the site of amalgam fillings in the oral cavity. Methods:? We conducted an observational study in 5 consecutive patients who had OLR and underwent to dental amalgam replacement. The number of total amalgam surfaces and OLR sites were charted. Saliva samples were taken and levels of total mercury were measured by CV-AAS method. Also we did patch-testing with dental series in all patients. Results: Our observational study revealed that oral lichen reactions may not have an association with the physical proximity the mercury tooth fillings. Unexpectedly, we noted a complete remission in patients with OLR (n?=?5). The patients with OLR presented allergies to mercury (n?=?4) or gold (n?=?1). All patients were negative for HCV/HBV and they had not been taking any drug-induced lichenoid mucositis. Findings:? In this case report series no topographical association was found between OLR and the dental amalgam fillings. All OLR cases were in full recovery after total amalgam removal within three months. Saliva mercury concentrations were significantly elevated in all subjects. After amalgam removal the mercury levels were undetectable. We suggest that dental amalgam removal is important therapeutic option in OLR cases even if the lichenoid lesions are not adjacent to dental amalgam restorations.

AB  - Sensitivity to fragrance ingredients is acknowledged as a common and clinically important problem in Europe. Aims of the project: The ?fragrance chemical allergy? project (QLK4-CT-1999-01558) funded by the European Commission under the Quality of Life programme was to increase the safety standard of fragrance compounds and provide more transparency in the data available, and to develop prevention of fragrance chemical allergy in non sensitised (primary prevention) and in already sensitised (secondary prevention) individuals. Primary prevention: A strategy for the rapid identification of sensitizers in complex mixture has been developed and 2 major sensitizers of oak moss, namely atranol and chloroatranol have been identified. Oxidation products, formed during storage and handling of common terpenes, have been shown to be involved in the sensitizing potential of fragrances. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships have been developed for 2 classes of aldehydes often present as perfume ingredients. Major fragrance allergens relevant to hand eczema have been identified. Secondary prevention: A new fragrance mix ?FMII? has been developed as a diagnostic tool for patients allergic to fragrances. An elicitation thresholds methodology has been established and validated with some important new sensitizers. The substitution strategy of sensitizing fragrance chemicals by analogues has been studied in the case of isoeugenol and demonstrated to be non relevant to consumer safety. Expected applications of results: Data generated by this project will be used as basis for decisions to improve consumer safety such as product labelling of the most frequent sensitizing materials, making guidelines for the evaluation of safe concentration limits, making rules of handling and best-before-date and banning of the most sensitizing compounds in consumer products. Participants: University Strasbourg (F), NIWL Stockholm (S), Unilever SEAC (UK), University Copenhagen (DK), University Witten/Herdecke (D), King?s College London (UK), NERI Roskilde (DK), University Odense (DK), University Malmö(S), University Leuven (B).

AB  - Objective:? The objective of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of the perfusion of the contact hypersensitivity response as measured by the laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) technique was associated with immunological parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Methods:? Urushiol was applied on one of the forearms of volunteers for 48 hours while the other forearm served as a control. Twenty-four hours later, measurements of perfusion of the patch test sites were performed with the LDPI technique. To determine whether there was a correlation with immunological parameters associated with human contact hypersensitivity, suction blisters were produced at the test sites. Blister fluid was removed and examined for the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Results:? There was an extremely close correlation between the magnitude of the contact hypersensitivity response as measured by the imaged perfusion and the level of IL-8 in the blister fluid (r?=?1.00). Compared to subjects with visually positive urushiol reactions, patients who failed to develop urushiol contact hypersensitivity despite repeated exposures to that substance had both greatly diminished perfusion and blister fluid IL-8 levels. Conclusion:? The results indicate that LDPI is a sensitive method of quantifying contact hypersensitivity reactions in humans and that the magnitude of the measurements with this technique correlates extremely well with cutaneous cytokine levels that have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of contact hypersensitivity.
