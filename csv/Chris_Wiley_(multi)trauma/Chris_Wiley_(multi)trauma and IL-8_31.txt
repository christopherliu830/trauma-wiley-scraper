AB  - In clinical studies on hand eczema (HE) an objective and accurate assessment of the severity of the disease is needed. The present study was undertaken in order to develop and validate a scoring system called the hand eczema severity index (HECSI) designed for clinical assessment of HE. Twelve dermatologists (observers) assessed 15 HE patients (11 women and 4 men) twice with an interval of 30?min. To minimise recall bias only the hands and wrists of the patients were visible to the observers. Agreement between the observers was determined by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). ICC for total HECSI score was 0.79 at time 1 and 0.85 at time 2 respectively. When looking at ICC for the different items in the scoring system (extent of lesions, anatomical location and intensity of clinical signs) best agreement was found for extension followed by anatomical location and least agreement was found for the scoring of clinical signs. ICC for intraobserver agreement was 0.90. A regression correlation coefficient of 0.993 was found (simple linear regression analysis of time 1 scores against time 2 scores) indicating high reproducibility. Overall good agreement existed for both inter- and intraobserver reliability although some inter- and intraobserver variation existed.

AB  - Methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone is an effective preservative and a major cause of cosmetic allergy in most European countries. On the face unusual clinical presentations are seborrhoeic dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, lymphocytic infiltrate, photodermatosis or atopic dermatitis. Three patients who suffered a chronic, recurrent, itchy and generalized cutaneous erytematous-desquamative and eczematous eruption with a common pathologic event, an atypical lymphoid infiltrate, whose induction by a contact allergen can be discussed are presented. The first, a 59 years old man showed a biopsy with an atypical dermal-epidermal T cell infiltrate of mycosis fungoides and monoclonal TCR-rearrangement. The second, a 74 years old man showed an atypical lymphoid infiltration with polyclonal TCR-rearrangement and a second biopsy showed an eczematous pattern. The third, a 50 year old man with pathology of plaque parapsoriasis with atypical lymphoid infiltrate. The three patients showed strong positive reaction to methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone (0.01%aq.) Trolab,,?. Avoiding the allergen the cutaneous eruption disappeared and any recurrence has been observed yet. Pathologic criteria for mycosis fungoides remains controversial and could not be done only on the basis of cellular density or the percentage of atypical T-cells. Autoinvolutive mycosis fungoides shows the unknowledge of its pathogenesis. How some allergens could affect on the cellular life needs further studies. We highly recommend to patch test all patients with atypical cutaneous T-cell infiltrates.

AB  - Objectives:? To analyse the yearly incidence rates and causes of occupational skin diseases (OSD) in different metal-working industries. Methods:? Between 1990 and 1999, all new cases of OSD and their causes were prospectively recorded in all metal-working enterprises of Northern Bavaria. We calculated the incidence rates according to the average employed population. Furthermore, we analysed the different allergens, irritants and constitutional factors (e.g. atopy) in the affected metal workers. Results:? In metal workers, a total of 700 OSDs were registered which comprise 18.8% of all OSDs in our register. They were classified into metal-surface processors (260 OSDs, yearly incidence per 10,000 employees?=?10.4), metal processors (129 OSDs, 5.9), locksmiths and automobile mechanics (119 OSDs, 2.5), electrical industry (69 OSDs, 1.4), machinists (47 OSDs, 11.6), mechanics (40 OSDs, 6.6), electroplaters (22 OSDs, 20.6) and solderers (14 OSDs, 13.4). The proportion between allergic (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) varies conspicuously. While electroplaters and solderers predominantly suffer from ACD (82% resp. 71%), in other occupational groups ICD is more common: mechanics (60%), locksmiths and automobile mechanics (59%) or metal-surface processors (53%). The type IV allergens differ widely depending on the occupational exposure. The most important allergen in solderers is colophony, in electroplaters nickel sulphate and potassium dichromate. There is a wide range of allergens in metal working fluids and it is mandatory to patch test patient?s own working materials due to the fact that important allergens are not yet included in the screening series.

AB  - Hand eczema is a common skin disease that often becomes chronic, and treatment of the disease is often challenging. Skin protection is of great importance for the prevention of hand eczema and is a fundamental aspect of the treatment of hand eczema. Emollients have been shown to be successful in the primary prevention of hand eczema as well as in reducing eczema activity. Topical corticosteroids are still the mainstay of treatment, but randomised controlled trials of their efficacy are needed. A combination of tacrolimus and topical corticosteroids may reduce the risk of steroid-associated side-effects. UV-therapy and Grenz rays can also suppress hand eczema. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and methotrexate show promising results, and acitretin may suppress keratotic hand eczema. Treatment possibilities for hand eczema, indications and side effects will be discussed.

AB  - Background:? The need for prevention to reduce the number of occupational hand eczema is high. Occupational hand eczema is the most frequently recognised work-related disease in Denmark. Previous findings have shown that almost half of all cases develop a chronic condition with persistent dermatitis, and the annual cost to society is immense. Aims:? The aim of this study was to survey the trends and development of occupational hand eczema in Denmark and thereby help to ensure future successful prevention of chronic disabling occupational hand eczema. Methods:? 758 patients with recognised occupational hand eczema were included prospectively in the period October 2001- November 2002. Data on diagnoses, disease duration, severity, absence from work and occupation was obtained from The Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries and an additional questionnaire was administered by mail. Results:? 621 patients answered the questionnaire (response rate 82%). Irritant contact dermatitis was the most frequent diagnosis and the female/male ratio was 2:1. High prevalence was found in particularly wet occupations. 19 per cent had sick leave more than 5 weeks per year and the mean disease duration was 4.8 years (median 2.1 years). 68.2% had chronic changes. Conclusion:? The results showed a marked gender difference in the pattern of diagnosis and occupation. The impact of occupational hand eczema is still high with prolonged absence from work and a high percentage of chronic disease. The results of the study give important suggestions for future preventive strategies for health authorities.

AB  - Objectives:? To study the healing time of an experimental eczema treated with Flutivate? cream, a potent corticosteroid containing a formaldehyde releasing preservative, in patients allergic to formaldehyde and controls not allergic to formaldehyde. Methods:? 24 individuals allergic to nickel, 7 of whom were also allergic to formaldehyde, had a nickel-allergic contact dermatitis experimentally induced on both upper arms. The dermatitis was treated twice daily for a maximum of 3 weeks or until healing with either Flutivate? cream or Betnovate? cream, a corticosteroid with the same potency but containing another preservative, which was tolerated by all 24 study persons. The study was double-blind and randomized. Results:? In 12/17 controls (71%) the nickel-allergic contact dermatitis healed completely when treated with Flutivate? cream compared to 2/7 formaldehyde-allergic patients (29%)(p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? Flutivate? cream should not be used by individuals allergic to formaldehyde.

AB  - Objectives:? Occupational skin diseases (OSDs) account for a large number of occupational diseases in Europe. Population-based epidemiological studies concerning certain occupations (e.g. Health care workers), however, are missing. Aim of our study was to analyse the reports of OSD in Health care workers (HCW) in the register of OSDs of Northern Bavaria and to assess the annual incidence in this occupational group in relationship to the total employed population in Northern Bavaria. Further, we investigated the spectrum of sensitizations with and without occupational relevance in this group. Methods:? A total of 5285 cases of OSD were assessed prospectively and registered from 1990?1999. Data of total employment were provided by the German Federal Employment office. Results:? A total of 3097 cases were confirmed as OSD in 24 occupational groups, of which 482 were confirmed in the group of HCW. The average annual incidence of OSD in this group accounted for 7.3 per 10,000 workers. In 1990 the incidences in this occupational group accounted for 11.4%, in 1999 for 5.0% per 10,000 workers with highest incidences in younger age groups. In the evaluated health care workers from the register of OSD in Northern Bavaria 54%(n?=?260) had irritant and 51%(n?=?244) had allergic contact dermatitis including 19%(n?=?89) who suffered from both. Of the 482 HCW 13% had occupational relevant Type IV allergy to glutaraldehyde, 12% to thiurams, 6% to nickel (II) sulfate, 4% to formaldehyde or fragances, respectively, 2% to thimerosal, potassium (II) chloride, chloromethyl-isothiazolone and p-phenylendiamine (free base) each. Conclusions:? HCW belong to the occupational groups at exceedingly high risk for OSD. Higher frequencies of OSD occur in younger age groups. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis are equally common causes of OSD in HCW. Sensitization to certain allergens (e.g. glutaraldehyde, thiurams and latex) are most often of occupational relevance, whereas others although frequently found (e.g. sensitization to nickel-II-sulfate, cobalt-II-chloride, fragance-mix) rarely are of occupational relevance.

AB  - Objectives:? Diphenylmethane-4,4?-diisocyanate (MDI) is a very common isocyanate which is used in the plastics industry in its? polymeric form in the production of polyurethane products such as rigid and flexible foams, elastomers (rubbers) and coatings. Previous reports on MDI-related contact allergy have shown a pattern where patients seem to react to their own MDI-based work material but not to the commercial patch test preparations of MDI. Therefore, we performed chemical analysis of 14 commercial patch test preparations of MDI. Materials and Methods:? MDI preparations from 8 European and 4 American dermatology departments as well as preparations obtained from 2 major European suppliers of patch test allergens were analyzed with respect to MDI content using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results:? None of the preparations obtained from dermatology departments contained more than 12% of the concentration stated on the label. In most cases the MDI content was only a few percentages or less of the concentration stated. In only 1 commercial preparation the MDI content came close to the declared concentration. Conclusion:? 7 of the 14 preparations were analyzed before the expiry date. Yet, only 1 of them contained a concentration that came close to that stated on the label. Thus, using these preparations patients will be tested with a much lower concentration than intended leading to a high risk of false-negative reactions and thereby underdiagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis from MDI.

AB  - A large number of monoterpenes and their degradation products are likely skin sensitizing agents (Hausen et al., 1999). Terpenes are very common e.g., as constituents of cosmetics, food and other daily used products. We investigated responses to the endoperoxide 1,4-epidioxy-2-p-menthen (ascaridol), an autoxidation product of tea tree oil, using monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDC). Therefore, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 9 healthy donors by the standard Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were isolated by adherence and incubated in media (RPMI 1640) containing GM-CSF (800 units/ml), IL-4 (1000 units/ml) and 10% autologous serum. The immature MDDC (day 6) were characterized by flow cytometry (CD1a+, CD14?, CD40, CD45, CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR and CCR-7) and incubated with various concentrations of ascaridol (1?70??g/ml). After one hour incubation time LPS was added (1??g/ml) for 23?h. Cell culture supernatants were collected after 24?h for cytokine analysis. IL-12p40, IL-12p70 and prostaglandin E2 were measured by ELISA, TNF-alpha and IL-2 were measured by flow cytometry (FACS). Methods of the quantification of steady state mRNA levels were established for IL-12 and CCR7 (real-time RT-PCR). Ascaridol enhanced significantly IL-12p70 production (120% up to 396%) by MDDC as well as mRNA levels for IL-12 and CCR7. Moreover, we detected a distinct increase of TNF-alpha (110% up to 146%) secretion, IL-2 (135%) and PGE2 (102% up to 155%). Totally, these results suggest that ascaridol may be a potent modulator of maturation and antigen presenting function of dendritic cells, and we performing further experiments to verify this hypothesis. This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

AB  - Objectives:? In the prevention of occupational contact dermatitis the usage of personal skin protection measures have a high priority, however there is a lack of intervention field studies to demonstrate its efficacy. Therefore we conducted a field study in a plant of the metal-working industry and investigated the efficacy of an established skin protection programme. Methods:? First, a professional dermatological appraisal of the current status and a skin-protection analysis were carried out for 180 company employees, and a dermatological evaluation of each workplace from the aspect of prevention was conducted. Using the information obtained a skin protection programme for the whole company was devised and subsequently set up. The follow-up examination was performed eight months later. Results:? At the beginning of the study 26% of the employees were found to have skin problems related to the work they were doing. In 50% of the cases skin protection was never or only rarely used, with the right kind of skin protection almost never being applied. There was no skin protection programme in place meeting today?s professional dermatological requirements, or at the most there were just the first signs of one. After the programme had been set up and suitable instruction and information given there was a follow-up observation period of eight months, during which several professional dermatological examinations of the employees were carried out and further instruction (individual prevention) was given. In the final examination only 8.7% of the employees were found to have work related skin problems. Conclusions:? We could demonstrated that the occurrence of occupationally-related hand eczema can be significantly reduced by setting up and providing instruction in a skin protection concept matched to the hazards the skin is exposed to at work. Additionally, valuable knowledge and experience were gained on implementing industrial skin protection programmes and performing intervention studies.

AB  - Objective:? Evaluate activity of a corticosteroid on dendritic cell (DC) activation induced by skin sensitizers. Methods:? Using a fetal mouse skin derived dendritic cell line (FSDC) stimulated by Nickel sulphate (50?100?ìg/ml) and DNFB (1?2.5?ìg/ml), we studied the effect of dexamethasone (DEX)(0.01?1?ìM) on nitric oxide (NO) production (by the Griess reaction), on nitric oxide synthase type II expression (iNOS)(by immunocytochemistry and western blot) and on the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway (NF-êB)(by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ? EMSA), pathways that we have previously shown to be activated by these sensitizers. Results:? NO production induced by Ni was significantly inhibited by DEX in a dose dependent way. Future studies using 0.5?ìM of DEX, showed a significant reduction of iNOS expression at 24?h induced by both sensitizers. This effect occurred in parallel with the inhibition of NF-êB activation, which was most evident at 45?min. Conclusions:? These results suggest that dexamethasone inhibits intracellular events that are relevant for DC activation induced by skin sensitizers during antigen presentation. Therefore, besides the anti-inflammatory activity of DEX usually used for the treatment of ACD, this drug can also interfere with the initial steps of skin sensitization.

AB  - The patch test results of patients tested at least twice at our clinic during a period of 11 years were analyzed with regard to reproducibility of the positive patch test reactions found in the first patch testing session. A retrospective analysis of 257 patients who have been tested with the TRUE Test at least twice between 1991 and 2002 and had a minimum of one positive reaction in the first testing session was done. Test reactions were read routinely after 3 and 5?7 days. In the first testing session a total of 299 positive reactions were found. Of these allergens, 151 (51%) stayed positive in the second test, 31 (10%) produced a doubtful reaction, 67 (22%) a negative response, and 50 (17%) were not retested because of strong positive reactions in the first test. Of the individual allergens, positive reactions from thiuram-mix, kathon CG and colophony were the most reproducible. If it is assumed that allergens which were not retested because of strong positive reactions would have shown positive reactions in a retest, a total of 68% of positive reactions were reproduced. A multitude of factors, such as: avoidance of relevant allergens between tests, diminished sensitivity, retesting within a period of more or less active dermatitis, different observers, methodological error, and prior false-positive responses, influence the reproducibility of patch tests. The results will be put in perspective.

AB  - Infliximab is a chimeric antitumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody used to treat Crohn?s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Acute infusion reactions, headache, fever, chills, urticaria and chest pain were seen in 17% of patients with infliximab compared with 7% of those receiving placebo. Other adverse cutaneous reactions are fungal dermatitis, eczema, seborrhoea, hordeolum, bullous eruption, furunculosis, periorbital oedema, hyperkeratosis, rosacea, verruca, skin pigmentation, alopecia, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lichenoid drug eruption, erythema multiforme, perniosis-like eruption, granuloma annulare and acute folliculitis. Any pathogenic mechanism has been suggested. Patch test with infliximab can induce flare-up of lesions, nausea and malaise and suggest a percutaneous absortion. A sixty years-old man with atopy background and rheumatoid arthritis treated with Remicare?, infliximab who developed a severe acute urticaria with angioedema is presented. The lesions appearance after previous endovenous administrations and the worsening spreading wheals days after the injection clinically suggested an hypersensitivity mechanism. The protocolized study drug hypersensitivity performed showed only the Prick Test positivity with infliximab at 30/60 minutes. Patch test with infliximab was negative and any adverse event was reported. Actually the patient is treated with etanercept and this drug is well tolerated. This result suggested a type I hypersensitivity mediated reaction. Urticaria could be induced as immunologic reaction of the host against the murine part of infliximab, just as it hapens with other antichimeric antibodies.

AB  - Background and aim:? Recent studies have demonstrated that contact sensitization to Compositae is not uncommon in adults. However, to our knowledge, no data are available in children. Our purpose was to investigate the prevalence of contact sensitization to Compositae in a pediatric population. Methods:? 434 consecutive pediatric patients (205 M; 229 F; mean age 6,7?,,b3,4 years) with suspected allergic contact dermatitis were patch tested with 30 haptens comprising Composite mix 5%(Tenacetum volgare, Arnica montana, Partenolide, Chamomilla recutitia, Achillea millefolium) at the Dermatology Unit of the Department of Pediatrics in Padua. Results:? 11 patients (7 M; 4 F; mean age 5,6?,,b2,8 years) had a positive patch test reaction to Compositae mix. In all these patients dermatitis was localized on the face and/or on the hands. Most of them had more than one positive reaction. 6 were affected by atopic dermatitis, 2 had a personal history of mucosal atopy and one had both. In 8 patients (5 with atopic dermatitis, 2 with mucosal atopy) the reaction was considered clinically relevant. Conclusion: It might be useful to add Compositae mix to the pediatric screening series, when investigating dermatitis of air-exposed areas in children with atopic diseases.

AB  - We observed a 65 years old male patient with pruritus, scaling erythema and liquenification areas on the face, neck, forearms and hands. For six years he had a story of episodic crisis of exsudative erythema associated with farm work. The skin biopsy showed irregular acantosis with slight hyperkeratosis and a mild multifocal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, with many eosinophils. The patch tests with the Contact Dermatitis Portuguese Group of Study standard tray were positive for colophony, perfume mix and lactone mix. The patch tests with plant series were positive to atranorin, usnic acid, alantolactone, Parthenolide, lichen mix, Frulania dilatata, Achillea millefolium and Tanacetum extracts. Treatment was started with oral prednisone and hydroxyzine plus topical hydrocortisone and emollient cream with great improvement. The patient was advised about the avoidance of possible allergens sources. This kind of multisensitization to plants is an uncommon finding and poses diagnostic and therapeutic problems. This patient had a sustained recovery by avoiding farm work and by removal of in house plants.

AB  - Millions of chemical protective gloves are used every day in Europe. Unfortunately, many are not achieving the level of performance needed to protect the health of the worker, although neither employer nor user are aware of this. The way in which such gloves perform is complex and affected by a whole range of factors. A method of integrating these into a simple method for selection and use has proved to be extremely difficult. This presentation will review the many factors that affect glove performance under actual working conditions and show how a system for the selection and use of gloves for chemical protection might be developed. A novel method for testing gloves under actual working conditions so as to correctly identify performance will be proposed.

AB  - Objective:? To study the usefulness of a trivalent gold salt, gold trichloride (GTC), as a marker for contact allergy to gold. Method: Patients patch test positive or negative to gold sodium thiosulfate (GSTS), 13 subjects of each, were patch-tested with dilution series of GTC and equimolar concentrations of GSTS; each series started at 0.03?mM and contained 5 steps. In order to avoid false positive and false negative test reactions the salts were dissolved in an alkaline buffer and placed on van der Bend? polypropene chambers. The tests were applied for 48?h; reading was blinded and performed on D3 and D7. Results:? Allergic reactions were observed in 9/13 gold-allergic patients with GSTS and in 2/13 with GTC. The sum of positive reactions was 18 with GSTS and 5 with GTC. Primary toxic reactions: 0 with GSTS and 2 with GTC among the gold-allergic patients; and 2 with GSTS and 1 with GTC among the controls. Conclusion:? GTC can elicit positive patch test reactions in patients with gold allergy but to a lesser degree than GSTS. GTC cannot be recommended for patch testing.

AB  - Background:? Several lines of evidence indicate a potential association between oral lichen-reactions and the presence of dental amalgam fillings. Aim:? We examined the relation between oral lichen reaction cases and the site of amalgam fillings in the oral cavity. Methods:? We conducted an observational study in 5 consecutive patients who had OLR and underwent to dental amalgam replacement. The number of total amalgam surfaces and OLR sites were charted. Saliva samples were taken and levels of total mercury were measured by CV-AAS method. Also we did patch-testing with dental series in all patients. Results: Our observational study revealed that oral lichen reactions may not have an association with the physical proximity the mercury tooth fillings. Unexpectedly, we noted a complete remission in patients with OLR (n?=?5). The patients with OLR presented allergies to mercury (n?=?4) or gold (n?=?1). All patients were negative for HCV/HBV and they had not been taking any drug-induced lichenoid mucositis. Findings:? In this case report series no topographical association was found between OLR and the dental amalgam fillings. All OLR cases were in full recovery after total amalgam removal within three months. Saliva mercury concentrations were significantly elevated in all subjects. After amalgam removal the mercury levels were undetectable. We suggest that dental amalgam removal is important therapeutic option in OLR cases even if the lichenoid lesions are not adjacent to dental amalgam restorations.
