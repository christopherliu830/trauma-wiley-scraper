AB  - Background:? Throughout medical literature, there are conflicting data on the relationship between atopy and contact sensitisation. Some authors believe that atopy is a protective factor against contact allergy, whereas others say it is a risk factor. Facing this contradiction, this study was undertaken to reassess the possible relationship. Study design:? In 5 vocational schools, 1 randomly selected class in each was invited to participate. Altogether 135 students were tested, 73 females and 62 males aged 18?19 years. As markers of atopy, positive skin prick tests, Phadiatop and elevated total IgE (>120?kU/l) were selected. Patch tests were used for the detection of contact sensitivity. Skin tests included 10 contact allergens and 16 aeroallergens relevant for this population. The tests were carried out and scored according to the ICDRG and EAACI guidelines. Statistical analysis of the relationships included Fisher?s chi-square test and odds ratios. Results:? Positive patch tests (at least 1+ reaction) were found in 28.1% of the study subjects, positive prick test (wheal diameter at least 3?mm) in 23.7%, positive Phadiatop in 20.0%, and elevated total IgE in 23.7%. No statistically significant relationship between atopy markers and patch test results could be found. For each analysed feature, odds ratios remained close to the value of 1. As a ?positive control? for the study design, the known relationship between female gender and positive patch test could be reconfirmed (for nickel: p?=?0.003, OR?=?12.0, 95%CI: 2.7?54.1). Conclusion:? In general population, there is no (or little) correlation between atopy and contact sensitisation.

AB  - Although the primary point of intervention for the prevention of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) should be appropriate assessment and management of potential skin sensitization hazards, there is nevertheless a place for secondary prevention in individuals who are already sensitized. Thus it is necessary to ensure a full appreciation of the variables impacting the elicitation of ACD exist. To this end, we have been engaged in a series of investigations of the elicitation of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) sensitization. In particular, we have studied the impact of duration and frequency of exposure on elicitation. Using groups of PPD sensitized volunteers, in patch tests and repeated open application tests, we have shown that exposures of only a few minutes are often without consequence in such individuals, except where the exposure is often repeated and/or the individual is highly allergic. With volunteers who were 1+ or 2+ positive to the diagnostic patch test, and where exposure to PPD was at 0.5%?1.0% in a short contact rinse-off hair colouring product, no scalp reactions were experienced. It is our view that the establishment of safe exposure limits to contact allergens should be based wherever possible on a detailed assessment of the risk to sensitized humans.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction mediated by allergen specific T-lymphocytes. Allergen exposure leads to the activation of specific T-lymphocytes, which subsequently start to produce and release a vast array of cytokines and chemokines. However, the list of relevant genes taking part in the elicitation phase of contact dermatitis is not complete. In this study, we evaluate the use of the high-density microarray technology, which enable us to assess the global gene expression in allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We included 3 chromium-allergic patients and 3 non-allergic controls in the study. Cultures of PBMC were established from each participant and stimulated with 100?ug/ul CrCl3 or media alone. The cell cultures were grown for 24 hours and the gene expression was analysed using an Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Array. Of the genes that exhibited differences of expression (p?<?0.01) in allergen-activated PBMC from patients compared to controls, 54%(159/294) displayed increased activity and 46%(136/294) displayed decreased activity. Of the 159 up-regulated genes, 41 genes had a fold change above 1.50 and 30 genes among the 136 down-regulated genes had a fold change below -1.5. A significant number of the genes that showed differential expression in the cell cultures established from the allergic patients are known to be involved in immune responses and inflammation. The data indicates that the method of microarrays is a valuable tool for investigating the gene expression profile in our model system for allergic contact dermatitis.

AB  - Objectives:? Study patch test reactivity to nickel sulphate and fragrance mix in a population of unselected infants with focus on reproducibility, clinical relevance, and nickel patch test concentration. Method:? The data presented is part of a clinical epidemiological study of allergic diseases in newborns followed prospectively with questionnaire, clinical examination and testing at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of age. TRUE Test patches were used with nickel sulphate in 3 concentrations: 200, 66, 22?ìg/cm2 and fragrance mix 430?ìg/cm2. A positive reaction suggesting sensitisation was defined as at least palpable erythema present at both the 12 and 18 months follow-up visits. Results:? A total of 543 children (268 girls, 275 boys) were patch tested at least once, 304 children were tested at both 12 and 18 months. The prevalence of a reproducible positive reaction to nickel sulphate 200?ìg/cm2 was 8.6%(20 girls, 6 boys). A transient reactivity was observed in 111 children (53 girls, 58 boys). A clinical relevance to nickel was found in only one child. There was no association between number of patch test procedures performed and reactions to nickel sulphate. Reproducible reactivity to fragrance mix was not found. Conclusion:? A high proportion of transient patch test reactivity to nickel sulphate 200?ìg/cm2 was found. Patch testing with nickel in concentrations used for adults cannot be recommended in infants. The interpretation of a singular positive nickel patch test in small children must be assessed with caution. Allergic reactions to fragrance mix were not found in this age group.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to know the prevalence of allergic patch test responses in patients with suspected fragrance allergy in Korea and to know the photoxic potentials of limited fragrance substances. Nine dermatology departments of university hospitals and one research institute of cosmetic company were participated in this study for the past 1 year. To inquire the specific fragrance allergens in Korea, eighteen fragrance ingredients were added to Korean standard series and fragrance series (Chemotechnique Diagnosis, Sweden). Among 422 patients, 83% were women and the most common topographic site was face. Except the fragrance mix and Balsam of Peru, Cinnamic alcohol and Sandalwood oil showed high frequency of positive responses. Among the added specific fragrance ingredients, 3-methyl-5-(2,2,3-trimethyl-3-cyclopenen-1-yl) pent-4-en-2-ol, alpha-isomethyl-ionone(methyl ionone gamma), Lyral showed high positive responses. With eighteen added specific fragrance substances, we have also performed two in vitro phototoxicity tests, 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test and photohemolysis test. 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test is a screening method for DNA or cellular damage and Photohemolysis test is a useful screening method for phototoxic chemicals that cause oxygen-dependent membrane damage. Only Lyral showed phototoxicity in photohemolysis test and no other fragrance ubstances showed phototoxicity in 3T3 NRU phtototoxicity test. We think our data are useful to know the current status of the frequent fragrance allergens in our society and the possible phototoxic potency of limited fragrance substances.

AB  - Concomitant sensitizations to Nickel, Cobalt and Chromate are often observed among patch test patients. However, the reasons for being sensitized to two or more of these substances are not completely understood. Examination of IVDK (http://www.ivdk.org) patch test results with multivariate procedures has been conducted to further elucidate the mechanisms involved with these sensitizations and potential exposure factors that may have led to the concomitant sensitizations. Gender, age, occupational dermatitis, and construction work were considered and examined with multivariate logistic regression models with the dependent response variable being concurrent reactions to a metal pair versus no reactions. In addition to the aforementioned anamnestic data, examination of a poly-sensitizations variable (reactions to 1, 2, or 3 standard series allergens other than Nickel, Cobalt or Chromate) provided information regarding general susceptibility to positive patch test reactions. Combined reactions to Cobalt and Chromate were strongly linked to construction work (OR?=?11.23 (7.46, 16.90)) and occupational dermatitis. Female patch test patients had a higher odds of a positive patch test reaction to both Nickel and Cobalt (OR?=?4.73 (3.81, 5.87)). Sensitization to other, unrelated standard series substances was associated with concurrent reactions to all of the metal pairs. The association between construction work and Cobalt-Chromate reactions corresponds with the hypothesis that cement exposures lead to cobalt-chromate sensitizations. Individual susceptibility to delayed-type sensitizations, as represented by the poly-sensitization variable, also appears to be associated with coupled sensitizations to metals and warrants further examination.

AB  - Covalent binding of hapten to skin protein is required for sensitisation. It has long been postulated that only sensitising chemicals will modify skin protein(s), whereas non-sensitisers and irritants do not. To pinpoint the amino acid residues involved in such modifications, we employed mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics techniques. Known sensitisers, non-sensitisers and irritants were incubated with human serum albumin (HSA). Modified HSA samples were digested by trypsin and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI-MS) analyses were conducted on the digests. Nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ES-MS/MS) analyses were conducted on modified peptides purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HSA sequence was mapped and modified peptides identified. In HSA samples incubated with non-sensitisers and irritants there was no change compared to HSA incubated without chemical. Modified peptides were purified by HPLC and sequenced using ES-MS/MS. Lysine, histidine and cysteine were found to be involved in covalent modifications by the sensitising chemicals used. A double adduct of one sensitiser (MCI) on His 338 of HSA molecule was also identified. More sensitisers need to be investigated to establish similarities between covalent protein modifications of chemically related compounds. The aim is to develop an assay for protein binding ability of chemicals which could form part of a battery of tests needed to replace animal testing for sensitisation potential.

AB  - Risk assessments of chemicals are key issues in our live. Prior to industrialisation, risk assessments based on individual experience, for the allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) for instance, after contact with allergic plants affecting the skin exposed. Today, the risk to get an ADC becomes more and more important, because of increasing contact to new chemicals because of frequent contact with consumer products. Therefore sufficient test systems are required, appropriate to estimate the sensitisation potential of individual chemicals. To be able to predict weak sensitisers, adjuvants were simultaneously injected to test animals to booster their allergic reactions. One of the most well known test method, is the maximisation test in guinea pigs according to Magnusson and Kligman. Regulatory authorities have required this method for chemical classification, as well as for estimating the risk to get sensitised when dermaly exposed. Beside the advantages of these guinea pig studies, the limitations became prominent not only in respect to ethical aspects, but also because of the lack to quantify the sensitisation potency of chemicals. To be able to perform accurate, realistic risk assessments, the knowledge of potency is becoming mandatory, especially when sensitive test methods are used. Based on the possibility to measure the biological response during induction of sensitisation, the local lymph node assay (LLNA) gets popular. Today, this test is officially accepted by regulators to give information on skin sensitisation potential. With the quantitative approach on potency, risk assessment of ACD will become much more reliable and useful for Men.

AB  - When considering the allergenic activity of a compound not only the possibility of bioactivation by skin metabolism but also air activation by autoxidation must be taken into account. Natural compounds (terpenes) easily oxidize at air exposure. They are found in products that are common causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) i.e. colophony and fragrances. The introduction of oxygen enables the molecules to form antigens with skin proteins via a nucleophilic- electrophilic interaction or via a radical reaction. The latter mechanism seems to be important since the primary oxidation products, the hydroperoxides, are the most potent sensitizers formed. Oxidative decomposition at air exposure resulting in allergenic oxidation products is observed also for other common compounds e.g. ethoxylated fatty alcohols used as surfactants. It is important to test the patient with the offending compounds for diagnosis of ACD. A negative diagnosis can be due to failure in testing with the correct substances. In the case of air activated compounds, testing should not be performed with the pure substances but rather with the oxidation mixture or the most sensitizing oxidation products (the hydroperoxides). We have in multicenter-studies shown that the common fragrance terpenes, limonene and linalool, are frequent sensitizers when oxidized. This is a challenge in clinical practice since such patch test materials are not easily standardized. Compounds, easily activated at air exposure, should be prevented from oxidative decomposition by addition of antioxidants and proper handling and storage. More research is needed in this area.

AB  - We have previously reported that, with suitable training and experience, skin irritation reactions can be graded visually with a high degree of sensitivity and precision. The objective of the work presented is to demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of the grading of skin irritation reactions by subjective visual assessment. In the present work, we have recorded a wide range of relatively minor skin irritation reactions using a high quality digital camera. The skin reactions recorded have then been graded by independent observers according to their appearance on a computer monitor. The results show that very subtle degrees of both erythema and skin dryness can be accurately described by trained skin graders in a reliable and reproducible manner. Examples of the grading scales and sensitivity of scoring will be shown. We conclude that visual scoring, when conducted well, represents a rapid and accurate method for the assessment of minor degrees of skin irritation. The present evidence, taken in combination with previously presented information on bioengineering techniques, leads us to the conclusion that visual assessment is both an adequate and a robust technique, delivering information of the quality necessary for safety assessment of consumer products.

AB  - Objective:? To determine the efficacy of a topical, MAS063D, in managing the clinical signs and symptoms of experimentally induced irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). Methods:? Two patches of ICD were created using sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) in 20 consenting volunteers. MAS063D was applied to one patch and a vehicle-only control to the other. Measurements were taken at baseline, 24, 48 and 72 hours as follows: blood flow volume (BFV); skin color (a*); transepidermal water loss (TEWL); patient?s view of itch and visual scoring. Results: The objective measurements of BFV, a* and TEWL all showed statistically significant benefits of MAS063D over the vehicle-only control. BFV and a* were significantly better at all time points (p?=?0.046, p?=?0.045 respectively at 72 hours) and TEWL at 48 and 72 hours (p?=?0.02 at 72 hours). MAS063D demonstrated benefit in the visual scoring of irritant contact dermatitis that was not statistically significant. Patient-assessed itch was low at baseline; significant improvement was neither expected nor demonstrated although a small benefit of MAS063D over vehicle was seen in the mean values. Conclusions:? BFV and a* are both good indicators of local erythema. TEWL is a good indicator of skin integrity. MAS063D therefore demonstrated statistically significant benefit over vehicle on three clinically meaningful outcomes of SLS-induced ICD, and therefore may benefit irritant contact dermatitis.

AB  - Objectives:? To identify substances and tonnage data for use for hair dyes registered in Europe. To predict the sensitization potential of each substance and to rank the substances due to their sensitization potential. Further to group the substances in clusters based on their physical chemical properties with a cluster analysis. Methods:? The Inventory list of Cosmetics Ingredients (INCI), new regulation on cosmetics, tonnage data for use and Toxnet were used to identify and quantify the hair dyes. Salts were disregarded. A QSAR (Qualitative structure-activity relationship) model called TOPS-MODE, based on local lymph node assay (LLNA) data and physical chemical properties were used to predict the sensitization potential and make a cluster analysis. Results:? Out of 315 hair dye substances 229 meet the inclusion criteria. Most of the hair dye substances 75% were predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers. Less were predicted to be weak 22% and only a small part 3% were predicted to be extremely weak or non sensitizing. The 8 most used hair dye substances were predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers. Ppd is the most used hair dye allergy marker but some azodyes were predicted to be more potent than para-phenylenediamine (ppd). Conclusions:? Most hair dye substances are predicted to be strong to moderate sensitizers, which explain why some people gets hair dye dermatitis. A patch test series with potent, much used azodyes, might prove useful in diagnosing ppd-negative patients, with hair dye allergy. The cluster analysis grouped the substances which can be helpful choosing substances for clinical patch test.

AB  - Iodopropynylbutyl carbamate (IPBC)is a preservative that has been increasingly used for skin care products and cosmetics within the last years and the first cases of contact sensitization have meanwhile been reported. Therefore, a surveillance for IPBC contact allergy is now necessary. Our study was aimed to find out a suitable test concentration of IPBC for this purpose. The data 8106 patients tested by 23 centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK)in the time from May 2001 to July 2003 with IPBC in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.5% were retrospectively evaluated. Criteria considered to determine the optimal test concentration of IPBC were the reaction index, the positivity ratio, the rate of crescendo reactions, and the relation of IPBC-reactions with MOAHLFA-indices, with irritant reactions to sodium lauryl sulfate, and with positive reactions to the most common standard contact allergens and 4 other preservatives. For statistical evaluations the exact McNemar test was applied and odds ratios were calculated according to the profile likelihood method, as derived from logistic regression analyses. The rate of positive reactions to IPBC increased from 0.5% with IPBC 0.1% to 1.7% with IPBC 0.5%, but there was a problem with sensitivity or specificity with both of these 2 concentrations. Therefore, we focused on IPBC 0.2%(0.8% positive reactions) and IPBC 0.3%(1.3% positive reactions) for further detailed analyses. An evaluation of the related parameters revealed that with IPBC 0.2% as compared to IPBC 0.3% a higher percentage of crescendo reactions, a higher reaction index, a lower number of doubtful reactions, a plausible association of positive reactions with reactions to other preservatives, nd no association with a pronounced skin irritability was found. In conclusion, we recommend to start with IPBC 0.2% for patch testing of all persons with contact dermatitis that may be related to preservatives.

AB  - Objectives:? Contact allergy to grease is a rare cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis and therefore this case is presented. Thin layer chromatograms were used for patch-testing and helped identify the contact sensitizer in the grease. Methods:? Patch-testing, thin layer chromatography and GC-MS. Case report: A previously healthy man working in an industry where brakes for trains were produced presented in the clinic after having developed a rash in the face, on the neck, volar aspects of the arms and dorsum of the hands. The patient's work in part consisted of putting grease on metal parts. The patient was patch-tested with our standard series, a MWF series and materials from work. He tested positively to the grease. A visit to the industry showed a much greater exposure to grease than was suspected. The investigation that followed was performed to identify the sensitizer in the grease. Thin layer chromatography was performed and the patient was tested with chromatograms. Results:? The patient had positive reactions to several allergens in the series including rubber sensitizers of the PPD type and disperse orange 3. A positive reaction was obtained to a spot on the chromatogram of the grease and investigation by GC-MS identified N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine as the sensitizer. Conclusions:? This case underlines the importance of patch testing with work materials and visiting the work environment. A rare case of contact allergy to grease was found and patch-testing with thin layer chromatograms helped identify the allergen, N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine. The identification of the allergen was made by GC-MS.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of the study was to get information on the chemical exposure and the prevalence of skin and respiratory symptoms among Finnish machinists. Methods:? A cross-sectional study was carried out on a population of 961 Finnish machinists. Skin and respiratory symptoms, atopy, exposure at work, etc. were inquired by a telephone interview. Working conditions were assessed and the data were combined with the data from the interview. Technical office personnel in the same companies were used as a control group. Results:? A third of the interviewees reported prolonged rhinitis. A fifth had continuous or relapsing hand or forearm dermatitis, cough, phlegm production or eye symptoms. Wheezing, dyspnea, laryngeal symptoms, or relapsing low fever were reported by 8?2%. 5% reported having asthma. In total, 35% of the machinists considered the skin or respiratory symptoms as work-related. Conclusion:? This study shows that work-related skin and respiratory symptoms are common among machinists in Finland. Those reporting symptoms have been examined in more detail at FIOH. New results of the statistical analysis and medical investigations will be presented.

AB  - Contact dermatitis among hairdressers is common and is one of the most frequent occupational dematoses due to continual exposure to water, detergents, hair dyes, permanent waves and metal equipment. Use of individual protection systems ? as gloves ? is considered a good measure of prevention. Few data exist about the real permeation resistance (PR) of gloves, also in term of time of PR. We tested two types of djsposable latex gloves different by thickness and density of the manufacture material. We used a permeation cell composed of two separated parts: in the upper part we introduced the hair colouring formulation and in the lower one the collection medium (NaHSO3 1% in water); the two parts were separated by a portion of the glove material. A 100 microL volume of the collection medium was collected and injected onto a HPLC apparatus after 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours. A diode array detector was utilised selecting two wavelengths in the UV range (240 and 275?nm) with a linear concentration gradient up to 60% of methanol/acetonitril mixture. We can simultaneously analyse 9 oxidation dyes and the detection limits were sufficient to determine these substances at very low concentrations. We obtained respectively a breakthrough time less than 24 hours for the lower thickness glove and of over 24 hours for the other one; the latex gloves are suitable for prevent the skin contamination during the preparation of the colourings mixture in the hairdresser activity. The obtained data show those latex gloves, of both thickness, have a very high PR. On the other hand, the use of latex gloves has been associated with the more frequent recognition of immediate-type hypersensitivity responses related to latex products. The prosecution of the study will evaluate the PR of latex-free gloves.

AB  - In dentistry there are many potential allergens and irritants. Patients may have an adverse reaction in minutes, hours or days after dental procedures. Dentists use many metals e.g. mercury in amalgam restorations, which may give an oral lichenoid eruption, and gold, and platinum group metals for inlays, crowns or bridges, which may give allergic reactions. Dentists, for dentures, use acrylate resins extensively and traces of which can give rise to allergic symptoms, though most cases are not ?allergic? in origin. Dental personnel have a high frequency of occupational skin problems and may complain of hand dermatitis or itching, facial eruptions or respiratory symptoms. With regard to oral lichenoid lesions, the proportion of patients allergic to mercury on patch testing varies according to series, from 67% down to 8%. In some cases, the mechanism can be irritant as well as allergic. Gold can cause lichenoid eruption or other changes. The role of palladium is still very difficult to judge. Cheilitis is particularly difficult to investigate, as there are many causes. The aetiology is irritant in 33%, allergic contact dermatitis in 25% and atopic eczema in 20%. Benzoates, antioxidants or flavourings in foods sometimes cause lip swelling. Hand dermatitis is common in dental personnel. Common causes are irritancy, latex contact urticaria, and allergic contact dermatitis to acrylates, Myroxolon, fragrance, thiuram and colophonium. In the investigation of reactions in dental patients many things need to be considered and often the cause is not related to the dental materials suspected.

AB  - Germall 115 and Germall II are well known cosmetic preservatives, widely used as such since the early 1970?s and 1980?s, respectively. This investigation reveals that they have mistakenly been regarded as pure chemical entities with specific structures by the majority of the chemical society. In fact Germall 115 and Germall II both consist of complex mixtures of numerous and fast degradable allantoin-formaldehyde condensation products and may not even contain the conventionally assigned chemical structures of imidazolidinyl urea (Germall 115) and diazolidinyl urea (Germall II). Equilibrium between different structures may be formed in different cosmetic formulations/test materials. This may have led to the discrepancies in the literature: Are the Germalls themselves sensitizers or are the allergic reactions caused by formaldehyde release? The identification and structure assignment of (4-hydroxymethyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-4-yl)-urea (HU) will be presented, as it is the major and chemically stable degradation product of both Diazolidinyl urea and Imidazolidinyl urea. A guinea pig maximization test has been performed to determine the potential of HU to induce delayed contact hypersensibility in guinea pigs. Separate chemically stable TRUE Test patches containing the mixtures have shown clinical efficacy.

AB  - Linalool is one of the most frequently used fragrance chemicals in scented products and a large population is exposed to it. It is therefore important to study the allergenic properties of linalool, and the effect of autoxidation. Objectives:? To study the autoxidation of linalool and identify formed oxidation products, to investigate the impact of autoxidation on the sensitizing capacity and to study the frequency of contact allergy to oxidized linalool among consecutive dermatitis patients. Methods:? Linalool was air-exposed and the degradation followed with GC. Oxidation products were identified with GC-MS and NMR. Pure linalool, 2 different states of oxidized linalool and 3 oxidation products were tested for their sensitizing capacity in the local lymph node assay (LLNA). Consecutive dermatitis patients were patch-tested with oxidized linalool and a fraction of oxidized linalool. Results:? Linalool started to decompose immediately when air-exposed. Several oxidation products were identified among which 3 (2 hydroperoxides and an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde) contain structural features that make them potential allergens. LLNA showed that the 3 oxidation products were moderate allergens, and that the sensitizing potential of linalool increased with longer air-exposure times. In the patch-test study positive reactions were observed to oxidized linalool in 1.65% of the patients. Conclusions:? The extensively used fragrance chemical linalool is not allergenic in itself. The autoxidation process that takes place at air-exposure leads to the formation of sensitizing oxidation products. The frequency of consecutive patients reacting to oxidized linalool shows that the experimental findings are clinically important.
