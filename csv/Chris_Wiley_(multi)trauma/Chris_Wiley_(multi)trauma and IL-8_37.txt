AB  - Objective:? To investigate interleukin-8 (IL-8) as a chemokine for T-lymphocytes and as a marker of magnitude of contact allergy. Subjects, Materials and Methods:? Urushiol, the contact allergen of poison ivy, was applied to allergic and anergic volunteers. Suction blisters of urushiol exposed and non-exposed skin were produced 48?h later and the fluids were analyzed for chemotactic activity for T-lymphocytes using modified Boyden chambers. Anti-IL-8-antibodies were added to the fluids to investigate their effect on the chemotactic activity. IL-8 protein concentration of the fluids was determined by ELISA and its correlation with visible test responses was investigated. Results:? Significant chemotactic activity for T-lymphocytes was only present in blister fluid from urushiol exposed skin and only from the allergic subjects. The chemotactic activity could be neutralized with the anti-IL-8 antibodies. There was an excellent correlation between the IL-8 protein concentration in blister fluids and the clinical appearance of the inflammatory reactions at the skin test sites. Conclusions:? The results support the hypothesis that IL-8 in blister fluid is both chemotactic for T-lymphocytes and is a sensitive marker of an inflammatory response. Determination of the concentration of IL-8 proteins in blister fluid of patch tests may be of future use for objective assessment of clinically important contact allergies.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether application of allergic patch tests with transparent semi-occlusive adhesive plastic foils yields higher test sensitivity than when tapes are used. To study whether such foils compared to tapes allow a shorter application time of tests. Methods:? We applied different doses of budesonide printed on polyester squares and vehicle control squares to budesonide allergic subjects for 4 days. Each subject was tested with a set of tests both with a tape and a foil. We assessed all tests when they had been detached and additionally those applied with foils at earlier time points. All assessments were performed both visually and with a laser Doppler perfusion imaging technique. Results:? Test sensitivity is higher with foil applications than when tapes are used and the perfusion is higher with the foils in many cases. The foils allow detachment of visually positive tests before 48 hours in some subjects, regardless of dose. Conclusions:? Test applications with transparent semi-occlusive adhesive plastic foils is sensitive and should be considered for application of patch tests when a short application time is important as when tests are carried out with occupationally hazardous allergens or when test substances containing allergens are expected to be irritating.

AB  - Fragrance substances represent a diverse group of chemicals, some being associated with the ability to cause allergic skin reactions. In recent work, we evaluated two groups of fragrance chemicals, saturated aldehydes (aryl substituted and aliphatic aldehydes) and ?,?-unsaturated aldehydes. QSAR models relating the LLNA EC3 values to a measure of the lipophilicity of a chemical (log P) and s*(a measure of reactivity) were developed for both sets of aldehydes. The outcome was consistent with ?,?-unsaturated aldehydes reacting via Michael addition, whilst saturated aldehydes formed Schiff bases with proteins. In the present study we evaluated further aldehydes to test the robustness and extend the scope of the QSARs. The QSAR models were used to predict EC3 values for 4 new Michael addition aldehydes and 6 new Schiff base formers. LLNA data generated for these compounds demonstrated the original QSARs were fairly accurate but still required improvement. Development of the QSAR models has provided us with a better understanding of the potential mechanisms of action for aldehydes and hence how to avoid or limit allergy. Knowledge generated from this project is being incorporated into new/improved rules for sensitisation in the expert toxicity prediction system Deductive Estimation of Risk from Existing Knowledge (DEREK).

AB  - Objective:? The purpose of this study is to investigate if patients with neomycin sulfate allergy may develop test responses that are unclassifiable by commonly used assessment scales but which should be considered positive. Materials:? 16 patients who tested positive to neomycin sulfate patch tests are retested with different dose levels and application times. Test areas are assessed visually up to 11 days. Results:? Three types of reactions were observed. The first type was characterized by erythema and diffuse infiltrate. Some of these had in addition either discrete papules or both papules and vesicles on their surface. The second type of reaction initially developed large perifollicular papules which later developed into coalescent erythema and diffuse infiltrate. The third type of reaction exhibited perifollicular papules only which declined over time. This type was unclassifiable by commonly used assessment scales. All types of reactions were of clinical significance. Conclusion:? The results support that universal assessment scales for patch-test responses due to different test agents may be inappropriate for assessment of neomycin sulfate patch tests. The clinician should only consider assessment scales as an aid in the assessment of test responses and be aware that morphology of test responses may differ between test agents and test techniques.

AB  - Objective:? In this study the statistical data on occupational dermatoses of Finnish machinists in 1992?2001 were analysed. Methods:? The data were collected from the Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases (FROD) to which physicians are obligated to report all cases of occupational disease. Each case record consists of information on the patient and the employer, date and diagnosis, causative agents, etc. Results:? During the 10-year period, a total of 281 occupational dermatoses of machinists were diagnosed. Dermatoses consisted mostly of irritant contact dermatitis (N?=?144), allergic contact dermatitis (N?=?108) and unspecified contact dermatitis (N?=?21). Only few cases of protein contact dermatitis and contact urticaria as well as occupational acne were reported. The main causes of irritant contact dermatitis were cutting oils and fluids, oils and lubricants, and organic solvents; the commonest inducers of allergic contact dermatitis were formaldehyde, cutting oils and fluids, metals (nickel, chromium and cobalt) and various antimicrobial agents. Conclusion:? Dermatoses were the second commonest occupational diseases of machinists, after hearing loss, and they accounted for 27% of all occupational diseases within the profession. Machinists are a large occupational group (about 19 000 employees; 0.8% of the work force) in Finland, and their dermatoses formed a noteworthy proportion (about 2.6%) of the occupational skin diseases reported during the study period.

AB  - Case report:? A 54-year-old woman, with no family or personal history of atopy, developed skin symptoms and cough after she had been cultivating shiitake mushrooms for 12 months. The patient reported dermatitis on the backs of her hands, fingers and on her wrists, after 1 or 2 days of being in contact with shiitake mushrooms. The skin lesions and cough disappeared entirely during the holidays. Result: Prick tests to common inhalant allergens, molds and flours were negative, with the exception of D. farinae (3?mm). The prick-to-prick test was positive for shiitake gill (3?mm), shiitake stalk (3?mm) and dry shiitake (8?mm?ps). The histamine wheal was 5?7?mm. Control prick tests with shiitake on 5 nonexposed subjects were negative. An open test was performed with shiitake on the flexor side of the upper arm. Within 20 minutes a positive reaction appeared comprising two wheals and flare reactions. Patch test with shiitake gave a strong toxic reaction in 2 days, which continued to diminish on days 3 and 4. Conclusion: Contact urticaria is the clinical skin symptom of immediate allergy, but repeated exposure may lead to protein contact dermatitis. However, our patient has not had urticaria symptoms from shiitake, although the prick-to-prick and open tests were positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report of protein contact dermatitis from shiitake in a patient with a positive immediate skin reaction and negative patch test result.

AB  - Objective:? Study permeability of gloves to plant allergens, therefore evaluating glove efficacy for hand protection. Material and methods:? We studied 20 female patients (aged 21?71; mean 45,1 years) with ACD from plants, 10 allergic to diallyl disulfide (DAD) from Allium sativa, 8 allergic to alpha-methylene-gama-butyrolactone (AMGBL) from Alstroemeria ligtu and 2 allergic to primin from Primula obconica. Patch testing was performed applying the allergens, for 24 or 48?h, directly on the skin and over fragments of different gloves: domestic rubber gloves (RG), nitrile latex gloves (NG), vinyl gloves (VG), surgical latex gloves (LG) and polyethylene gloves (PG). Results:? VG, PG or LG gloves offered no protection for these 3 allergens. With RG and NG gloves, DAD reactivity was abolished or significantly reduced, respectively, in 5 and 7 cases. Reactivity to AMGBL wasn?t abolished by any glove material. NG abolished skin reactivity to primin; RG was efficacious only in 1 patient. Conclusions:? Advising gloves in patients with ACD from plants is difficult, as allergen permeability through gloves associated with occlusion may intensify the dermatitis, as occurred during skin testing. Nitrile latex gloves may protect from primin and garlic dermatitis, whereas they are not helpful for manipulating Alstroemeria. Although exposure time in this study is higher than in real life, results show interesting data on glove permeability to these plant allergens and support our patients? complaints that gloves didn?t protect them.

AB  - There is only very limited data on the prevalence of contact allergy, as judged by a positive diagnostic patch test, in unselected, non-clinical populations. We carried out a 48?h patch test to 7 common allergens and to the petrolatum vehicle in a total of 2545 adult volunteers in Bangkok. The patch tests were read at 48?h approximately 1?h after patch removal. Positive results were as follows Ni 27.8%, fragrance mix 2.9%, Cr 2.6%, PPD 2.3%, colophony 2.1%, MI/MCI 1.2% and formaldehyde 0.7%. No reactions were found to petrolatum. The particularly high frequency of reactions to Ni was surprising. However, the large female bias (approximately 75:1) strongly suggested that, despite the absence of a 96?h score, that irritancy did not play a significant part in these reactions. Reaction rates to the other 6 contact allergens appeared to confirm predictions made from the extrapolation of diagnostic patch testing or from previous published studies on smaller population groups. The rates of reaction to these allergens also are likely to reflect the extent of exposure in the Bangkok region. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that over 2% of this adult population appear to be allergic to the cosmetic related allergens PPD and fragrance.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether interleukins in blisters formed at patch-test sites can be used as markers of the grade of contact allergy. Methods:? Recently patch-tested volunteers with and without allergy to nickel sulfate were retested with 5 nickel sulfate patch tests and 5 control tests. 48 hours later, the test were removed and the perfusion of the test sites was assessed with a laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) technique. Then, suction blisters were made at the test sites. Blister fluids were collected separately from the allergen test sites and the control-test sites. Results:? The patch-test results prior to the study and in current study, and the results with the LDPI helped to distinguish between subjects with and without allergy to nickel sulfate. The concentration of one of the interleukins was high in the blister fluid from the nickel-test sites in all of the allergic subjects while the concentration was not detectable or low in fluid from the control sites and in fluid both from the nickel and the control sites in subjects without nickel allergy. Conclusion:? Immunological factors in fluid from blisters at patch-test sites may be important for the detection of contact allergy. Acknowledgement:? Icelandic Research Council.

AB  - A 37-year-old female cashier working in a drugstore developed a dyshidrotic hand eczema in summer 2001. Positive patch test results were obtained against nickel and cobalt. When the new euro coins were introduced in January 2002, the skin symptoms disappeared. Five months later the work-related hand eczema flared up with massive aggravation. Money-triggered hand eczema has occasionally been reported. Its low incidence is probably due to the absence of wet or irritant work. Coins are not mentioned in the EU nickel directive as ?products intended to come into direct and prolonged contact with the skin?. Nestle et?al. (Nature, Vol 419, p 132, 2002) found that 1- and 2- euro coins released more nickel than pure nickel itself in vitro. A factor contributing to this high release of nickel is corrosion due to the bimetallic structure of these coins, which generates a galvanic potential of 30?40?mV in human sweat. A current can enhance galvanic corrosion and thereby cause more nickel release. In a thin irregular electrolyte layer such as a sweat deposit, galvanic corrosion occur primarily near the bimetallic junction owing to the high resistance to lateral current flow in the thin layer.

AB  - There exists within the population subsets of individuals who display heightened skin reactivity to materials the majority find tolerable. In a series of investigations, we have examined interrelationships between many of the endpoints associated with the term ?sensitive skin?. In the most recent work, 58 volunteers were treated with 10% lactic acid, 50% ethanol, 0.5% menthol and 0.1% capsaicin on the nasolabial fold, unoccluded, for 8 minutes. Sensory reactions were recorded at 2.5, 5 and 8 minutes. Urticant susceptibility was evaluated with 1?M benzoic acid and 125?mM trans-cinnamic acid applied to the volar forearm for 20 minutes. Visual assessments were taken at intervals for up to 4 hours after treatment. A 2???23 hour patch test was also conducted using 0.1% and 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 0.3% and 0.6% Tegobetain F50 and 0.1% and 0.2% benzalkonium chloride to determine irritant susceptibility. As found in previous studies, increased susceptibility to one endpoint was not predictive of sensitivity to another. In our hands, nasolabial stinging is a poor predictor of sensory as well general skin sensitivity. However, it may be possible to identify in the normal population individuals who are more generally sensitive to a range of non-immunologic adverse skin reactions. Whether such individuals are those who experience problems with skin care products is open to question.

AB  - Patch testing with materials brought in by the patient is useful to identify the cause(s) of current allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). However, little is known (i) on the contribution of such tests to diagnostic success and (ii) on the spectrum of contact allergens associated with ACD to certain product categories. Between 1998 and 2002, 5911 out of 48381 patients patch tested in the centres of the IVDK (http://www.ivdk.org) have been tested with own cosmetics and toiletries in addition to commercial allergens. These were manually assigned to 26 categories, based on a EU classification (annex I to 76/768/EEC), which was further refined. As illustrative example, data on ?Bath and shower preparations? are presented: out of 1333 patients tested with a total of 2336 single patches (1102 with 1%, 391 with 10% and 280 with 0.1% in water, remainder with other preparations, depending on the actual kind of product), 71 had positive reactions at the D3 reading. Only in 46 of these, reactions to potential cosmetic ingredients, tested as commercially available allergens, were observed. Among these, fragrance mix (30.0% vs. 12.9% in those not reacting positively to this product category), Myroxylon Pereirae resin (18.6% vs. 8.4%) and some biocides like MCI/MI (11.4% vs. 1.8%) and methyldibromo glutaronitrile?+?phenoxyethanol (12.1% vs. 5.3%) were the most common allergens. In conclusion, patch testing own products ? although not without pitfalls ? may (i) help to correctly diagnose ACD and (ii) give important hints on the occurrence of allergens in a particular type of (cosmetic) product.

AB  - A retrospective study was done of allergic contact dermatits to cosmetics, seen at the department of dermatology of Curry Cabral Hospital, over a six year period (1998 to 2003). Of 2848 patients patch tested during this period, 314 had cosmetic contact allergy and represented about 15.7% of all patients with at least one positive patch test. The patients aged between 13 and 82 years old, and were mostly female (78%). Skin reactions occurred most often on the face, followed by hands, neck and the eyelids. All the patients were tested with the standard series, with supplementary series when appropriate, and whenever possible, with the personal cosmetic products. 92% had positive reactions to standard series allergens; 226 patiens to allergens of the standard series, which may be used in cosmetics. The majority of reactions were due to fragrance mix, followed by balsam of Peru, p-phenylenediamine, kathon CG and colophony. Fragrance series was tested in 118 patients, with the following most frequent positive reactions: oak moss absolute, isoeugenol, hydroxycitronellal. Cosmetic series was tested in 147 patients with the following most frequent positive reactions: toluenesulphonamide-formaldehyde resin and propolis. 30 patients tested with photoallergen series, 4 reacted to oxybenzone. Skin care products and fragrances were the most commonly involved product categories. Twelve patients reacted only with their own products. The fragrances were the most frequent ingredient recorded as the cause of cosmetic contact allergy. Our standard series detected 70% of cases of allergic contact dermatitis to cosmetics.

AB  - Chronic hand dermatitis is a common and distressing condition with a complex, multifactorial aetiology. In order to better understand its pathophysiology and hopefully improve diagnosis, we have begun a systematic histopathological study of various forms of hand dermatitis, with a particular emphasis on those in which exposure to irritants and allergens is strongly implicated. Suitable patients were recruited from amongst those presenting at the contact dermatitis clinic. Detailed past and present medical and personal histories, clinical examination, patch testing and prick testing were conducted in order to classify the eczema into one of several broad entities e.g. chronic irritant contact dermatitis (CICD), with or without atopy. After performing a range of bio-engineering measurements on a pre-selected affected area of the hand, biopsies were removed and processed for high resolution light microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Age/sex matched, healthy, non-atopic individuals provided control skin from similar sites of the hand. Using a range of antibodies and quantification techniques, we examined the status and expression of certain immune-associated cells and receptor/adhesion molecules. Of note amongst these, were the differences in epidermal CD1a+ cell density between groups. Non-atopics with CICD, for example, had significantly fewer CD1a+ cells than both atopics with CICD and those with normal skin. CD54 (ICAM-1) and several cytokine/chemokine receptors were more widely and strongly expressed by keratinocytes in those with an atopic diathesis. Although preliminary in nature at this stage, our results suggest that different forms of hand dermatitis display characteristic immunopathological features which may possibly be of diagnostic value.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the effects of a SLS toothpaste formulation with and without betaine on skin and oral mucosa using electrical bioimpedance (IMP). Two groups, in total 47 participants, were recruited. In the skin group (27 participants) four test sites on the volar forearms were used: SLS paste, SLS?+?betaine paste, betaine paste, and one unoccluded control site. In the oral group (20 participants) the same toothpaste formulations were used. The test substances were applied in 12?mm Finn chambers for 24 hours at randomised test sites on the skin, and in 18?mm Finn chambers for 15 minutes on the oral mucosa. Visual examination and readings with IMP were taken before application and 24 hours after removal of the chambers for the skin, and for the oral mucosa before and 15 minutes after exposure. Information was extracted from the impedance spectra using four indices based on magnitude and phase at 2 frequencies, emphasising different aspects of the impedance properties of the tissues. The SLS-containing pastes showed for both skin and oral mucosa some positive visual grade 1 reactions. Significant changes were found for the impedance indices, and the reaction patterns of the indices differed between the skin and the oral mucosa. We conclude that very slight reactions of skin and oral mucosa are detected by IMP. Furthermore, betaine containing toothpaste does not irritate neither skin nor oral mucosa, but the effect together with SLS is insignificant.

AB  - Repeated tape stripping of the skin associated with e.g. the use of stoma care products can cause irritant dermatitis. This experimental study in 12 healthy volunteers was designed to assess the effects of 3 chemically and physically different adhesives commonly used in stoma care products. Two different frequencies of stripping (daily vs twice weekly) were tested, and the various parameters of inflammation and barrier integrity were studied with established non-invasive methods (Measurement of erythema, conductance, and Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)) on day 0, 4, 6, 10, 16, 22 and 28. All adhesives caused increases in all the studied parameters during the 28 day period compared to the corresponding non-stripped values. Furthermore, daily stripping caused significantly greater inflammation and barrier disruption than stripping twice weekly. In conclusion, it was possible by measuring skin erythema, conductance and TEWL to detect different patterns of inflammatory changes and barrier disruption in areas treated with the 3 adhesives. As expected, more frequent stripping caused greater changes. These differences did however appear at different times during the study period, suggesting that the chemical and mechanical properties of the adhesives may affect the skin differently.

AB  - The objective of the study was to establish eliciting threshold concentrations of diazolidinyl urea (Germall II)? derived formaldehyde in formaldehyde and/or in diazolidinyl urea ? sensitive patients, using a leave-on face cream formulation in a repeated open application test (ROAT) applied to different anatomical regions. 150 patients with known formaldehyde allergy were reviewed for inclusion in the study. 108 patients were contacted and in 65 patients the formaldehyde sensitisation was reconfirmed by a patch test. Four groups of 10 formaldehyde allergic subjects were exposed to 0.05%, 0.15%, 0.3% and 0.6% diazolidinyl urea, corresponding to approximately 50, 100, 200 and 400?ppm free formaldehyde, respectively. Additional 10 individuals allergic to the formaldehyde donor ? diazolidinyl urea itself ? were exposed to 0.15% diazolidinylurea, corresponding to approximately 100?ppm free formaldehyde and 10 healthy non-allergic individuals were exposed to 0.6% of diazolidinylurea (approximately 400?ppm free formaldehyde). A ROAT was performed in a scheduled sequence: upper arm, neck and face. Contact allergy reactions were elicited in 39 out of 58 formaldehyde-sensitive and in 5 out of 7 diazolidinyl urea-sensitive individuals. Elicitation responses were dose- and anatomical region ? dependent. No reactions were observed at the lowest dose, suggesting that an elicitation threshold was attained in the study.

AB  - The objective of the study was to investigate, using the Repeated Open Application Test (ROAT), two key parameters of exposure ? allergen concentration (dose/unit area) and time in terms of the elicitation capacity of methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) in MCI/MI-sensitised individuals and to explore the inter-relationship between these two key factors. The study was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response ROAT preceded by a Diagnostic Patch Test (DPT). 79 patients with a known MCI/M allergy were contacted, 29 were diagnostically patch tested and 25 had their allergy confirmed. 25 MCI/M-allergic subjects and 10 healthy non-allergic control subjects were challenged with 2?ppm of MCI/MI/unit area of skin for 4 weeks. After a wash out period of at least 4 weeks the subjects were challenged with 7.5?ppm of MCI/MI/unit area of skin for 4 weeks. A ROAT with 2 drops of solution twice a day was conducted on the volar aspect of the left and right forearms on a 3???3?cm area resulting in dose/unit area of MCI/MI of 0.025?mg/cm2 and 0.095?mg/cm2 for 2?ppm and 7,5?ppm MCI/MI respectively. The elicitation capacity of MCI/MI in MCI/MI sensitive patients is dependent on the exposure dose/unit area and time The results of this study will be a useful addition to the risk assessment information available for MCI/MI. The risk assessment for the use of MCI/MI in rinse off consumer products is unaffected by the results of this study.

AB  - The U.S. Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) program has evaluated safety in use data on approximately 1300 ingredient since 1976. The review process, which relies on open public meetings and the active participation of the public, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the cosmetics and chemical industries, has identified many cosmetic ingredients that should only be used under limited conditions. Adhearance to the limitations on use in the conclusions of the CIR reports, in the U.S., appears to have limited exposure and patient population sensitivity to some widely used cosmetic ingredients that have produced high rates of reactions in Europe. The advantages of the CIR process for the public and the medical community; the deliberations leading to the use limitations on two example ingredients, and sources for attendees to locate CIR Reports and conclusions will be presented.

AB  - Background:? The preservative methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) has been used extensively in various products since the 1980s. Recently, a biocide containing only MI and not MCI has been launched on the Swedish market for use in industrial settings, paints and glues. Objectives:? To describe sensitization to the unchlorinated isothiazolinone 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MI) in 2 workers, a technician after a chemical burn and a painter, both exposed to a preservative containing MI. Methods: Patch testing with serial dilutions of MCI/MI, MCI, MI, 2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (OIT) and a commercial preservative containing MI in the 2 workers. Results:? The patients reacted positively to MCI/MI and to the separate active ingredients (MCI, MI). The patch test reactivity to MI was higher than the reactivity to MCI, which is a reversed pattern to what is usually seen in patients sensitized to MCI/MI. Both patients also had positive test reactions to OIT. Conclusion:? MI may sensitize on it?s own, and in patients allergic to MI, cross-reactions are also seen to MCI.
