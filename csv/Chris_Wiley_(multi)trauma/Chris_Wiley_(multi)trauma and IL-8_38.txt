AB  - Background:? Topical corticosteroids are usually banned on test areas prior to patch testing. The previous literature on the effect of topical corticosteroids is conflicting. Methods:? Patients allergic to nickel sulphate were patch tested on 4 sites with nickel on Day 0. Intracutaneous betamethasone was injected to test sites on Day ?1, Day 0 and Day 1. NaCl injection on Day ?1 was control. The patch test reactions were evaluated clinically and with laser doppler. Observations:? There were no differences in patch test reaction intensities on sites treated with intracutaneous betamethasone as compared to control. Conclusions:? A single local dose of potent corticosteroid does not suppress allergic patch reactions to nickel. The current practice of avoiding topical corticosteroid use prior to patch testing should be re-evaluated.

AB  - Coconut oil, a traditional moisturizer used for centuries by people in the tropics, does not have any clinical studies documenting its effectivity and safety. This study aims to determine effectivity and safety of coconut oil compared to mineral oil as moisturizer for mild to moderate xerosis. A review board-approved randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted in 34 patients after negative patch-testing. Patients applied either coconut or mineral oil twice a day for two weeks. Quantitative outcomes for effectivity, measured at baseline and each weekly visit, were skin hydration (Corneometer CM825?) and skin lipids (Sebumeter SM810?); for safety, transepidermal water loss [TEWL](Tewameter TM210?) and skin surface pH (Skin pH meter PH900?). Patients and investigator evaluated symptoms of dryness, scaling, roughness, and pruritus using visual analogue scales (VAS) and grading of xerosis. Both groups showed significant improvement in skin hydration and increased skin surface lipid levels. TEWL and Skin pH were not affected. Objective instrumental determinations showed no significant difference between both groups. Patient and investigator subjective grading of xerosis and VAS showed general trend toward better, though not statistically evident, with coconut over mineral oil. Coconut oil is as effective and safe as mineral oil as a moisturizer.

AB  - In recent years, the local lymph node assay (LLNA) has emerged as a practical option for assessing the skin sensitization potential of chemicals. In addition to accurate identification of skin sensitizers, the LLNA can also provide a reliable measure of relative sensitization potency; information that is pivotal in successful management of human health risks. However, even with the significant animal welfare benefits provided by the LLNA, there is interest still in the development of non-animal test methods for skin sensitization. Here, we have collected a large dataset of chemicals that have been tested in the LLNA, and the activity of which correspond with what is known of their potential to cause skin sensitization in humans. It is anticipated that this will be of value to other investigators in the evaluation and calibration of novel approaches to skin sensitization testing, in particular for the development of in silico methods. Prerequisite for the development of in silico models is always the availability of a large high quality data set, suitable for modeling. This dataset encompasses both the chemical and biological diversity of known chemical allergens, and provides also examples of negative controls. The data are a collection of published and non-proprietary industry data. All materials were tested in standard vehicules following the standard LLNA protocol. It is hoped that this dataset will accelerate the development, evaluation and eventual validation of new approaches to skin sensitization testing.

AB  - Background and Objectives:? Tape stripping is a common method for investigating stratum corneum (SC) physiology as well as bioavailability and bioequivalence of topical drugs. However, little is known concerning the influence of procedures (anatomic site, pressure, pressure duration, tape removal rate) inherent in each stripping protocol. Methods:? Tape stripping was performed using tapes on the forearm, forehead and back. On the forearm different pressures (165 and 330?g?cm?2), durations of pressure (2s and 10s), and removal rate (slow and rapid removal) was performed. Changes in skin physiology were evaluated by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and hydration. Results:? A significant influence of all parameters on the TEWL-increase as a function of tape strip number was observed. The fastest increase was demonstrated on the forehead, followed by the back and, lastly, the forearm. Rapid removal produced a protracted increase in comparison to the slow removal. 10s pressure induced a faster increase of TEWL than 2s pressure. Likewise, the 330?g?cm?2 pressure induced an earlier increase than the 165?g?cm?2. Skin hydration was not influenced by the variables tested. Conclusion:? Tape stripping results are influenced dramatically by all investigated parameters. A standardized procedure is necessary for a comparable study design. A dynamic SC stress test to more closely investigate SC cohesion is proposed based on the present observations.

AB  - Atopy patch tests (ATPs) are believed to be a useful diagnostic procedure for atopic dermatitis (AD), aiming at the detection of delayed reactions to aeroallergens and food allergens. Our aim was to investigate immune responses to gluten and gliadin in children affected by coeliac disease by performing APTs, and to compare these data to the ones observed in AD patients. 31 children, 15 males and 16 females (mean age?±?s.d.?=?5,5?±?3,8 years) affected by coeliac disease underwent APTs with gluten and gliadin. Among these, 15 children were on gluten-free diet at the moment of our examination and 3 patients were affected by AD. 83 AD children not affected by celiac disease, were used as controls. 19,4% and 12,9% of children with coeliac disease proved positive to APTs with gluten and gliadin, respectively. No difference in the frequency and intensity of APT responses were present between the patients on gluten-free diet and the children not on diet. Among AD patients 12% reacted to gluten, whereas no positive reactions to gliadin were observed. Going on these findings, the cellular-mediated reactivity to gliadin in patients with coeliac disease may show a clinical expression by positive APT reactions to gliadin. These represent a specific finding in subjects with coeliac disease when compared to AD children.

AB  - Statistics for occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) in Australia are gathered from workers? compensation (WC) data and research has indicated that occurrence is underestimated by as much as 400%. This study investigated reasons which might influence decisions whether to claim WC or not. A questionnaire was posted to 168 individuals diagnosed with significantly work related OCD at a specialised occupational dermatology clinic, therefore fulfilling valid claim criteria under the WC scheme operating in the state of Victoria. 70 completed responses were analysed. Ages ranged from 18?65 and only 40% had claimed workers? compensation, with those under 45?y less likely to claim. Females were significantly (P?<?0.05) less likely to claim, as were respondents who had dermatitis present for less than 6 months. At the time of diagnosis, 37% of respondents were health care workers, 10% hairdressers, 7% food handlers, and 29% worked in hospitals, 24% manufacturing, 10% hairdressing salons, and 7% each vehicle maintenance, food service and trades. 31% no longer worked for the same employer, however 90% of respondents were still employed. Those who did not claim WC lost less time from work than those who claimed, but more non-claimants still had skin problems quite often or constantly than did claimants. 28.6% of non-claimants had all or some of their medical and/or lost time costs paid by their employer, and only 18% of claimants had all of their costs paid by their employer or WC insurer. Although the sample size was small, interesting data was also obtained from the qualitative responses.

AB  - Background:? Drug eruptions as maculopapular rash, hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis occur in about 2% of patients taking allopurinol. The allopurinol oxidation product ? oxypurinol ? seems to be responsible for these hypersensitivity reactions. Opposing what occurs during the study of drug eruptions induced by other drugs as carbamazepine or amoxiciline, patch testing with allopurinol is usually negative. Objective:? To evaluate skin reactivity to allopurinol and oxypurinol by patch testing in patients with a previous history of drug eruption related with allopurinol. Methods:? 10 patients (6 females and 4 males) with drug eruptions induced by allopurinol with a high imputability index (6 hypersensitivity syndromes, 2 Stevens-Johnson syndromes, 1 erythroderma and 1 toxic epidermal necrolysis) were patch tested with allopurinol in vaseline (10 and 20%) and with oxypurinol in vaseline (10 and 20%), acetone (10 and 20%) and alcohol (10 and 20%). Results:? Patch tests with allopurinol and oxypurinol were invariably negative after 48 and 96 hours in all patients tested. Conclusion:? Patch testing with oxypurinol as well as with allopurinol is usually negative and therefore is not helpful in the confirmation of these hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol.

AB  - The Allergen Bank supplies dermatologists on request with special contact allergens for aimed patch testing of suspected contact dermatitis patients. Easy access to patch test materials beyond the standard patch test series makes it possible for the dermatologists to make an early diagnosis of special cases of allergic contact dermatitis. The Allergen Bank was established in 1992, and the concept described in Acta Derm Venereol 1996; 76: 136?140. The Allergen Bank service is financed through an annual subscription fee, and about 60 Danish dermatologists are currently subscribers.The use of the service has increased steadily over the years. In average, the dermatologists order 6?7 allergens for each patient. The dermatologists use pattern of the bank service varies considerably, probably reflecting what they have available in their clinic of extra allergens beyond the standard series, as well as their patient selection and interest in contact dermatitis. Based on the test results reported back from the dermatologists to the Allergen Bank a total of 197 positive reactions from 107 different contact allergens were found in 2002. This is a yield of approximately 7% positive patch tests related to the number of allergens ordered. The pro's and con's of the Allergen Bank function will be reviewed.

AB  - We describe two cases of Toxicodendron dermatitis, one acquired in the United States but presenting in the United Kingdom, the other a recurrent dermatitis following importation to the UK. Poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac are native to North America and belong to the genus Toxicodendron. This group of plants is of interest to the dermatologist because they contain a mixture of potent sensitisers which cause a severe allergic contact dermatitis. The dermatitis can present to the dermatologist in Europe after an individual has been in contact with the plant whilst visiting an endemic area. The plants have the potential to grow in the UK and it is therefore possible for an individual to be sensitised and subsequently to develop the rash without leaving the UK. A 35-year-old American man who lived in the UK visited his family in Marietta, Georgia USA. Shortly before his return to the UK he cut some plants back in his mother?s garden. Two days following his arrival back in the UK he developed a widespread pruritic and painful vesicobullous eruption. He required admission for intensive potent topical corticosteroid therapy and the eruption settled over the next two weeks. The plant he had been pruning was subsequently identified as poison sumac (Toxicodendron vernix). A 54-year-old woman living in Wales was referred to the Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit because during the summer months for the previous four years she had experienced an intermittent, intensely pruritic, vesicular and in parts linear eruption affecting her face, arms and legs. This responded slowly to potent topical corticosteroids. She is a keen gardener and suspected that it was related to a plant in her garden. She was patch tested to our Standard Series, Plant Series and all the plants in her garden. She showed ++ allergic reactions to sodium metabisulphite, propolis and a strong vesicular reaction to the leaf of one of the plants from her garden Inspection of the plant revealed that it had three leaflets per stem. She had taken a cutting whilst visiting friends in Pennsylvania in 1996 and on returning to the UK had planted it in her garden. It grew but had never flowered or produced seeds. Once the cause of her dermatitis had been confirmed our patient took the necessary protective measures and removed the plant including its roots from her garden. She has not experienced any further problems with her skin. She contacted her friends in the USA who knew precisely where she had picked the plant. A further specimen was taken to the local Conservation Office where it was confirmed to be poisonivy. Poison ivy and poison sumac belong to the genus Toxicodendron which is native to North America and Mexico. They cause an allergic contact dermatitis when there is exposure to a bruised portion of the plant. This leads to the oleoresin, urushiol coming into contact with the skin. 25?60% of North Americans are reported be allergic to poison ivy and its relatives. The importation of plants into the UK is restricted by law. It is clear that this plant grew in its new habitat but did not extend beyond the confines of the garden. With frequent and more extensive air travel it seems reasonable to speculate that similar occurrences have taken place and that plants not endemic to Europe should be considered in those with suspected plant dermatitis.

AB  - Objective:? To detect a possible allergen in a florist with occupational dermatitis. Patient and methods: a 27-year-old atopic female working in a greenhouse since 10 years presented with a 3 months history of severe eczema involving hands, face, eyelids and neck requiring a stop of the work. Tests were performed with European standard series (Trolab?), additional series, plant series, (Chemotechnique Diagnostics?) and flowers. Readings were performed at D2 and D3 according ICDRG criteria. Results: positive patch tests were parabens +/+ nickel sulphate ++/++ cobalt chloride ?/++ palladium chloride ++/++ thiomersal ++/++, Iris petal ++/+. Then various colours of Iris were tested and pale blue, yellow and white petals were positive ++/++ but purple blue petal was negative. The proximal yellow part of purple blue petal and orange part of yellow petal were also positive ++/++. The leaf and pistil of Iris were negative. One control with a white Iris petal was negative. Then the patient presented flare up of her dermatitis in the presence of Iris, at home, without handling them, that could make suspect an airborne contact dermatitis. Even after examination by a botanist, the precise identificaton of these Iris was not possible. Positive patch tests to unspecified Iris (petal and leaf) have already been reported in a florist who was allergic to safflower (Van der Willigen A.H. and al, Contact Dermatitis, 1987, 17,184). Conclusion: this case could evoke the responsibility of anthocyans, which play a role in the colours, but essential oils or other components are also possible responsibles.

AB  - Phenol formaldehyde resins were the first synthetic plastics to be used commercially, being patented as Bakelite in 1907.There are two main types of phenol formaldehyde resin [PFR], resols [phenol reacted with excess formaldehyde in alkaline conditions] and novolacs [formaldehyde reacting with excess phenol in acid conditions]. Novolac resins may require cross-linking agents to cure them but resol can be hardened by heat alone. Usually sensitisation occurs when the resins are handled in partially condensed form. Modifications and additives to these resin systems increase the range of potential allergens. PFRs have electrical resistance and binding properties resulting in their widespread use in electrical appliances, glues, laminated floorboards, plywood, fibreglass including insulation, brake linings, clutch facings, grinding wheels, foundry sand moulds, abrasive cloths and papers, plastic moulds, telephones and steering wheels. Study aim:? To analyse retrospectively the causes, occupations and investigations of patients demonstrated to have dermatitis from occupational contact with PFRs. Summary of Results:? 27 dermatitis cases were identified (4 irritant and 23 allergic). The commonest causes were from contact with PFR used in fibreglass materials, in binders e.g. brakes, foundry sand, and from adhesives. Conclusions:? Patients should be investigated for contact allergy by patch testing them with their own resins. PFR-2 identified by M. Bruze was the best commercially available allergen to screen for contact allergy. Concomitant allergy to formaldehyde and PTBP formaldehyde resin is rare. The possibility of allergy to reactive diluents should be considered in those exposed to epoxy novolac systems.

AB  - p-tert-Butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBP-F-R) is frequently reported to give positive patch test reactions with uncertain clinical relevance. A possible explanation is deficient knowledge of the sources of exposure. An analytical method for PTBP-F-R could be used to investigate products in the patient?s environment. Most individual PTBP-F-R substance constitute less than 1% w/w of the resin contributing to analytical difficulties. Objective:? To develop an analytical method for PTBP-F-R and to use it to investigate some patients? products. Methods:? 10 identified PTBP-F-R substances in silylated form were used as reference substances in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results:? The recording of ion chromatograms for the 3 largest mass peaks in the MS for each reference substance was used to avoid interference of disturbing substances. Demonstration of a PTBP-F-R substance was defined as the simultaneous detection the 3 defined mass peaks at the expected retention time and with the same relative intensities as found with the corresponding reference substance. A minimum criterion for the demonstration of PTBP-F-R was the demonstration of 3 PTBP-F-R substances. PRBP-F-R was demonstrated in watchstraps, shoes, glues and ECG-electrodes. p-tert-Butylcatechol, a PTBP-F-R substance but also an antioxidant, was demonstrated in: an ECG-electrode, watchstraps, a prosthesis, a protective mask, a glue, an oil for bikes and in a nail polish. Conclusion:? An analytical method for PTBP-F-R was developed, which when applied to products could show the presence of PTBP-F-R substances and PTBP-F-R in products and indicate contact of clinical relevance.

AB  - Phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) is an aromatic reactive diluent used in epoxy resin systems. The sensitizing capacity of PGE, as well as the cross-reactivity between PGE and the most important contact allergens in epoxy resins based on bisphenol A and bisphenol F, i.e. diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and the 3 isomers of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F (p,p?-DGEBF, o,p?-DGEBF, and o,o?-DGEBF), were investigated in a guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Statistical significance was calculated with one-sided Fisher?s exact test. PGE was found to be a strong sensitizer (24/24 sensitized animals, p?<?0.001). Induction with DGEBA resulted in a statistically significant number of animals reacting to PGE (p?=?0.006), but when induced with PGE, the animals did not react significantly to DGEBA. When induced with PGE, significant numbers of animals reacted to p,p?-DGEBF (13/24 animals, p?=?0.0011) and o,p?-DGEBF (11/24 animals, p?=?0.004). Induction with p,p?-DGEBF and o,p?-DGEBF resulted in a high number of reacting animals when tested with PGE (23/24 animals, p?<?0.001 for both isomers). No statistically significant cross-reactivity between PGE and o,o?-DGEBF was found. Conclusion: According to our results in the GPMT, sensitization to DGEBA, which is the main constituent in the most common epoxy resin, may result in contact allergy to PGE, whereas sensitization to PGE seldom causes contact allergy to DGEBA. Sensitization to PGE may cause contact allergy to epoxy resins based on bisphenol F.

AB  - Background/objectives:? The health care sector is known for its high prevalence of hand dermatitis, mainly because of the high exposure to wet work in nursing activities. Wet work can be activities with wet skin and activities with glove use (skin occlusion). A prevention program to reduce wet work exposure should be based on knowledge about activities that are components of wet work. We observed the frequency and duration of skin exposures to irritants with nursing activities. Method:? Duration and frequency wet work activities were assessed in parts of the health care sector: 53 randomly chosen nurses were observed during their morning shift. Hand skin exposure to water, soap/detergents and occlusion by using gloves were recorded during 112 different 8-hour morning shifts. Results:? In nursing wet work activities make up 9%(dialysis ward), 16%(regular ward) and 24%(I.C.-unit) of the duration of one shift. On a regular ward duration of wet work is mainly divided into 34% patient washing, 31% glove use and 26% hand washing. These main wet work activities have a short exposure cycle of 1.4?3.6 minutes. Hand washing, excluding the use of hand alcohol, and patient washing (without gloves) form both one third of the frequency of wet work activities. Conclusions:? Wet work activities take up a substantial portion of nursing activities and are characterised by frequent short-term exposures. Effective prevention programs on reducing the risk of hand dermatitis in nursing should primarily focus on the high frequencies of hand washing and patient washing. Using gloves in the procedure of patient washing will reduce the frequency of exposure to water and soap with 24%, at the expense of increasing exposure to occlusion by these gloves.

AB  - Labels on cosmetics with statements such as ?recommended by dermatologists?, ?allergy-tested?, ?hypo-allergenic?, and more recently ?for use on intolerant? or for ?sensitive skin? have become very popular. Indeed, many ingredients are used precisely because of their low irritancy potential. However, this does not preclude the occurrence of contact allergic reactions from such cosmetic products. During the last few months several of these substances have been identified as allergens. Examples are: ? Alkylglucosides, e.g. coco-, decyl-, and laurylglucosides, which are condensation products of the corresponding fatty alcohols with glucose, are widely used as emulsifiers in skin-care products, mild surfactants and cleansing agents, as well as in fragrance products, hair dyes, sunscreens and tanning products. ? Ethylhexylglycerin (syn.: octoxyglycerin) is used as a skin conditioning agent (and for miscellaneous purposes). ? Methoxy PEG-17 and PEG-22/dodecyl glycol copolymers, which are alkoxylated alcohols and synthetic polymers, are used as emulsion stabilizers and suspending and viscosity-increasing agents, and also as skin-conditioning agents. ? Butylene glycol and pentylene glycol are aliphatic alcohols with applications similar to those of propylene glycol, which is considered to be more irritant and allergenic. These agents are widely used in a wide variety of cosmetic products because of their solvent, humectant and antibacterial effects. Butylene glycol is also usd as a fragrance ingredient and as a skin conditioner.

AB  - Background:? PTD, a component of oxidative hair dyes, is a frequent sensitizer in hairdressers. Investigations on the stability of the patch test preparation PTD 1% pet. revealed a decline of the PTD concentration to 0.1% within 6 months, possibly due to a reaction of PTD molecules to dye complexes. This raises the question if the long-term diagnostic quality of the PTD preparation is hampered by chemical changes. Objective:? To systematically compare intra-individually patch test results obtained with three PTD patch test preparations of different age, tested synchronously in a multicenter study of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG). Methods:? 3 PTD preparations, produced in January 2002 (batch A), August 2001 (batch B), and April 2001 (batch C), were patch tested in 177 patients from March to December 2002. Patch testing was performed blinded, with respect to the production date. Results:? There were 150 concordant reactions to batch A, B, and C, i.e. 133 negative, 1 doubtful (?), 11 weak positive (+), 3 strong positive (++ and +++), and 2 irritant reactions. In 27 patients, discordant reactions to batch A, B, and C had been observed. Altogether, 22 positive reactions were noted to batch A, and 19 to batch B and C, respectively (difference not significant). There was no clear cut time trend concerning the occurrence of positive or discordant reactions. Conclusions:? Reproducibility of patch test reactions was within a normal range. The chemical changes mentioned above apparently do not affect the diagnostic quality of the PTD patch test preparation.

AB  - Objective:? The first Spanish patch-test study of patients with contact dermatitis was performed in 1977. We aimed to determine the prevalence of hypersensitivity for Spanish standard allergens in patients suspected of contact dermatitis in 2001. Methods:? A total of 3832 patients of 13 dermatological centers were patch-tested with Spanish standard series. Age, gender, occupation, dermatitis site and type, and positive patch test were tabulated. Results:? 2300 female and 1532 male patients, aged 0 to 70 years were observed with contact dermatitis. Origin of eczema was occupational in 16.66% of patients. Eczema was located on hands in 54.34% of cases. Allergic contact dermatitis in 31.02% and irritative contact dermatitis in 15.88% were the most frequent diagnosis. Positive patch tests was observed in 55.11% of patients. Prevalence of positives reaction was obtained with nickel (26.64%), cobalt (9.89%), chrome (8.66%), PPDA (5.27%), thimerosal (5.21%), fragance mix (5.03%), Kathon CG (4.04%) and thiuram mix (2.87%). Conclusions:? The results emphasize that nickel, cobalt, chrome are by far the most common allergens. A increase in the frequency of allergic patch test reactions to nickel has been noted (18,78 in 1977; 26,64 in 2001). However the contact sensitivity to cobalt, chrome and thiuram mix has decreased. Currently, allergy to cosmetics constitutes a significant portion of the cases of contact dermatitis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of contact sensitization to preservatives in a pediatric population and to compare the data to our previous findings referring to the period 1988?1994. From January 1995 to December 2002, 1255 patients aged 7 months-12 years, 583 boys and 672 girls, with suspected allergic contact dermatitis underwent patch testing with our pediatric series of 30 allergens including 5 different preservatives: methyldibromoglutaronitrile, methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone, imidazolidinyl urea, paraben mix, and formaldehyde. Of the 1255 children tested, 108 (8.6%), 52 boys and 56 girls, showed positive reactions to 1 or more of the preservatives listed above. In particular, 55 subjects reacted to methyl(chloro)isothiazolinone, 22 to methyldibromoglutaronitrile, 20 to paraben mix, 17 to formaldehyde, and 13 to imidazolidinyl urea. Among our preservative-positive children, 77% of patients reacted to other haptens of the series, and 44% were affected by atopic dermatitis. In comparison with our previous data referring to the period 1988?1994, a significant increase has been observed in the frequency of positive reactions to methyldibromoglutaronitrile, paraben mix, and formaldehyde. Our findings confirm the importance of patch testing children with preservatives since the wider and wider use of cosmetics in the pediatric age.

AB  - Objectives:? To show cases of contact dermatitis (CD) provoked by different factors and possibility of their treatment with ozone application. Methods:? Description of clinical cases: Patient S., female, 17 years old, came to dermatologist with complaints on erythema and vesicles, sense of burning on the face during two weeks. The patient works on the market, exposures by sun. As a result of a talk with the patient, new perfume as a possible reason of photoallergic reaction was suspected. The patient was successfully treated by use of ozone therapy: 6 autochemotherapy minor (AHTmin) treatments were applied. By the end of the course crusts and hyperpigmentation only were observed. Patient T., male, 36 years old, suffered from erythema and vesicles, itching and sense of burning on both hands and arms for 3 days. During weekend he had contact with cow-parsnip plant. The patient got 5 AHT minor treatments: clinical recovery was registered. Patient S., 36 years old, frosted his hands two weeks ago. When he came to dermatologist, erythema, vesicles, erosions and crusts on the backs of the hands were observed. Ozone therapy (AHTmin ? 5 treatments plus ozonized water externally) was successfully applied: full recovery was registered. Summary of results:? Different cases of CD were successfully treated by ozone therapy use. Conclusions:? CD provoked by different factors can be cured with ozone.

AB  - A 58-year-old female presented with a rash around an ulcer of livedo vasculitis. She had applied ActosinTM ointment (Bucaladesine Sodium) on the ulcer 1 month before. A patch test with ActocinTM ointment (as is) resulted in a ?+ reaction on D2 and?+?on D3. Polyethyleneglycol (10%pet.) gave a?+?reaction on D2 and?+?on D3. A skin biopsy of the positive reaction showed contact dermatitis. Patch tests to Bucaladesine Sodium and other components of ActosinTM ointment were negative. The eruption disappeared after 2 weeks of treatment with a topical corticosteroid.
