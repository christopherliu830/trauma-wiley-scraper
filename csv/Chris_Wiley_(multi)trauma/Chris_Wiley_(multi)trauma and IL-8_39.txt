AB  - Para-phenylenediamine (PPD), an arylamine dye, is a strong allergen causing allergic contact dermatitis. Cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1beta are key mediators in the initiation of this reaction. Both cytokines are predominantly produced by stimulated monocytes and macroghages. We investigated the responses of PPD and Bandrowski's base (BB), an autoxidation product of PPD in human monocytes. We isolated monocytes from healthy volunteers and incubated them with the allergens. TNF-α and IL-1beta mRNA expression and protein levels were estimated after 45?min, 2?h, 4?h and 24?h after allergen contact. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were measured in cell culture supernatants by ELISA (n?=?7) and mRNA expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. We found that PPD reduced TNF-α protein secretion by 20?69.9%(n?=?6). Further, IL-1beta levels were decreased by 44?98%. The same tendency was found studying IL-1beta and TNF-α mRNA steady state levels (n?=?3; 1?h incubation). These effects were substance-specific and not found for PPD derivatives nor for the autoxidation product BB. These findings suggest that PPD may specifically modify immune responses by directly infering with the cellular proinflammatory cytokine network. This study was supported by the EU.

AB  - The critical factor in determining if an alloy may induce metal sensitisation or elicit allergic contact dermatitis is the release rate of soluble metal ions of allergenic metals at the skin surface. Metals or alloys in direct and prolonged contact with body fluids may result in electrochemical reactions (commonly called corrosion) that release metal ions. Induction or elicitation of metal allergy results if a sufficient amount of metal ions are released and absorbed through the skin where they react with the human immune system. The virtual insolubility of most metals and alloys in aqueous media (including body fluids) limits the bioavailability of metal ions. Several factors influence the rate of corrosion: metal or alloy metallurgical structure, surface films, surface finish, geometry, process history, and composition; body fluid composition, amount, pH, electrolytic properties, dissolved oxygen and other gas content; and the service environment (e.g. temperature, flow rate, etc). A review of recently published studies on metal allergy from a metallurgical perspective provides information that helps explain why certain metals and alloys cause allergic reactions and others (e.g. most stainless steels) do not. This information is useful in predicting what alloys will cause allergic reactions under varying conditions. In order to predict allergic reactions and responses to metals and alloys, metallurgical aspects of ion release should be taken into account. This presentation will increase understanding and interpretation of results of clinical or other scientific studies (e.g. studies in vitro) of reactions and responses to metals and alloys by providing a metallurgical perspective.

AB  - A history of reacting to jewellery contact on the skin is a common symptom of nickel allergy; wearing cheap jewellery is a common cause of nickel sensitization. We analyzed nickel release from 770 white gold jewels with different shape and karatage from the Italian market. Jewels were stored in artificial sweat for 1 week at 30?C and nickel in sweat after the release procedure was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma detection (ICP), according to the European Standard EN1811 ?Reference test method for release of nickel?. Nickel release was above 0,5??g/cm/week in 157 jewels (20,4%), between 0,5??g/cm/week and 0,1??g/cm/week in 163 (21,2%) and below 0,1??g/cm/week in 450 (58,4%). Nickel release was above 0,5??g/cm/week in 132 out of 432 (30,6%) 14 (or lower) karat gold jewels and in 25 out of 338 (7,4%) 18 karat gold jewels suggesting an inverse relationship between nickel release and karatage. However, when comparing jewels with the same karatage, we found no clear relationship between nickel content and nickel release in the 256 items of which the exact alloy composition was known. Data seem to indicate that other factors, besides nickel content, such as ratio between nickel and other elements, presence of grain refiners and homogenization state of the alloy play a crucial role in nickel release.

AB  - Background:? Studies in Gothenburg, Sweden, reported unexpectedly high rates, 0.35?1.66%, of late occurring itching nodules at the site of injection of aluminium containing vaccines. Among 455 children with itching nodules after vaccination, 352 had a positive epicutaneous test to aluminium. When switching to a new booster diphtheria-tetanus vaccine in Sweden these findings warranted a comparative study of local itching nodules that had remained at least 2 months after injection, and of aluminium contact allergy. Methods:? A prospective cluster randomised study was done in 25,232 10-year-olds. Participating schools in each municipality were randomised in a 1/1 ratio to use the old diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (DT) vaccines, Duplex? or the new vaccine, diTeBooster?. Parental reports 6 months after vaccination were obtained for 22,365 (88%) pupils in 851 schools. Patch testing with aluminium chloride-hexahydrate was performed in 9 children with an itching nodule, 6 children only pruritus and 17 children without any itching nodule after the fourth dose of DT vaccine. Results:? We identified 3?6 children per 10000 with a local itching nodule persisting for at least 2 months. There were no significant differences between the vaccine groups. Contact allergy to aluminium was not detected. Conclusion:? Our findings support the use of the vaccine presently available in the Swedish vaccination program. Continued surveillance of persistent itching nodules after vaccination with different aluminium containing DT and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis toxoid (DTP) vaccines is however warranted.

AB  - Background:? Hydrochloric acid is formed in water solutions of gold trichloride. Hydrochloric acid in contact with aluminium generates hydrogen gas which can reduce and transform trivalent gold to elemental gold. Objective:? To investigate whether patch testing with aqueous gold trichloride can cause false positive (irritant) reactions in patients without contact allergy to gold and false negative reactions in patients with gold allergy. Methods:? 13 patients with and 13 patients without positive patch test reactions to gold sodium thiosulfate were tested with gold trichloride in 2 different vehicles, water and alkaline buffer, using 2 different test techniques, the Finn Chamber technique with aluminium chambers and van der Bend technique with polypropene chambers. Results:? Irritant patch test reactions were obtained with aqueous gold trichloride tested in van der Bend chambers in 10 patients without gold allergy. In gold-allergic patients no positive test reactions were obtained from aqueous gold trichloride in Finn chambers while 2 positive test reactions were obtained from gold trichloride in alkaline buffer tested in van der Bend chambers. Conclusion:? If gold trichloride is patch tested in wrong vehicle and with wrong test technique irritant test reactions may occur which can be misinterpreted as positive allergic reactions in patients without gold allergy as well as negative reactions in patients with gold allergy.

AB  - Summary Although substance P (SP), a potent proinflammatory peptide, is involved in inflammation and immune responses, the effect of SP on the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 3α[MIP-3α, chemokine C-C ligand 20 (CCL20)] in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells is unknown. Equally enigmatic is the link between SP, the stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and CCL20 production. We investigated whether SP induces the release of chemokine CCL20 from immortalized PDL (IPDL) cells, and further clarify SP-mediated pathways. We also examined the relationship between HO-1 and CCL20 by treating PDL cells with SP. Incubating IPDL cells with SP increased expression of CCL20 mRNA and CCL20 protein in a dose?time-dependent manner. Highly selective p38 and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitors abrogated SP-induced expression of CCL20 in IPDL cells. SP is also responsible for initiating phosphorylation of I?B, degradation of I?B and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-?B. SP induced expression of HO-1 in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and CCL20 reflected similar patterns. The inductive effects of SP on HO-1 and CCL20 were enhanced by HO-1 inducer hemin and the membrane-permeable guanosine 3?,5?-monophosphate (cGMP) analogue 8-bromo-cGMP. Conversely, this pathway was inhibited by the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX) and the selective inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazole(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). We report herein the pathway that connects SP along with other modulators of neuroimmunoregulation to the induction of HO-1 and the inflammatory mediator macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3α/CCL20 in IPDL cells, which play an important role in the development of periodontitis or inflammation during orthodontic tooth movement.

AB  - Summary.? Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection may exhibit neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive impairment. Post-mortem studies of hepatitis C virus HCV quasispecies and replicative intermediates indicate that the brain might act as a separate compartment for viral replication and microglia may be the locus for infection and subsequent neuroinflammatory activity. We sought to use two independent in vivo imaging techniques to determine evidence of neuroinflammation in patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C. Using positron emission tomography (PET) with a ligand for microglial/brain macrophage activation, 11C-(R)-PK11195 (PK11195) and cerebral proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined whether there was evidence of neuroinflammation in a pilot study of 11 patients with biopsy-proven mild chronic hepatitis C, compared to healthy volunteers. Patients were characterized by cognitive testing and the fatigue impact scale to assess for CNS impairment. PK11195 binding potential was significantly increased in the caudate nucleus of patients, compared to normal controls (P?=?0.03). The caudate and thalamic binding potential were more significantly increased in six patients with genotype 1 infection (P?=?0.007) and positively correlated with viraemia (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.005). Basal ganglia myo-inositol/creatine and choline/creatine ratios were also significantly elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis C compared to normal controls (P?=?0.0004 and P?=?0.01, respectively). Using PET, we demonstrated evidence of microglial activation, which positively correlated with HCV viraemia and altered cerebral metabolism in the brains of patients with mild hepatitis C. This provides further in vivo evidence for a neurotropic role for HCV.

AB  - Abstract Bone fragility and loss are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the lack of effective therapeutic options means that treatment is more often palliative rather than curative. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CF-related bone disease (CFBD) is necessary to develop new therapies. Defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and chronic inflammation in bone are important components of the CFBD development. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) drive the regulation of bone turnover. To investigate their roles in CFBD, we evaluated the involvement of defective CFTR in their production level in CF primary human osteoblasts with and without inflammatory stimulation, in the presence or not of pharmacological correctors of the CFTR. No major difference in cell ultrastructure was noted between cultured CF and non-CF osteoblasts, but a delayed bone matrix mineralization was observed in CF osteoblasts. Strikingly, resting CF osteoblasts exhibited strong production of RANKL protein, which was highly localized at the cell membrane and was enhanced in TNF (TNF-α) or IL-17-stimulated conditions. Under TNF stimulation, a defective response in OPG production was observed in CF osteoblasts in contrast to the elevated OPG production of non-CF osteoblasts, leading to an elevated RANKL-to-OPG protein ratio in CF osteoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of CFTR chloride channel conductance in non-CF osteoblasts replicated both the decreased OPG production and the enhanced RANKL-to-OPG ratio. Interestingly, using CFTR correctors such as C18, we significantly reduced the production of RANKL by CF osteoblasts, in both resting and TNF-stimulated conditions. In conclusion, the overexpression of RANKL and high membranous RANKL localization in osteoblasts are related to defective CFTR, and may worsen bone resorption, leading to bone loss in patients with CF. Targeting osteoblasts with CFTR correctors may represent an effective strategy to treat CFBD. Copyright ? 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

What are the expectations? Inflammation is a central element of atherogenesis. Innate pathways contribute to vascular inflammation. However, the initial molecular process(es) starting atherogenesis remain elusive. The various risk factors, represented by particular compounds (activators), may cause altered cellular functions in the endothelium (e.g. vascular endothelial cell activation or -dysfunction), in invading cells (e.g. inflammatory mediator production) or in local vessel wall cells (e.g. inflammatory mediators, migration), thereby triggering the innate inflammatory process. The cellular components of innate immunology include granulocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes. Among the molecular innate constituents are innate molecules, such as the toll-like receptors or innate cytokines. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 are among the innate cytokines. Cytokines are potent activators of a great number of cellular functions relevant to maintain or commove homeostasis of the vessel wall. Within the vessel wall, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can significantly contribute to the cytokine-dependent inflammatory network by: (i) production of cytokines, (ii) response to cytokines and (iii) cytokine-mediated interaction with invading leucocytes. The cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are involved in SMC-leucocyte interaction. The IL-6 effects are proposed to be mediated by trans-signalling. Dysregulated cellular functions resulting from dysregulated cytokine production may be the cause of cell accumulation, subsequent low-density lipoprotein accumulation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The deposition of ECM, increased accumulation of leucocytes and altered levels of inflammatory mediators may constitute an ?innate-immunovascular-memory? resulting in an ever-growing response to anew invasion. Thus, SMC-fostered inflammation, promoted by invading innate cells, may be a potent component for development and acceleration of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Abstract Background: High levels of endotoxin in patients with cirrhosis are thought to be responsible for the activation of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF)-α-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways involved in haemodynamic alterations. Bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) is a protein found in neutrophils with endotoxin-binding and neutralization capacity. It is not known whether defective BPI production or release is present in cirrhosis. Aims: We investigated the levels of BPI in cirrhotic patients and its relation to other endotoxin-binding proteins and inflammatory markers. Methods: Plasmatic levels of BPI, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, soluble CD14, TNF-α and BPI mRNA expression in neutrophils were determined in 130 patients and 30 healthy controls. The capacity of patients' plasma to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated TNF-α production by monocytes from healthy donors was assessed in vitro. Results: Patients with cirrhosis exhibited an increase in BPI mRNA and plasma level of BPI when compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). Child C group displayed the highest frequency of patients with a high concentration of BPI. A positive correlation was found between TNF-α and plasma levels of BPI (P<0.01). High levels of BPI in plasma were able to significantly reduce in vitro TNF-α release by monocytes after a challenge with LPS (8.54 ± 1.04 vs. 10.44 ± 0.85?pg/ml, P=0.028). Conclusion: BPI is increased in cirrhotic patients, especially in those with more severe liver disease. The amount of BPI in the plasma correlated with the TNF-α level and was able to reduce LPS-mediated TNF production by monocytes. BPI possibly plays a regulatory role by antagonizing the pro-inflammatory mechanisms mediated by TNF-α.

AB  - Abstract The infrapatellar pad, a fibro-adipose tissue with peculiar microscopic and mechanical features, is gaining wide attention in the field of rheumatological research. The purpose of this descriptive review is to summarize the most recent published evidence on the anatomic, physiologic and biomechanical inter-relationship between the infrapatellar fat pad and the knee synovial membrane. As an extrasynovial tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad does not directly interact with the articular cartilage; based on its location in close contact with the synovial membrane, and due to the metabolic properties of adipose tissue, it may influence the behavior of the synovial membrane. In fact, considering evidence of macroscopic and microscopic anatomy, the infrapatellar fat pad is the site of insertion of the infrapatellar and medial synovial plicae. Also biochemically, there is much evidence highlighting the interaction among these two structures; in the case of inflammation, the mutual interplay is ascribable to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators stimulating the proliferation of inflammatory cells and promoting tissue modifications in both. All these assumptions could support the emerging idea that the infrapatellar fat pad and the synovial membrane may be considered a morpho-functional unit.

AB  - Abstract Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2-CDG) is the most common congenital disorder of N-glycosylation and is caused by a deficient PMM2 activity. The clinical presentation and the onset of PMM2-CDG vary among affected individuals ranging from a severe antenatal presentation with multisystem involvement to mild adulthood presentation limited to minor neurological involvement. Management of affected patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this article, a systematic review of the literature on PMM2-CDG was conducted by a group of international experts in different aspects of CDG. Our managment guidelines were initiated based on the available evidence-based data and experts' opinions. This guideline mainly addresses the clinical evaluation of each system/organ involved in PMM2-CDG, and the recommended management approach. It is the first systematic review of current practices in PMM2-CDG and the first guidelines aiming at establishing a practical approach to the recognition, diagnosis and management of PMM2-CDG patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article reviews a body of work performed by the investigators over 9 years that has addressed the significance of cam morphology in the development of hip osteoarthritis (OA). Early hip joint degeneration is a common clinical presentation and preexisting abnormal joint morphology is a risk factor for its development. Interrogating Hill's criteria, we tested whether cam-type femoroacetabular impingement leads to hip OA. Strength of association was identified between cam morphology, reduced range-of-movement, hip pain, and cartilage degeneration. By studying a pediatric population, we were able to characterize the temporality between cam morphology (occurring 1st) and joint degeneration. Using in silico (finite element) and in vivo (imaging biomarkers) studies, we demonstrated the biological plausibility of how a cam deformity can lead to joint degeneration. Furthermore, we were able to show a biological gradient between degree of cam deformity and extent of articular damage. However, not all patients develop joint degeneration and we were able to characterize which factors contribute to this (specificity). Lastly, we were able to show that by removing the cam morphology, one could positively influence the degenerative process (experiment). The findings of this body of work show consistency and coherence with the literature. Furthermore, they illustrate how cam morphology can lead to early joint degeneration analogous to SCFE, dysplasia, and joint mal-reduction post-injury. The findings of this study open new avenues on the association between cam morphology and OA including recommendations for the study, screening, follow-up, and assessment (patient-specific) of individuals with cam morphology in order to prevent early joint degeneration. Statement of significance: By satisfying Hill's criteria, one can deduct that in some individuals, cam morphology is a cause of OA. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Limb/digit amputation is a common event in humans caused by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. Although the loss of a digit is not lethal, it affects quality of life and imposes high costs on amputees. In recent years, the increasing interest in limb regeneration has led to enhanced scientific knowledge. However, the limited ability to develop functional limb regeneration in the clinical setting suggests that a challenging issue remains in limb regeneration. Recently, the emergence of regenerative engineering is a promising field to address this challenge and close the gap between science and clinical applications. Cell signalling and molecular mechanisms involved in the limb regeneration process have been extensively studied; however, there is still insufficient data on cell therapy and tissue engineering for limb regeneration. In this review, we intend to focus on therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration that are closely related to gene, immune, and stem cell therapies, as well as tissue engineering approaches that take into consideration the peculiar developmental properties of the limbs. In addition, we attempt to identify the challenges of these strategies for limb regeneration studies in terms of clinical settings and as a road map to accomplish the goal of functional human limb regeneration.

AB  - The mechanisms which lead to secondary brain damage following transient ischaemia are incompletely defined. As discussed in this hypothesis article, the events which lead to such damage could encompass (a) a perturbed membrane handling of calcium, leading to a slow, gradual increase in the free cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i), with subsequent calcium overload of mitochondria, (b) a sustained reduction of protein synthesis which, in the long run, deprives cells of enzymes or trophic factors essential to their survival, or (c) the initiation of an inherent program for cell death. Results obtained in ischaemia of brief to intermediate duration demonstrate that the ultimate cell death is heralded by a reduction in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. However, the results fail to demonstrate whether or not such a reduction precedes deterioration of the bioenergetic state which then precipitates cell death. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has recently been shown to dramatically improve the delayed CA1 damage following transient forebrain ischaemia. Since CsA is known to block a deleterious permeability transition (PT) in mitochondria from several tissues in response to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, the results on CsA effects in forebrain ischaemia support a mitochondrial origin for the delayed cell death. Furthermore, comparisons with the effects of CsA and α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in thymocytes and other cells undergoing programmed cell death suggest that delayed neuronal damage occurs by a sequence of events akin to those leading to apoptotic cell death. However, whether cell death is apoptotic or necrotic may depend on the severity of the insult (and its duration). We speculate that the initial ischaemic transient leads to gradual mitochondrial calcium overload, the latter triggering a PT, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Since similar results have been obtained in normoglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemia of intermediate duration, and in animals with preischaemic hyperglycaemia, it seems likely that both increased ischaemia duration and hyperglycaemia accelerate damage to mitochondria in the reperfusion period. Recent results obtained in transient focal ischaemia of 2 h duration demonstrate that the free radical spin trap PBN reduces infarct size, even when given 1 or 3 h after the start of reperfusion, thus providing a second window of therapeutic possibility. A major effect of the drug is exerted on the recovery of energy metabolism of the tissue since it reduces a secondary deterioration in the bioenergetic state, occurring after 2?4 h of reperfusion. At least in part, the spin trap may exert its effect by reducing microvascular dysfunction caused by oedema and to adhesion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, which give rise to an inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, lipid mediators, or free radicals. This contention is supported by the reduction in focal ischaemic damage by antibodies to adhesion molecules for PMNs. However, it has now been found that the secondary deterioration of the bioenergetic state of core and penumbral tissues are mirrored by corresponding changes in the respiratory functions of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that, also in this type of ischaemia, the mitochondria suffer secondary damage. It is conceivable that a significant fraction of malfunctioning mitochondria emanate from microvascular tissue, explaining why antibodies to adhesion molecules mitigate the ischaemic lesions.
