AB  - Abstract Cytokines are proteins or glycoproteins which are produced by cells and act on other cells that display on their surface specific cytokine receptors. Cytokines are used by cells to communicate. Within a determined sequence, these mediators lead the responding cells to modify their function (e.g., secretion, proliferation, induction, inhibition, enhanced or reduced function, migration, apoptosis). Despite cytokines having mainly been discovered by immunologists as a product of cells of leukocyte lineage, they are now recognized as elements of a universal language used by most cells of any other lineage. Accordingly, they are essential for many events through life, such as reproductive tissue remodeling, embryogenesis, steady-state and adaptive hematopoiesis, surveillance and maintenance of tissue structure, functions of the immune system, inflammation, cell survival, and cell death. Cytokines also allow a dialog with the central nervous system, and some may modify different behaviors (e.g., fever, anorexia, sleep). Cytokines usually act within their vicinity, but they can also act via an endocrine fashion. Their production is tightly controlled within a complex network of positive and negative loops. They are a prerequisite for the control of infection by invasive microorganisms, though their exacerbated production may be deleterious at local or systemic levels. Their ?half-angel/half-devil? aspect has rendered cytokines difficult to use for therapeutic purposes, though some recombinant cytokines or cytokine-neutralizing strategies have been used successfully in different pathological conditions.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines are essential components of our defense and repair systems but also potentially harmful mediators of infectious and immunoinflammatory reactions. Clinically important cytokines function systemically as pleiotropic hormones with overlapping effects on many cell types. All engage in a complex network of agonists and antagonists. Some immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have been found to be potent and specific regulators of cytokines. These antibodies bind interleukin (IL-1)α, IL-6, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interferon (IFN)-α/? with exceptional force. They neutralize their corresponding cytokines ex vivo and perhaps in vivo, although they may also function as cytokine carriers. The biological role of autoantibodies to cytokines is not yet understood, but they may provide a level of regulation not appreciated at present. Inappropriate production/function of such antibodies could be pathogenetically involved in immunoinflammatory and other diseases. Cytokine antibodies may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of human IgG therapy.

Sepsis-induced changes in signalling cascades -? Divergent effects on phagocytic cells during sepsis -? Harmful effects of C5a and C5a receptors in experimental sepsis ?? Future directions Sepsis in human beings is a major problem involving many individuals and with a high death rate. Except for a single drug (recombinant activated protein C) that has been approved for treatment of septic patients, supportive measures represent the main clinical approach. There are many models of experimental sepsis, mostly in rodents. A commonly used model is cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, robust activation of complement occurs together with up-regulation of C5a receptors (C5aR, C5L2) in a variety of different organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart). In septic human beings there is abundant evidence for complement activation. Interception of C5a or its receptors in the CLP model greatly improves survival in septic rodents. There is compelling evidence that CLP causes an intense pro-inflammatory state and that C5a interaction with its receptors can be linked to apoptosis of the lymphoid system and cells of the adrenal medulla, loss of innate immune functions of blood neutrophils, consumptive coagulopathy and cardiac dysfunction. These findings may have implications for therapeutic interventions in human beings with sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Fracture healing is a well-organized process between several molecules and mediators. As known from other diseases, genetic polymorphisms may exhibit different expression patterns in these mediators. Concerning fracture healing, this may lead to an extended healing process or non-union. We investigated the incidence of polymorphisms in patients with aseptic non-unions after femoral and tibial shaft fractures as compared to patients with uneventful healing. Exclusion criteria were smoking, diabetes, bilateral fractures, systemic corticoid therapy, and septic non-unions. Analysis of allele frequencies and genotype distribution of various mediators were carried out following PCR. Clinical parameters such as injury severity and in-hospital were analyzed. Fifty patients following non-union (group NU) were enrolled, the control group consisted of 44 patients (group H). A significant association of a PDGF haplotype and non-unions following fracture could be observed. There was a significantly increased in-hospital time and amount of surgical procedures in group NU. Polymorphisms within the PDGF gene seem to be a genetic risk factor for the development of non-unions of the lower extremity following fracture. The early identification of high risk patients could result in an adapted therapeutical strategy and might contribute to a significant decrease of posttraumatic non-unions. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Adult multipotent stem/progenitor cells, with remarkable regenerative potential, have been isolated from various components of the human periodontium. These multipotent stem/progenitor cells include the periodontal ligament stem/progenitor cells (PDLSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP), the gingival mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (G-MSCs), and the alveolar bone proper stem/progenitor cells (AB-MSCs). Whereas inflammation is regarded as the reason for tissue damage, it also remains a fundamental step of any early healing process. In performing their periodontal tissue regenerative/reparative activity, periodontal stem/progenitor cells interact with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environmental, through their expressed receptors, which could influence their fate and the outcome of any periodontal stem/progenitor cell-mediated reparative/regenerative activity. The present review discusses the current understanding about the interaction of periodontal stem/progenitor cells with their surrounding inflammatory micro-environment, elaborates on the inflammatory factors influencing their stemness, proliferation, migration/homing, differentiation, and immunomodulatory attributes, the possible underlying intracellular mechanisms, as well as their proposed relationship to the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.

AB  - Abstract Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a specific cutaneous toxicity caused by a variety of antitumor drugs. The most common drugs include capecitabine, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and fluorouracil (PLD), tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is a dose-limiting cutaneous toxicity of these drugs. We reported an advanced lung adenocarcinoma female patient, who developed a Grade 3 HFS after a third-line treatment with apatinib of 250?mg for 10?days, the patient developed intolerable pain with pruritus. Large erythema on the skin of the hand, with local ulceratio, exudation, and desquamation of cutaneous lesions. After treatment with 100?mg of thalidomide every night for 1 week, the patient's HFS was significantly relieved, and the duration of the remission was about 2 months, which not only significantly improved the patient's quality of life, but also maintained the antitumor strength.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.

AB  - Summary Systemic inflammation can be investigated by changes in expression profiles of neutrophil receptors. Application of this technology for analysis of neutrophil phenotypes in diseased tissues is hampered by the absence of information regarding the modulation of neutrophil phenotypes after extravasation to tissues under non-inflammatory conditions. To fill this gap we measured the expression of neutrophil receptors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, which included both smokers and non-smokers. Blood and BALF neutrophils were identified by CD16bright/CD45dim cells, and triple-stained with antibodies directed against integrins, chemokine- and Fc?-receptors. BALF neutrophils of healthy volunteers showed an activated phenotype characterized by Mac-1 (CD11b)bright, L-selectin (CD62L)dim, intrecellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) (CD54)bright, Fc?RII (CD32)bright, C5a receptor (CD88)bright and CD66bbright. A similar phenotype was observed for BALF neutrophils of patients affected by sarcoidosis. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a modulated expression of C5a receptor (CD88) and ICAM-1 (CD54) in neutrophils of sarcoidosis patients. In conclusion, our data indicate that neutrophils found in the lung exhibit an activated phenotype under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Background Shock and severe tissue injury lead to an endogenous coagulopathy mediated by activation of Protein C and hyperfibrinolysis known as acute traumatic coagulopathy. Together, hemodilution, acidosis, inflammation, and hypothermia result in a global trauma-induced coagulopathy. Coagulopathy in trauma is associated with mortality. Early and effective hemostatic resuscitation is critical in restoring perfusion, correcting coagulopathy, and saving lives in exsanguinating trauma. Lyophilized plasma (LP) provides a logistically superior alternative to fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Study Design and Methods Plasma was lyophilized following whole blood collection from anesthetized swine. A series of studies were performed using anesthetized swine subjected to a validated model of polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock including a Grade V liver injury. Animals were randomized to resuscitation using reconstituted LP fluids. Physiologic data and blood loss were measured. Coagulation status and inflammatory mediators were evaluated. Results Full volume reconstituted LP (100%LP) retains on average 86% coagulation factor activity compared to fresh plasma and when used in 1:1 ratios with red blood cells demonstrated superior hemostatic efficacy compared to FFP. Hypertonic LP reconstituted using 50% of the original plasma volume (50%LP) had higher coagulation factor concentrations, was well tolerated in swine, and equally effective compared to 100%LP with respect to physiologic and hemostatic properties. Buffering with ascorbic acid resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Conclusion By minimizing the volume of reconstituted LP and optimizing its anti-inflammatory properties, an LP resuscitation fluid may be created to provide effective hemostatic resuscitation with superior logistical properties.

AB  - It has been recognized for some time that cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are, to a major extent, inflammatory disorders associated with an environment characterized by a sedentary lifestyle together with abundant intakes of calories. Systemic low-level inflammation is suggested to be a cause as well as consequence of pathological processes with local tumor necrosis factor α production as an important biological driver. It is hypothesized that physical inactivity contributes to an enhanced proinflammatory burden independently of obesity, as regular muscle contractions mediate signals with myokines/cytokines as important messengers, which suppress proinflammatory activity at distant sites as well as within skeletal muscle. Muscle-derived interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to possess a central role in anti-inflammatory activities and health beneficial effects in relation to physical exercise. It is discussed how this fits the consistent observation that enhanced plasma levels of IL-6 represent a strong risk marker in chronic disorders associated with systemic low-level inflammation and all-cause mortality.

AB  - Abstract? Our bacterial residents are deadly Janus-faced indwellers that can lead to a sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. Over half of ICU patients suffer from infections and sepsis remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Severe ileus frequently accompanies sepsis setting up an insidious cycle of gut-derived microbial translocation and the copious intestinal production of potent systemic inflammatory mediators. Few therapeutic advances have occurred to prevent/treat the sequelae of sepsis. Here, we selectively review studies on cellular membrane-bound Toll-like receptor (TLR) mechanisms of ileus. Virtually, no data exist on Gram-positive/TLR2 signaling mechanisms of ileus; however, TLR2 is highly inducible by numerous inflammatory mediators and studies using clinically relevant scenarios of Gram-positive sepsis are needed. Specific Gram-negative/TLR4 signaling pathways are being elucidated using a ?reverse engineering? approach, which has revealed that endotoxin-induced ileus is dually mediated by classical leukocyte signaling and by a MyD88-dependent non-bone marrow-derived mechanism, but the specific roles of individual cell populations are still unknown. Like TLR2, little is also know of the role of flagellin/TLR5 signaling in ileus. But, much can be learned by understanding TLR signaling in other systems. Clearly, the use of polymicrobial models provides important clinical relevancy, but the simultaneous activation of virtually all pattern recognition receptors makes it impossible to discretely study specific pathways. We believe that the dissection of individual TLR pathways within the gastrointestinal tract, which can then be intelligently reassembled in a meaningful manner, will provide insight into treatments for sepsis.
