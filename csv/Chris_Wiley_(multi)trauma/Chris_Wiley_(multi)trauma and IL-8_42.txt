AB  - Abstract The controversy regarding the role of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) in the treatment of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning has been re-ignited following the publication of a further randomized controlled trial by Weaver et al., the results of which appear to conflict with our findings. Comparative analysis suggests that the apparent outcome differences may be secondary to the design, analysis and interpretation of the results of the two studies. Following careful analysis of these two papers and further results from a study by Raphael et al on 385 CO-poisoned patients, we can still find no convincing evidence favouring HBO therapy. Pending further research to determine optimal oxygen therapy for CO-poisoning, current therapy should involve stratifying patients for risk of a poor outcome. This stratification may be aided by the evolving availability of biochemical markers of brain injury and the finding that patients with transient loss of consciousness and poor performance on neuropsychological tests of the supervisory attention system are at higher risk of neuropsychological sequelae. We propose that those patients most at risk be admitted and receive more prolonged normobaric oxygen therapy whilst those with more minor CO-poisoning should be provided with normobaric oxygen of no less than 6 h duration and certainly until sign and symptom free.

AB  - ABSTRACT There is growing evidence in support of the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Harpagoside, one of the bioactive components of Harpagophytum procumbens (Hp), has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Here we used an in vitro model of inflammation in OA to investigate the potential of harpagoside to suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6 and matrix degrading proteases. We further investigated the likely targets of harpagoside in primary human OA chondrocytes. OA chondrocytes were pre-treated with harpagoside before stimulation with IL-1?. mRNA expression profile of 92 cytokines/chemokines was determined using TaqMan Human Chemokine PCR Array. Expression levels of selected mRNAs were confirmed using TaqMan assays. Protein levels of IL-6 and MMP-13 were assayed by ELISA and immunoblotting. Total protein levels and phosphorylation of signaling proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Cellular localization of IL-6 and c-Fos was performed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. DNA binding activity of c-FOS/AP-1 was determined by ELISA. Harpagoside significantly altered the global chemokine expression profile in IL-1?-stimulated OA chondrocytes. Expression of IL-6 was highly induced by IL-1?, which was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment of OA chondrocytes with harpagoside. Harpagoside did not inhibit the IL-1?-induced activation of NF-?B and C/EBP? transcription factors but suppressed the IL-1?-triggered induction, phosphorylation, and DNA binding activity of c-FOS, one of the main components of AP-1 transcription factors. Further, harpagoside significantly inhibited the expression of MMP-13 in OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. siRNA-mediated knockdown of IL-6 resulted in suppressed expression and secretion of MMP-13 directly linking the role of IL-6 with MMP-13 expression. Taken together, the present study suggests that harpagoside exerts a significant anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the inflammatory stimuli mediated by suppressing c-FOS/AP-1 activity in OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract This paper discusses the role of molecular oxygen as an aid to wound healing, and the potential value of the three major therapies which allow the delivery of oxygen to the wound site: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), Topical Oxygen Therapy (TOT) and a new sterile wound dressing, OxyzymeTM. We summarize studies which have been undertaken using these interventions, and discuss their reported effect on chronic, non-healing wounds, in particular, on ulcers associated with Diabetes. The main conclusions drawn from the studies reviewed indicate that therapeutic oxygen can be used as an aid to the healing of chronic wounds; and benefits are clearly evident with the use of both HBOT and TOT. There is also potential for the use of a new, portable, topical oxygen delivery system, oxyzyme. However its use is still embryonic and studies on its effectiveness are limited. More robust measures of its efficacy are urgently needed.

AB  - Background The dearth of literature regarding how or when to intervene when an adult with intellectual disability is bereaved may impede clinical practice; this study therefore aimed to explore the current clinical psychology response, so as to enhance understanding of the role of the profession in supporting grief within this population. Method A collective case study design was used. Data for six persons with intellectual disability, including interviews with parentally bereaved persons and involved staff members, were integrated into individual case stories for cross-case synthesis. Results Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Five overarching themes illustrated that the clinical psychology role is broadly distributed and identified potentially complicating factors such as ?gatekeeping? and ?staff uncertainty.? Conclusions A model of bereavement supports reflecting that by Read (Learning Disability Practice, 8, 2005, 31) is being approximated in clinical practice; further research is required to determine how best to implement this, and whether this meets the true needs of the population.

AB  - ABSTRACT For severe burn injuries, successful medical intervention is accomplished by rapidly and safely providing physical barriers that can cover damaged skin tissues, thereby preventing critical danger of extensive bleeding and infection. Despite availability of a large assortment of wound coverage options, the etiology of wound healing is rather complex leading to significant defects in skin repair. The use of cell-mediated treatment approaches in combination with bioengineered wound coverage constructs may provide the missing tool to improve wound healing outcomes. In this study, we have used an engineered 3D PEGylated fibrin (P-fibrin) gel as a scaffold for adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) delivery into the burn injury model. We were able to confirm the presence of ASCs in the wound site two weeks after the initial injury. Delivery of ASCs-containing gels was associated with improved vascularization of the injured area at early time points accompanied by an increased abundance of mannose receptor expressing cells. Moreover, the application of P-fibrin biomaterial exhibited positive effects on early mononuclear cell recruitment and granulation tissue formation without negatively affecting wound closure kinetics or extent of connective tissue deposition. Collectively, our data support the feasibility of using P-fibrin gels in wound dressing applications requiring controlled delivery of viable cells.

AB  - Microglia in the central nervous system are usually maintained in a quiescent state. When activated, they can perform many diverse functions which may be either beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. Although microglial activation may be accompanied by changes in morphology, morphological changes cannot accurately predict the function being undertaken by a microglial cell. Studies of peripheral macrophages and in vitro and animal studies of microglia have resulted in the definition of specific activation states: M1 (classical activation) and M2 (sometimes subdivided into alternative activation and acquired deactivation). Some authors have suggested that these might be an overlapping continuum of functions rather than discrete categories. In this review, we consider translational aspects of our knowledge of microglia: specifically, we discuss the question as to what extent different activation states of microglia exist in the human central nervous system, which tools can be used to identify them and emerging evidence for such changes in ageing and in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.
