AB  - Summary:? The caspase family of cysteine proteases becomes activated in response to diverse cellular insults and coordinates apoptosis through proteolysis of hundreds of cellular substrates. Cytotoxic lymphocytes are adept at promoting apoptosis of virally infected or transformed cells through delivery of cytotoxic enzymes, such as granzyme B, into target cells via the granule exocytosis pathway. Granzyme B promotes apoptosis of target cells through direct processing of certain caspases, which leads to their autoactivation. Granzyme B can also activate caspases indirectly through proteolysis of Bid, a protein that promotes mitochondrial permeabilization and consequent activation of the apoptosome pathway to caspase activation. Evidence also indicates that granzyme B may contribute to antiviral immunity by directly suppressing viral replication through direct proteolysis of viral proteins that are essential for pathogenicity. Recent reports also suggest that granzyme B may have additional non-cytotoxic roles under certain circumstances and may also function in the extracellular space. Here, we discuss the cytotoxic and putative non-cytotoxic functions of granzyme B within the immune system.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Abstract Aucubin (AU) is the main active ingredient of Aucuba japonica which has showed many positive effects such as anti-inflammation and liver protection. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. In this research, we explored the effects of AU on the tyloxapol-induced NAFLD in mice and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) induced-3T3L1 cells. Tyloxapol (300 mg/kg) was injected to C57BL/6 mice with aucubin. The differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with or without aucubin after stimulation of apoC-III (100 ?g/mL). In results, aucubin inhibited hyperlipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation by influencing the content of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumour necrosis factor receptor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and IL-6 in blood. AU activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), PPAR? and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and promoted the phosphorylation of adenosine 5?-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα), AMPK?, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and protein kinase B (AKT). In conclusion, AU performed the function of hypolipidaemic by its obvious anti-inflammation and antioxidant activity, which may become a kind of new drug targeting at NAFLD.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - Summary While interleukin (IL)-1? plays an important role in combating the invading pathogen as part of the innate immune response, its dysregulation is responsible for a number of autoinflammatory disorders. Large IL-1? activating platforms, known as inflammasomes, can assemble in response to the detection of endogenous host and pathogen-associated danger molecules. Formation of these protein complexes results in the autocatalysis and activation of caspase-1, which processes precursor IL-1? into its secreted biologically active form. Inflammasome and IL-1? activity is required to efficiently control viral, bacterial and fungal pathogen infections. Conversely, excess IL-1? activity contributes to human disease, and its inhibition has proved therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of a spectrum of serious, yet relatively rare, heritable inflammasomopathies. Recently, inflammasome function has been implicated in more common human conditions, such as gout, type II diabetes and cancer. This raises the possibility that anti-IL-1 therapeutics may have broader applications than anticipated previously, and may be utilized across diverse disease states that are linked insidiously through unwanted or heightened inflammasome activity.

AB  - ABSTRACT Long-term administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can induce detrimental side effects such as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) in human. Although inflammation is known to be associated with BRONJ development, the detailed underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-36α is, in part, responsible for the BRONJ development. We found a notably higher level of IL-36α and lower level of collagen in the BRONJ lesions in mice. We also found that IL-36α remarkably suppressed TGF-?-mediated expression of Collα1 and α-Sma via the activation of Erk signaling pathway in mouse gingival mesenchymal stem cells. When IL-36 signaling was abrogated in vivo, development of BRONJ lesions was ameliorated in mice. Taken together, we showed the pathologic role of IL-36α in BRONJ development by inhibiting collagen expression and demonstrated that IL-36α could be a potential marker and a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of BRONJ. ? 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary:? The discovery of antibodies specific for citrullinated protein epitopes [anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)] is a hallmark for the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and will also be a useful tool for understanding the fundamental pathologic processes. There are several essential questions pertaining to ACPA that remain to be explored, such as understanding the early specificity of the underlying T-cell recognition, whether the production of ACPA is a primary or secondary process, and in the event of such antibodies being arthritogenic, whether they could possibly regulate the disease development. To answer these questions, animal models are needed, but unfortunately ACPA is not a prominent feature of any of the classical animal models of RA. However, we showed recently that ACPA can be isolated from animals susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis that are specific for citrullinated type II collagen (CII). The citrulline specificity could be visualized, and the specificity is determined primarily by a direct interaction with citrulline. We also demonstrated that these antibodies are specific for the citrullinated epitopes and are pathogenic in vivo. A new hypothesis to explain how inflammation in RA can be directed to cartilaginous joints and be self-perpetuating is suggested, which involves recognition of post-translational modifications (glycosylation and citrullination) on CII by T and B cells that can have both arthritogenic and regulatory consequences.

AB  - Abstract Individualizing cancer therapy for molecular targeted inhibitors requires a new class of molecular profiling technology that can map the functional state of the cancer cell signal pathways containing the drug targets. Reverse phase protein microarrays (RPMA) are a technology platform designed for quantitative, multiplexed analysis of specific phosphorylated, cleaved, or total (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) forms of cellular proteins from a limited amount of sample. This class of microarray can be used to interrogate tissue samples, cells, serum, or body fluids. RPMA were previously a research tool; now this technology has graduated to use in research clinical trials with clinical grade sensitivity and precision. In this review we describe the application of RPMA for multiplexed signal pathway analysis in therapeutic monitoring, biomarker discovery, and evaluation of pharmaceutical targets, and conclude with a summary of the technical aspects of RPMA construction and analysis.
