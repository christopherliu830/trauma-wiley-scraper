AB  - Summary:? The discovery of antibodies specific for citrullinated protein epitopes [anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)] is a hallmark for the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and will also be a useful tool for understanding the fundamental pathologic processes. There are several essential questions pertaining to ACPA that remain to be explored, such as understanding the early specificity of the underlying T-cell recognition, whether the production of ACPA is a primary or secondary process, and in the event of such antibodies being arthritogenic, whether they could possibly regulate the disease development. To answer these questions, animal models are needed, but unfortunately ACPA is not a prominent feature of any of the classical animal models of RA. However, we showed recently that ACPA can be isolated from animals susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis that are specific for citrullinated type II collagen (CII). The citrulline specificity could be visualized, and the specificity is determined primarily by a direct interaction with citrulline. We also demonstrated that these antibodies are specific for the citrullinated epitopes and are pathogenic in vivo. A new hypothesis to explain how inflammation in RA can be directed to cartilaginous joints and be self-perpetuating is suggested, which involves recognition of post-translational modifications (glycosylation and citrullination) on CII by T and B cells that can have both arthritogenic and regulatory consequences.

AB  - Summary The description of highly exposed individuals who remain seronegative (HESN) despite repeated exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 has heightened interest in identifying potential mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance. HIV-specific humoral and T cell-mediated responses have been identified routinely in HESN subjects, although it remains unknown if these responses are a definitive cause of protection or merely a marker for exposure. Approximately half of HESN lack any detectible HIV-specific adaptive immune responses, suggesting that other mechanisms of protection from HIV-1 infection also probably exist. In support of the innate immune response as a mechanism of resistance, increased natural killer (NK) cell activity has been correlated with protection from infection in several high-risk cohorts of HESN subjects, including intravenous drug users, HIV-1 discordant couples and perinatally exposed infants. Inheritance of protective NK KIR3DL1high and KIR3DS1 receptor alleles have also been observed to be over-represented in a high-risk cohort of HESN intravenous drug users and HESN partners of HIV-1-infected subjects. Other intrinsic mechanisms of innate immune protection correlated with resistance in HESN subjects include heightened dendritic cell responses and increased secretion of anti-viral factors such as ?-chemokines, small anti-viral factors and defensins. This review will highlight the most current evidence in HESN subjects supporting the role of epithelial microenvironment and the innate immune system in sustaining resistance against HIV-1 infection. We will argue that as a front-line defence the innate immune response determines the threshold of infectivity that HIV-1 must overcome to establish a productive infection.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews current knowledge of the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and describes emerging markers of inflammation in CVD. It examines whether individuals identified on the basis of elevated serum high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP) benefit from clinical intervention. The chapter reviews existing guidelines relating to hs-CRP and highlights limitations in the use of hs-CRP in risk assessment. It evaluates the prognostic value of other inflammatory markers, including fibrinogen, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, serum amyloid A, albumin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, circulating immune complexes, heat-shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), paraoxonase-1, and myeloperoxidase in CVD. The chapter reviews the influence of chronic inflammatory disease and infectious burden on CVD, and discusses relevant data regarding pharmacological agents with anti-inflammatory effects in CVD. It evaluates the influence of dietary patterns, wholegrains, dietary fat, antioxidants, phytochemicals, plant sterols, alcohol, micronutrients, physical activity, genetics, and family history on inflammatory markers associated with CVD.

AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - Summary Background? Although development of visceral pain is an important defensive mechanism, hypersensitivity results in a significant clinical problem and is likely to be one of the major factors involved in the pathogenesis of abdominal and chest pain in functional bowel disorders (FBDs). Understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in peripheral sensitization of visceral nociceptors has advanced as a result of the experimental studies, especially in animal models, which have led to knowledge and identification of key mediators and receptors. Aim? To provide a comprehensive review focused on the peripheral mechanisms believed to be responsible for sensitization and potential molecular targets for a disorder which is common, distressing and has sub-optimal treatment options. Methods? Literature review using Ovid and Pubmed from 1966. Results? There is substantial interest in the development of new drugs for treatment of FBDs in the background of advances in understanding the molecular and physiological mechanisms of visceral hypersensitivity. The potential drug targets include TPRV1, ASICs, voltage-gated sodium channels, ATP, PAR-2, cannabinoid, prostaglandin, tachykinin and 5HT3 receptors. Conclusion? It is anticipated that with advancing molecular understanding of the basis of visceral hypersensitivity, the next decade will see accelerated development of new molecules for treatment of functional bowel diseases.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

AB  - Mammals harbor a complex gut-associated microbiota, comprising bacteria that provide immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits to the host, and contribute to their well-being. However, dysregulation of the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, along with the associated mucosal immune response have a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, among others. In addition, outside the gut lumen, bacteria from microbiota are the causative agent of peritoneal inflammation, abdominal sepsis and systemic sepsis. Critical care interventions during sepsis by antibiotics induce dysbiosis and present acute and long-term poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss immunomodulatory effects of the microbial molecules and products, highlighting the role of Bacteroides fragilis, a human commensal with ambiguous interactions with the host. Moreover, we also address the impact of antibiotic treatment in sepsis outcome and discuss new insights for microbiota modulation.

AB  - Abstract In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in infected individuals with adequate immunological and virological status. Risk factors for cognitive impairment include hepatitis C virus co-infection, host genetic factors predisposing to HAND, the early establishment of the virus in the CNS and its persistence under HAART; thus, the CNS is an important reservoir for HIV. Microglial cells are permissive to HIV-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were found expressed in brains of HIV-1-infected persons, contributing to brain disease. Inflammasomes can be triggered by alarmins or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which directly stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators by glial cells, contribute to blood?brain barrier injury through induction of release of various proteases and allow the passage of infected macrophages, and trigger IL-1? release from primed cells. Amongst alarmins involved in HIV-1-induced neuropathogenesis, IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are of particular interest. Neurocognitive alterations were recently associated with dysregulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the CNS, leading to the induction of neuronal apoptosis, decrease in synaptic function and neuroinflammation. Specific biomarkers, including HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 antibodies, have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with HAND, correlated with immune activation and identifying a very early stage of neurocognitive impairment that precedes changes in metabolites detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Moreover, HMGB1 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 persistence in dendritic cells and in the constitution of viral reservoirs. In this review, the mechanisms whereby alarmins contribute to HIV-1-induced CNS inflammation and neuropathogenesis will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Epidermal keratinocytes (KCs) undergo highly orchestrated morphological and molecular changes during transition from proliferative compartment into growth arrested early and late differentiation layers, prior to dying in outermost cornified layers of normal skin. Creation of stratum corneum is vital to barrier function protecting against infection. Transcriptional events in KCs regulating complex processes of differentiation and host defense required to maintain constant epidermal thickness and resistance to infection in either young or aged skin are largely unknown. Furthermore, as terminal differentiation is characterized by irreversible loss of replicative potential culminating in dead layers at the skin surface, this process may be viewed as a form of senescence. However, a complete transcriptional profile of senescent (SN) human KCs has not been previously defined to permit delineation of molecular boundaries involving differentiation and senescence. To fill this void, we utilized global transcriptional analysis of KCs maintained in vitro as either cultures of proliferating (PR) cells, early and late confluent (LC) (accelerated senescence) cultures, or KCs undergoing replicative senescence. Global gene expression profiling revealed early confluent (EC) KCs were somewhat similar to PR KCs, while prominent differences were evident when compared to LC KCs; which were also distinct from replicatively SN KCs. While confluent KCs have in common several genes regulating differentiation with replicatively SN KCs, the latter cells expressed elevated levels of genes involved in interferon signaling and inflammatory pathways. These results provide new insights into cell autonomous transcriptional-based programs operative within KCs contributing to replicative senescence, with partial sharing of genes involved in differentiation. In addition, regulation of KC senescence may involve participation of interferon signaling pathways derived from the important role of KCs in protecting skin from infection. Integrating all of the transcriptional data revealed a key role for Notch receptor mediated signaling in the confluency induced differentiation phenotype using this model system. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the often fatal sequelae of a broad range of precipitating conditions. Despite decades of intensive research and clinical trials there remain no therapies in routine clinical practice that target the dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response that characterises ARDS. Neutrophils play a central role in the initiation, propagation and resolution of this complex inflammatory environment by migrating into the lung and executing a variety of pro-inflammatory functions. These include degranulation with liberation of bactericidal proteins, release of cytokines and reactive oxygen species as well as production of neutrophil extracellular traps. Although these functions are advantageous in clearing bacterial infection, the consequence of associated tissue damage, the contribution to worsening acute inflammation and prolonged neutrophil lifespan at sites of inflammation are deleterious. In this review, the importance of the neutrophil will be considered, together with discussion of recent advances in understanding neutrophil function and the factors that influence them throughout the phases of inflammation in ARDS. From a better understanding of neutrophils in this context, potential therapeutic targets are identified and discussed. ? 2018 The Authors.
