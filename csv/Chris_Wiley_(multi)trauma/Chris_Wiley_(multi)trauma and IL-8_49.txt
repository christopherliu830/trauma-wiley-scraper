AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Cosmetics based on traditional herbal medicine are formulated not only with herbal extracts but also using advanced bioprocessing and delivery method. This chapter explains the characteristics of Korean herbal cosmetics through examples of concepts, history, and traditions within the Korean traditional medicine industry. With the advancements in biotechnology, studies are now being conducted on the dermatological effects and processing methods of traditional medicinal ingredients, including ginseng. The enzymatic and microbial bioprocessing is used to produce novel natural compounds. Camelliaside A and B and three oxyisoflavones were isolated from the green tea seed and soybean. Using these compounds, a commercially and biologically useful new polyphenol, kaempferol, and 7,3?,4?-trihydroxyisoflavone were produced by enzymatic and microbial bioconversion. Carrier systems, such as liposomes, polymersomes, and solid lipid nanoparticles, are being developed for the stabilization and skin delivery of herbal active compounds.

AB  - Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an unusual, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder leading to the loss of motor neurons. After diagnosis, the average lifespan ranges from 3 to 5 years, and death usually results from respiratory failure. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, multiple factors are thought to contribute to the progression of ALS, such as network interactions between genes, environmental exposure, impaired molecular pathways and many others. The neuroprotective properties of neural stem cells (NSCs) and the paracrine signaling of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been examined in multiple pre-clinical trials of ALS with promising results. The data from these initial trials indicate a reduction in the rate of disease progression. The mechanism through which stem cells achieve this reduction is of major interest. Here, we review the to-date pre-clinical and clinical therapeutic approaches employing stem cells, and discuss the most promising ones.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains syndromes produced by the transfusion of incompatible blood. It considers haemolytic reactions due to causes other than incompatibility. By convention, red cell destruction is classified as either intravascular, characterized by rupture of red cells within the bloodstream and liberation of haemoglobin (Hb) into the plasma, or as extravascular, characterized by phagocytosis of red cells by macrophages of the mono-nuclear phagocyte system (MPS), with subsequent liberation of bilirubin into the plasma. Intravascular destruction may be produced by antibodies such as anti - A and anti - B that are readily lytic in vitro , although not all of the red cells are lysed in the plasma; some are sensitized and removed from the circulation by erythrophagocytosis, mainly in the liver. To ensure that haemolysis has not occurred ex vivo , the supernatant plasma of the unit or units of transfused blood should be inspected for free haemoglobin (Hb).

AB  - Summary Membrane-bound and intracellular immune receptors respond to microbial pathogens by initiating signaling cascades that result in production of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial factors. These host responses need to be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage and other harmful consequences of excessive inflammation. CARD-only proteins (COPs) and Pyrin-only proteins (POPs) are human- and primate-specific dominant negative inhibitors that modulate inflammatory and innate immune responses. In addition, several poxviruses encode POPs that interfere with inflammatory and host defense responses. COPs and POPs modulate inflammatory signaling at several checkpoints by sequestering key components of the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling cascades, thus hampering downstream signal transduction. Here, we review and discuss current understanding of the evolutionary history and molecular mechanisms by which roles of host- and virus-encoded COPs and POPs may regulate inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, we address their (patho)physiological roles and highlight topics for further research.
