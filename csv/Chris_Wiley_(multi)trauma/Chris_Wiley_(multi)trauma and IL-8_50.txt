AB  - Abstract Reticulohistiocytoses (RH) are rare and clinically heterogeneous histiocytic disorders of dermatological interest. Three clinical entities with superimposable histopathological features are currently considered, namely: solitary reticulohistiocytoma, diffuse/generalized reticulohistiocytosis and multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. Although in the last decade RH studies have only minimally progressed, histiocytosis research has advanced considerably: the prognostic and therapeutic importance of the clinical sub-classification of histiocytosis patients as well as of the detection of genetic alterations in the genes of the ERK pathway has been highlighted. According to these insights, we previously reported the presence of molecular alteration RH and described a subset of patients with disseminated multisystem involvement lacking arthritis. In the present review, we aim to update and revise the knowledge regarding RH. We first reviewed their histopathological, immunophenotypical and ultrastructural features, discussed their histopathological differential diagnosis with other conditions characterized by infiltrates made of oncocytic or epithelioid cells (with special regard to Destombes-Rosai-Dorfman Disease (DRDD)) and finally summarized the molecular landscape of RH. We therefore tried to adjust the clinical sub-classification of Langerhans cell histiocytosis to the clinical phenotypes of RH, outlining 5 clinically different groups of patients. Finally, we reconsidered the clinical workflow to the evaluation of RH patients, in light of the 5 different clinical groups and discussed the different therapeutic approaches and the possible role of target inhibitors.

AB  - Biomarker analysis and proteomic discovery in pediatric sickle cell disease has the potential to lead to important discoveries and improve care. The aim of this review article is to describe proteomic and biomarker articles involving neurological and developmental complications in this population. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant research publications. Articles were selected for children under the age of 21 years with the most common subtypes of sickle cell disease. Included articles focused on growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor), intra and extracellular brain proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (interleukin-1?, l-selectin, thrombospondin-1, erythrocyte, and platelet-derived microparticles). Positive findings include increases in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor and platelet-derived growth factor with elevated transcranial Dopplers velocities, increases in platelet-derived growth factor isoform AA with overt stroke, and increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein with acute brain injury. These promising potential neuro-biomarkers provide insight into pathophysiologic processes and clinical events, but their clinical utility is yet to be established. Additional proteomics research is needed, including broad-based proteomic discovery of plasma constituents and blood cell proteins, as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid components, before, during and after neurological and developmental complications.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review the human and veterinary literature on the biology of apoptosis in health and disease. Data Sources ? Data were examined from the human and veterinary literature identified through Pubmed and references listed in appropriate articles pertaining to apoptosis. Human Data Synthesis ? The role of apoptosis in health and disease is a rapidly growing area of research in human medicine. Apoptosis has been identified as a component of human autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and sepsis. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Research data available from the veterinary literature pertaining to apoptosis and its role in diseases of small animal species is still in its infancy. The majority of veterinary studies focus on oncologic therapy. Most of the basic science and human clinical research studies use human blood and tissue samples and murine models. The results from these studies may be applicable to small animal species. Conclusions ? Apoptosis is the complex physiologic process of programmed cell death. The pathophysiology of apoptosis and disease is only now being closely evaluated in human medicine. Knowledge of the physiologic mechanisms by which tissues regulate their size and composition is leading researchers to investigate the role of apoptosis in human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disease and sepsis. Because it is a multifaceted process, apoptosis is difficult to target or manipulate therapeutically. Future studies may reveal methods to regulate or manipulate apoptosis and improve patient outcome.

AB  - Aim? Blood Matters was a project funded by the Victorian Department of Human Services to introduce sustainable improvements in hospital transfusion practice. An evaluation was conducted at two metropolitan hospitals to review progress against stated aims and identify key elements leading to changes in transfusion practice and highlight any unintended consequences. Method? During the project, each hospital chose to focus improvement efforts in key areas. Measurable, specific goals were developed. Using a case study approach, the evaluation was conducted by review of the aim-specific data collected during the project and by semi-structured interviews from which key themes (eg assumptions underpinning decisions) were identified. Interviews were conducted with at least 10 representative individuals from each organisation whose roles were considered necessary for change in their institution?s transfusion practice. Result? Measurable improvements have been made (eg an 87 percent improvement in reduction of patient identification error) and the Transfusion Nurse position made operational at both sites. Examples of key success factors identified are: a committed transfusion team to direct improvements in the organisation; integration of transfusion data reporting into existing organisational quality/risk management structures to provide ongoing visibility for transfusion issues and; mentorship and support for the Transfusion Nurse role. Conclusion? This project has, in the short term, successfully generated improvements in hospital transfusion practice and influenced hospital systems to enable changes to be sustainable in the longer term.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - As in many aspects of transfusion medicine, practices have developed based on low levels of evidence. Let?s review some assumptions and think how these might change in future:- (1)?Indications. 80% of platelet transfusions are given prophylactically to patients with bone marrow failure, yet no trials have demonstrated the value of prophylaxis over treatment of bleeding alone. (2)?Trigger. A trigger of 10???10?g/l is now accepted. Reducing this further will depend on accurate counting, challenging at this level. (3)?Dose & frequency. The optimum dosing schedule has not been derived by pharmacokinetic studies, but by what can be conveniently manufactured. An adult dose of 3???1011 platelets is accepted, but there is wide variation in practice. (4)?Manufacture. Globally, 3 methods (pooled buffy coats, platelet rich plasma and apheresis) all produce an efficacious product. Although apheresis platelets reduce donor exposure, no functional advantage has been demonstrated. (5)?In vitro assessment of function. A battery of tests is recommended, but only pH has been shown to correlate with posttransfusion survival. (6)?ABO matching. ABO compatible platelets give better increments, and transfusing ABO incompatible plasma can be associated with haemolysis, but ABO matching to patient is often compromised by stock management. (7)?Use of platelet additive solution. A 70:30 mix of PAS:plasma would reduce reactions and perhaps TRALI but this is not standard practice. Is the plasma useful? (8)?CMV safety. Overall, leucocyte depletion alone appears to provide a high degree of protection, but this is not universally accepted. (9)?Assessment of response. 1 and 24?hr increments are standard, but is regression analysis the way forward? (10)?Management of refractoriness. Better HLA and HPA matching is now technically possible. Should these lead to better HLA matching for all? (11)?Is one product for all appropriate? 20% of platelets go to surgical patients who are bleeding. Do they need a product with a different specification?

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.

AB  - Stage 1 of routine antenatal RhD immunoglobulin prophylaxis was recommended in late 2002, for RhD negative women having their first child. This was as a result of a 1999 National Health Medical Research Council [NHMRC] recommendation as best practice to further reduce the incidence of HDN due to anti-D. Revised guidelines were released in 2003 by the National Blood Authority with NHMRC endorsement. It is likely that stage 2 [for all pregnancies in RhD negative women] will be in place by early 2005. The introduction of antenatal prophylaxis has raised a number of issues for pathology laboratories: a)?frequency of antenatal testing within this new program b)?laboratory protocols where the presence of RhD immunoglobulin is confirmed or suspected c)?reporting formats in such circumstances d)?inventory and supply issues including product traceability e)?testing of maternal and cord samples at delivery in women who have received antenatal prophylaxis The Australian & New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion released revised antenatal testing guidelines in early 2004 to assist laboratories in dealing with some of these issues. Collaboration with ARCBS, CSL and RANZCOG has also resulted in useful information being made available covering other aspects of this new initiative. The presentation will explore some of the above issues leading to more general discussion during the symposium.
