AB  - The application of formal regulatory structures to the field of blood component and blood product manufacture is an understandable response to public and governmental concern over the safety of such products. Internationally the trend is to greater central control of blood service provision and regulation is one of several tools used to achieve this. In both Australia and New Zealand, blood components are treated as medicinal products for the purposes of regulation. The imminent creation of a TransTasman Regulatory Authority provides an opportunity to review systems used for the regulation of these products within Australasia and to ensure that an appropriate balance between clinical need and quality conformance is achieved. The control of human derived medicinal products presents a number of specific challenges. This is particularly the case in relation to blood components where biological variation will impact on the ?formulation? of any given product. Essentially each component becomes a unique batch. Efforts at control and regulation should recognise this. Two broad approaches can be used for regulation. In the first control is achieved through the application of standard processes. In the second the necessary outcome is defined but the process not formally defined. Increasingly regulatory control of blood component manufacture favours control of the process. Control through process can however ultimately restrict clinical flexibility and responsiveness. Care must be taken to ensure that this is recognised and addressed in the development of systems utilised to assure the quality and safety of blood components.

AB  - Since its establishment on 1 July 2003, the National Blood Authority (NBA) has been making steady progress towards fulfilling its vision of ?Saving and improving Australian lives through a world-class blood supply?. While the NBA?s early focus has been on developing organisational infrastructure and meeting compliance requirements as a new Commonwealth agency, it has already begun to bring about improvements to the management of the blood sector in line with the recommendations of the 2001 Stephen Review. As the centralised procurement agency for blood and blood products, the NBA is responsible for managing existing supply contracts with the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, CSL Limited and a number of pharmaceutical companies, and is currently negotiating new contracts with two major suppliers. The NBA has also been working with the signatories to the National Blood Agreement, all nine Australian Government Jurisdictions, to coordinate national demand and supply planning. It is introducing an agreed single national pricing schedule and has developed improved forecasting models and reporting mechanisms to ensure that jurisdictional requirements for blood and blood products are more closely matched to supply. With time, the NBA hopes to play a greater facilitation role in encouraging the better clinical use of blood and blood products as this will not only result in better patient outcomes, but will also contribute to ensuring the adequacy of the blood supply. This presentation discusses why the NBA was established, its roles and responsibilities, and how it is working to bring about reforms in the sector in terms of increased value for money, transparency and accountability.

AB  - Aim? The aim of the study is to quantitate D antigenic sites on RBC in weak D and partial D variants in Indian population by flowcytometric method. Method? Dantigenic sites were estimated in 48 cases of partial D, eight cases of weak D (identified by serological methods) and normal Rh phenotypes subjects by flowcytometric technique. The indirect immunoflourescence method was employed using thirty epitope specific monoclonal anti-D as primary antibody. The D antigenic sites were calculated using standard RBC with known D antigenic sites. Result? The mean (±I S.D) D antigenic sites per RBC in weak D and partial D were 4503?±?2067 and 6750?±?3426 respectively. In R1R1 phenotype the range of D antigenic sites was 16500?±?2500 and in R1r it was 10600?±?2520. In four cases of weak D sites were in range of 1700 to 3500 and in other four it was 5000 to 7200?D sites/RBC. Among partial D variants DVI had minimum, and DVa had maximum number of D sites. Conclusion? Flowcytometry is a very good tool for demonstrating minor differences in D antigen sites in partial D and weak D when serological methods are not conclusive.

AB  - BloodSafe is a joint initiative between the South Australian (SA) Department of Health, Australian Red Cross Blood Service, hospitals and transfusion service providers. It has successfully established quality assurance programs to improve the safety and quality of blood management practice within the SA health system. BloodSafe began as a project in September of 2002 initially with 12?months funding from the Safety and Quality Council. Four Transfusion Nurse Consultants were appointed across five major metropolitan teaching hospitals. Audit of practice within these hospitals demonstrated three major problem areas- transfusion specimen collection, the decision to transfuse and administration of blood. A further 12?months funding was granted including extension of the project to include a Nurse Educator for the state to introduce initiatives into country and private hospitals. Reaudit of practice after interventions and education demonstrated that the Transfusion Nurse Consultants were effective change agents. In particular red cell use outside the NHMRC/ASBT guidelines fell from 18% to 4%(p?<?0.01) in stable adult orthopaedic patients audited. A number of other important aspects of transfusion practice also showed significant improvement including documentation, consent and administration. Recurrent funding for BloodSafe Transfusion Nurse Consultants was granted by the SA Department of Health from July 2004. Factors contributing to the success of BloodSafe include a multidisciplinary team, Transfusion Nurses of clinical nurse consultant level, demonstration of a clear need for the initiatives, evidence of successful practice improvement, statewide collaboration and interventions, benchmarking across hospitals, and impartiality of the BloodSafe name with acceptance by stakeholders.

AB  - Focus on the risks of viral transmission via transfusion has pushed recognition of other transfusion risks to the background over the last several decades. With reduction in the risks of HCV and HIV to very low levels (well less than 1/million units), productive attention can now be directed toward other risks. Bacterial contamination of platelets represents the largest morbidity and mortality risk faced by a platelet recipient, and the risk of dieing due to a contaminated unit is at least 10- if not 100-times greater than the chance of HIV transmission. Approximately 1 in every 1?4,000 units of platelets can be shown to contain bacteria, and the frequency of fatality due to port-transfusion sepsis is 14/million units transfused. Bacterial contamination is often not recognized clinically, however, because of the situation of the patient. A variety of techniques to limit and detect bacterial contamination are available for implementation. Culturing is used most widely. Checking pH, glucose concentration or preservation of swirling are simple and inexpensive techniques but suffer from lack of sensitivity. The development of immunologic techniques that can be accomplished rapidly may shift the testing to immediately before issuance for transfusion, a time at which any contamination would be easier to detect because of growth during the storage period. Not only will detection techniques improve transfusion recipient safety, but they can lead to cost-savings through extension of the platelet storage period as has already been implemented in several European countries.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been implicated in certain adverse patient outcomes. Immunomodulation may play a central role. The aim of this project was to determine the ability of supernatants and cellular fractions of RBC concentrates to modulate the immune response of allogeneic mononuclear cells (MNCs), particularly monocytes. Non-leucocytereduced, buffy-coat-depleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected on day 1 and fortnightly until product expiry, and centrifuged to obtain supernatant and cellular fractions. On the?day of RBC sample collection, whole blood (WB) and MNCs were prepared from ABO-compatible allogeneic donors. Induction of monocyte CD11b and CD54 was determined by flow cytometry by incubating allogeneic WB with RBC supernatants or cellular fractions, followed by staining with fl uorescently-labelled anti-CD14, anti-CD11b and anti-CD54. Cytokine release was determined by incubating MNCs with RBC supernatants and culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA for IL-8, TNFalpha; and IL-10. Supernatant and cellular fraction from non-leucocyte-reduced RBC concentrates induced expression of CD11b and CD54 on allogeneic monocytes. Buffy-coatdepleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates had minimal effect on monocyte CD11b or CD54 expression. Cytokine release from MNCs incubated with RBC supernatant suggested a tenuous balance between proinflammatory (IL-8 and TNF alpha;) and immunosuppressive (IL-10) responses. All RBC product types induced cytokine release from MNCs. The results from this study indicate that stored RBC concentrates can modulate allogeneic MNCs. Both proinflammatory and immunosuppressive responses were evident. Leucocytes in RBC concentrates appear to favour a proinflammatory response by MNCs.

AB  - In July 2003, The Royal Women?s Hospital, Melbourne implemented the use of Prophylactic Rh D Immunoglobulin in obstetrics to help reduce the incidence of Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN), as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer in December 2002. Successful implementation required the coordinated efforts of a large working party including haematologists, laboratory staff, blood bank, product technicians, CSL, clinical managers, midwives, obstetricians, clerical staff and educators. New practice guidelines, system processes, procedures and staff education needed to be developed and coordinated to support the successful implementation across the Royal Women?s Hospital complex maternity care programme sites. This talk firstly outlines how this implementation was achieved across a complex organisation as is The Royal Women?s Hospital, and the tools that were invaluable in contributing to its consistent success. Examples of materials developed to support staff, from discussion guidelines to materials developed to aid pregnant women to make an informed choice will be shown. The second part of this talk offers an insight into the concerns that pregnant women raise regarding the offering of prophylactic Anti ? D, from a midwifery perspective. What does the consumer think and how can we best serve their needs? What are the practical considerations that help Rh D negative women choose what is best for themselves and their babies? It is hoped that this talk contributes practical information to anyone involved in the delivery of prophylactic Anti-D to pregnant women for the prevention of HDN.

AB  - Bombay phenotype, one of the rare blood group was discovered in India in 1952 by Bhende et al. The frequency of this in Western India is about 1 in 7600. Aim? Our Institute gets referral samples from various hospitals and blood banks with problems in grouping and cross matching for identification of blood group and atypical antibodies. We have identified many Bombay phenotype cases out of these by serological procedures. We undertook molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene on this large series of Bombay phenotypes to see whether the earlier reported mutations on Indian Bombay phenotypes from South Africa and Reunion Island are present in our population or not. Method? Serological confirmations of Bombay phenotypes was done as per standard procedures. Thirty of these serologically confirmed samples were undertaken for molecular characterization of FUTI(H) gene. DNA extraction was done from these samples and FUTI(H) gene was amplified by performing nested PCR followed by digestion with restriction enzyme Nae 1 to screen for T 725 G mutation. The digested product was run on agarose gel electrophoresis and analysed. Result? Out of these 30 samples 27 samples were homozygous for T 725 G mutation and one sample was heterozygous for T 725 G mutation which serologically had shown absence of H antigen on red cells and two samples did not show the presence of this mutation. Conclusion? The T 725 G mutation of FUTI(H) gene appears to be the common mutation amongst the Bombay phenotypes detected in India.

It is characterised by a clinical constellation of signs and symptoms including dyspnoea, cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, fever, chills and bilateral non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We will discuss its diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment and causative factors. TRALI has been described as a leading cause of transfusion related death. However the incidence of non lethal forms of TRALI is unknown and we will discuss the reasons for this, as well as future directions for the prevention and treatment of this complication.

AB  - By comparison with many other procedures in medicine, apheresis for collection of haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) is a relatively innocuous process. The procedure itself is straightforward, serious adverse effects are rare and many donors experience real benefits. But the apparent simplicity of HPC harvest is misleading as apheresis raises substantial issues of consent, risk assessment and conflict of interest. G-CSF primed apheresis is associated with a number of predictable shortterm risks and unpredictable long-term risks, particularly in those who submit to a second or third donation. Donors are often coerced by the very nature of their relationship to the recipient and by expectations of altruism and are infrequently offered a true choice between bone marrow harvest and peripheral HPC harvest. And, as is the case in solid organ donation, HPC donors may consent to HPC collection for a number of different reasons, some of which may negatively impact upon their experience of apheresis and may give rise to concerns regarding late withdrawal from donation. While these issues are complex enough where competent adults are the donors, they are more difficult again where the ?donor? in not competent, is mentally ill or is a child. In this paper I will review the ethics of apheresis, critique the concept of informed consent and the disproportionate concern with unrelated donors, and consider whether current practices are ethically justifiable.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.

AB  - Aim? To understand the underlying cause of a cluster of haemolysis-type adverse event (AE) reports received by CSL/ARCBS in patients receiving Intragam? P. Method? The cluster of AE reports were analysed with respect to patient factors (clinical indication, dose, blood group, concomitant medications and blood products, bone marrow reserve), product factors (batch results, production records) and changes in clinical practice (administration protocols, infusion kits). All Intragam P haemolysis related AEs from clinical trials and post-marketing exposure were reviewed, as well as international literature on this subject. Result Sixteen haemolysis type cases were reported to ARCBS/CSL over a 3?month period, ranging from abnormal laboratory test results (positive Coombs test) to clinical symptoms requiring transfusion. Ten of these reports were received in 4?days from 2 Victorian hospitals following the detection of 2 cases, which precipitated a retrospective review that identified additional similar cases. All patients received high dose (doses exceeding 400?600?mg/kg given every 3?4 weeks either in frequency or quantity) and all but one (where evidence suggested an underlying disorder) were of blood group A or AB. Eight patients were recipients of bone marrow transplants. No product or batch related factors or processes likely to have contributed to the haemolysis type AEs were identified. Anti-A and Anti-B titres of all Intragam P batches were investigated and confirmed to be within regulatory approved release specifications and pharmacopoeial limits. Conclusion? Haemolysis type adverse events are a recognised consequence of IVIG administration and are widely discussed in the literature. This investigation has confirmed the association of high dose IVIG in recipients of blood group A or AB and increased risk of haemolysis type adverse events. It also highlighted the possibility of accentuating any consequent anaemia in patients with diminished bone marrow reserve (eg post bone marrow transplant patients). Pre-infusion ABO blood groups should be determined in patients receiving high dose IVIG and their haemoglobin levels monitored in the?days following therapy.

AB  - Since 1980 a register of all blood donors and patients in Western Australia (WA) with clinically significant red cell and platelet antibodies has been maintained by the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS)-Enterprise. The register is updated by ARCBS daily, and prior to 1999 a microfiche version was sent each month to WA transfusion laboratories. In 1999 ARCBS-Enterprise and the Health Department of WA (HDWA) explored the option of transfusion laboratories in public hospitals obtaining immediate electronic access to the register. A secure telnet radio-link was established between a dedicated stand-alone ARCBS server and the HDWA computer network which allowed password protected enquiry-only access to the database by hospital end-users. All end-users are required to sign an agreement to guarantee proper use of the register. The use of this comprehensive database has been successfully incorporated into the pre-transfusion testing protocols of all transfusion laboratories in WA. The benefits of this system include: ??Reduced delay in obtaining phenotyped units for patients with known antibodies. ??Reduced chance of delayed transfusion reactions in patients whose antibody level has fallen below detectable levels. ??A mechanism for ante-natal monitoring and predicting severity of haemolytic disease of the newborn when patients move between care providers during the pregnancy. ARCBS-Enterprise and end-users are passionate about the continuation of this extremely important resource in the future.

AB  - Aim? Borna Virus (BV) is a negative strand RNA virus associated with neurological diseases in animals. An association with human neuro-psychiatric disease has been suggested. The hypothesis investigated was that potentially infectious levels of blood borne BV may be present in humans. Levels of antibody to BV in human and cat sera were studied by ELISA with antigen from infected horse brain, immunofluorescence with infected cells, Western blot and BV epitope peptide-ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies were used in capture ELISAs to measure BV antigen levels (BVAg) in plasma and RT-PCR and sequencing used to investigate relatedness of BV sequences from humans in Australia with European sequences. Result? In 1% of blood donors, free BV antigen was detected in plasma and reactions with BV p24 or p40 antigens confirmed by Western Blot. Circulating immune complexes, antibody to brain-derived antigen and reactions with two of the eight peptides tested were also detected. Strong positive reactions in tests for circulating immune complexes, free plasma antigen and free antibody, were observed in a small number of blood donors. Individuals with high levels of plasma antigen were investigated by RT-PCR and sequencing. Sequence from the p24 region of the Australian human BV genome was 5% different from European reference strains. Conclusion? These data support the hypothesis that a form of BV is endemic in humans in Australia, including potentially infectious levels in blood donors. The extent of difference, in regions other than p24, between BV in Australia and strains infecting animals overseas remains to be clarified.

AB  - Aim? Since 1995, the SCBB has used three protocols to screen CB for contaminating microbes. The protocols differed in the number of culture bottles inoculated and sample volume used. The aim of this study was to compare microbial detection rates for each method. Method? CB units (n?=?9,618) were tested for microbial contamination using BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles (BioMerieux). Of these, 6,836 had 20?ml plasma waste fraction inoculated into adult anaerobic and aerobic bottles (Group A), 365 had 1?ml final stem cell product into an aerobic paediatric bottle (Group B), and 2,417 had 1?ml final product into a paediatric bottle and 10?ml plasma waste fraction into an adult anaerobic bottle (Group C). All bottles were incubated for a minimum of 5?days. Detection rates for microbe contamination were calculated for each group. Result? Microbe detection rates were: Group A ?345/6836 (5.0%), Group B ? 3/365 (0.8%) and Group C ? 66/2417 (2.7%)(p?<?0.0001). Organisms detected by A but not by B (and to a lesser extent C) included Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Proprionibacterium. Conclusion? Contamination detection rates differ significantly, depending upon the sample volume and type of culture bottle used. A protocol that uses the recommended sample volume and both anaerobic and anaerobic test bottles is likely to detect the highest number of contaminated units. Testing of a small sample from the final product using only a single paediatric aerobic bottle is likely to miss detection of the majority of anaerobic and some aerobic organisms. Prospective studies to define a standardised method for microbial detection for CB are required.

AB  - Crocus sativus L. (C.?sativus), commonly known as saffron, is used as a food additive, preservative, and medicinal herb. Traditionally, it has been used as an alternative treatment for different diseases. C.?sativus' medicinal effects are related to its major constituents like crocins, crocetin, and safranal. According to the literature, C.?sativus and its constituents could be considered as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, coronary artery diseases, asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, diabetes, and so on. Recently, numerous studies have reported such medicinal properties and found that the underlying mechanisms of action may be mediated by antioxidant, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. C.?sativus enhances the antioxidant capacity and acts as a free radical scavenger. As an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, it modulates inflammatory mediators, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity responses. This review highlights in vitro and animal findings regarding antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of C.?sativus and its constituents. Present review found that the C.?sativus and its main constituents such as safranal, crocins, and crocetin could be effective against various diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulatory effects.

AB  - Following the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the introduction of testing for erythropoietin in elite athletes, it became apparent that many athletes had reverted to blood doping using homologous and autologous transfusions. The Science and Industry Against Blood doping research consortium approached Dr Nelson at RPAH to determine if a test could be developed to detect recent blood transfusions. A grant was provided by the US Anti-Doping Agency to develop a flow cytometric assay which detects the expression of a panel of minor blood group antigens. Most blood bank reagents are IgM and are not satisfactory as they cause aggregation. A series of IgG polyclonal antibodies were sourced and the optimal titre of each antibody to detect minor negative and positive red cell populations in in vitro mixtures was determined. The test was validated by four Sydney flow cytometry laboratories who tested unknown samples in a proficiency exercise. In April 2004, IOC, WADA and ATHOC agreed to introduce the test into the Athens laboratory in time for the 2004 Olympics with assistance from RPAH. From May till August, RPAH sourced suitable antibodies, performed antibody titrations, provided a standard operating procedure, consulted daily with both the Athens lab and the Anti-doping lab in Lausanne and conducted a series of 3 Proficiency Testing exercises for both labs. No false positives were found in 254 antibody/sample test combinations. The Athens lab used a panel which included antibodies to C, c, E, Jka, Jkb, Fyb, Fyb, M, N and S. Reagents for anti s, K and e were also provided by RPAH. Two weeks before the Games, the lab personnel moved into the IOC Athens Testing lab. A total of 350 endurance athletes were tested. This included placegetters plus randomly selected competitors.

AB  - The regulation of blood, blood product, tissue and gene technology therapies are viewed as critical to protecting the health of Australians. In response to the growing community concerns regarding the ethics, quality and safety of tissue and biological therapy products, the Australian Health Ministers Council, in 2002, recommended the development and introduction of a regulatory framework for tissues and emerging biological therapies. The proposal for tissues and emerging biological therapies parallels the regulation of blood and blood components introduced by the TGA in 2000 following similar ministerial recommendations, policy development and consultation A comprehensive system for the regulation of cellular and tissue based therapies within a proposed trans Tasman framework will be characterised by the following principles: ??All therapeutic products definable as cellular and tissue therapies, including cell-based gene therapy products, will be overseen by the system ??The level of regulation will be classified according to the risks posed by the therapies to the individual and the community. ??The classification system will align regulation of therapies to: ??standards ??standards and GMP ??standards, GMP and pre-market evaluation according to the level of risk. ??All facilities responsible for the manufacture and supply of cellular and tissue based products will be required to register their organisation with the TGA.

AB  - Aim To identify the medical officers responsible for blood transfusion therapy across the ACT. Method? Medical records of patients having transfusions were audited in one tertiary referral hospital, one general hospital and one associated private hospital as part of a quality improvement project. The clinical status patients, reasons for transfusion and laboratory data were extracted and the appropriateness of transfusion was assessed independently by two of the authors. Differences were resolved by consensus. The prescriber was also identified where possible, defined as the most senior clinician recorded in the medical record involved in the decision to transfuse. Result? The prescriber could be determined in 78% of transfusion episodes. In the majority of cases the decision to transfuse was attributed to specialist staff, in all hospitals. Registrars at the tertiary hospital prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (12%) than specialists (18.1%, p?<?0.05). This was not found at the smaller public hospital. After hours resident and registrar staff prescribed significantly fewer inappropriate transfusions (3%) than other prescribers across the Territory (18.7%, p?<?0.005). Conclusion? Medical practitioners with varying levels of experience make medical decisions in hospitals. Who is responsible for these decisions has not been well studied. Our findings demonstrate specialist involvement in the majority of transfusion decisions. The results favour a ?top down? approach to quality improvement in transfusion, rather than targeting junior medical officers. The findings also have significant implications in understanding the dynamics of clinical decision making in the hospital setting and for the targeting of other quality improvement strategies.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate the Baxter ?Blood in Motion? temperature controlled system for transportation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) by the blood bank at St Vincent?s Hospital Melbourne. The trial incorporates transport of RBCs between the blood bank and theatre within St Vincent?s, and between St Vincent?s blood bank and blood banks within peripheral laboratories. Interest in this system arose in response to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and ARCBS amendments to packing of RBCs for transport effective 1st January 2004. According to the MOU, RBCs must be transported in a system which maintains a temperature range of 2?10 degrees Celcius. Method? RBCs were transported between the blood bank and theatre in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements on 11 occasions [N(t)?=?11]. RBCs were transported between St Vincent?s blood bank and Werribee Mercy Hospital blood bank in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements contained within a ?Blood in Motion? silver bag on 6 occasions [N(w)?=?6]. An acceptable outcome resulted if the temperature displayed on the LCD thermometer inside the system was within range of 2?10 degrees Celcius on arrival at destination. Result? An acceptable outcome was achieved in 100% of transport episodes to date. Further data will be collected and evaluated. Conclusion? The Baxter ?Blood in Motion? transport system is a viable alternative to the ARCBS packing system for transport of RBCs (and facilitates compliance with the proposed ARCBS MOU). This system would ensure maintenance of RBC quality and safety during transport by St Vincent?s blood bank and minimise wastage of RBCs.
