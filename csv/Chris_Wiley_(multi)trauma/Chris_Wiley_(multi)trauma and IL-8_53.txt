AB  - Factor XIII (FXIII) is the last enzyme in the clotting cascade. Its main function is to convert the loose fibrin polymer into a firm, cross-linked structure. FXIII inhibitor is a rare condition, in which three different types of inhibitors have been described usually due to IgG antibodies. We describe two male patients with acquired FXIII deficiency (age; 73 and 69?years), who had a history of significant bleeding. Functional assay using the acetic acid/urea clot solubility test showed residual FXIII levels between 1?2%. Molecular studies by PCR and DNA sequencing excluded an inherited FXIII deficiency. In addition, we demonstrated an inhibitor pattern for FXIII by in vitro mixing studies with both purified FXIII (Fibrogammin, Aventis Behring) and cryoprecipitates as sources of FXIII. Transglutaminase assay of FXIII (Dade Behring) was normal for both patients, consistent with a type III FXIII inhibitor, which believed to be directed against the activated FXIII-fibrin complex. Both patients showed transient correction of clot solubility to normal after infusion of high doses of Fibrogammin. In view of previous reports describing FXIII inhibitors of the IgG class, we attempted a novel treatment with rituximab (chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, Roche) to interfere with production of the inhibitor. However, neither patient showed correction of FXIII activity as measured by clot solubility tests during and up to 2 weeks after therapy. Preliminary results suggest that high dose Fibrogammin is required to correct FXIII deficiency due to an acquired type III inhibitor. The role of rituximab or other immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation.

AB  - Aim? Review of four failures of refrigeration facilities in Victorian institutional blood banks reported to ARCBS in the first 4?months of 2004. These incidents at both public and private institutions, in metropolitan and regional settings, resulted in loss of 148 units of red cells, 7 vials of RhD Ig and 2 bottles of Albumex. Incidents were investigated and root causes identified by initial phone interview and visits to blood bank storage facilities. Result? Case 1: Temperature fell below 0?°C at remote site, alarm was activated at monitoring centre (main lab) but without response. Case 2: Power failure resulted in rise in temperature. Alarm did not activate until power was restored. Alarms were set outside required storage temperatures. Case 3: Circuit failure resulted in loss of power. Alarm was activated, but then switched off and no further action taken. Case 4: Compressor failure resulted in alarm activation. Alarm and monitoring devices were deactivated while repairs carried out. Product was not moved to other storage facilities. These cases all highlight the importance of procedures, training, equipment and maintenance. Conclusion? Losses of precious blood components and products through refrigeration failures are preventable. Vital improvements should include commissioning refrigeration equipment that meets AS 3864, protocol development and staff training in use of procedures to be followed when out of temperature events occur, and performance of regular preventative maintenance, calibration and testing of storage and monitoring equipment. ARCBS can work with institutional blood banks to improve storage and management of blood.

AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - The aim of this project was to identify potential protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions in stored red cell concentrates. Previously, research into protein mediators of adverse transfusion reactions has focussed on specific proteins, such as cytokines. In this study, a global approach was taken which involved two-dimensional electrophoresis based Proteomics, which has the potential to uncover previously unrecognised mediators or novel proteins. Red cell products with and without pre-storage leukoreduction (each n?=?6) were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. Supernatant samples were taken at several time points until product expiry. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and those that accumulated in the supernatant were selected for identification by mass spectrometry. The protein profile of supernatant from leukoreduced red cell products was less complex compared to non-leukoreduced products (from 4.4 fold fewer proteins at day 1 to 1.6 fold fewer at day 43). Several proteins were observed to be predominantly present in leukoreduced products which may potentially be beneficial to red cell survival. These proteins were identified as being involved in the maintenance of a stable extracellular environment. Conversely, a number of proteins, which may have detrimental effects, were predominantly expressed in non-leukoreduced products. These proteins included a neutrophil chemoattractant (activator) and a potential acute-phase reactant. A number of proteins identified by mass spectrometry were matched to theoretical proteins of unknown function. The findings confirm the usefulness of Proteomics to investigate storage effects on blood products. The clinical relevance of these proteins is the focus of our future investigations.

AB  - Abstract One of the most overlooked of all serious complications of diabetes is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. There is now clear evidence that suggests activation of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic patients and that these correlate with abnormalities in sympathovagal balance. Dysfunction of the autonomic system predicts cardiovascular risk and sudden death in patients with type 2 diabetes. It also occurs in prediabetes, providing opportunities for early intervention. Simple tests that can be carried out at the bedside with real-time output of information ? within the scope of the practicing physician ? facilitate diagnosis and allow the application of sound strategies for management. The window of opportunity for aggressive control of all the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular events or sudden death with intensification of therapy is with short duration diabetes, the absence of cardiovascular disease and a history of severe hypoglycemic events. To this list we can now add autonomic dysfunction and neuropathy, which have become the most powerful predictors of risk for mortality. It seems prudent that practitioners should be encouraged to become familiar with this information and apply risk stratification in clinical practice. Several agents have become available for the correction of functional defects in the autonomic nervous system, and restoration of autonomic balance is now possible.

AB  - Born at the dawn of the 20th Century, Transfusion Medicine has seen tremendous progress and technical achievement during the last 100?years. As the pace of change increases, the prospects for the future are even brighter. This lecture will review the recent past developments and provide conjecture on future advances in each of the following areas: blood donor services, infectious hazards, non-infectious hazards, process risk, diagnostics and therapeutics. Expectations of what may occur by 2010 and 2015 will be presented. Emerging technologies such as gene array and radio-frequency identification are likely to produce advances in the safety of blood transfusion therapy. More into the future, nanotechnology may re-invent the indications for blood therapies. The field of new therapeutics should be the fastest growing area and the lecture will highlight recent advances in drug development and molecular therapeutics as well as highlight coming technology such as robotic surgery. The therapeutic promise offered by nuclear transfer technology and its impact on cellular therapies will be addressed. With these new opportunities come new challenges and the lecture concludes with an impassioned reminder of the real challenges that await us.

AB  - Australian Rh(D) Immunoglobulin is produced by CSL Bioplasma using plasma containing anti-D collected by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) from Australian voluntary blood donors. The ARCBS Rh Project was established, initially in New South Wales in 1967, with an aim of providing an adequate supply of Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin. In 1999, the NHMRC ?Guidelines on the prophylactic use of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin (Anti-D) in obstetrics? stated that universal prophylaxis with Rh(D) Immunoglobulin to RhD negative women with no preformed anti-D antibodies at 28 and 34 weeks gestation is generally regarded as best practice. With the availablity of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin at that time, the NHMRC recommended a phased implementation commencing with all Rh(D) negative primigravidae with no preformed anti-D antibodies (Phase 1). Phase 1 commenced in late 2002. The NHMRC recommemnded that full antenatal prophylaxis (phase 2) would be implemented when domestic supplies of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin increased sufficiently to cover the increased demand. The ARCBS plays an integral part in the implementation of universal antenatal prophylaxis by being the supplier of plasma containing anti-D for production and as the distributor of the final Rh(D) Immunoglobulin product. In 1999, the ARCBS supplied an average of 15???106?IU of anti-D per month to CSL Bioplasma. Implementation of phase 1 occurred following the introduction of two new products; the Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin 250?IU dose for first trimester indications and the temporary importation of WinRho SDFTM for postnatal use. Implementation of phase 2 and 3 requires the ARCBS to increase the amount of anti-D collected to an average of 30???106?IU and 45???106?IU per month, respectively. Phase 3 of the program is full antenatal prophylaxis supported entirely by domestic product. In 2002, additional funding was allocated to the ARCBS Rh Project to implement strategies to ensure that the input targets for phase 2 and 3 are achieved. In mid 2004, following months of primary immunisation and boosting of both new and existing donors, input levels began to consistently meet or exceed 30???106?IU, and planning for phase 2, implementation began. This presentation will give an overview of the strategies used by the ARCBS to increase the volume of anti-D collected from these donors.

AB  - In 1966, Sydney hosted the conference of the International Society of Blood Transfusion. At an Rh Symposium, experts revealed that several countries had conducted trials proving the safety and efficiency of anti-D in preventing Rh Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn. There have been no other major advances in the prevention of this tragic disease since that time. The source of anti-D in Australia is donated by a small group of Rh Project donors, and we depend entirely on them for the precious antibody which prevents Rh Disease. They have given magnificent service and thousands of babies have been saved. The Rh Project donors? contribution over 37?years is remarkable, inspiring and a triumph over disease.

AB  - As a cosmic element Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe. Its presence in the atmosphere and solubility in water makes life on Earth possible. As a human element Oxygen makes up approximately 60% of our body weight and access to too little or too much is fatal. Medically, Oxygen is an essential therapeutic element and its technical delivery has led to the development of blood transfusion, ventilators and intensive care units. The discovery and evolution of our understanding of Oxygen as ?The Molecule that made the World? is a story of genius, serendipity and politics. To the haematologist and transfusionist Oxygen?s relationship to the red cell and the haemoglobin molecule is a constant source of amazement and fascination. The red cell, the only cell in the body that is not dependent on Oxygen for energy production, has, in conjunction with the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the awesome responsibility of delivery adequate amounts of Oxygen to every cell in the body 24 hours a day 7?days a week. Haemoglobin, probably the most studied molecular in biology, has been pivotal in the broader understanding of molecular structure and function and continues to reveal it?s secrets. Oxygen, as an economic element is essential to industry and as an environmental element is closely linked to conservation of planet Earth. Many sports have a close and frequently dubious interest in enhancing delivery of oxygen to the muscles. On the basis of doubtful people who feel the need are increasingly being enticed to ?Flood their bodies with Oxygen as therapy against our polluted World?. It is the presenter?s aim that this lecture will illustrate the paramount role of Oxygen to our existence and it?s central importance in the history of medicine, and blood transfusion in particular.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - On behalf of the ?Blood Matters? Planning Group. The Blood Matters Collaborative was structured around a series of specific projects designed to improve distinct aspects of the sequence of care processes that ultimately determine the safety of each and every fresh blood product (red cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) transfusion. These commence with the appropriateness of the clinical decision to transfuse blood products, then move to ensure that procedures for patient, sample and blood product identification and blood administration are robust and that any procedural errors and adverse events associated with transfusion are captured, analysed and acted upon. Finally and very importantly the collaborative sought to improve the patient and carers understanding of the risks and benefits of transfusion. It was an ambitious program of work but there seemed little alternative other than addressing all of the interdependent processes that determine the quality and safety of transfusion. All elements in this chain contribute to the actual levels of transfusion safety. With support from the Clinical Innovation Agency and planning group members, local multi-disciplinary hospital teams set out to deliver changes to improve transfusion safety. The collaborative methodology, initially developed by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in the United States of America, has been adopted and used by a large number of health systems internationally and within Australia. It is based on answering three key questions [Q1. What are we trying to accomplish? Q2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? Q3. What changes can we make that will result in improvement?] and testing ideas through the plan, do, study, act cycles of change. Individual projects monitored progress using ?run charts? to record their measured performance. These indicated progress towards achieving locally set targets and collaborative improvement goals. Our objectives were translated into tangible benefits for patients requiring blood product transfusion. Fundamental to the collaborative approach to improving transfusion practice is the belief that changes can be tested rapidly on a small scale without risk. For example, an idea can quickly be tried with one patient, one clinic or ward, a single consultant or hospital. Only if it proved successful was it suggested for wider adoption as an improvement in care across an entire Health Service or system of care. Our successes reinforced the value of using a systematic method for translating ideas into practice such as that used by the collaborative. The governance structures and teams established during our participation in the collaborative have helped us to identify key local issues and implement strategies to enhance the quality of our transfusion services to our patients. Our aim is to ensure that the continued review and improvement of transfusion practices becomes an integral part of the way that clinical teams and hospital and health system clinical governance structures work. The role of state or national bodies is to support this to happen. We hope to build a series of improvement partnerships that all focus on optimising the quality of transfusion services and the outcomes of patients receiving transfusion during their clinical care.

AB  - Removing, inactivating or detecting pathogens in platelet units are panaceas that some expect to revolutionize transfusion support for patients. Opting for transfusion without concern for the presence of pathogens may not be such a simple decision, however. The effect of pathogen reduction treatment may reduce platelet number and/or function. Clinical trials have documented that treated platelets provide effective hemostatic support for thrombocytopenic patients. However, platelets may need to be transfused in greater quantity, and thus the treatment technique may create a greater demand for the production of platelets through the supply system. Toxicologic concerns about the treatments must be addressed to ensure that there is net benefit for patients. Testing reported to date suggests that any residual compounds are at concentrations far below that associated with detectable toxicity, but the concept of transfusing a component containing even minute amounts of toxic substances may be unsettling to some. Detecting bacteria may remove the largest remaining infectious threat in platelet units and would leave platelets undamaged to function normally. This opens the option for extending the storage period of platelet units, but any extension of storage would be expected to be associated with a decrease in recovery and survival. To avoid continuing decrements with each proposed change in processing or storage, a new standard for efficacy has been proposed that would compare the recovery and survival of the platelet component to fresh platelets from the same donor. This standard appears useful and applicable in ensuring safe and efficacious platelets for transfusion. The question remains: Which direction is best for platelet recipients?

AB  - Aim? To review the operation of an Emergency Donor Panel in an isolated Australian community. Result? The Panel has been in operation for 4?years. Two donors have been rejected, one due to development of cancer and one due to biological false positive hepatitis C serology. Thirty five donors remain active on the panel. No donors have sero-converted for transmissable disease during the operation of the panel. The panel has been activated on 3 occasions, all for surgical bleeding, resulting in blood transfused within 40 minutes of activation in all cases. Two cases were for bleeding associated with ruptured AAA and one for bleeding associated with gangrenous bowel. Conclusion? A properly designed and monitored Emergency Donor Panel can safely supply blood for transfusion in the event of depletion of local stores. The EDP should be activated after 10 units of stored blood have been transfused into a patient undergoing massive bleeding from a correctible source, or in association with the hospital?s Disaster Plan.

AB  - In the late 1960s clinical trials showed that the incidence of Rh D immunisation of Rh negative women could be dramatically reduced by the administration of Rh D immunoglobulin (Ig) after delivery. In 1968 Australia became the first country to be self sufficient in Rh?D?Ig with the introduction of the Rh programme. Despite appropriate use of Rh?D?Ig 1?2% of Rh negative women still became immunised. Studies subsequently showed that immunisation rates could be further reduced by prophylactic administration of Rh?D?Ig during pregnancy. Routine antenatal prophylaxis has been practiced in Canada and USA for more than 20?years. The first NHMRC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the use of Rh?D?Ig were issued in 1999. These acknowledged that routine antenatal prophylaxis was best practice, however could not be recommended due to supply constraints. Subsequent initiatives included the licensing of the 250?IU dose of Rh?D?Ig, expansion of plasma collection and importation of product. Staged introduction of routine antenatal prophylaxis began in late 2002 with introduction of prophylaxis for primigravidae. Stage 2, which provides antenatal prophylaxis for all Rh?D?negative women, is to be implemented by 1 January 2005. Stage 3 will see cessation of the need for use of imported product. A Joint Consultative Committee of involved specialties is helping to ensure consultation and communication for the implementation process. The possibility of developing a laboratory Rh?D?Ig which could be produced in unlimited quantities, in a standardised formulation with no reliance on human derived sources has been entertained for many years. Results of trials of possible options have been intermittently published. However, it is likely that the ?liquid gold? anti D plasma donated by our amazing volunteers will be needed for many years to come.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the nutrition support in critically ill patients. The negative acute phase proteins are albumin and transferrin. Their serum concentrations fall immediately after the injury, in proportion to its severity. They are used to monitor the nutritional status of acutely ill patients. Areas of intense clinical investigation in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may eventually be shown to be of great value are cancer patients in general, sepsis and trauma, and general perioperative support to prevent or correct malnutrition. Although protein restriction was historically used to reduce risk from hepatic encephalopathy, such a strategy may worsen nutrition status, decrease lean muscle mass, and ironically lead to less ammonia removal. Many interacting biologic and clinical factors are responsible for the development of malnutrition in critically ill and injured hospitalized patients and also the hypercatabolic states associated with trauma, sepsis, cancer, and surgical interventions.
