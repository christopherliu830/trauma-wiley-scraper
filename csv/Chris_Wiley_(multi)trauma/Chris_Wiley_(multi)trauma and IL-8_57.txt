AB  - Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreas by an autoimmune response. Due to ethical and practical difficulties, the features of the destructive process are known from a small number of observations, and transcriptomic data are remarkably missing. Here we report whole genome transcript analysis validated by quantitative reverse transcription?polymerase chain reaction (qRT?PCR) and correlated with immunohistological observations for four T1D pancreases (collected 5 days, 9 months, 8 and 10 years after diagnosis) and for purified islets from two of them. Collectively, the expression profile of immune response and inflammatory genes confirmed the current views on the immunopathogenesis of diabetes and showed similarities with other autoimmune diseases; for example, an interferon signature was detected. The data also supported the concept that the autoimmune process is maintained and balanced partially by regeneration and regulatory pathway activation, e.g. non-classical class I human leucocyte antigen and leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily B1 (LILRB1). Changes in gene expression in islets were confined mainly to endocrine and neural genes, some of which are T1D autoantigens. By contrast, these islets showed only a few overexpressed immune system genes, among which bioinformatic analysis pointed to chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) (CXCR4) chemokine pathway activation. Remarkably, the expression of genes of innate immunity, complement, chemokines, immunoglobulin and regeneration genes was maintained or even increased in the long-standing cases. Transcriptomic data favour the view that T1D is caused by a chronic inflammatory process with a strong participation of innate immunity that progresses in spite of the regulatory and regenerative mechanisms.

AB  - Within the last decade, research regarding the human gut microbiome has exploded. While the gastrointestinal tract was once regarded simply as a digestive organ, new technologies have led the science world to wonder about the impact that the gut microbiota may have on human health and disease. The gut microbiome is now becoming known for its role in metabolism, immune defense, and behavior. From in utero variations to those that rapidly occur post partum, our gut microbiome changes with age, environment, stress, diet, and health status as well as medication exposure. This article reviews what is currently known regarding various influences on the gut microbiome and is meant to encourage the reader to further explore the unknown.

AB  - Summary Autoimmune skin diseases are complex processes in which autoreactive cells must navigate through the skin tissue to find their targets. Regulatory T cells in the skin help to mitigate autoimmune inflammation and may in fact be responsible for the patchy nature of these conditions. In this review, we will discuss chemokines that are important for global recruitment of T cell populations to the skin during disease, as well as signals that fine-tune their localization and function. We will describe prototypical disease responses and chemokine families that mediate these responses. Lastly, we will include an overview of chemokine-targeting drugs that have been tested as new treatment strategies for autoimmune skin diseases.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, haemophilia management has continually evolved, with prophylaxis now considered the treatment of choice. Prophylaxis primarily seeks to prevent bleeding and haemarthrosis episodes from occurring and avert the otherwise inevitable haemophilic arthropathy. Yet, numerous unanswered issues remain. These concern dose levels, dosing intervals, ways of integrating variability in bleeding phenotype, patient age, joint status, lifestyle, physical activity, treatment adherence and individual responses to FVIII or FIX concentrates. Individualized prophylaxis may thus be paramount. One crucial tool that may allow more accurate prophylaxis regimens to be implemented is the individual pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Therefore, physicians in charge of managing those living with haemophilia must be comfortable with PK profiling in order to be in a position to tailor patients? treatment, taking into account PK data, while minimizing patients? inconvenience, discomfort, as well as, possibly, treatment costs. For optimization of prophylaxis, recent development of recombinant molecules with more attractive PK properties, such as prolonged elimination half-life, increases the choice of dosing regimens, enabling decreased frequency of dosing for some, if deemed appropriate. For each patient, PK parameters can be determined, including trough levels, AUC, and time spent under a predefined threshold, with additional pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters possibly established by means of a global coagulation test like the thrombin generation test. Most importantly, target PK/PD parameters will need to consider clinical variables like patient age, body weight, joint status, treatment adherence, number of bleeding episodes, activity index or lifestyle.
