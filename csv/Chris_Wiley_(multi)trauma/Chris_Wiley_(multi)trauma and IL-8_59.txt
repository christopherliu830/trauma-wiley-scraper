AB  - Purpose:?? The multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) has been widely adopted as standard of care for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there is little evidence to support the MDM, and individual clinician attitudes have not been studied. Methods:?? Clinicians involved in patients with CRC patients completed a questionnaire. The study was conducted in 2008 at 5 institutions, including MDM naïve (NG) and experienced groups (EG), with repetition in 6?months. The impact of the MDM was prospectively studied at a hospital from 7/7/08 to 22/12/08. The initial plan and the final consensus were recorded. Results:?? 22 clinicians completed the survey. The clinicians in the NG stated that there was an influence of MDM on routine patient management in 40% of patients. After 6?months, in both the EG and the NG, the MDM was felt to have an impact on the patients? management in >70% of cases (p = 0.16). 115 cases (91 patients) were discussed at the MDM. The median age was 65?years (range 26 to 101) with 48% males. The locations were colonic 53 (46%), rectum 40 (35%), anus 6 (5%) and other 16 (14%). 80 (69%) were discussed at the time of initial diagnosis. In 79 (69%) the main issue was chemotherapy and/or radiation administration. In 17 (52%) patients it was decided that further investigations were required. There was an impact on the management in 33 (29%) patients. A change in treatment intent occurred, either curative or palliative, in 5 (15%) patients. Conclusion:?? Clinicians involved in an MDM believe that this influences management in majority of patients with impact on management of almost a third of patients discussed. The multidisciplinary meeting is valuable in the treatment of colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - Purpose:?? Significant pain and discomfort are reported by a proportion of patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids. Several nerve blocks have been trialled with varied results. The aim of this study was to determine whether an anal intersphincteric nerve block may reduce post-operative pain and analgesic requirements in these patients. Methodology:?? One hundred sequential patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids were randomised to either an anal intersphincteric nerve block using 0.5% Marcaine with adrenaline or to the control group. The procedures were performed by a single surgeon using the KilRoid (TM) rubber band ligator (Astratech ? Sweden). Patients were assessed for pain and analgesic use in the immediate post operative period and at 24?hours. Both the patient and data collector were blinded to whether a nerve block had been administered. Results:?? There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in median post operative pain (3.0 vs. 2.0 p > 0.0.29), median post operative analgesic use (1.6 vs. 3.3 p = 0.62), median pain score at 24 hour (4.14 vs. 4.22 p = 0.9) and median analgesic use at 24 hours (1.0 vs. 1.0 p = 0.13). Conclusions:?? There is no benefit from performing an intersphincteric nerve block in patients undergoing rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programmes have demonstrated significant reduction in hospital stay for patient undergoing colonic surgery, however their impact on long term outcomes such as Post Operative Fatigue (POF) has not been fully established. Aim: To assess the impact of an ERAS programme on POF and recovery following elective open colonic surgery. Method:?? In a prospective study, 26 consecutive patients undergoing open colonic surgery under a conventional care plan were compared to 26 consecutive patients in an ERAS programme. Results:?? Demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable at baseline. The median duration of total hospital-stay (4 v 7?days p < 0.001), rates of urinary-tract infections (p = 0.028) and ileus (p = 0.042) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Postoperatively, POF significantly increased in both groups. However peak POF score was significantly lower in the ERAS group (p = 0.001). In the first 30?days after surgery, Fatigue Consequence scores were also significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Overall, the total fatigue experience (p = 0.035) and the total fatigue impact (p = 0.005) were significantly smaller in the ERAS group. Conclusion:?? The impact of ERAS programmes may extend beyond the commonly reported short term outcomes and ERAS may accelerate overall recovery and return to normal function.

AB  - Purpose:?? The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge relating to risk factors, tumorigenesis and survival of patients with metachronous colorectal cancer to address potential advances in surveillance and management of patients with colorectal cancer. Methodology:?? The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and Ovid databases were searched from 1966 to December 2008 for both published reviews and published articles on metachronous colorectal cancer regarding incidence, carcinoma sequence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, detection, treatment, surveillance and survival. Further articles were obtained by a manual review of the reference lists of all retrieved articles. All publications relevant to this study were included. Results:?? Factors likely to increase the risk of developing metachronous colorectal cancer include; age, personal and family history of multiple malignancies, synchronous polyps, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and microsatellite instability. Conclusion:?? Pre-operative colonoscopic polyp status and biopsy analysis regarding microsatellite instability are essential in identifying patients at risk of metachronous colorectal cancer. A rapid adenoma-carcinoma sequence less than the accepted 2 to 5?years would warrant stringent colonoscopic surveillance. Thus, frequent colonoscopic surveillance is recommended, within the first 5?years post-operatively, for the detection of metachronous colorectal cancer.

AB  - Introduction:?? Post-operative fatigue (POF) is an important indicator of recovery after major surgery. Recent data have suggested a relationship between the post-operative peritoneal cytokine response and development of POF. Glucocorticoids decrease the production of cytokines and thus we hypothesised that administration of dexamethasone to patients undergoing colonic surgery may decrease peritoneal cytokine production and POF. Aim:?? To assess the influence of 8?mg of pre-op IV Dexamethasone on peritoneal cytokine and POF in patients undergoing elective colonic surgery. Method: In a double blinded RCT, 70 consecutive patients undergoing elective, open colonic resection were administered 8?mg I.V. Dexamethasone or saline (Placebo) prior to surgery. All patients were treated within a structured Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program. Results:?? After exclusions there were 31 patients in the Placebo group and 29 in the Dex group. At baseline there were no differences in the age, ASA, BMI or CR-POSSUM scores. Dexamethasone was associated with a significant reduction in Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-13 in the peritoneum and IL-6 and IL-8 in plasma. Subsequently, patients in the Dex group had lesser POF and fatigue impact scores at days 3 and 7. Patients in the Dex group had less post-op nausea and vomiting. There was no significant increase in complications. Conclusion:?? Preoperative Dexamethasone administration is associated with a significantly diminished post-operative pro-inflammatory reaction which is associated with clinical benefits in POF and its impact. This intervention may be an effective method of improving outcomes for patients undergoing major colonic surgery within a multimodal enhanced peri-operative care pathway.

AB  - Purpose:?? Colonic inertia (CI) may co-exist with obstructed defaecation (OD). It is unclear if it adversely influences the results of surgery for OD. We aimed to compare the functional results of laparoscopic anterior rectopexy (LAR) for OD secondary to high-grade internal rectal prolapse (IRP) in those with normal colonic transit (NCT) and CI. Methodology:?? Patients with high-grade (recto-anal) IRP were evaluated with defaecating proctography and colonic transit study. Colonic transit time (CTT) (hours) was calculated by the number of pellets remaining in the colon and rectum at 7?days ? 2.4. Patients were offered surgery for significant symptoms if they failed a program of conservative management. Constipation was prospectively assessed pre-op and at 3?months using Wexner constipation scores. Results:?? 80 patients (93% female) underwent LAR for OD and IRP. Patients with NCT gave less history of stool infrequency currently (10% versus 32%) and in their 20's (17% versus 71%). 61 patients had normal colonic transit (CTT median 17, range 0?48 hours) and 19 had CI (CTT median 79, range 50?154 hours, p < 0.0001). Overall symptom improvement at 3?months was similar for NCT and CI (84% versus 84%, p = 0.97). Rates of total (50% versus 68%, p = 0.19) and partial (34% versus 16%, p = 0.16) symptom improvement were similar. Improvement in Wexner constipation score was similar for NCT (mean pre-op 13 to post-op 5) and CI (14 to 5), (p = 0.34). Conclusions:?? In the short term, colonic inertia has no adverse impact and may be disregarded when considering laparoscopic anterior rectopexy for obstructed defaecation and high-grade internal rectal prolapse.

AB  - Purpose:?? Slow transit constipation (STC) is a debilitating condition mainly affecting young women. Total colectomy (TC) is an option for patients with severe symptoms who are unresponsive to conservative measures. Open TC has been the procedure of choice but is associated with long term SBO and ongoing symptoms. It is difficult to determine if these ongoing symptoms are related to gut dysmotility or to post operative adhesions. Laparoscopic TC appears equivalent open TC with the advantage of being able to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy at a later stage to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause of chronic obstructive symptoms or pain. Methods:?? All consecutive patients undergoing a laparoscopic TC ± rectopexy for STC from 1991?2007 were reviewed. Results:?? 84 patients (81 female, 3 male) were included. Average operating time was 188 min, average LOS 8?days. Conversion rate was 1.2%. There were no post op mortalities. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 2.4%, pelvic collections in 2.4%, intra-abdominal bleeds in 4.7% and 3.5% developed wound infections. Bowel frequency was significantly improved however, 31% had at least 1 episode of obstructive symptoms. Ongoing pain was experienced by 38%. 57% underwent a further procedure a majority of which was a laparoscopy ± division of adhesions. Conclusion:?? Lap TC is a feasible and acceptable option for patients with STC with reasonable operating times, low conversion rates and acceptable mortality and morbidity. Bowel frequency is significantly improved however long term chronic pain and SBO are common. Lap TC allows for a minimally invasive laparoscopy to be performed to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause for obstructive symptoms or ongoing pain.

AB  - Purpose:?? The aim of this study is to make an objective assessment of whether multidisciplinary meetings (MDM) improve the management of patients requiring surgery for colorectal cancer as this has never been examined. Methodology:?? This retrospective study analyzed patients from the Geelong Hospital mandatory Colorectal Database between 1/1/2006 and 31/12/2007. MDM were implemented on 3/10/2006. To be included in the study patients had to have had an operation for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Each patient's management was determined to have conformed, or not conformed, to meet the best practice guidelines according to the 2005 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Early Detection and Management of Colorectal Cancer. Those patients who had been discussed in an MDM were compared with those pre-MDM to ascertain if there was any difference in patient treatment. Results:?? 182 patients had surgery for colorectal cancer. In the period where an MDM was available, 46% (53 of 116) patients were discussed in an MDM and all conformed to best practice guidelines. Of the 130 patients where no MDM review occurred, 98.5% conformed to best practice guidelines. This was consistent in both the pre MDM period (98.5%) and MDM available period (98.4%). Conclusion:?? The implementation of MDM at Geelong Hospital has marginally improved management of colorectal cancer. Few clinicians would dispute the benefits of such meetings but where an already high standard of care exists it is difficult to objectively demonstrate these improvements. We support using MDM but look to the less tangible benefits such as improved consistency and coordination of care, communication between health professionals and educational opportunities that MDM provide.

AB  - Purpose:?? Approximately 10% of temporary stomas created after low or ultra low anterior resection for rectal cancer remain unreversed. In this study, we aim to determine the reversal rate at our institution and the reasons for stomas remaining unreversed, especially due to anastomotic leaks. Method:?? A retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer at a single institution between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2007 was performed. Patients with unreversed stomas were identified and their patient files reviewed. Results:?? 230 patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer were considered. 54 of these had low or ultra-low anterior resection and a stoma fashioned. 47 (87%) had their stomas reversed (RS), and 7 (13%) had not (US). The RS group were younger, with 30 (63%) males compared to 6 (86%) in the US group. Not surprisingly, the US group were more likely to have surgical complications (72% vs. 28%, p = 0.022). The reasons for non-reversal were anastomotic leak 2(28%), death 2(28%), metastatic disease 1(14%), medical co-morbidities 1 (14%), and patient refusal 1 (14%). Of the 2 patients with anastomotic leaks, 1 remained unreversed due to development of stricture at the point of anastomosis, while the other was reversed 8?months later (outside the study period). Conclusion:?? When faecal diversion surgery is undertaken in low or ultra low anterior resection for the treatment of rectal cancer, it is usually reversed during a reasonable period of time. Surprisingly, even in our very small set of patients (7) with unreversed stomas, only 2 were unreversed due to anastomotic leaks.

AB  - Purpose:?? Concern about maternal morbidity associated with vaginal delivery (VD) may be driving the increasing trend for elective caesarean section (CS). This study aimed to quantify the risk of morbidity from VD that pregnant women would be prepared to accept before requesting an elective CS, and to compare these views with those of clinicians. Methodology:?? Participants completed a questionnaire to ascertain the maximum level of risk they would be prepared to accept before opting for an elective CS. Utility scores for each complication were calculated, with higher scores (closer to 1) indicating a preference towards VD. Results:?? 122 pregnant women, 84 midwives, 166 obstetricians, 12 urogynaecologists and 79 colorectal surgeons participated. For the evaluated 18 potential complications of VD pregnant women were willing to accept higher risks than clinicians. Pregnant women were least accepting of risks of severe anal incontinence (mean utility score 0.32), emergency CS (0.51), moderate anal incontinence (0.56), severe urinary incontinence (0.56), fourth degree tears (0.59), and third degree tears (0.72) The views of midwives were closest to those of pregnant women. Urogynaecologists and colorectal surgeons were the most risk averse, with 42% and 41% respectively stating they would request an elective CS for themselves or their partners. Conclusions:?? Pregnant women were able to quantify the level of risk they are prepared to accept from a VD before opting for an elective CS being aware of the potential complications of elective CS, and these risks were significantly higher than those accepted by the clinicians involved in their care. Their views are more closely aligned to midwives than to specialist clinicians.

AB  - Purpose:?? Rectal mucosal advancement flaps (RMAF) and fistula plugs (FP) are techniques used to manage complex anal fistulas. The purpose of this study was to review and compare the results of these methods of repair. Methodology:?? A retrospective review of all complex anal fistulas treated, by either a RMAF or a FP, at Auckland City Hospital from 2004 to 2008. Comparisons were made in terms of successful healing rates, time to failure and the use of MRI. Results:?? Overall, 70 operations were performed on 55 patients (55.7% male). The mean age was 44.9?years. 21 patients (30%) had had at least 1 previous unsuccessful repair. Indications for repair included 57 high cryptoglandular anal (81%), 4 Crohn's anal (6%), 7 rectovaginal (10%), 1 rectourethral (1%) and 1 pouch-vaginal fistula (1%). All patients were followed up with a mean of 4.5?months. 48 RMAF's (69% of total) were performed with 16 successful repairs (33%). 22 FP's (31% of total) were performed with 7 successful repairs (32%, p = 0.9). In failed repairs, there was no difference in terms of mean time to failure (RMAF 4.8?months vs. FP 4.1?months, p = 0.62). MRI was performed in 21 patients (37%) before the repair. The success rate in these patients was 20%. Conclusion:?? The results of treatment of complex anal fistulas are disappointing. The choice of operation of either a RMAF or a FP did not alter the poor healing rates of about one third of patients in each group.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cause of cancer deaths in Australia. Some studies recently reported disturbing rates of metachronous colorectal cancer occurring early after curative treatment of the index tumour. Poor bowel preparation and polypectomy during colonoscopy may increase the risk of metachronous cancer, by causing cancerous lesions to be missed and tumour seeding respectively. This study examines these two factors in association with the timing of metachronous recurrence. Methods:?? This is a retrospective audit utilising a database of all patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy at Flinders Medical Centre and Repatriation General Hospital. Patients were identified using the database, with subsequent case note review. Patients with familial disorders or disease recurrence at anastomotic sites within 12?months were excluded. This audit has been approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of both hospitals. Results:?? Colorectal cancers were identified in 569 patients, of whom 15 (2.6%) had metachronous cancers. There were 10 men and 5 women with average age of 74?years. Bowel preparation was categorised as good (7 patients), moderate (1 patient) and poor (1 patient). Quality of bowel preparation was not available for 6 patients (4 had no comments documented and 2 had colonoscopies performed elsewhere). Of the 4 patients who had biopsy of polyps found during the initial colonoscopy, 1 developed metachronous cancer in the same area at 60?months. Conclusion:?? Poor bowel preparation may contribute to missed lesions presenting as early metachronous cancers. Seeding into polypectomy sites does not appear to be a problem.

AB  - Introduction:?? Laparoscopic anterior resection for rectal cancer remains controversial due to the possibility of a positive circumferential margin with the laparoscopic approach. The ?hybrid procedure? has been performed with laparoscopic colonic mobilization but rectal dissection is through a Pfannenstiel incision. Methods:?? Data from a prospective single institution rectal cancer database was used to compare hybrid, converted and open anterior resections for mid and low rectal cancer from February 2003 to August 2008. Results:?? There were 253 patients found. There were 66 (26%) hybrid (H), 5 (2%) converted (C) and 182 (72%) open (O) cases. The median follow up all 3 groups was similar. 30 (h), 28 (C), 34 (O)?months. The median length of stay (days) was shorter in the (H) group. [6.5 (H), 10 (C), 9 (O), p = 0.001. There was a trend to a higher ASA score, age, median BMI, more wound infections and higher stage in the (O) group. The circumferential margin was involved in 6 (O) group compared with 0 in H) or (C) group (p = 0.5). There were no significant differences in local recurrences [1.1% (O) vs. 1.5% (H&C)] or T stage. There was no difference in neoadjuvant radiation, (48 (26%) (O), 20 (30%) (H), 1 (20%), p = 0.9. The median lymph node count was 11 in each group. The 2?year overall survival was the same both groups, 90% (H), 89% (O) 100% (C) (p = 0.65) as was the progression free survival 76% (H), 64%(O), 80% (C), (p = 0.32). Conclusion:?? The hybrid procedure results in improved short term outcomes for patients with rectal cancer compared to open cases. The hybrid approach did not compromise circumferential margins or lymph node yield, and has no effect in short term progression free or overall survival.

AB  - Introduction:?? A positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) is associated with local recurrence and poor oncological outcome. Studies highlight that positive CRMs occurs more often following abdominoperineal excisions (APER), compared to anterior resections (AR). However a bias towards performing APERs in patients with locally advanced tumours, or down staging prior to sphincter preserving surgery may underlie the difference. Aims:?? Determine (1) positive CRM rates following APER and low ARs (2) if pre-operative decision making accounts for the difference. Methods:?? The last 100 low AR and 100 APERs within our unit were reviewed. Data collected included 1) Tumour distance from the anal verge, 2) Pre-operative staging (CT / MRI) (Early stage cancers T1-2N0, Intermediate stage ? T3N0-1, and Advanced stage ? CRM threatened by tumour or involved nodes) 3) Neo-adjuvant therapy use 4) positive CRMs. Results:?? One hundred Low AR were performed Between Jan 2008 ? June 2004, while 100 APER were performed between Jan 2008 ? Jan 2003. Average tumour distance from anal verge: APERs 3.4?cm vs. AR 5.2?cm. There was no significant difference in the pre-operative stage (Early 28 vs. 27, Intermediate 51 vs. 58, and advanced 21 vs. 15), or the use of chemo-radiotherapy (APER 9 vs. AR 13). There was a significant increase in CRMs in the APER group 15 vs. 7. Conclusion:?? A positive CRM occurred twice as often following APERs vs. low AR. This difference could not be accounted for by early cancers undergoing AR, or the use of down staging chemo-radiotherapy.

AB  - Purpose:?? Faecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent and important multifactorial condition. Neuromodulation via implanted sacral nerve stimulators is efficacious, but as with other invasive treatment modalities is expensive and associated with significant complications. Peripheral neuromodulation of sacral nerve roots via posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is effective in urinary incontinence, but there is minimal evidence for its use in FI. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of PTNS in FI. Methodology:?? 12 patients with FI of various causes (8 idiopathic, 3 obstetric, 1 previous anorectal surgery) underwent PTNS at a UK hospital. All were investigated with colonic imaging, anorectal physiological studies and endoanal ultrasound. Prior treatments comprised physiotherapy (12), sphincter repairs (3 biofeedback (3) and implants (1). PTNS was performed for 30 minutes, weekly for 12?weeks. Outcome measures were episodes of incontinence, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Rockwood Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life score. Results:?? Mean monthly episodes of incontinence of wind, liquid and solid before treatment were 18.77, 21.77 and 22.15 respectively. After 12?weeks? treatment this had reduced to 0.92, 0.83 and 0.83 respectively (p < 0.05). Sphincter integrity, physiology and aetiology were not shown to affect efficacy. No patient's incontinence worsened. Non-significant improvements in Anxiety and Depression and quality of life scores were also seen. Conclusions:?? This is the first UK study to demonstrate PTNS as a potentially efficacious and minimally invasive alternative treatment modality for faecal incontinence. These early results are encouraging, but we await medium and long term follow up.

AB  - Recently, in Australasia, a plea to screen all young patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for Lynch syndrome has been advanced1. Since 2001 the three public hospitals in Auckland have had the policy of undertaking immunohistochemical (IHC) testing on the tumours of patients aged 50?years and under to detect loss of expression (LOE) of protein products for the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Purpose:?? To determine (1) the completeness of patient capture, (2) the incidence of LOE by IHC of the 4 gene proteins, and (3) to correlate IHC results with those of subsequent genetic testing for the corresponding germline mutations. Methodology:?? Retrospective review of the prospectively gathered clinical, pathological, and genetic records of all patients diagnosed with CRC aged 50?years and below between January 2001 and December 2007. Results:?? 244 patients aged 50?years or below with CRC were diagnosed in this period. 212 (86.9%) patients? tumours underwent IHC, 147 of which had all 4 gene products studied. 30 (14.2%) tumours had LOE for one or more MMR proteins. 25/30 patients were offered genetic testing of whom 3 declined. So far 8 out of 16 patients tested have a confirmed germline mutation. Only 3/8 patients report a family history of CRC. Conclusion:?? Tumour IHC reveals LOE for one of the four MMR gene proteins in approximately 14% of young patients developing CRC and in half subsequent genetic testing will identify Lynch syndrome. A policy of mandatory testing is confirmed but audit of performance and appropriate referral is required.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - Purpose:?? Preoperative radiotherapy (PRT) reduces the risk of local pelvic recurrence (LR) after rectal cancer surgery but is associated with considerable side-effects. This study aims to identify the LR rate associated with the present MRI based selection criterion for PRT (tumour threatening the fascia propria on MRI) at Auckland City Hospital (ACH), and to assess the likely influence on LR rates of a regimen using a PRT selection criterion based on a 5?mm clearance of the fascia propria. Methodology:?? All patients with rectal cancer treated at ACH from 1997?2005 who had preoperative MRI scans were identified from the National Cancer Registry. Details of demographics, MRI results, treatment and outcome were collated. Long-term outcomes were obtained from digital records, GPs, patient contact and death-certificates. All MRIs were re-reported using the new criterion of 5?mm clearance for the fascia propria. Results:?? There were 126 patients eligible patients, 20 were excluded with lack of MRI or follow-up. 106 patients (mean age 66.5?years, 67% male) were followed-up for a minimum 2?years (med 3?years). Using the present MRI based ACH criteria for PRT 29 (27%) patients were irradiated. Using a 5?mm tumour free margin 80 (75%) of patients would have been offered PRT. Overall 7 (6.6%) patients developed LR, 6 of these did not receive PRT, 4 of these fulfilled the new criterion and only 2 of these patients had a resection with curative intent. Conclusion:?? Selective PRT based on threatened fascia propria involvement on MRI lead to low PRT and LR rates. The use of a 5?mm tumour free lateral margin on MRI would result in three times as many patients receiving PRT and is likely to reduce the local recurrence rate by about 2%.
