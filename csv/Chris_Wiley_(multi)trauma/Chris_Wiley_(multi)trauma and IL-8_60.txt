AB  - Introduction:?? Follow up after curative resection for colorectal cancer has been demonstrated to improve survival and failure to attend (FTA) may compromise patient outcomes. The incidences of FTA and the causes have not been documented. Methods:?? Patients were identified from a prospective clinical database and a hospital based appointment system. FTA follow up was defined as non-attendance of at least one appointment, within 5?years post operatively. A phone interview was used to evaluate the cause. Patients from a non-English speaking background (NESB) were contacted with interpreters. Results:?? From January 2003 to May 2008 622 patients with stage I-III cancer were identified, including 202 from a NESB. 125 non-attendees were identified. 61 patients (70%) were contacted from 87 surviving patients. 26 could not be located and 38 patients were deceased. Of the 61 patients studied, 32(52%) were male. The mean age was 68?years (range 33, 102). 14 patients (23%) were from a NESB. Each non-attendant averaged 16 appointments, and 1.7 failed attendances. A median of > 13?months elapsed from diagnosis to 1st missed appointment. The main reasons for non attendance were: unaware of the appointment (n = 21), inconvenience due to time or travel (n = 14), poor health (n = 10), long waiting times (n = 8), forgetting (n = 6) and other (n = 2). Age, sex and number of booked appointments were not associated with non-attendance. Conclusion:?? Failure to attend follow-up appointments is common. Overall, access to follow up was prevented by structural factors more than disease/patient factors. A common reason for non-attendance was that patients were unaware of the appointment. Opportunities for significantly improving attendance include a reminder system.

AB  - Introduction:?? The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHSBCSP) has been running since September 2006. Its impact on the workload of colorectal units has not currently been assessed. Aims: To determine the initial increased in workload resulting from screen detected cancers detected by the NHSBCSP. Methods:?? Cancers detected by the local NHSBCSP were reviewed with respect to: operative intervention, Dukes? stage, post operative complications, and neo-adjuvant therapy. Results: Between September 2006 to Jan 2008 100 screen detected cancers were identified. Twenty eight were located in the rectum, 38 sigmoid colon, 2 descending colon, 9 transverse colon, 10 ascending colon, and 13 within the caecum. Of the 100 cases 18 were polyp cancers, 3 of which proceed to a subsequent resection, (2 anterior resections and 1 right hemicolectomy). Of the remaining 82 cases 38 patients had an anterior resection, 26 right hemicolectomy, 5 abdominal perineal resection, 3 sigmoid colectomy and 1 subtotal colectomy. Nine patients had no operative intervention; 5 due to metastatic disease and 4 as a result of patient choice. Thirty five patients had Dukes? stage A, 31 Dukes? B, 17 Dukes? C, and 5 Dukes? D. There were 8 major post operative complications: 6 anastomotic leaks, 1 colo-pouch-vaginal fistula, and one death. Two patients who underwent resections for polyp cancers failed to have the polyp scar removed at the time of surgery. Conclusion:?? The local NHS colorectal cancer screening programme has resulted in a significant shift towards Dukes? stage A and B cancers at time of presentation. However it has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of colorectal resections, 76 between September 06 to Jan 2008.

AB  - Purpose:?? We investigated the use of ?Surgisis? anorectal fistula plug in the treatment of anorectal fistula. Success rates quoted have been variable. There is no known data regarding when to reattempt the ?Surgisis? plug if failure occurs. We assessed our success rate and looked at any pattern for reinsertion of the ?Surgisis? anorectal plug. Methodology:?? We retrospectively collected patient/fistula characteristics, procedure details, and follow-up information for all patients treated with the anal fistula plug at our institution over the past 5?years. The outcome was considered successful if the external and internal opening were closed and if the patient had no drainage at the last follow-up. Results:?? Of 16 patients, 21 fistulae were treated with the ?Surgisis? anorectal fistula plug. 28.5% had complete healing after the first attempt at insertion of the ?Surgisis? plug, while 28.5% required a reinsertion of the ?Surgisis? plug for complete healing to occur. 43% failed to heal with the insertion of the ?Surgisis? plug or were awaiting follow-up. The period of time between insertion of seton, subsequent failure and insertion of ?Surgisis? plug was extremely variable. Median time taken was 220 (41?553)?days. Following this the median time taken for reinsertion was 303 (151?495)?days. Conclusion:?? Collectively our success rate for ?Surgisis? plug insertion is 57% however only 28.5% after first insertion. There is no clear relationship between the time period and the success of reinsertion of the ?Surgisis? plug. More data is required to give clear guidelines for timing of ?Surgisis? plug reinsertion.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - Purpose:?? Colonic inertia (CI) may co-exist with obstructed defaecation (OD). It is unclear if it adversely influences the results of surgery for OD. We aimed to compare the functional results of laparoscopic anterior rectopexy (LAR) for OD secondary to high-grade internal rectal prolapse (IRP) in those with normal colonic transit (NCT) and CI. Methodology:?? Patients with high-grade (recto-anal) IRP were evaluated with defaecating proctography and colonic transit study. Colonic transit time (CTT) (hours) was calculated by the number of pellets remaining in the colon and rectum at 7?days ? 2.4. Patients were offered surgery for significant symptoms if they failed a program of conservative management. Constipation was prospectively assessed pre-op and at 3?months using Wexner constipation scores. Results:?? 80 patients (93% female) underwent LAR for OD and IRP. Patients with NCT gave less history of stool infrequency currently (10% versus 32%) and in their 20's (17% versus 71%). 61 patients had normal colonic transit (CTT median 17, range 0?48 hours) and 19 had CI (CTT median 79, range 50?154 hours, p < 0.0001). Overall symptom improvement at 3?months was similar for NCT and CI (84% versus 84%, p = 0.97). Rates of total (50% versus 68%, p = 0.19) and partial (34% versus 16%, p = 0.16) symptom improvement were similar. Improvement in Wexner constipation score was similar for NCT (mean pre-op 13 to post-op 5) and CI (14 to 5), (p = 0.34). Conclusions:?? In the short term, colonic inertia has no adverse impact and may be disregarded when considering laparoscopic anterior rectopexy for obstructed defaecation and high-grade internal rectal prolapse.

AB  - Purpose:?? Slow transit constipation (STC) is a debilitating condition mainly affecting young women. Total colectomy (TC) is an option for patients with severe symptoms who are unresponsive to conservative measures. Open TC has been the procedure of choice but is associated with long term SBO and ongoing symptoms. It is difficult to determine if these ongoing symptoms are related to gut dysmotility or to post operative adhesions. Laparoscopic TC appears equivalent open TC with the advantage of being able to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy at a later stage to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause of chronic obstructive symptoms or pain. Methods:?? All consecutive patients undergoing a laparoscopic TC ± rectopexy for STC from 1991?2007 were reviewed. Results:?? 84 patients (81 female, 3 male) were included. Average operating time was 188 min, average LOS 8?days. Conversion rate was 1.2%. There were no post op mortalities. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 2.4%, pelvic collections in 2.4%, intra-abdominal bleeds in 4.7% and 3.5% developed wound infections. Bowel frequency was significantly improved however, 31% had at least 1 episode of obstructive symptoms. Ongoing pain was experienced by 38%. 57% underwent a further procedure a majority of which was a laparoscopy ± division of adhesions. Conclusion:?? Lap TC is a feasible and acceptable option for patients with STC with reasonable operating times, low conversion rates and acceptable mortality and morbidity. Bowel frequency is significantly improved however long term chronic pain and SBO are common. Lap TC allows for a minimally invasive laparoscopy to be performed to divide or exclude adhesions as a cause for obstructive symptoms or ongoing pain.

AB  - Purpose:?? The aim of this study is to make an objective assessment of whether multidisciplinary meetings (MDM) improve the management of patients requiring surgery for colorectal cancer as this has never been examined. Methodology:?? This retrospective study analyzed patients from the Geelong Hospital mandatory Colorectal Database between 1/1/2006 and 31/12/2007. MDM were implemented on 3/10/2006. To be included in the study patients had to have had an operation for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Each patient's management was determined to have conformed, or not conformed, to meet the best practice guidelines according to the 2005 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention, Early Detection and Management of Colorectal Cancer. Those patients who had been discussed in an MDM were compared with those pre-MDM to ascertain if there was any difference in patient treatment. Results:?? 182 patients had surgery for colorectal cancer. In the period where an MDM was available, 46% (53 of 116) patients were discussed in an MDM and all conformed to best practice guidelines. Of the 130 patients where no MDM review occurred, 98.5% conformed to best practice guidelines. This was consistent in both the pre MDM period (98.5%) and MDM available period (98.4%). Conclusion:?? The implementation of MDM at Geelong Hospital has marginally improved management of colorectal cancer. Few clinicians would dispute the benefits of such meetings but where an already high standard of care exists it is difficult to objectively demonstrate these improvements. We support using MDM but look to the less tangible benefits such as improved consistency and coordination of care, communication between health professionals and educational opportunities that MDM provide.

AB  - Purpose:?? Approximately 10% of temporary stomas created after low or ultra low anterior resection for rectal cancer remain unreversed. In this study, we aim to determine the reversal rate at our institution and the reasons for stomas remaining unreversed, especially due to anastomotic leaks. Method:?? A retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer at a single institution between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2007 was performed. Patients with unreversed stomas were identified and their patient files reviewed. Results:?? 230 patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer were considered. 54 of these had low or ultra-low anterior resection and a stoma fashioned. 47 (87%) had their stomas reversed (RS), and 7 (13%) had not (US). The RS group were younger, with 30 (63%) males compared to 6 (86%) in the US group. Not surprisingly, the US group were more likely to have surgical complications (72% vs. 28%, p = 0.022). The reasons for non-reversal were anastomotic leak 2(28%), death 2(28%), metastatic disease 1(14%), medical co-morbidities 1 (14%), and patient refusal 1 (14%). Of the 2 patients with anastomotic leaks, 1 remained unreversed due to development of stricture at the point of anastomosis, while the other was reversed 8?months later (outside the study period). Conclusion:?? When faecal diversion surgery is undertaken in low or ultra low anterior resection for the treatment of rectal cancer, it is usually reversed during a reasonable period of time. Surprisingly, even in our very small set of patients (7) with unreversed stomas, only 2 were unreversed due to anastomotic leaks.

AB  - Purpose:?? Concern about maternal morbidity associated with vaginal delivery (VD) may be driving the increasing trend for elective caesarean section (CS). This study aimed to quantify the risk of morbidity from VD that pregnant women would be prepared to accept before requesting an elective CS, and to compare these views with those of clinicians. Methodology:?? Participants completed a questionnaire to ascertain the maximum level of risk they would be prepared to accept before opting for an elective CS. Utility scores for each complication were calculated, with higher scores (closer to 1) indicating a preference towards VD. Results:?? 122 pregnant women, 84 midwives, 166 obstetricians, 12 urogynaecologists and 79 colorectal surgeons participated. For the evaluated 18 potential complications of VD pregnant women were willing to accept higher risks than clinicians. Pregnant women were least accepting of risks of severe anal incontinence (mean utility score 0.32), emergency CS (0.51), moderate anal incontinence (0.56), severe urinary incontinence (0.56), fourth degree tears (0.59), and third degree tears (0.72) The views of midwives were closest to those of pregnant women. Urogynaecologists and colorectal surgeons were the most risk averse, with 42% and 41% respectively stating they would request an elective CS for themselves or their partners. Conclusions:?? Pregnant women were able to quantify the level of risk they are prepared to accept from a VD before opting for an elective CS being aware of the potential complications of elective CS, and these risks were significantly higher than those accepted by the clinicians involved in their care. Their views are more closely aligned to midwives than to specialist clinicians.
