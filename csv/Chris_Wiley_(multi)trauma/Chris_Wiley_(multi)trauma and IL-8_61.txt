AB  - Cerebral air embolism is a known complication of open-heart surgery with devastating consequences. Neurologic injury after CPB can be divided into 2 types: Type I: Focal injury. Type II: Intellectual deterioration/neurocognitive impairment (up to 53% at the time of hospital discharge and 42% could be impaired for up to 5 years). Increasing evidence points to cerebral embolization as the principal culprit. Since the early days of modern cardiac surgery, surgeons have attempted to limits its damage by various means. One of the early techniques propounded was carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial cavity. Carbon dioxide, was uniquely positioned for this, being denser than air, more soluble than air, and easily managed perioperatively if the blood levels were to go up beyond physiological ranges. The technique gradually went into disuse, since there was no instrumentation, in the early days of CPB to measure and establish its impact on the actual outcomes. Secondly, the devices, through which CO2 was delivered, were not effective. There has been increasing enthusiasm for the technique but no consensus on the technical considerations or on the actual benefits of the practice. Our literature search showed that if practiced properly, carbon dioxide flooding does decrease the embolic counts significantly and that, by inference, could possibly improve the neurocognitive outcome. Since, there are no studies at this point in time, which show a direct beneficial correlation, we intend to do a prospective randomized controlled trial, to put things in proper perspective.

AB  - ABSTRACT Vitiligo is a depigmentary disorder that develops as a result of the progressive disappearance of epidermal melanocytes. Stress can precipitate or exacerbate a skin disease through psychosomatic mechanisms. Stress exposure induces vitiligo-like symptoms in mice, as cellular damage to melanocytes causes synthetic pigment loss. Stress also increases IL-17, IL-1?, and antimelanocyte IgG in model mouse serum. Up-regulation of the IL-1? transcript in patients suggests its possible role in autoimmune pathogenesis of vitiligo. We demonstrate that IL-17 promoted IL-1? secretion from keratinocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which can induce the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is emerging as a mechanism that underlies various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-17 inhibits melanogenesis of zebrafish, normal human epidermal melanocytes, and B16F10 cells. IL-17 increased mitochondrial dysfunc-tion and ROS accumulation, which was related to autophagy induction. Autophagy is needed for autophagic apoptosis of B16F10 cells induced by IL-17. To inhibit ROS generation, B16F10 cells were pretreated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which inhibited autophagy. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) also had an inhibiting effect on autophagy. NAC or 3-MA pretreatments inhibited IL-17-mediated cell apoptosis. In summary, IL-17 induces the cellular stress microenvironment in melanocytes to promote autophagic cell apoptosis in vitiligo.?Zhou, J., An, X., Dong, J., Wang, Y., Zhong, H., Duan, L., Ling, J., Ping, F., Shang, J.

AB  - Abstract Clinical and point-of-care disease diagnostics promise to play an important role in personalized medicine, new approaches to global health, and health monitoring. Emerging instrument platforms based on lab-on-a-chip technology can confer perfomance advantages successfully exploited in electrophoresis and electrochromatography to affinity-based electrokinetic separations. This review surveys lab-on-a-chip diagnostic developments in affinity-based electokinetic separations for quantitation of proteins, integration of preparatory functions needed for subsequent analysis of diverse biological samples, and initial forays into multiplexed analyses. The technologies detailed here underpin new clinical and point-of-care diagnostic strategies. The techniques and devices promise to advance translation of until now laborabory-based sample preparation and analytical assays to near-patient settings.

AB  - Inotropes and vasopressors are biologically and clinically important compounds that originate from different pharmacological groups and act at some of the most fundamental receptor and signal transduction systems in the body. More than 20 such agents are in common clinical use, yet few reviews of their pharmacology exist outside of physiology and pharmacology textbooks. Despite widespread use in critically ill patients, understanding of the clinical effects of these drugs in pathological states is poor. The purpose of this article is to describe the pharmacology and clinical applications of inotropic and vasopressor agents in critically ill patients.

AB  - Background To date there are no biomarkers with proven reliability as a measure of disease burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of our study is to assess the neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples as a measure of disease activity and progression in ALS. Methods Thirty-seven consecutive patients with ALS, 25 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and 21 with other neurodegenerative diseases were evaluated. CSF NFL levels were assayed by two-site solid-phase sandwich ELISA. In patients with ALS, neurological status was assessed by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-r) and the Medical Research Council scale, and the progression of the disease was evaluated using the ?diagnostic delay? and the ?progression rate?. Results Cerebrospinal fluid NFL levels were higher in ALS cases than in controls (P < 0.0001). Using receiver operating curve analysis, an optimal NFL cut-off of 1981 ng/l discriminated between patients with ALS and neurological controls, with a sensitivity of 78.4% and specificity of 72.5%. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed the association between CSF NFL levels and the presence of ALS (age and sex adjusted odds ratio for ALS 8.9; 95% CI 3.1?25.8; P < 0.0001). In ALS, CSF NFL negatively correlated with the diagnostic delay (P < 0.0001) and the ALSFRS-r (P = 0.014) and positively with the progression rate (P < 0.0001). Conclusions High CSF NFL levels were found in patients with ALS, reflecting the burden of neurodegeneration. The significant relation between CSF NFL levels and disease progression suggests that NFL may be a useful marker of disease activity and progression in ALS.

Journal of Advanced Nursing?66(11), 2450?2459. Abstract Aim.? This paper is a report of a study of the effect of family caregivers? needs on the functional recovery of elders with a hip fracture during the first 6?months after discharge. Background.? Family members are closely involved in the postdischarge care of older Chinese patients. However, the influence of family caregiving-related variables, such as caregiver?s needs, on recovery after hip fracture has not been explored. Methods.? Data were collected between 2002 and 2005 with elders with hip fracture and their family caregivers at a medical centre in Taiwan. Data were collected at 1, 3 and 6?months after discharge, and 120 people completed all follow-ups. The effect of caregiver needs on elders? recovery was analysed using the generalized estimating equations approach. Findings.? Elders whose caregivers reported a need for information on caregiving and related health care were more likely (odds ratio?=?1·93, confidence interval?=?1·08?3·46) to recover their walking ability than those whose caregivers did not report such need. However, elders whose caregivers reported a need for social services were less likely to recover their walking ability (odds ratio?=?0·38, confidence interval?=?0·18?0·78), and activities of daily living (odds ratio?=?0·40, confidence interval?=?0·17?0·94) than those whose caregivers did not report such need. Conclusion.? Healthcare providers should include caregivers? needs in their clinical assessment of Chinese elders after surgery for hip fracture. Given the rapidly increasing population of Asian elders in Western countries, the results of this study may be applicable to other countries with Chinese populations.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), manifested by intricate etiology and pathophysiology, demands careful clinical surveillance due to its high mortality and imminent life support measures. NMR based metabolomics provides an approach for ARDS which culminates from a wide spectrum of illness thereby confounding early manifestation and prognosis predictors. 1H NMR with its manifold applications in critical disease settings can unravel the biomarker of ARDS thus holding potent implications by providing surrogate endpoints of clinical utility. NMR metabolomics which is the current apogee platform of omics trilogy is contributing towards the possible panacea of ARDS by subsequent validation of biomarker credential on larger datasets. In the present review, the physiological derangements that jeopardize the whole metabolic functioning in ARDS are exploited and the biomarkers involved in progression are addressed and substantiated. The following sections of the review also outline the clinical spectrum of ARDS from the standpoint of NMR based metabolomics which is an emerging element of systems biology. ARDS is the main premise of intensivists textbook, which has been thoroughly reviewed along with its incidence, progressive stages of severity, new proposed diagnostic definition, and the preventive measures and the current pitfalls of clinical management. The advent of new therapies, the need for biomarkers, the methodology and the contemporary promising approaches needed to improve survival and address heterogeneity have also been evaluated. The review has been stepwise illustrated with potent biometrics employed to selectively pool out differential metabolites as diagnostic markers and outcome predictors. The following sections have been drafted with an objective to better understand ARDS mechanisms with predictive and precise biomarkers detected so far on the basis of underlying physiological parameters having close proximity to diseased phenotype. The aim of this review is to stimulate interest in conducting more studies to help resolve the complex heterogeneity of ARDS with biomarkers of clinical utility and relevance.
