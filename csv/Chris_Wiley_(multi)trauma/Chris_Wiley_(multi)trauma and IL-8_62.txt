AB  - Abstract To evaluate the potential differences in maternal nutritional investment in pregnancy, data collected from nomadic Ngisonyoka Turkana women during a July 1993?July 1994 field season were utilized. The roles maternal age, parity, duration of the previous nonpregnant interval, overlap between pregnancy and lactation on trimester changes in weight and summed skinfolds during pregnancy were examined. Because seasonality is an important aspect of the Turkana environment, the effects of seasonality were also assessed. First trimester weight gain is positively associated with overlap in pregnancy and lactation. Second trimester maternal weight gain is negatively influenced by higher parity and by overlap between lactation and early pregnancy. Third trimester weight gain is influenced only by seasonally induced morbidity. First trimester changes in maternal skinfolds are negatively influenced by older maternal age and parity, and positively influenced by a longer nonpregnant interval, and overlap between pregnancy and lactation. Second and third trimester skinfolds are significantly associated only with overlap between lactation and pregnancy (negatively in the second, positively in the third). Seasonality does not influence maternal skinfolds. Differences in age- and parity-related patterns of maternal nutritional investment in pregnancy are not supported by the data. The possibility that Turkana cultural beliefs may influence nutritional status during pregnancy is discussed. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 11:658?672, 1999. ? 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Neurological disorders occur in the central and peripheral nervous system and include Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Activation of the innate immune system inevitably occurs in all forms of neurological disorders. The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multimolecular complex that can sense danger signals associated with neurological disorders. Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes caspase-1-mediated interleukin-1? and interleukin-18 maturation in microglia, where neuroinflammation contributes to neurological disease development and progression. Thus, this review attempts to elucidate the current knowledge regarding NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Recent scientific findings with respect to neuroprotective effects of dietary phytochemicals against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neurological disorders summarized in this review suggest that modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by plant-derived phytochemicals could be a potential strategy for prevention or treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - Brachial plexus anesthesia with verapamil and/or morphine. (Baystate Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine, Springfield, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:379?383. This study examined the analgesic effects of administering morphine, verapamil, or its combination into the brachial plexus sheath with lidocaine in 75 patients undergoing upper extremity orthopedic surgery. All patients received brachial plexus anesthesia with 40 mL of 1.5% lidocaine and epinephrine 5 ?g/mL. Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 groups: Group 1 received IV saline; Group 2 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg; Group 3 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; Group 4 received IV morphine 5 mg and verapamil 2.5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; and Group 5 received verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution. Postoperatively, patients rated their pain (0?10) at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. Patients were instructed to take 1 acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone 5 mg tablet every 3 h whenever the pain score exceeded 3. Analgesic duration was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with morphine (Groups 3 and 5) (P < 0.005). The total 24 h acetaminophen/oxycodone was also less in Groups 3 and 5 (P < 0.03). Duration of anesthesia (time of abolition of pinprick response) was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with verapamil (Groups 4 and 5) (P = 0.002). Conclude that the addition of verapamil to the brachial plexus block with lidocaine can prolong the duration of sensory anesthesia, but it had no effect on analgesic duration of 24-h analgesic use. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. It is well established that calcium channel blockers potentiate analgesic effects of both local anesthetics and opioids. A desire for improvement of the quality and duration of brachial plexus blockade has led many investigators to study various agents in addition to standard local anesthetics. This interesting double-blinded study involving 82 patients scheduled for elective upper extremity orthopedic surgery involved 5 groups. Interestingly, the combination of verapamil and morphine via the brachial plexus did not provide any additional analgesic effect, which is different than previous studies. The subjectivity of telephone data and the relatively small sample size in each arm of this study make statistically significant findings harder to ascertain and relevant changes in clinical practice less convincing. Further, the authors do not appropriately note the complexity of calcium channel pharmacology and its overall role in opioid as well as local anesthetic modulation. Future studies with more precise endpoints for efficacy and duration are warranted if clinical practice is to be altered and accepted by the practitioner.

AB  - An in vitro study of dural lesions produced by 25-gauge Quincke and Whitacre needles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. (Hospital de Mostoles, Madrid Spain) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:393?402. This study evaluated the dural lesions produced by Whitacre and Quincke spinal needles in the external and internal surface of the dura mater of the lower spine area in an attempt to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of postdural puncture headaches (PDPH). The T11-L4 dural membranes from 5 fresh (immediately after extraction of organs for transplantation) male patients declared brain dead, ages 23, 46, 48, 55, and 60, were excised by anterior laminectomy. Morphologic orientation of the membrane and normal pH were maintained; 100 punctures at 90-degree angles were done with a new needle each time, 50 with 25-gauge Whitacre and 50 with 25-gauge Quincke needles. Half of the punctures with the Quincke needles were done with the bevel in the parallel direction to the axis of the spinal cord, and the rest with the bevel perpendicular to it. Fixation in solutions of 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer, followed by dehydration with acetone, was done 15 min after the punctures. The acetone was removed and the specimens were metallized with carbon followed by gold and inspected under a scanning electron microscope. When the area of the dural lesions found in the external and internal surfaces produced by the 2 types of needles was compared, no significant differences were found. The percentage of lesion closing area with the Quincke needles was 88.3% and 82.7% in the external and internal surfaces, respectively. With the Whitacre needles, the percentage of closing was 86.8% and 84.8% in the epidural and arachnoid surfaces, respectively. There were differences noted in the morphology of the lesions. The Whitacre needles produced coarse lesions with significant destruction in the dura's fibers while the Quincke needles produced a ?U?-shaped lesion (flap) that mimics the opened lid of a tin can, regardless of the tip's direction. Conclude that the needles produced lesions in the dura with different morphology and characteristics. Lesions with the Quincke needles resulted in a clean-cut opening in the dural membrane while the Whitacre needle produced a more traumatic opening with tearing and severe disruption of the collagen fibers. The lower incidence of PDPH seen in the Whitacre needles may be explained, in part, by the inflammatory reaction produced by the tearing of the collagen fibers after dural penetration. The inflammatory reaction may result in a significant edema, which may act as a plug limiting the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article that explains why a patient will develop a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after receiving a spinal with a Quincke needle and not after a Whitacre-type needle. The explanation is based more upon an inflammatory reaction than the direction of the needle cut. The Quincke needle appears to make a sharp cut while the Whitacre needle induced an inflammatory response including edema, which could block off the dura from leaking. It is very interesting that the response seen after the Whitacre needle was utilized occurred as quickly as it did. The article introduces the question as to whether a Quincke needle or a Whitacre needle is associated with more trauma to the dura, and which is better for decreasing the incidence of PDPD.

AB  - Tip-holed spinal needle: a new design concept. (Sir Salimullah Medical College and Mitford Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:403?407. This article discussed new technology regarding the production of finer spinal needles and described a new spinal needle tip design. Complications associated with dura-arachnoid puncture for spinal anesthesia were taken into account. Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) and needle bending are stated as being significant complications. Although pencil-point needles significantly reduce PDPH, it is stated that these needles also have their limitations such as obstruction of the delivery port by tissues affecting both cerebrospinal fluid flash back and drug delivery. The problem of tip bending was also addressed. At the center of the discussion was the newly designed spinal needle tip that was created to overcome the disadvantages of other spinal needles. Analyzing the performance of the existing needles, the conclusion was drawn that the criteria of an ideal spinal needle may be as follows: (1) the external diameter of the needle should be as thin as possible and the tip should be a dural fiber-spreading variety; (2) the shaft and tip should be capable of withstanding forces during needle placement; and (3) it should also have a drug delivery hole that does not weaken the needle or become obstructed by tissue. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This article introduces a new type of needle for performing spinal anesthesia techniques. According to the authors, classic Quincke-type needles are associated with postdural puncture headache (PDPH), while side port blunt needles may be associated with mechanical problems such as back flow or having tissue obstruct side port. Therefore, the authors designed a new type of needle that is pencil point in shape, but the removal stylet is the component that forms the pencil point. When the stylet is removed, the needle has a conical distal shape with the opening at the end. The authors believe that this ?new spreading beveled needle tip? will help alleviate problems with PDPH as well as the problems associated with side port holes. While the idea is very intriguing, it remains to be seen how successful the needle will be.
