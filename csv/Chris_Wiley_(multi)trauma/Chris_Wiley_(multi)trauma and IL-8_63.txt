AB  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. (Hospital Morvan, Brest, France) Ophthalmology 2000;107:1507?1511. This randomized, double-blinded study compared the efficacy and safety of valaciclovir and acyclovir in immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. One hundred ten immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus diagnosed within 72 h of skin eruption were treated; 56 were allocated to the valaciclovir group and 54 to the acyclovir group. Patients randomized to the valaciclovir group received 2 500-mg tablets of valaciclovir 3 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo twice daily. Patients in the acyclovir group received 1 800-mg tablet of acyclovir 5 times daily and 1 tablet of placebo 3 times daily for 7 days. Main outcome measures included the frequency, severity, and duration of ocular complications, patient records of zoster-associated pain, and the outcome of skin lesions. Tolerance was also assessed on the incidence and types of adverse effects and changes in laboratory parameters. The analysis was mainly descriptive and performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus were similar in the valaciclovir and acyclovir treatment groups. The main complications were conjunctivitis (54% and 52%, respectively), superficial keratitis (39% and 48%, respectively for punctate keratitis; 11 in each group for dendritic keratitis), stromal keratitis (13% in each group) and uveitis (13% and 17%, respectively). The long-term outcomes of these ocular complications were favorable and similar in both treatment groups. Pain duration, severity, and outcome of skin lesions were similar between groups. Most patients reported prodromal pain. After 1 month, 25% of the patients in the valaciclovir group and 31% in the acyclovir group still reported pain. The percentage of patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia decreased during follow-up. The tolerance to acyclovir and valaciclovir was comparable and considered good. The most frequent adverse events were vomiting and edema of the eyelids or face (3%?5%). Three serious adverse events not linked to the study drugs occurred. Valaciclovir is as effective as acyclovir in preventing ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, including conjunctivitis, superficial and stromal keratitis, and pain. Tolerability of the 2 drugs is similar, but the dosing schedule of valaciclovir is simpler. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study comparing the efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and its ophthalmologic complications and sequelae between valaciclovir and acyclovir. The initial review of the incidence and the associated ophthalmologic complications of untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus is concise and educational for physicians who do not interact with these kind of patients frequently. As pain physicians, it is part of our daily practice to deal with patient compliance to the medication treatment we prescribe. In this sense, this article provides comparison between 2 medications that are very similar in the efficacy profiles as well as their control of complications, but with acyclovir there is question of whether patients might be more compliant to the lower dosing frequency of valaciclovir. Results overall are similar between both drugs, but in terms of complications, although not statistically significant, the percentage is consistently lower with valaciclovir than acyclovir. The fact stated in this article regarding the bioavailability of valaciclovir being similar to that of intravenous acyclovir may account for this. The high incidence of irreversible ophthalmic complications such as anatomical loss of an eye (50%?70%) in untreated herpes zoster ophthalmicus makes the question of patient compliance with treatment a crucial one. As physicians, we may not realize that for a patient there might be a significant difference between interrupting their daily life 3 times to take a medication instead of 5 times. In summation, this is a well-designed study with valid conclusions that would impact our practice of medicine.

AB  - Bruno Guignard, Anne Elisabeth Bossard, Carole Coste, et al:Intraoperative remifentanil increases postoperative pain and morphine requirement. (Hôpital Ambroise Paré, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) Anesthesiology 2000;93:409??417. The study tested the hypothesis that intraoperative remifentanil administration results in acute opioid tolerance that is manifested by increased postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Fifty adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to 2 anesthetic regimens: (1) the remifentanil group or (2) the desflurane group. All patients were given a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg morphine 40 min before the end of surgery. Morphine was initially titrated to need by postanesthesia care nurses blinded to group assignment. Subsequently, patients?who were blinded to group assignment?controlled their own morphine administration. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded for 24 postoperative h. The results indicated that the mean remifentanil infusion rate was 0.3 ± 0.2 ?g · kg?1· min?1 in the remifentanil group, which was significantly greater than in the desflurane group. Intraoperative hemodynamic responses were similar in each group. Postoperative pain scores were significantly greater in the remifentanil group. These patients required morphine significantly earlier than those in the desflurane group and needed nearly twice as much morphine in the first 24 postoperative h: 59 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 43?71) versus 32 mg (25% to 75% interquartile range, 19?59; P<0.01). Conclude that relatively large-dose intraoperative remifentanil increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption. These data suggest that remifentanil causes acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia.

AB  - Valaciclovir: a review of its use in the management of herpes zoster. (Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) Drugs 2000;59:1317?1340. This study compared the effectiveness of valaciclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily for 7 days) and aciclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was found to alleviate zoster-associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. A 14-day regimen of valaciclovir showed no significant advantage over the 7-day regimen. A smaller trial in Japanese patients focusing primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster confirmed the similar efficacy of valaciclovir and aciclovir in the 7-day regime. Valaciclovir and aciclovir demonstrated similar efficacy for the control of cutaneous lesions and ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Starting treatment later than 72 h after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of valaciclovir on the duration of zoster-associated pain, suggesting that valaciclovir might be effective when given later than previously thought. However, valaciclovir should ideally be given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. Valaciclovir was well tolerated with nausea and headache as being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of the agent was similar to that seen with aciclovir or famciclovir. Conclude that the efficacy of valaciclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster has been confirmed and extended by follow-up studies in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in Japanese patients, and in the wider primary care setting. Valaciclovir is at least equivalent to, and better in certain parameters than, aciclovir and appears to have similar efficacy to famciclovir 500 mg 3 times daily. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a review article on the antiviral drug valaciclovir. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is commonly treated with the antiviral drug aciclovir. However, aciclovir has a low oral bioavailability that limits its efficacy in the treatment of herpes zoster. Valaciclovir was developed in order to have a more readily absorbed oral antiviral drug. When valaciclovir was compared to aciclovir in a large study, it was noted that valaciclovir was as effective in controlling the symptoms of acute herpes zoster. It was also noted valaciclovir alleviated zoster associated pain and postherpetic neuralgia significantly faster than aciclovir. Also, there was no significant advantage of treating valaciclovir 14 days versus 7 days; therefore, a 7-day regimen is recommended. In a smaller trial from Japan that focused primarily on the cutaneous (rash) signs of herpes zoster, there was also confirmation of similar efficacy of aciclovir and valaciclovir in a 7-day regimen. The similarity in efficacy was not only for cutaneous lesions but also for ocular complications in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. In a large controlled trial, they compared valaciclovir and famciclovir. This showed similar efficacy in resolution of acute herpes zoster rashes shortening the duration of postherpetic neuralgia. It was purposed in the article that the therapeutic window for beneficial treatment with valaciclovir and zoster associated pain may be wider that previously though. It is still recommended that valaciclovir be ideally given as soon as possible after symptoms appear. However, starting treatment after 72 hours after rash onset did not significantly reduce the beneficial effect of the valaciclovir on duration of zoster associated pain. Valaciclovir is known to be well tolerated with nausea and headache being the most commonly reported adverse events. The adverse events profile of valaciclovir is similar to aciclovir or famciclovir. The purpose of this review was to present an overview of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in the assessment of pain in herpes zoster in comparison with known agents of aciclovir, famciclovir, and/or placebo. It is concluded that valaciclovir is an efficacious agent in the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. It's at least as efficacious as aciclovir and has similar efficacy to famciclovir. It is well tolerated with a similar side effect profile as aciclovir and famciclovir.

AB  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine: results of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (Center for Headache Management, Springfield, PA) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:782?789. This clinical trial determined the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace productivity loss. Adult migraine sufferers self-injected 6 mg of sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the first 4 h of a minimum of an 8-h work shift. Outcome measures included productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2 h after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work performance, and time to headache relief. A total of 206 patients underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the workplace. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median productivity loss 2 h after injection compared with placebo (25.2 versus 29.9 min, respectively) (P = 0.14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo (36.8 versus 72.6, respectively) (P = 0.001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients experienced shorter return to normal work performance at 2 h and across the work shift. Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients experienced headache relief 1 h after injection compared with placebo-treated patients. Conclude that across an 8-h work shift, sumatriptan was superior to the placebo in reducing productivity loss due to migraine.

AB  - Ethical considerations in the treatment of pain in a hospice environment. (Hospice Rozenheuvel, Rozendaal, The Netherlands) Patient Education and Counseling 2000;41:47?53. This article discussed some specific ethical problems encountered in hospice practice. Patient's autonomy with all its advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Ethical considerations with regard to risk taking and the treatment of pain are discussed. The needs of the patients are central to the discussion. Myths regarding opioids and pain therapy goals are addressed, as are approaches to treating intractable pain and dealing with patients who request assisted death. Acceptance of death may result in an active and creative attitude. Conclude that although scientific evidence of the processes taking place is still lacking, the modern hospice may be seen as a complementary, mainstream institution contributing to the development of whole medicine.

AB  - P.A. Mallinder, J.E. Hall, F.G. Bergin, P. Royle, D.J. Leaper: A comparison of opiate- and epidural-induced alterations in splanchnic blood flow using intraoperative gastric tonometry. (North Tees Hospital, Hardwick, Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, UK) Anaesthesia 2000;55:659?665. This study assessed the ability of tonometry to measure differential effects of opiate and epidural analgesia on splanchnic blood flow. Forty patients for elective colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to receive epidural infusion or intravenous morphine. Gastric mucosal PCO2, pHi, standard pHi, PCO2 gap, and pH gap were measured after induction and on termination of surgery. These parameters were within normal limits at the end in most cases and there was no significant difference between the groups. The complication rate was similar in both groups and was not correlated with low pHi, but was correlated with blood loss. A difference in splanchnic perfusion was not demonstrated between the two groups. Comment by Octavio Calvillo, MD, PhD. This study concerns the assessment of splanchnic blood flow measured indirectly and noninvasively in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The tonometer is a modified gastric tube terminating in a silicone balloon, which can be filled intermittently with either air or saline. With this technique, it is possible to measure gastric mucosal CO2 (PgCO2) and intramucosal pH and pH gap using a modified Henderson-Hasellbach equation, thus indirectly providing an estimate of splanchnic blood flow. These parameters were measured after induction and upon termination of surgery in 2 groups of patients randomly allocated to receive either intravenous morphine (10 mg) or epidural bupivacaine to achieve a T5 sensory level of blockade. The authors were unable to demonstrate a difference in splanchnic perfusion as assessed with tonometry between the 2 groups.

AB  - Spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) N Engl J Med 2000;343:618?624. This randomized trial involved patients who had had reflex sympathetic dystrophy for at least 6 months. Thirty-six patients were assigned to receive treatment with spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy, and 18 were assigned to receive physical therapy alone. The spinal cord stimulator was implanted only if test stimulation was successful. The intensity of pain was assessed (on a visual-analogue scale from 0 cm [no pain] to 10 cm [very severe pain]), as well as the global perceived effect (on a scale from 1 [worst ever] to 7 [best ever]), functional status, and the health-related quality of life. The test stimulation of the spinal cord was successful in 24 patients; the other 12 patients did not receive implanted stimulators. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the group assigned to receive spinal cord stimulation plus physical therapy had a mean reduction of 2.4 cm in the intensity of pain at 6 months, as compared with an increase of 0.2 cm in the group assigned to receive physical therapy alone (P < 0.001 for comparison between the 2 groups). In addition, the proportion of patients with a score of 6 (?much improved?) for the global perceived effect was much higher in the spinal cord stimulation group than in the control group (39% vs. 6%, P = 0.01). There was no clinically important improvement in functional status. The health-related quality of life improved only in the 24 patients who actually underwent implantation of a spinal cord stimulator. Six of the 24 patients had complications that required additional procedures, including removal of the device in 1 patient. Conclude in carefully selected patients with chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy, electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life. Conmment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a well-written article describing a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for reflex sympathetic dystrophy, which is also known as complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I). The results show clearly that in carefully selected patients suffering from this pain syndrome, SCS can reduce pain and improve health-related quality of life compared to patients treated only with physical therapy. Functional status did not improve in either group of patients as SCS treats pain, but not the disease itself. The authors note that the improvement in the overall score for health-related quality of life was derived mainly from the alleviation of pain as in the study population, pain was the primary source of distress. This study represents a major reference for pain doctors and neurosurgeons treating CRPS and chronic pain.

AB  - The impact of spinal problems on the health status of patients: have we underestimated the effect? (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire) Spine 2000;25:1509?1514. This prospective study involved 17,774 patients who consulted spine centers and aimed to qualify the effect that spinal diagnoses have on patient's physical functional status (SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score) compared with other common conditions and to qualify the effects of comorbidities on physical functional status in spine patients. The study patients were a mean of 47.5 years of age, 54.7% were female, 52.3% had lumbosacral diagnoses, and 82% has had 3 or more months of pain. The population had a mean PCS score of 30.4 ± 9.95 (SD) compared with 50.0 ± 10.00 for the general United States population. The more comorbidities in a patient, the lower the PCS score (Spearman rank correlation = ?0.27). The 5 comorbid conditions that lowered the PCS the most included congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. Conclude the PCS score is greatly affected in patients with spinal problems. The study population's OCS was lower or similar to the PCS for patients with other illnesses reported in the literature. Further, the presence of comorbidity in spine patients adds to the burden of spinal conditions on functional status.

AB  - Endocrine consequences of long-term intrathecal administration of opioids. (University of Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium) J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2000;85:2215?2222. This study involved 73 patients (29 men and 44 women) receiving opioids intrathecally for nonmalignant pain who were enrolled for extensive endocrine investigation. At the time of hormonal determination, the mean duration of opioid treatment was 26.6 ± 16.3 months; the mean daily dose of morphine was 4.8 ± 3.2 mg. The control group consisted of 20 patients (11 men and 9 women) with a comparable pain syndrome, but not treated with opioids. Decreased libido or impotency was present in 23 of 24 men receiving opioids. The serum testosterone level was below 9 nmol/L in 25 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The free androgen index was below normal in 18 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The serum LH level was less than 2 U/L in 20 of 29 men and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). Serum FSH was comparable in both groups. Decreased libido was present in 22 of 32 women receiving opioids. All 21 premenopausal females developed either amenorrhea or an irregular menstrual cycle, with ovulation in only 1. Serum LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were lower in the opioid group. In all 18 postmenopausal females significantly decreased serum LH (P < 0.001) and FSH (P = 0.012) levels were found. The 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion was below 20 ?g/day in 14 of 71 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.003). The peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was below 180 ?g/L in 9 of 61 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the nonopioid group (P = 0.002). The insulin-like growth factor I sd score was below ?2 sd in 12 of 73 opioid patients and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.002). The peak GH response to hypoglycemia was below 3 ?g/L in 9 of 62 subjects and was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.010). Thyroid function tests and PRL levels were considered normal. No metabolic disturbances were recorded, apart from significantly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.041) and elevated total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P = 0.008) in the opioid group compared to the control group. Supplementation with gonadal steroids improved sexual function in most patients. Conclude of all patients receiving intrathecal opioids, the large majority of men and all women developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, about 15% developed central hypocorticism, and about 15% developed GH deficiency. These findings suggest that further investigations are required to determine the need for systematic endocrine work-up in these patients and the necessity for substitutive therapy.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Neurotoxicity of intrathecally administered tetracaine commences at posterior roots near entry into the spinal cord. (Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:372?379. This study examined the histopathologic effects of intrathecally administered tetracaine. Sixty Wistar rats randomly received either 20%, 10%, 5%, 3%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0% tetracaine dissolved in 10% glucose solution or no solution via a chronically implanted intrathecal catheter. The spinal cord at L1, posterior and anterior roots and cauda equina were excised 5 days later, sectioned, processed, and prepared for light and electron microscopic examinations. Rats treated with tetracaine at 10% or 20% developed lesions in the posterior white matter and posterior roots. Rats injected with 3% or 5% tetracaine developed lesions, which began in the posterior roots close to the spinal cord and extended to the posterior white matter. The lesions were characterized by axonal degeneration. Injections of 1% of tetracaine did not cause any pathological changes. The results suggest that the initial target of intrathecal tetracaine neurotoxicity may be the posterior roots at their entry into the spinal cord, where the axons are devoid of myelin sheath and thus represent a sensitive area for neurotoxic change. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The reassuring aspect of this study is that no significant lesions were found when rats were given clinically used concentrations of tetracaine. The investigators do make a case that clinically used concentrations of tetracaine might be neurotoxic in humans based on the observation that the duration of action of tetracaine is shorter in rats than in humans. The distribution of the lesions is curious in that 10% tetracaine produced lesions in the posterior rootlets and in the posterior rootlet entry zone, but did not produce lesions in the fasciculus gracilis. The implication is that rootlets posterior to lamina L1 (the L1 segment that was examined) that were destroyed do not project into the fasciculus gracilis. One would expect that destruction of lamina L2 posterior rootlets that projected into the fasciculus gracilis would produce lesions visible at the EM level at L1 5 days after damage. The absence of lesions in the L1 fasciculus gracilis puzzles me. I am also puzzled by the suggestion that all posterior rootlets loose their myelin sheath just before entry into the posterior white matter of the spinal cord (Obersteiner-Redlich zone). To my knowledge, most posterior rootlets do not have this nonmyelinated zone and; therefore, the absence of the myelin would make only a portion of the posterior rootlets vulnerable to tetracaine neurotoxicity as suggested by the authors. In short, there are some anatomical relationships that do not fit with the distribution of lesions described by the investigators.

AB  - Acute tolerance to continuously infused alfentanil: the role of cholecystokinin and N-methyl-D-aspartate-nitric oxide systems. (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:110?119. To test the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) and N-methyl-D-aspartate-nitric oxide (NMDA-NO) systems in the development of acute tolerance to analgesia during alfentanil IV infusion, experiments were conducted in rats with the use of an infusion algorithm designed to maintain a constant plasma level of the opioid for 4 h. The degree of acute tolerance was determined on the basis of decline in the level of analgesia measured with a tail compression test. CCKB receptor antagonists (proglumide, CI-988, and L-365,260) and NMDA-NO cascade inhibitors (dizocilpine and NO synthase inhibitor) were administered before the start of alfentanil infusion. Use of 30 mg/kg proglumide, 10 mg/kg CI-988, and 1 mg/kg L-365,260 attenuated acute tolerance at 1 h of alfentanil infusion by approximately 60%, 55%, and 70%, respectively, and by the end of the 4-h infusion by 50%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. Use of 0.1 mg/kg dizocilpine and 10 mg/kg NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester attenuated acute tolerance at 1 h of alfentanil infusion by approximately 65% and 65% and by the end of the 4-h infusion by 30% and 0%, respectively. Comparison of the results with CCKB receptor antagonists and inhibitors of NMDA-NO cascade demonstrates that both groups provide more or less similar degrees of attenuation of acute tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of alfentanil, and none of these drugs completely prevents tolerance development.

AB  - A follow-up study of 14 young adults with complex regional pain syndrome type I. (Hospital Morvan, Brest, France) J Neurosci Nurs. 2000;32:83?88. This study evaluated the symptom experience and functional status of 27 young adults with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, now known as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I. All were originally diagnosed and studied 12 years ago. Only 15 subjects could be located; 14 participated in the research. A descriptive exploratory design was utilized. A tool was designed to gather data about daily living variables, psychological variables, and symptom variables. Although many questions required the use of Likert scales, there were some open-ended questions to capture the qualitative descriptions of the participant's symptom experiences. Findings contribute to the clinical literature about CRPS and its effect on clients over time. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This paper is a follow-up interview on 14 patients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I more than a decade ago. The author created a tool with the purpose of gathering data in 3 different aspects such as: current activity levels, psychosocial assessment, and symptom experiences. This data were gathered in a questionnaire form. The first 2 sections (current acting levels and psychosocial assessment) are questions to be answered on a 4-point Likert scale and the last part (symptom experiences) is an open-ended question section where the subject can answer in a more descriptive manner. What is particular about the population of patients in this study is the fact that all were diagnosed at an early age (childhood or as young adults). This yielded an interesting set of results. As far as current activity levels, more that two-thirds of the patients were able to perform basic daily living activities and at least 50% of them can perform more strenuous activities such as running, climbing stairs, and driving a car. The results above extrapolate well into the psychosocial assessment where greater than 90% considered themselves self-sufficient. Of interest was the fact that there was no depression or overwhelming psychiatric morbidity reported. This could be because at a younger age of onset for CRPS type I, more effective coping skills can be developed that would aid these patients in adaptation to daily life. It is not surprising that in symptom experience the most common was continuing pain, followed by limitations in range of motion. In summation, this study sheds light into an aspect that has not been researched in an extensive manner, which is a long-term follow-up of patients suffering from CRPS type I and how they adapted to daily life. Although conclusions reflect valid facts, the sample size is small and larger population including patients who develop CRPS type I at later stages in life may provide us with crucial information in a general set of patients.

AB  - Intravenous clodronate in the treatment of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. (Istituto Ortopedico Gaetano Pini, Milan, Italy) J Rheumatol 2000;27:1477?1483. This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) and assessed the urinary excretion of type 1 collagen crosslinked N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after treatment. Thirty-two patients with RSDS were randomized to receive either IV Clodronate 300 mg daily for 10 consecutive days or placebo. Forty days later, the placebo treated patients received the clodronate treatment. Outcome measures included as a primary endpoint the visual analog scale of pain (VAS, range 0?100); secondary endpoints were a clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3) and an efficacy verbal score (EVS, range 0?3). Clinical and biochemical assessments were performed before the treatment, 40 (T40), 90 (T90), and 180 (T180) days later. At T40 the 15 patients randomized to clodronate treatment showed significant decreases of VAS and CGA (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively). Compared with the placebo group (17 patients), significant differences were found in all clinical variables. A further clinical improvement was observed throughout the study. Pooling the results of all 32 patients after clodronate treatment, at T180 the overall percentage decrease of VAS was 9.32 ± 15.6% with 30 patients significantly improved or asymptomatic. Significant inverse correlations between baseline NTx values and decreases of VAS were found at T90 (P = 0.03) and T180 (P = 0.01). No adverse events related to treatment occurred. Conclude that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and effective in the treatment of RSDS. NTx seems to be a predictive factor for clodronate efficacy. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized double blind placbo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous clodronate in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) or complex regional pain syndrome type I. It is also to assess the urinary excretion of type I collogen crosslink N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after the treatment. Thirty-two patients with complex regional pain syndrome type I were randomized to receive either a placebo or IV clodronate 300mg daily for 10 consecutive days. At the end of 40 days, the placebo group was then treated with the clodronate. The primary endpoint measures with the visual analog scale (VAS, range 0?100) and a secondary endpoint was the clinical global assessment (CGA, range 0?3), and an efficacy vocal score (EVS, range 0?3). In addition, the patient had clinical and biochemical assessments performed before the treatment at 40 days, at 90 days, and at 180 days later. The purpose of the study was valued at the efficacy of the IV clodronate in pain relief. The second purpose was to evaluate the possibility of using NTx as a predicting factor for evaluating complex regional pain syndrome type I or the clodranate efficacy. On day 40, 15 patients that were randomized to the clodronate treatment showed significant decreases in their VAS and CGA when compared with the placebo group with 17 patients. In addition, the patients who had originally received placebo infusions showed decreased VAS and CGA scores after 40 days of treatment with the clodronate when compared to their VAS and CGA scores after placebo. At 180 days, the patients continued to show significant improvement or were asymptomatic. Bisphosphonates have been proposed since 1988 for the treatment of CRPS type I. The most frequently used is pamidronate, which is given intravenously showing varied results. The pamidronate did not seem to be well tolerated. Alendronate is also given intravenously demonstrating good efficacy. It, however, has a high relapse rate. Clodronate was chosen for this study because it was efficacious in treatment of various painful skeletal disorders and was more tolerable and safe than the pamidronate. The length of the time of the study was chosen to be 10 consecutive days so that it followed the study with successful use of pamidronate. These results suggest that a 10-day IV clodronate course is better than placebo and is an effective complex regional pain syndrome type I treatment that may induce prompt and long lasting improvement. This study also attempted to demonstrate NTx as a predictive factor for clodranate efficacy. While NTx has shown to be a specific and sensitive marker of bone resorption, in this study, they found a low association between high NTx values and the complex regional pain syndrome type I. This finding could weaken the relationship between NTx baseline values and the responsiveness to clodronate treatment. It should be noted, however, that there were significant immerse correlations found between the baseline NTx values and in the pain improvement measured on the percentage change of VAS at 90 days and 180 days. Therefore, while significant inverse correlations may have been determined, and the NTx may be a promising tool, it is not yet possible to determine the predictive rolls of NTx as a marker.

AB  - The treatment of neuropathic pain: antidepressants and opioids. (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S49?S55. This article reviewed the scientific data on antidepressants and opioids, which are largely confined to randomized controlled trials in two neuropathic pain conditions that have proved to be good models for clinical investigation. A review of literature was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database regarding postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. The use of the older antidepressants such as amitriptyline in neuropathic pain was extensively supported by the literature. However, newer randomized controlled trials supported the use of opioids. Conclude that first-line therapy for neuropathic pain may be either an older generation antidepressant such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline or the anticonvulsant gabapentin. For refractory cases, chronic opioid therapy may be the only avenue of relief, and evidence is accumulating that this approach is safe if proper guidelines are observed.

AB  - Microinvasive transaxillary thoracoscopic sympathectomy: technical note. (Presbyterian University Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA) Neurosurgery 2000;46:1254?1258. This report describes a two-port transaxillary thoracoscopic approach for thoracic sympathectomy that maximizes working space, improves manipulative ability, and enhances visualization of the surgical field. Positioning of the patients was optimized to displace the scapula posteriorly, widen the avenue of approach to the sympathetic ganglia, and create a more direct route to the target. The semi-Fowler position permitted the lung apex to fall away from mediastinal structures, obviating a separate retraction port. A 30-degree endoscope allowed an unobstructed view of surgical progress, and anatomic relationships were manipulated in a temporal sequence to facilitate dissection. Microinvasive transaxillary sympathectomy was performed successfully in 13 patients, all of whom had a good outcome without complications. Conclude the modifications implemented increase the speed and safety of thoracoscopic sympathectomy while minimizing complications. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. Thoracic sympathectomy is an accepted means of treating hyperhidrosis, Raynaud's disease, causalgia major and other autonomically mediated syndromes. The authors describe a two-port transaxillary thoracoscopic approach that maximizes working space, improves manipulative ability, and enhances visualization of the surgical field, advocating a lateral decubitus semi-Fowler position. A total of 13 patients were treated, 11 with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I)) and 2 with palmar hyperhidrosis. Interestingly, the authors excellent outcomes for CRPS I, not reflecting the experience of most practitioners. Thoracoscopic sympathectomy is evolving quickly since first described by Klux in 1951. From a technical standpoint, the authors describe a useful procedure of endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy that is worthy of further investigation as the series is limited to only 13 patients and in a larger series come complications would be encountered.

AB  - Natural history of individuals with asymptomatic disc abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging: predictors of low back pain-related medical consultation and work capacity. (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) Spine 2000;25:1484?1492. This prospective study involved 46 asymptomatic individuals who had a high rate of disc herniations (73%) that were observed for an average of 5 years. Four classes of variable were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Disc herniations and neural compromise did not significantly worsen at follow-up, whereas disc degeneration progresses in 17 individuals (41.5%). Minor episodes of low back pain occurred in 19 individuals (41.3%), 6 of whom had to seek medical treatment and 5 of whom had to stop work temporarily. The requirement for low back pain-related medical consultation was predicted with high accuracy by listlessness, job satisfaction, and working in shifts (P < 0.001). Work capacity was best predicted by physical job characteristics, job disaffection, and working in shifts (P < 0.001). Conclude that physical job characteristics and psychological aspects of work were more powerful than magnetic resonance imaging-identified disc abnormalities in predicting the need for low back pain-related medical consultation and the resultant work incapacity. However, the conclusions are still preliminary, and replication of the findings in larger and more representative study samples is needed.

AB  - Reoperations after lumbar disc surgery: a population-based study of regional and interspecialty variations. (National Research and Development Center for Welfare and Health (STAKES), Helsinki, Finland) Spine 2000;25:1500?1507. This study aimed to explore rates of reoperation after lumbar disc surgery and their regional and interspecialty variations. Patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery from 1987 to 1995 were identified in the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Data on the patient's initial disc operations, subsequent operations, and cause-of-death records were linked using personal identification codes. The Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazard model were used to analyze risks of reoperation after initial surgery and for neurosurgical and orthopedic patients of university hospitals. Out of 25,359 surgical patients with herniated lumbar discs, 12.3% underwent subsequent lumbar operations corresponding to the cumulative risk of 18.9% in the 9-year follow-up. Reoperation rates increased during the study period with the recent patient cohorts exhibiting risks. The reoperation risk showed a systematic geographic variation: the higher the regional disc surgery rate, the higher the reoperation risk. Overall, neurosurgical patients had a higher reoperation risk than orthopedic patients, but it was not a uniform finding. Conclude that the reoperation risk after disc surgery increased during the study period and was higher in hospital catchment areas with higher overall discectomy rates. The reoperation rates varied among the university hospitals, but tended to be higher for neurosurgical rather than for orthopedic patients.
