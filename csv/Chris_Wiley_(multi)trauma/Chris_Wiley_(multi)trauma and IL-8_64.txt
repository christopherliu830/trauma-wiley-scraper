AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Lateral cervical epidural catheter placement for continuous unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:313?317. This article discussed the use of a laterally directed cervical epidural catheter for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. The technique was used in a series of 30 patients to produce unilateral upper extremity analgesia and sympathetic block. A case report of a patient treated with this technique and a description of the technique as well as the results from the series are presented. The method included placement of an epidural catheter at the C6-7 vertebral interspace; the needle bevel and catheter were directed to the affected side in a woman with a history of complex regional pain syndrome of the right upper extremity. A unilateral block was shown with the technique by anatomic parameters (unilateral contrast dye spread), physiologic parameters (unilateral Horner's syndrome), and symptomatic parameters (unilateral, subjective neural block). One patient treated with the technique had bilateral effects; however, no patient had a predominant block on the contralateral side and no complications developed. The case report showed results that were typical of the series of 30 patients. Conclude that the laterally directed cervical epidural catheter was an effective technique to produce continuous unilateral analgesia and sympathetic block.

AB  - The effects of intrathecal morphine encapsulated in l- and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline liposomes on acute nociception in rats. (University of California, San Diego, CA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:423?428. This study evaluated the antinociceptive effects of morphine encapsulated in liposomes of two isomeric phospholipids, l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (l-DPPC) and d-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline (d-DPPC), in comparison with morphine in saline. Sprague-Dawley rats with chronic lumbar intrathecal catheters were tested for their acute nociceptive response using a hindpaw thermal escape test. Their general behavior, motor function, pinna reflex, and corneal reflex were also examined. The duration of antinociception was longer in both liposomal morphine groups than in the free morphine group. The peak antinociceptive effects were observed within 30 min after intrathecal morphine, l-DPPC or d-DPPC morphine injection. The rank order of the area under the effect-time curve for antinociception was l-DPPC morphine> d-DPPC morphine> morphine. The 50% effective dose was: 2.7 ?g (morphine), 4.6 ?g (l-DPPC morphine), and 6.4 ?g (d-DPPC morphine). d-DPPC morphine had fewer side effects for a given antinociceptive AUC than morphine. Conclude that l-DPPC and d-DPPC liposome encapsulation of morphine prolonged the antinociceptive effect on acute thermal stimulation and could decrease side effects compared with morphine alone. Comments by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. One would intuitively expect that encapsulation of a drug would prolong its duration of action and reduce systemic side effects. However, the results of this study taken in the context of studies with the encapsulation of other opioids indicate that the physical/chemical properties of the opioid can have an important influence on the results of encapsulation. For example, the investigators have demonstrated that encapsulation of alfentanyl had only a modest effect on its duration of action, presumably because of the ability of the lipophilic alfentanyl to rapidly defuse through the membranes of the liposomes. One question the study leaves open is whether or not the material used for encapsulation has consistent effects on its own. The investigators previously found that intrathecal delivery of l-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline resulted in a steroid-sensitive allodynia. However, in the present study the investigators did not observe this. Thus, there is much to be learned about the science and art of drug encapsulation for therapeutic purposes in humans.

AB  - D. Sheffield, P.L. Biles, H. Orom, W. Maixner, D.S. Sheps: Race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC) Psychosomatic Medicine 2000;62:517?523. The purpose of this study was to determine race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. Pain perception was measured using a suprathreshold evaluation of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli in 27 whites (14 men and 13 women) and 24 African-Americans (12 men and 12 women). Blood pressure, depressive symptoms, anxiety state levels, and negative mood were assessed before pain testing to examine whether they might account for any sex or race differences in pain perception that emerged. African-Americans rated the stimuli as more unpleasant and showed a tendency to rate it as more intense than whites. Women showed a tendency to rate the stimuli as more unpleasant and more intense than men. In addition, systolic blood pressure was inversely related to pain intensity. After statistically adjusting for systolic blood pressure, sex differences in pain unpleasantness were reduced and sex differences in pain intensity were abolished; race differences were unaltered. These differences in pain perception may be associated with different pain mechanisms: in the case of sex, differences in opioid activity and baroreceptor-regulated pain systems; in the case of race, unmeasured psychological characteristics are suggested by the larger differences in ratings of pain unpleasantness than pain intensity. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study where the authors look to elucidate whether there was a difference in cutaneous pain perception determined by race or sex. In general, it is a very well-designed study where 2 different groups were evaluated, 1 of 27 whites and 1 of 24 African-Americans with close to half and half distribution of men and women. Pain perception was measured using pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli. Five different temperatures were used on each subject ranging from 45°C to 49°C. The pain scoring was carried upon a scale from 0 to 150 represented as a line where the evaluated subject had to mark the line at a certain height according to their pain perception. The conclusions reached in the study show that, in general, whites rated the thermal stimuli less painful than African-Americans. The results show a tendency for men to rate the thermal stimuli as less painful than women did. One of the interesting findings in this study was that the pain differences between men and women were diminished after statically adjusting for systolic blood pressure level. However, the pain intensity and the pain differences after adjusting for systolic blood pressure were unaltered for race differences. In addition, it was also found that pain perception and pain rating was inversely proportional to systolic blood pressure. The hypoalgesia caused by increased systolic blood pressure is a poorly understood mechanism. Several studies have shown that in hypertensive rats there is increased opioid activity in brain tissue. These studies have suggested that at the increase of the pain threshold in subjects who have elevated blood pressure may be related to opioid activity. It is important to mention that in order to establish a definite correlation between systolic blood pressure elevation and the decreased pain perception more studies have to be done. Another important point in this study is the influence of psychological factors on pain perception. In general, it was seen that individuals that were psychologically rated as depressive had a higher rating of the pain compared to individuals that tested as high for anxiety.

AB  - Regional pain syndrome: a distinct clinical entity associated with HLA-DR13. (Leiden University Medical center. Leiden, The Netherlands) Ann Neurol 2000;48:113?116. This report discussed 26 patients with a distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome that progressed toward a multifocal or generalized tonic dystonia. The dystonia initiated distally, involved mainly flexor muscles, and was associated with sensory and autonomic symptoms. Dryness of the eyes or mouth and bladder and bowel disturbances were frequently reported. There was no increase in the familial prevalence of autoimmune-mediated disease. Compared with controls, a significant elevation of HLA-DR13 was found in the patients. Thus, HLA-DR13 may be a factor indicating susceptibility to this distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathic pain: from mechanisms to symptoms. (Christian-Albrechts-Univerität Kiel, Kiel, Germany) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S12?20. This review concentrates on the several independent pathophysiological mechanisms in both the peripheral and central nervous system that are responsible for sensory symptoms as well as spontaneous and evoked pains in peripheral neuropathies. These mechanisms can operate in concert in a single disease entity and also in a single patient. Distinct pathophysiological mechanisms lead to specific sensory symptoms, for example, dynamic mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. It is also possible that the pain-generating mechanism and the symptoms change during the course of the disease. A thorough analysis of sensory symptoms may reveal the underlying mechanisms that are mainly active in a particular patient. The treatment of neuropathic pain is currently unsatisfactory. In the future, drugs will be developed that address specifically the relevant combination of mechanisms. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This is an excellent article, which will be a landmark in the approach to the treatment of neuropathic pain. There are several pathophysiological mechanisms, which can cause sensitive symptoms and spontaneous or evoked pain. Mechanical or thermal hyperalgesia is caused by peripheral sensitization. Pinprick hyperalgesia is correlated to the ?wind-up? phenomenon. Allodynia has multiple triggering factors: central sensitization, central reorganization and loss of inhibitory control. Paresthesia is explained by ectopic discharges due to the accumulation of Na+ channels, as with stabbing or paroxysmal pain. A hot or burning pain can be explained by peripheral sensitization and loss of inhibitory mechanisms. This explains why not all painful syndromes respond with the same efficacy to a given treatment. Neuropathic pain can occur in very different forms. For instance, a diabetic neuropathy can be associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia, or with burning and paroxysmal pain. A different treatment is required for each of these symptoms. From now on, we must use a different criterion to label painful neuropathic syndromes. Keeping to the above example, we shall distinguish between diabetic neuropathy with allodynia and diabetic neuropathy with burning pain.

Advice on the development of a palliative care plan and on working with parents and children is also provided. Barriers to the provision of effective pediatric palliative care and potential solutions are identified. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the development and broad availability of pediatric palliative care services based on child-specific guidelines and standards. Such services will require widely distributed and effective palliative care education of pediatric health care professionals.

AB  - Intertester reliability of the McKenzie evaluation in assessing patients with mechanical low back pain. (Sunny Brook 30:368?389. In this study, patients were assessed simultaneously by 2 physical therapists trained in the McKenzie evaluation system. The therapists were randomly assigned as examiner and observer. Agreement was estimated by Kappa statistics. Forty-five subjects (47 ± 14 years), composed of 25 women and 20 men with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain were examined. The agreement between raters for selection of the McKenzie syndromes was K = 0.70, and for the derangement subsyndromes was K = 0.96. Interrater agreement for the presence of lateral shift, relevance of lateral shift, relevance of lateral component, and deformity in the sagittal plane was K = 0.52, 0.85, 0.95, and 1.00, respectively. Intertester agreement on syndrome categories in 17 patients under 55 years of age was excellent with K = 1.00. Conclude that a form of low back evaluation, using patterns of pain response to repeated end range spinal test movements, was highly reliable when performed by 2 properly trained physical therapists. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This article intends to address the ability for therapists to agree on a low back pain diagnosis using the McKenzie technique of classification. It is important for this study to select a clear clinical diagnosis in order to establish rationale for patient management and determine a prognosis. Another purpose for this study was to agree on the relevance of sagittal and frontal plane deformities using McKenzie methods in assessing patients with back pain. The subjects included adult patients with a history of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain. Patients were referred by general practitioners or specialists for treatment at an outpatient department where the study was conducted. The examination consisted of taking a history, observational evaluation of the range of motion, and completion of a specified tests movements in the sagittal, frontal, and combined planes. Subjects were allowed to communicate only with the assessor. A total of 46 patients with a history of low back pain agreed to complete the assessment. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those 55 years of age and older and those younger than 55. McKenzie identifies only 3 mechanical syndromes: 1. Postural, 2. Dysfunction, 3. Derangement. Each of these syndromes were divided into separate subsyndromes according to location of the pain and presence or absence of spinal deformities. The study concluded that therapists trained in use of the McKenzie evaluation system can be highly reliable in reaching the same conclusion in respect to classifying patients into diagnostic syndromes and subsyndromes, especially in patients under the age of 55. In contrast to other published studies, the importance of advanced training for interpretation of symptom behavior definitely leads to selection of the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Relationship between functional evaluation measures and self-assessment in nonacute low back pain. (Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada) Spine 2000;25:1817?1826. In this study, two hypotheses were examined: range of motion and velocity are controllable and inherently correlated with self-assessment; complex spinal coordination patterns such as range of lordosis cannot be controlled and are independent of self-assessment. Self-assessment questionnaires were administered, and indexes of spinal motion and coordination were measured through skin marker kinematics. The correlation between self-assessments and biomechanical measures was determined. Self-assessments of function were significantly correlated with parameters prone to regulation: range of motion, velocity, and load lifted. In contrast, little correlation was found with measures of complex spinal coordination less susceptible to conscious or affective regulation, namely, range of lordosis, and estimated segmental mobility. This effect was magnified with increased load. Self-assessment scores were significantly poorer among insurance referrals, regardless of functional status. Conclude that simple parameters of the functional examination, such as range of motion and velocity, are strongly correlated with cognitive state, and thus the information they supply is less than ideal. Complex spinal coordination is a better indicator of the degree of spinal dysfunction and enhances the process of differentiating between pain, disability, and functional impairment. Comment by Phillip S. Sizer Jr., MEd, PT. Numerous approaches to the evaluation of lumbar spine disorders have been proposed. Self-reported disability scales are frequently implemented, but outcomes can be influenced by patient psychological factors. ROM tests have been frequently used for disability rating, but difficulty is encountered in detecting submaximal patient effort. These investigators evaluated the relationships between the Quebec Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and other self-assessment measures, simple functional measures, and coordination patterns using the Spinoscope. From these measures the investigators attempted to elucidate a more accurate objective measure of biomechanical impairment independent from affective or self-assessment influences. The outcomes illustrated that, while simple ROM and velocity measures were strongly correlated with subjective index scores, complex spinal coordination measures were not correlated with the same self-assessment outcomes. Additionally, the authors suggested that simple ROM does not ensure biomechanical normalcy in movement. Furthermore, they suggested that complex coordination measures that include Range of Lordosis (ROL) and Estimate of Inter-segmental Mobility (EISM) may serve as a better compliment to the clinical examination findings associated with lumbar conditions. Finally, they suggested that loading the spine during coordination testing further distances the outcomes from the subjective influence of pain and other factors. These measures may be superior to traditional measures for accurate diagnosis and return-to-work decisions with patients suffering from seemingly vague conditions, such as nonspecific low back pain.

AB  - The role of physical exercise and inactivity in pain recurrence and absenteeism from work after active outpatient rehabilitation for recurrent or chronic low back pain: A follow-up study. (DBC International, Vantaa, Finland) Spine 2000;25:1809?1816. This study analyzed the role of physical exercise and inactivity on long-term outcome after active outpatient low back rehabilitation. One hundred twenty-five patients with low back pain, who had participated in a 12-week active low back rehabilitation program, were asked about subjective pain and disability on the average of 14 months after the treatment. The outcomes were defined as a recurrence of persistent pain and work absenteeism, and a survival or failure analysis was performed between those who had continued exercising and who had been physically inactive. Recurrences of persistent pain during the follow-up period were fewer (P = 0.03) among those who had maintained regular exercise habits after the treatment than among those who had been physically inactive. Similarly, work absenteeism was less (P < 0.01) among physically active than among physically inactive persons. However, patients with good outcome in pain reduction after low back pain rehabilitation were more likely to participate in physical exercise. Conclude that exercises are beneficial after guided treatment in the maintenance of the results of active treatment for recurrent chronic low back pain in the long term, but those with less favorable outcome in rehabilitation are less likely to participate in exercises afterward. In active treatment programs, it is recommended that exercises be incorporated after the guided treatment. Comment by Phillip S. Sizer Jr., MEd, PT. Historically, clinicians have instructed their patients to use trunk exercise to reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms and functional losses associated with low back pain (LBP). Through the years increasing evidence has supported this notion. However, fewer investigators have evaluated the impact of exercise after the rehabilitation process has been completed. This investigation performed this evaluation and found that regular, postrehabilitation exercise improved long-term outcomes for patients who had previously suffered from LBP. Specifically, the investigators reported that ongoing exercise performed after an active outpatient rehabilitation program reduced recurrence of symptoms and absenteeism from work, especially after 1 year postonset. Additionally, these benefits did not appear to differ for those involved in self-guided exercises versus those participating in a guided program with back-specific devices in an outpatient treatment unit. This very interesting article reveals several pearls for the practitioner. First, subjects were not recruited on a voluntary basis, so to avoid attracting a group with good self-motivation to alleviate their prevailing symptoms. This measure allows the outcomes to be applicable to a varied clinical population. Secondly, although the results favored the use of a guided program with back specific devices over self-guided exercise, there were no statistical differences between the 2 approaches. Thus, patients can benefit from self-monitored exercise even when they do not have access to a guided program using specific devices. Finally, the investigators revealed that poor clinical rehabilitation outcomes predicted postrehabilitation inactivity and reduced success with posttreatment exercise. Thus, the effectiveness of the rehabilitation process may influence patient's activity level and success of exercise after rehabilitation.

AB  - Generating a learning curve for pediatric caudal epidural blocks: an empirical evaluation of technical skills in novice and experienced anesthetists. (Institute of Anesthesiology, Lucerne, Switzerland) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:385?388. The aim of this study was to assess the number of caudal blocks needed to guarantee a high success rate in performing caudal epidural analgesia in children. The technical skills of 7 residents in anesthesiology who performed caudal blocks were evaluated during 4 months using a standardized self-evaluation questionnaire. At the start of the study period, the residents had no prior experience in pediatric anesthesia or in performing caudal epidural blocks. All residents entered the pediatric rotation after a minimum of 1 year of training in adult general and regional anesthesia. The blocks were rated using a binary score. For comparison, the success rates of 8 experienced staff anesthesiologists were collected during the same period using the same self-evaluation questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed by generating individual and institutional learning curves using the pooled data. The learning curves were calculated with the aid of a least-square fit model and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by a Monte-Carlo procedure with a bootstrap technique. The success rate of residents was 80% after 32 procedures (95% confidence interval of 0.59 to 1.00). The pooled success rate of the staff anesthesiologists was 0.73 (mean) with a standard deviation of 0.45, which was not statistically different from the success rate of the residents. Conclude that high success rates in performing caudal anesthesia in pediatric patients can be acquired after a limited number of cases. Success rates of residents learning this procedure are comparable to the results of the staff anesthesiologists.

AB  - Motor blockade by brachial plexus block in the sheep. (Université de Rennes, Rennes, France) Anesthesiology 2000;93:292?294. This report aimed to evaluate the approach of the brachial plexus block in a sheep model using bupivacaine. Blocks were performed with electrical stimulation using a 50mm insulated needle. When muscle twitches were elicited with 0.5-mA impulses, drug solutions were injected over a 1-min period. Nerve stimulation and injection of methylene blue were performed in two sheep that were killed 2 h later for postmortem anatomic control of setting injection. Twenty-three nerve stimulations were achieved; the brachial plexus was reached in less than 5 min and within 5-cm depth (range, 1.5?4.5 cm). Sheep cadaver dissection showed no visible vital structure in close proximity to the site of injection. Dissection records confirmed that the brachial plexus anatomy of sheep was close to that of humans. An optimal distribution of contrast medium was obtained with 30-mL volume. Usually 1?2 min was sufficient to recover from anesthesia and to allow motor evaluation. No apparent sign of cardiac or central nervous system toxicities were recorded with any dose (0.5?4.3 mg/kg). All animals demonstrated a complete recovery, and no sequelae were recorded. Conclude that the brachial plexus block was performed easily in sheep and produced a motor block that varied in a dose-related fashion. This model may be useful for assessing regional anesthesia of new drugs and/or new drug delivery. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. Two questions ran through my mind as I read this manuscript. One, is there a need for an animal model for brachial plexus block, the other, is the sheep the model of choice? The investigators state that ?laboratory animal studies are necessary models for the assessment of new drugs and/or drug delivery systems used in regional anesthesia.? They indicate that with the exception of sciatic nerve block in rats, there are few data in the literature. This does not directly answer the question of whether or not there is a need for an animal model for brachial plexus block evaluation. To be positive, assume there is a need and then move to the question of whether or not the sheep would be the appropriate model. The investigators describe variations between the sheep and humans with respect of the origin of the brachial plexus and the phrenic nerves. What is not stated is that the gross anatomical morphology of humans and sheep are quite different, which may or may not be significant. Again to be positive, assume that the difference is not significant. If we accept that there is a need for an animal model and that the sheep is a suitable model, then we must ask what is it we want to do with the model? It would have been helpful if the investigators provided some suggestions for future studies. While recognizing the importance of animal models in advancing the science and art of regional anesthesia, I believe there is limited need for an animal model to evaluate brachial plexus block and have reservation regarding the utility of sheep as a model for such studies. I believe that most inquiries regarding brachial plexus block can be conducted safely on humans.

AB  - Effects of radolmidine, a novel α2-adrenergicagonist compared with dexmedetomidine in different pain models in the rat. (University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland) Anesthesiology 2000;93:473?481. This study determined the antinociceptive and sedative effects of radolmidine in different models of acute and chronic pain. Dexmedetomidine and saline served as controls. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied in acute pain (tail flick), carrageenan inflammation, and the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain. Mechanical allodynia was assessed with von Frey filaments, cold allodynia with the acetone test, and thermal hyperalgesia with the paw flick test. Locomotor activity-vigilance was assessed in a dark field. Dexmedetomidine and radolmidine were administered intrathecally in doses of 0.25 ?g, 2.5 ?g, and 10 ?g. In the tail flick test, radolmidine showed a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect, being equipotent compared with dexmedetomidine. In carrageenan inflammation, intrathecal doses of 2.5 ?g or 5 ?g of dexmedetomidine/radolmidine produced significant antinociception compared with saline (P < 0.01). The two drugs were equianalgesic. In the neuropathic pain model, an intrathecal dose of 5 ?g dexmedetomidine-radolmidine had a significant antiallodynic effect compared with saline (P < 0.01). The 2 drugs were equipotent. Intrathecal administration of both dexmedetomidine and radolmidine dose dependently decreased spontaneous locomotor activity-vigilance, but this effect was significantly smaller after intrathecal administration of radolmidine than after intrathecal dexmedetomidine. Conclude radolmidine and dexmedetomidine had equipotent antinociceptive effects in all tests studied. However, radolmidine caused significantly less sedation than dexmedetomidine, probably because of a different pharmacokinetic profile.

AB  - Effect of pretreatment with intrathecal excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists on the development of pain behavior caused by plantar incision. (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) Anesthesiology 2000;93:489?496. This study examined the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluRs) on the development of pain behavior after plantar incision. Rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were anesthetized with halothane. Fifteen minutes before an incision was made, drug [40 nmol MK-801; 20 nmol NBQX; or 200 nmol [(+)-MCPG] or vehicle was injected intrathecally followed by an infusion of the same drug for 75 min. Withdrawal thresholds to calibrated von Frey filaments applied adjacent to the wound and response frequencies to a blunt mechanical stimulus applied directly to the wound were measured before incision and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after incision and then once daily for 6 days. Preincision treatments with antagonists against the NMDA (MK-801) and Group I and II metabotropic receptors [(+)-MCPG] did not inhibit the development of mechanical hyperalgesia caused by incision. Preincision treatment with the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX increased withdrawal thresholds at 1 and 2 h and on postoperative day 1 compared with the vehicle group; response frequencies were reduced 1 and 2 h after incision and on postoperative day 2 (P < 0.05). In an additional group, postincision treatment with NBQX was similar to preincision treatment. Conclude spinal NMDA and MGluR antagonists may not be useful for preventing postsurgical pain. Spinal non-NMDA receptor antagonists reduced pain behaviors, but a preventive effect using preincision treatment was not apparent. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The incisional model using rats was developed by Dr. Brennan and colleagues for the study of acute surgical pain. In a previous study, they showed that blockade of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors, but not blockade of NMDA receptors nor mGluR receptors reduces postincisional pain if administered after the incision is made. This study shows the same is true if the receptor antagonists are administered before the incision is made. However, the effect is not particularly marked and; therefore, pursuit of non-MNDA excitatory amino transmitter receptor blockers for the prevention of postincisional pain would not likely be fruitful. The results of the study do require us to rethink how postincisional pain differs from other experimental pains and the phenomena of ?wind-up? attributed to activation of the NMDA receptor. Worth keeping in mind is that incisional pain does not equal surgical pain, which may involve traumatic injury to nerves and produce a neuropath pain, which strongly indicates involvement of NMDA receptors.

AB  - Longitudinal quantitative measures of the natural course of low back pain. (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) Spine 2000;25:1950?1956. This prospective study compared traditional self-report measures of low back pain recovery with quantitative measure of recovery. Sixteen occupational and 16 non-occupational patients with low back pain were recruited. Recovery was monitored prospectively every 2 weeks for 3 to 6 months, using subjective work status, pain symptoms, activities of daily living, and objective functional performance probability (trunk kinematics). Return to work underestimated the percentage of subjects impaired, as compared with all other outcome measures. Symptoms, activities of daily living, and functional performance probability all showed similar patterns of recovery for 0 to 12 weeks. At 14 weeks, there was a lag in functional performance recovery. Both symptoms and activities of daily living indicated that 80% of the population was recovered, whereas functional performance indicated the figure to be 68%. Conclude that the objective kinematic functional performance measure of recovery quantifies a different aspect of impairment not evaluated by traditional subjective measures. Use of several outcome measures may lead to a better understanding of low back pain recovery or residual impairment, which may minimize the risk of recurrent injury. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. This study evaluates several traditional and not so traditional quantitative measures in the recovery of low back pain. The authors hypothesize that a better understanding of the natural course of low back pain (LBP) recovery may provide the knowledge necessary to prevent high cost recurrent low back injuries. But the relationship between acute low back pain, its recovery, and the subsequent recurrence of LBP is not studied here at all. However the study offers some other interesting information. The traditional outcome measure ?back to work? is a very insensitive one. It depends on the job rather than the severity of the LBP. A relatively new functional outcome measure was introduced: the lumbar motion monitor, a device that evaluates trunk kinematics. This measure seems more important in later stages of recovery.

AB  - Sympathetic innervation and function in reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) Ann Neurol 2000;48:49?59. This study examined sympathetic neurocirculatory function and the role of sympathetic postganglionic nerve traffic in maintaining the pain in 30 patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Most had had the condition for more then 1 year, and 14 had undergone sympathectomy for the pain. Positron emission tomographic scanning after administration of 13N-ammonia was used to assess local perfusion, and 6-[18F]fluorodopamine was used to assess sympathetic innervation. Rates of entry of norepinephrine in the regional venous drainage (spillovers) and regional plasma levels of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (the immediate product of the rate-limiting enzymatic step in norepinephrine biosynthesis) and dihydroxyphenylglycol (the main neuronal metabolite of norepinephrine) were measured with and without intravenous trimethaphan for ganglion blockade. 13N-ammonia-derived radioactivity was less on the affected side than on the unaffected side, whereas 6-[18F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity was symmetrical. Thus, perfusion-adjusted 6-[18F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity was higher on the affected side. Norepinephrine spillover and smaller arteriovenous increments in plasma levels of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dihydroxyphenylglycol did not differ significantly between affected and unaffected limbs, although 4 patients had noticeably less norepinephrine spillover and smaller arteriovenous increments in plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol on the affected side. Trimethaphan decreased the pain in only 2 of 12 nonsympathectomized patients. The results indicate that patients with chronic unilateral reflex sympathetic dystrophy have decreased perfusion of the affected limb, symmetrical sympathetic innervation and norepinephrine synthesis, variably decreased release and turnover of norepinephrine in the affected limb, and failure of ganglion blockade to improve the pain in most cases. These findings suggest augmented vasoconstriction, intact sympathetic terminal innervation, possibly impaired sympathetic neurotransmission, and pain usually independent of sympathetic neurocirculatory outflows.

AB  - Anticonvulsants (antineuropathies) for neuropathic pain syndromes. (University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, WI) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S67?72. This review concentrated on randomized clinical trials of anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain syndromes. The discussion included the use of phenytoin, benzodiazepines, valproic acid, lamotrigine, and gabapentin (GBP). GBP has a favorable side effects profile, and based on the results of these studies, it should be considered a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. GBP mechanisms of action are still not thoroughly defined, but GBP is effective in relieving indexes of allodynia and hyperalgesia in animal models. It still remains to be seen whether GBP is as effective in other painful disorders. One small clinical trial with lamotrigine demonstrated improved pain control in trigeminal neuralgia. Evidence in support of the efficacy of anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain continues to evolve, and benefits have been clearly demonstrated in the case of GBP and carbamazepine. More advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain syndromes should further our opportunities to establish the role of anticonvulsants in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. The clinical efficacy of anticonvulsants is clearly established after years of use in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. However, there are few controlled studies to support their clinical efficacy. Not all anticonvulsant drugs have the same mode of action, which explains why their relief of the different symptoms of neuropathic pain (allodynia, hyperalgesia, burning pain, etc.) is varied. Gabapentine is a first-choice drug for relieving allodynia and hyperalgesia, but it is usually less effective for decreasing paresthesia and dysaesthesia. This article does not refer to clonazepam (a benzodiazepine acting on GABA, which is useful in stabbing pain) or topiramate. The latter is an antiepileptic drug with a good profile for the treatment of neuropathic pain. It has a triple action mechanism: Na+ channel blockade, increased GABA transmission, and antagonism of the kainate-glutamate/AMPA.

AB  - New analgesics for neuropathic pain: the lidocaine patch. (North Shore University Hospital, Syosset, NY) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S62?266. This article reviewed the basis for the development of the lidocaine patch and reviewed the reports of the clinical studies published. Potential uses of the lidocaine patch for other conditions in addition to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) were also discussed. Conclude that it has been clearly established that the lidocaine patch is a safe and effective treatment for PHN and it is recommended as a first-line treatment based on demonstrated efficacy, quick onset of action, lack of systemic effects, and ease of use with other treatments. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. Intravenous lidocaine is used in pain units for the transient relief of chronic neuropathic pain. If the analgesic result is satisfactory, some physicians start treatment with a lidocaine analogue, oral mexylithene. However, the latter drug is not always well tolerated and its efficacy (in my opinion) is far lower than that of intravenous lidocaine. The recently marketed lidocaine patch is a highly recommended therapeutic alternative if we are considering long-term treatment with lidocaine. Topical agents act locally (skin, soft tissues, peripheral nerves) and do not cause high blood levels (no higher than 0.6 micgr/mL). Topical 5% lidocaine decreases the ectopic discharges from peripheral afferents, reducing nociceptive input to the CNS. There are few side effects and the main indication is postherpetic neuralgia and all those syndromes with peripheral neuropathic pain. The relief that can be expected after using topical 5% lidocaine is not complete, and it can be associated with other types of drugs (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, analgesics, etc.) to obtain a synergistic effect.
