AB  - D. Sheffield, P.L. Biles, H. Orom, W. Maixner, D.S. Sheps: Race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC) Psychosomatic Medicine 2000;62:517?523. The purpose of this study was to determine race and sex differences in cutaneous pain perception. Pain perception was measured using a suprathreshold evaluation of pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli in 27 whites (14 men and 13 women) and 24 African-Americans (12 men and 12 women). Blood pressure, depressive symptoms, anxiety state levels, and negative mood were assessed before pain testing to examine whether they might account for any sex or race differences in pain perception that emerged. African-Americans rated the stimuli as more unpleasant and showed a tendency to rate it as more intense than whites. Women showed a tendency to rate the stimuli as more unpleasant and more intense than men. In addition, systolic blood pressure was inversely related to pain intensity. After statistically adjusting for systolic blood pressure, sex differences in pain unpleasantness were reduced and sex differences in pain intensity were abolished; race differences were unaltered. These differences in pain perception may be associated with different pain mechanisms: in the case of sex, differences in opioid activity and baroreceptor-regulated pain systems; in the case of race, unmeasured psychological characteristics are suggested by the larger differences in ratings of pain unpleasantness than pain intensity. Comment by Mauricio Orbegozo, MD. This is a study where the authors look to elucidate whether there was a difference in cutaneous pain perception determined by race or sex. In general, it is a very well-designed study where 2 different groups were evaluated, 1 of 27 whites and 1 of 24 African-Americans with close to half and half distribution of men and women. Pain perception was measured using pain intensity and pain unpleasantness to a series of thermal stimuli. Five different temperatures were used on each subject ranging from 45°C to 49°C. The pain scoring was carried upon a scale from 0 to 150 represented as a line where the evaluated subject had to mark the line at a certain height according to their pain perception. The conclusions reached in the study show that, in general, whites rated the thermal stimuli less painful than African-Americans. The results show a tendency for men to rate the thermal stimuli as less painful than women did. One of the interesting findings in this study was that the pain differences between men and women were diminished after statically adjusting for systolic blood pressure level. However, the pain intensity and the pain differences after adjusting for systolic blood pressure were unaltered for race differences. In addition, it was also found that pain perception and pain rating was inversely proportional to systolic blood pressure. The hypoalgesia caused by increased systolic blood pressure is a poorly understood mechanism. Several studies have shown that in hypertensive rats there is increased opioid activity in brain tissue. These studies have suggested that at the increase of the pain threshold in subjects who have elevated blood pressure may be related to opioid activity. It is important to mention that in order to establish a definite correlation between systolic blood pressure elevation and the decreased pain perception more studies have to be done. Another important point in this study is the influence of psychological factors on pain perception. In general, it was seen that individuals that were psychologically rated as depressive had a higher rating of the pain compared to individuals that tested as high for anxiety.

AB  - Regional pain syndrome: a distinct clinical entity associated with HLA-DR13. (Leiden University Medical center. Leiden, The Netherlands) Ann Neurol 2000;48:113?116. This report discussed 26 patients with a distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome that progressed toward a multifocal or generalized tonic dystonia. The dystonia initiated distally, involved mainly flexor muscles, and was associated with sensory and autonomic symptoms. Dryness of the eyes or mouth and bladder and bowel disturbances were frequently reported. There was no increase in the familial prevalence of autoimmune-mediated disease. Compared with controls, a significant elevation of HLA-DR13 was found in the patients. Thus, HLA-DR13 may be a factor indicating susceptibility to this distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathic pain: from mechanisms to symptoms. (Christian-Albrechts-Univerität Kiel, Kiel, Germany) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S12?20. This review concentrates on the several independent pathophysiological mechanisms in both the peripheral and central nervous system that are responsible for sensory symptoms as well as spontaneous and evoked pains in peripheral neuropathies. These mechanisms can operate in concert in a single disease entity and also in a single patient. Distinct pathophysiological mechanisms lead to specific sensory symptoms, for example, dynamic mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. It is also possible that the pain-generating mechanism and the symptoms change during the course of the disease. A thorough analysis of sensory symptoms may reveal the underlying mechanisms that are mainly active in a particular patient. The treatment of neuropathic pain is currently unsatisfactory. In the future, drugs will be developed that address specifically the relevant combination of mechanisms. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This is an excellent article, which will be a landmark in the approach to the treatment of neuropathic pain. There are several pathophysiological mechanisms, which can cause sensitive symptoms and spontaneous or evoked pain. Mechanical or thermal hyperalgesia is caused by peripheral sensitization. Pinprick hyperalgesia is correlated to the ?wind-up? phenomenon. Allodynia has multiple triggering factors: central sensitization, central reorganization and loss of inhibitory control. Paresthesia is explained by ectopic discharges due to the accumulation of Na+ channels, as with stabbing or paroxysmal pain. A hot or burning pain can be explained by peripheral sensitization and loss of inhibitory mechanisms. This explains why not all painful syndromes respond with the same efficacy to a given treatment. Neuropathic pain can occur in very different forms. For instance, a diabetic neuropathy can be associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia, or with burning and paroxysmal pain. A different treatment is required for each of these symptoms. From now on, we must use a different criterion to label painful neuropathic syndromes. Keeping to the above example, we shall distinguish between diabetic neuropathy with allodynia and diabetic neuropathy with burning pain.

This article presented an integrated model for providing palliative care for children living with a life-threatening or terminal condition. Advice on the development of a palliative care plan and on working with parents and children is also provided. Barriers to the provision of effective pediatric palliative care and potential solutions are identified. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the development and broad availability of pediatric palliative care services based on child-specific guidelines and standards. Such services will require widely distributed and effective palliative care education of pediatric health care professionals. The Academy offers guidance on responding to requests for hastening death, but does not support the practice of physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia of children.

AB  - Intertester reliability of the McKenzie evaluation in assessing patients with mechanical low back pain. (Sunny Brook 30:368?389. In this study, patients were assessed simultaneously by 2 physical therapists trained in the McKenzie evaluation system. The therapists were randomly assigned as examiner and observer. Agreement was estimated by Kappa statistics. Forty-five subjects (47 ± 14 years), composed of 25 women and 20 men with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain were examined. The agreement between raters for selection of the McKenzie syndromes was K = 0.70, and for the derangement subsyndromes was K = 0.96. Interrater agreement for the presence of lateral shift, relevance of lateral shift, relevance of lateral component, and deformity in the sagittal plane was K = 0.52, 0.85, 0.95, and 1.00, respectively. Intertester agreement on syndrome categories in 17 patients under 55 years of age was excellent with K = 1.00. Conclude that a form of low back evaluation, using patterns of pain response to repeated end range spinal test movements, was highly reliable when performed by 2 properly trained physical therapists. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This article intends to address the ability for therapists to agree on a low back pain diagnosis using the McKenzie technique of classification. It is important for this study to select a clear clinical diagnosis in order to establish rationale for patient management and determine a prognosis. Another purpose for this study was to agree on the relevance of sagittal and frontal plane deformities using McKenzie methods in assessing patients with back pain. The subjects included adult patients with a history of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain. Patients were referred by general practitioners or specialists for treatment at an outpatient department where the study was conducted. The examination consisted of taking a history, observational evaluation of the range of motion, and completion of a specified tests movements in the sagittal, frontal, and combined planes. Subjects were allowed to communicate only with the assessor. A total of 46 patients with a history of low back pain agreed to complete the assessment. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those 55 years of age and older and those younger than 55. McKenzie identifies only 3 mechanical syndromes: 1. Postural, 2. Dysfunction, 3. Derangement. Each of these syndromes were divided into separate subsyndromes according to location of the pain and presence or absence of spinal deformities. The study concluded that therapists trained in use of the McKenzie evaluation system can be highly reliable in reaching the same conclusion in respect to classifying patients into diagnostic syndromes and subsyndromes, especially in patients under the age of 55. In contrast to other published studies, the importance of advanced training for interpretation of symptom behavior definitely leads to selection of the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Relationship between functional evaluation measures and self-assessment in nonacute low back pain. (Concordia University, Montréal, Québec, Canada) Spine 2000;25:1817?1826. In this study, two hypotheses were examined: range of motion and velocity are controllable and inherently correlated with self-assessment; complex spinal coordination patterns such as range of lordosis cannot be controlled and are independent of self-assessment. Self-assessment questionnaires were administered, and indexes of spinal motion and coordination were measured through skin marker kinematics. The correlation between self-assessments and biomechanical measures was determined. Self-assessments of function were significantly correlated with parameters prone to regulation: range of motion, velocity, and load lifted. In contrast, little correlation was found with measures of complex spinal coordination less susceptible to conscious or affective regulation, namely, range of lordosis, and estimated segmental mobility. This effect was magnified with increased load. Self-assessment scores were significantly poorer among insurance referrals, regardless of functional status. Conclude that simple parameters of the functional examination, such as range of motion and velocity, are strongly correlated with cognitive state, and thus the information they supply is less than ideal. Complex spinal coordination is a better indicator of the degree of spinal dysfunction and enhances the process of differentiating between pain, disability, and functional impairment. Comment by Phillip S. Sizer Jr., MEd, PT. Numerous approaches to the evaluation of lumbar spine disorders have been proposed. Self-reported disability scales are frequently implemented, but outcomes can be influenced by patient psychological factors. ROM tests have been frequently used for disability rating, but difficulty is encountered in detecting submaximal patient effort. These investigators evaluated the relationships between the Quebec Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and other self-assessment measures, simple functional measures, and coordination patterns using the Spinoscope. From these measures the investigators attempted to elucidate a more accurate objective measure of biomechanical impairment independent from affective or self-assessment influences. The outcomes illustrated that, while simple ROM and velocity measures were strongly correlated with subjective index scores, complex spinal coordination measures were not correlated with the same self-assessment outcomes. Additionally, the authors suggested that simple ROM does not ensure biomechanical normalcy in movement. Furthermore, they suggested that complex coordination measures that include Range of Lordosis (ROL) and Estimate of Inter-segmental Mobility (EISM) may serve as a better compliment to the clinical examination findings associated with lumbar conditions. Finally, they suggested that loading the spine during coordination testing further distances the outcomes from the subjective influence of pain and other factors. These measures may be superior to traditional measures for accurate diagnosis and return-to-work decisions with patients suffering from seemingly vague conditions, such as nonspecific low back pain.

AB  - The role of physical exercise and inactivity in pain recurrence and absenteeism from work after active outpatient rehabilitation for recurrent or chronic low back pain: A follow-up study. (DBC International, Vantaa, Finland) Spine 2000;25:1809?1816. This study analyzed the role of physical exercise and inactivity on long-term outcome after active outpatient low back rehabilitation. One hundred twenty-five patients with low back pain, who had participated in a 12-week active low back rehabilitation program, were asked about subjective pain and disability on the average of 14 months after the treatment. The outcomes were defined as a recurrence of persistent pain and work absenteeism, and a survival or failure analysis was performed between those who had continued exercising and who had been physically inactive. Recurrences of persistent pain during the follow-up period were fewer (P = 0.03) among those who had maintained regular exercise habits after the treatment than among those who had been physically inactive. Similarly, work absenteeism was less (P < 0.01) among physically active than among physically inactive persons. However, patients with good outcome in pain reduction after low back pain rehabilitation were more likely to participate in physical exercise. Conclude that exercises are beneficial after guided treatment in the maintenance of the results of active treatment for recurrent chronic low back pain in the long term, but those with less favorable outcome in rehabilitation are less likely to participate in exercises afterward. In active treatment programs, it is recommended that exercises be incorporated after the guided treatment. Comment by Phillip S. Sizer Jr., MEd, PT. Historically, clinicians have instructed their patients to use trunk exercise to reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms and functional losses associated with low back pain (LBP). Through the years increasing evidence has supported this notion. However, fewer investigators have evaluated the impact of exercise after the rehabilitation process has been completed. This investigation performed this evaluation and found that regular, postrehabilitation exercise improved long-term outcomes for patients who had previously suffered from LBP. Specifically, the investigators reported that ongoing exercise performed after an active outpatient rehabilitation program reduced recurrence of symptoms and absenteeism from work, especially after 1 year postonset. Additionally, these benefits did not appear to differ for those involved in self-guided exercises versus those participating in a guided program with back-specific devices in an outpatient treatment unit. This very interesting article reveals several pearls for the practitioner. First, subjects were not recruited on a voluntary basis, so to avoid attracting a group with good self-motivation to alleviate their prevailing symptoms. This measure allows the outcomes to be applicable to a varied clinical population. Secondly, although the results favored the use of a guided program with back specific devices over self-guided exercise, there were no statistical differences between the 2 approaches. Thus, patients can benefit from self-monitored exercise even when they do not have access to a guided program using specific devices. Finally, the investigators revealed that poor clinical rehabilitation outcomes predicted postrehabilitation inactivity and reduced success with posttreatment exercise. Thus, the effectiveness of the rehabilitation process may influence patient's activity level and success of exercise after rehabilitation.

AB  - Brachial plexus anesthesia with verapamil and/or morphine. (Baystate Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine, Springfield, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:379?383. This study examined the analgesic effects of administering morphine, verapamil, or its combination into the brachial plexus sheath with lidocaine in 75 patients undergoing upper extremity orthopedic surgery. All patients received brachial plexus anesthesia with 40 mL of 1.5% lidocaine and epinephrine 5 ?g/mL. Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 groups: Group 1 received IV saline; Group 2 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg; Group 3 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; Group 4 received IV morphine 5 mg and verapamil 2.5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; and Group 5 received verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution. Postoperatively, patients rated their pain (0?10) at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. Patients were instructed to take 1 acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone 5 mg tablet every 3 h whenever the pain score exceeded 3. Analgesic duration was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with morphine (Groups 3 and 5) (P < 0.005). The total 24 h acetaminophen/oxycodone was also less in Groups 3 and 5 (P < 0.03). Duration of anesthesia (time of abolition of pinprick response) was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with verapamil (Groups 4 and 5) (P = 0.002). Conclude that the addition of verapamil to the brachial plexus block with lidocaine can prolong the duration of sensory anesthesia, but it had no effect on analgesic duration of 24-h analgesic use. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. It is well established that calcium channel blockers potentiate analgesic effects of both local anesthetics and opioids. A desire for improvement of the quality and duration of brachial plexus blockade has led many investigators to study various agents in addition to standard local anesthetics. This interesting double-blinded study involving 82 patients scheduled for elective upper extremity orthopedic surgery involved 5 groups. Interestingly, the combination of verapamil and morphine via the brachial plexus did not provide any additional analgesic effect, which is different than previous studies. The subjectivity of telephone data and the relatively small sample size in each arm of this study make statistically significant findings harder to ascertain and relevant changes in clinical practice less convincing. Further, the authors do not appropriately note the complexity of calcium channel pharmacology and its overall role in opioid as well as local anesthetic modulation. Future studies with more precise endpoints for efficacy and duration are warranted if clinical practice is to be altered and accepted by the practitioner.

AB  - An in vitro study of dural lesions produced by 25-gauge Quincke and Whitacre needles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. (Hospital de Mostoles, Madrid Spain) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:393?402. This study evaluated the dural lesions produced by Whitacre and Quincke spinal needles in the external and internal surface of the dura mater of the lower spine area in an attempt to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of postdural puncture headaches (PDPH). The T11-L4 dural membranes from 5 fresh (immediately after extraction of organs for transplantation) male patients declared brain dead, ages 23, 46, 48, 55, and 60, were excised by anterior laminectomy. Morphologic orientation of the membrane and normal pH were maintained; 100 punctures at 90-degree angles were done with a new needle each time, 50 with 25-gauge Whitacre and 50 with 25-gauge Quincke needles. Half of the punctures with the Quincke needles were done with the bevel in the parallel direction to the axis of the spinal cord, and the rest with the bevel perpendicular to it. Fixation in solutions of 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer, followed by dehydration with acetone, was done 15 min after the punctures. The acetone was removed and the specimens were metallized with carbon followed by gold and inspected under a scanning electron microscope. When the area of the dural lesions found in the external and internal surfaces produced by the 2 types of needles was compared, no significant differences were found. The percentage of lesion closing area with the Quincke needles was 88.3% and 82.7% in the external and internal surfaces, respectively. With the Whitacre needles, the percentage of closing was 86.8% and 84.8% in the epidural and arachnoid surfaces, respectively. There were differences noted in the morphology of the lesions. The Whitacre needles produced coarse lesions with significant destruction in the dura's fibers while the Quincke needles produced a ?U?-shaped lesion (flap) that mimics the opened lid of a tin can, regardless of the tip's direction. Conclude that the needles produced lesions in the dura with different morphology and characteristics. Lesions with the Quincke needles resulted in a clean-cut opening in the dural membrane while the Whitacre needle produced a more traumatic opening with tearing and severe disruption of the collagen fibers. The lower incidence of PDPH seen in the Whitacre needles may be explained, in part, by the inflammatory reaction produced by the tearing of the collagen fibers after dural penetration. The inflammatory reaction may result in a significant edema, which may act as a plug limiting the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article that explains why a patient will develop a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after receiving a spinal with a Quincke needle and not after a Whitacre-type needle. The explanation is based more upon an inflammatory reaction than the direction of the needle cut. The Quincke needle appears to make a sharp cut while the Whitacre needle induced an inflammatory response including edema, which could block off the dura from leaking. It is very interesting that the response seen after the Whitacre needle was utilized occurred as quickly as it did. The article introduces the question as to whether a Quincke needle or a Whitacre needle is associated with more trauma to the dura, and which is better for decreasing the incidence of PDPD.

AB  - Tip-holed spinal needle: a new design concept. (Sir Salimullah Medical College and Mitford Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:403?407. This article discussed new technology regarding the production of finer spinal needles and described a new spinal needle tip design. Complications associated with dura-arachnoid puncture for spinal anesthesia were taken into account. Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) and needle bending are stated as being significant complications. Although pencil-point needles significantly reduce PDPH, it is stated that these needles also have their limitations such as obstruction of the delivery port by tissues affecting both cerebrospinal fluid flash back and drug delivery. The problem of tip bending was also addressed. At the center of the discussion was the newly designed spinal needle tip that was created to overcome the disadvantages of other spinal needles. Analyzing the performance of the existing needles, the conclusion was drawn that the criteria of an ideal spinal needle may be as follows: (1) the external diameter of the needle should be as thin as possible and the tip should be a dural fiber-spreading variety; (2) the shaft and tip should be capable of withstanding forces during needle placement; and (3) it should also have a drug delivery hole that does not weaken the needle or become obstructed by tissue. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This article introduces a new type of needle for performing spinal anesthesia techniques. According to the authors, classic Quincke-type needles are associated with postdural puncture headache (PDPH), while side port blunt needles may be associated with mechanical problems such as back flow or having tissue obstruct side port. Therefore, the authors designed a new type of needle that is pencil point in shape, but the removal stylet is the component that forms the pencil point. When the stylet is removed, the needle has a conical distal shape with the opening at the end. The authors believe that this ?new spreading beveled needle tip? will help alleviate problems with PDPH as well as the problems associated with side port holes. While the idea is very intriguing, it remains to be seen how successful the needle will be.

AB  - Preventing postoperative pain by local anesthetic instillation after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery: a placebo-controlled comparison of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. (Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Paris, France) Anesth Analg 2000;91:403?407. This study tested the hypothesis that local anesthetics instilled at the end of laparoscopic gynecologic procedures are able to prevent postoperative pain at wake-up and during the first 24 h. A total of 180 patients were randomly assigned into three groups to receive an intraperitoneal instillation of 20 mL of either bupivacaine 0.5% (Group B), ropivacaine 0.75% (Group R) or saline (Group S) at the end of surgery. All patients received analgesia with acetaminophen and ketoprofen IV infusions. Pain was assessed by using a 0-10 graded numerical scale (NS) every 5 min in the postanesthesia care unit and IV morphine was administered if NS was> 4. Assessment of pain continued every 4 h on the ward, and subcutaneous morphine was injected if needed to keep the NS score <4. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was rated on a 4-point scale. The morphine consumption at wake-up and over the first 24 h was significantly lower (P<0.05) in Group B (mean, 0.92 mg at wake-up; 3.08 mg over 24 h) and in Group R (mean, 0.25 mg at wake-up; 0.69 mg over 24 h), than in Group S (mean, 4.18 mg at wake up; 12.93 mg over 24 h). The morphine-sparing effect of ropivacaine was significantly greater than that of bupivacaine. Both local anesthetics were effective in the prevention of PONV. Conclude that local anesthetics should be instilled in all gynecologic patients at the end of all laparoscopic procedures.

AB  - Small-dose clonidine prolongs postoperative analgesia after sciatic-femoral nerve block with 0.75% ropivacaine for foot surgery. (University of Milan, Milan, Italy) Anesth Analg 2000;91:388?392. This study evaluated the effects of adding small-dose clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine during peripheral nerve blocks, 30 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing hallux valgus repair under combined sciatic-femoral nerve block were randomly allocated in a double-blinded fashion to receive block placement with 30 mL of either 0.75% ropivacaine alone (Group Ropivacaine, n = 15) or 0.75% ropivacaine plus ?g/kg clonidine (Group Ropivacaine-Clonidine, n = 15). Hemodynamic variables, oxygen saturation, and levels of sedation, as well as the time required to achieve surgical block and time to first analgesic request, were recorded by a blinded observer. Time to surgical blockade required 10 min in both groups. Patients in the Ropivacaine-Clonidine Group were more sedated than patients in the Ropivacaine Group only 10 min after block placement. No differences in oxygen saturation and hemodynamic variables, degree of pain measurement at first analgesic request, and consumption of postoperative analgesics were observed between the two groups. The mean time from block placement to first request for pain medication was shorter in Group Ropivacaine (13.7 h; 25th?75th percentiles: 11.8?14.5 h) than in Group Ropivacaine-Clonidine (16.8; 25th?75th percentiles: 13.5?17.8 h) (P = 0.038). Conclude that adding 1 ?g/kg clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine provided a 3-h delay in first request for pain medication after hallus valgus repair, with no clinically relevant side effects.

AB  - Analgesic mechanisms of ketamine in the presence and absence of peripheral. (Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan) Anesthesiology 2000;93:520?528. In this study, the authors investigated the contribution of the supraspinal monoaminergic descending inhibitory system to ketamine analgesia for acute nociception and inflammation-induced hyperalgesia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The paw withdrawal latencies to radiant heat stimuli were measured to assess the thermal nociceptive threshold. The analgesic effects of intrathecal or intraperitoneal ketamine were examined in the rats that received unilateral intraplantar carrageenan and in those that were untreated. In addition, it was examined whether pretreatment with intrathecal yohimbine or methysergide inhibited the analgesic effects of ketamine. Using an intrathecal microdialysis method, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid were measured after intraperitoneal ketamine in both saline- and carrageenan-treated rats. In the untreated rats, intraperitoneal but not intrathecal ketamine produced antinociceptive effects in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with intrathecal yohimbine or methysergide inhibited these antinociceptive effects. Intraplantar carrageenan significantly reduced paw withdrawal latencies on the injected paw, but not on the contralateral paw. Both intraperitoneal and intrathecal ketamine reversed the shortened paw withdrawal latencies on the injected side in a dose-dependent manner without any effects on the contralateral side. Neither yohimbine nor methysergide inhibited these antihyperalgesic effects. In analyses of monoamines, the magnitiute of increase in monoamines after intraperitoneal ketamine was significantly smaller in the carrageenan-treated rats than in the saline-treated rats. Conclude that these results demonstrated that ketamine produced antinociceptive effects through an activation of the monoaminergic descending inhibitory system, whereas, in a unilateral peripheral inflammation-induced hyperalgesic state, the monoaminergic system did not contribute to the antihyperalgesic effects of ketamine. The mechanisms of the antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic properties of ketamine are different.

AB  - Epidural infusion of ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia after major orthopedic surgery. (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands) Anesthesiology 2000;93:395?403. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine administered by 72-h epidural infusion to provide postoperative analgesia. Twenty-eight patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery during combined epidural and general anesthesia received a bolus dose of ropivacaine (50 or 70 mg), followed by constant-rate (10 mL/h) epidural infusion of ropivacaine 2 mg/mL (Group 1) or 3 mg/mL (Group 2). Total and unbound plasma concentrations of ropivacaine and pipecoloxylidide and plasma concentrations of α1-acid glycoprotein were determined. The urinary excretion of ropivacaine and major metabolites was measured. Results showed that total plasma concentrations of ropivacaine increased steadily during infusion and unbound ropivacaine concentrations reached average steady levels of approximately 0.06 and 0.07 mg/l. Total and unbound concentrations of pipecoloxylidide increased to 1.0 ± 0.4 and 0.4 ± 0.2 mg/l (Group 1) and 1.2 ± 0.4 and 0.5 ± 0.1 mg/l (Group 2) after 72 h infusion. α1-Acid glycoprotein concentrations initially decreased, but thereafter increased steadily to approximately twice the baseline values. Conclude postoperative increases in plasma α1-acid glycoprotein concentrations enhance the protein binding of ropivacaine and pipecoloxylidide, which causes divergence of total and unbound plasma concentrations.

AB  - Migraine: the evolution of our knowledge. (The New England Center for Headache, Stamford, CT) Arch Neurol 2000;57:1221?1223. This brief article described the evolution of knowledge regarding headache pain, namely migraines. By exploring historical literature, quotes related to headache pain and treatments are discussed. Early clinical developments are outlined with references to Hippocrates, Aretaeus the Cappadocian, and Galen. The theories of Thomas Willis regarding pain sensitivity are also provided. Conclude that the history of headache illustrates that the acquisition of understanding is a long-term, evolving process.

AB  - Recurrent rejection of a spinal cord stimulation system. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) Contact Dermatitis 2000;42:304?305. This case report involved a 52-year old male reflex sympathetic dystrophy patient. This brief report describes a patient who responded to spinal cord stimulation positively, but who could not continue to undergo this treatment because of inflammatory-type reactions of unknown pathophysiology. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a case report communication describing a patient who responded to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) positively, but who could not continue to undergo this modality because of inflammatory-type reactions of unknown pathophysiology. Once signs and symptoms of infection with negative bacteriological cultures had occurred for 2 consecutive times, the authors suspected contact hypersensitivity to materials of the SCS system to be the cause of rejection. Although a very rare condition, allergic reactions to cardiac pacemakers have previously been reported. In this case, a striking feature was the lack of any visible skin reaction such as rash, erythema, local swelling, or pruritus.

AB  - Applying the American Pain Society's QA standards to evaluate the quality of pain management among surgical, oncology, and hospice inpatients in Taiwan. (Taipei Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan) Pain 2000;87:43?49. The purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to apply the American Pain Society (APS) outcome questionnaire to examine and compare the quality of pain management provided in surgical, oncology, and hospice inpatient units in the Taipei area of Taiwan, and second, to provide baseline data of pain management quality in advance of the implementation of national guidelines for cancer pain management. Data revealed that hospice patients reported that they received pain medication within 15 min after they complained of pain. However, a large number of patients never asked for pain medication during hospitalization. Moreover, most patients never requested medication changes even when their perception was that their medication was not effective. The findings of this study may provide support for the effectiveness of hospices in Taiwan in pain management and provide information on the validity of the APS quality standards.

AB  - Gabapentin enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in healthy volunteers. (Dr. Margarete Fischer Bosch Institut fuer Klinische Pharmakologie, Stuttgart, Germany) Anesth Analg 2000;91:185?191. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study investigated the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction of Gabapentin (GBP) and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Morphine (60 mg, controlled release) or placebo was administered at 8:00 a.m., and GBP (600 mg) or placebo was administered at 10:00 a.m., thus comparing the analgesic effect of placebo + GBP (600 mg) with placebo + placebo and morphine (60 mg) + GBP in comparison to morphine plus placebo by using the cold pressor test. The duration and intensity of the side effects were assessed by using visual analog scales. The analgesic effect was evaluated by the change in the area under the curve of pain tolerance. Placebo + GBP did not present any significant analgesic effect compared with placebo + placebo. A siginificant increase in pain tolerance was observed comparing the combination of morphine and GBP with morphine and placebo. The observed adverse events after placebo + GBP were not significantly different compared with placebo + placebo. Morphine + placebo led to the expected opioid-mediated side effects. They were significantly more pronounced compared with placebo + placebo, but did not differ significantly compared with the combination of morphine + GBP. Concerning the pharmacokinetic variables of morphine and its glucuronides, no significant difference between morphine + placebo and morphine + GBP was observed, whereas the area under the curve of GBP significantly increased, and apparent oral clearance and apparent renal clearance of GBP decreased when morphine was administered concomitantly. These results suggest 2 different sites for the pharmacokinetic interaction?1 at the level of absoption and the other at the level of elimination. The study reveals both a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between morphine and GBP, leading to an increased analgesic effect of morphine + GBP. These results and the good tolerability of GBP should favor clinical trials investigating the clinical relevance of the combination of morphine and GBP for treating severe pain.

AB  - Pure trigeminal motor neuropathy: a case report. (Korea University Medical Center, Guro-gu, Korea) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:995?998. A 38-year-old man complaining of progressive weakness and wasting of the right masticatory muscles after a bout of mild cold symptoms is presented in this case report. No sensory symptoms were present. History, neurologic examination, electrophysiologic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain led to the diagnosis of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The cause may have been an autoimmune reaction to a viral infection. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article is a case report of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. Trigeminal motor neuropathy is defined as a trigeminal motor paralysis accompanied by no trigeminal sensory signs or other cranial nerve involvement. The author described the history of the patient and their work up including examination, laboratory tests, and electro diagnostic examinations, which all pointed to the pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The strength of this case report is the detailed description of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve and the muscular innervations of the mandubular branch. The authors attributed the motor neuropathy to a possible post viral infection autoimmune response that predominantly affected the motor division of the trigeminal nerve. They have stressed that all other potential causes of motor neuropathy should be ruled out including malignancy in mass lesions.

AB  - Glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in hemiplegic patients. (Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1999; 81:944?946. This is a case-controlled study of the relationship between glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) in hemiplegic patients set in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Thirty-five hemiplegic patients with RSD (RSD group) and 35 hemiplegic patients without RSD (non-RSD group) were included in this study. Patients with rotator cuff rupture, brachial plexus injury, or spasticity greater than stage 2 on the Ashworth scale were excluded. Both the RSD and non-RSD groups were assessed for presence and grade of subluxation from radiographs using a 5-point categorization. The degree of shoulder pain of the non-RSD group was assessed by a visual analogue scale of 10 points. Glenohumeral subluxation was found in 74.3% of the RSD group and 40% of the non-RSD group (P = 0.004). In the non-RSD group, 78.6% of the patients with subluxation and 38.1% of the patients without subluxation reported shoulder pain (P = 0.019). No correlation was found between the degree of shoulder pain and grade of subluxation in the non-RSD group (P = 0.152). Conclude that the findings suggest that shoulder subluxation may be a causative factor for RSD. Therefore, prevention and appropriate treatment of glenohumeral joint subluxation should be included in rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. Comment by Miles Day, MD. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shoulder subluxation in hemiplegic patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. They also examined if subluxation is associated with shoulder pain and the grade of subluxation in patients with subluxation and no reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Patients with injuries to the rotator cuff of the brachial plexus, marked spasticity, and major trauma to joint structures were excluded as these can be precipitating factors for RSD. The study noted a significantly higher presence of shoulder subluxation within the RSD group and the presence of pain was significantly high in patients with shoulder subluxation in the non-RSD group. The take home message of this article is that any measure or treatment that can be applied to the glenohumeral joint should be performed to eliminate the possibility of the patient developing RSD and subsequently hindering further rehabilitation in these patients.
