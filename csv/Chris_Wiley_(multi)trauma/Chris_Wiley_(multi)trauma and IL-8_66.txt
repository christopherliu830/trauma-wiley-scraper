AB  - Brachial plexus anesthesia with verapamil and/or morphine. (Baystate Medical Center and the Tufts University School of Medicine, Springfield, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:379?383. This study examined the analgesic effects of administering morphine, verapamil, or its combination into the brachial plexus sheath with lidocaine in 75 patients undergoing upper extremity orthopedic surgery. All patients received brachial plexus anesthesia with 40 mL of 1.5% lidocaine and epinephrine 5 ?g/mL. Patients were randomized to 1 of 5 groups: Group 1 received IV saline; Group 2 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg; Group 3 received IV verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; Group 4 received IV morphine 5 mg and verapamil 2.5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution; and Group 5 received verapamil 2.5 mg and morphine 5 mg was added to the lidocaine solution. Postoperatively, patients rated their pain (0?10) at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. Patients were instructed to take 1 acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone 5 mg tablet every 3 h whenever the pain score exceeded 3. Analgesic duration was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with morphine (Groups 3 and 5) (P < 0.005). The total 24 h acetaminophen/oxycodone was also less in Groups 3 and 5 (P < 0.03). Duration of anesthesia (time of abolition of pinprick response) was significantly increased in those patients receiving brachial plexus blocks with verapamil (Groups 4 and 5) (P = 0.002). Conclude that the addition of verapamil to the brachial plexus block with lidocaine can prolong the duration of sensory anesthesia, but it had no effect on analgesic duration of 24-h analgesic use. Comment by Alan David Kaye, MD, PhD. It is well established that calcium channel blockers potentiate analgesic effects of both local anesthetics and opioids. A desire for improvement of the quality and duration of brachial plexus blockade has led many investigators to study various agents in addition to standard local anesthetics. This interesting double-blinded study involving 82 patients scheduled for elective upper extremity orthopedic surgery involved 5 groups. Interestingly, the combination of verapamil and morphine via the brachial plexus did not provide any additional analgesic effect, which is different than previous studies. The subjectivity of telephone data and the relatively small sample size in each arm of this study make statistically significant findings harder to ascertain and relevant changes in clinical practice less convincing. Further, the authors do not appropriately note the complexity of calcium channel pharmacology and its overall role in opioid as well as local anesthetic modulation. Future studies with more precise endpoints for efficacy and duration are warranted if clinical practice is to be altered and accepted by the practitioner.

AB  - An in vitro study of dural lesions produced by 25-gauge Quincke and Whitacre needles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. (Hospital de Mostoles, Madrid Spain) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:393?402. This study evaluated the dural lesions produced by Whitacre and Quincke spinal needles in the external and internal surface of the dura mater of the lower spine area in an attempt to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of postdural puncture headaches (PDPH). The T11-L4 dural membranes from 5 fresh (immediately after extraction of organs for transplantation) male patients declared brain dead, ages 23, 46, 48, 55, and 60, were excised by anterior laminectomy. Morphologic orientation of the membrane and normal pH were maintained; 100 punctures at 90-degree angles were done with a new needle each time, 50 with 25-gauge Whitacre and 50 with 25-gauge Quincke needles. Half of the punctures with the Quincke needles were done with the bevel in the parallel direction to the axis of the spinal cord, and the rest with the bevel perpendicular to it. Fixation in solutions of 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer, followed by dehydration with acetone, was done 15 min after the punctures. The acetone was removed and the specimens were metallized with carbon followed by gold and inspected under a scanning electron microscope. When the area of the dural lesions found in the external and internal surfaces produced by the 2 types of needles was compared, no significant differences were found. The percentage of lesion closing area with the Quincke needles was 88.3% and 82.7% in the external and internal surfaces, respectively. With the Whitacre needles, the percentage of closing was 86.8% and 84.8% in the epidural and arachnoid surfaces, respectively. There were differences noted in the morphology of the lesions. The Whitacre needles produced coarse lesions with significant destruction in the dura's fibers while the Quincke needles produced a ?U?-shaped lesion (flap) that mimics the opened lid of a tin can, regardless of the tip's direction. Conclude that the needles produced lesions in the dura with different morphology and characteristics. Lesions with the Quincke needles resulted in a clean-cut opening in the dural membrane while the Whitacre needle produced a more traumatic opening with tearing and severe disruption of the collagen fibers. The lower incidence of PDPH seen in the Whitacre needles may be explained, in part, by the inflammatory reaction produced by the tearing of the collagen fibers after dural penetration. The inflammatory reaction may result in a significant edema, which may act as a plug limiting the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article that explains why a patient will develop a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after receiving a spinal with a Quincke needle and not after a Whitacre-type needle. The explanation is based more upon an inflammatory reaction than the direction of the needle cut. The Quincke needle appears to make a sharp cut while the Whitacre needle induced an inflammatory response including edema, which could block off the dura from leaking. It is very interesting that the response seen after the Whitacre needle was utilized occurred as quickly as it did. The article introduces the question as to whether a Quincke needle or a Whitacre needle is associated with more trauma to the dura, and which is better for decreasing the incidence of PDPD.

AB  - Tip-holed spinal needle: a new design concept. (Sir Salimullah Medical College and Mitford Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:403?407. This article discussed new technology regarding the production of finer spinal needles and described a new spinal needle tip design. Complications associated with dura-arachnoid puncture for spinal anesthesia were taken into account. Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) and needle bending are stated as being significant complications. Although pencil-point needles significantly reduce PDPH, it is stated that these needles also have their limitations such as obstruction of the delivery port by tissues affecting both cerebrospinal fluid flash back and drug delivery. The problem of tip bending was also addressed. At the center of the discussion was the newly designed spinal needle tip that was created to overcome the disadvantages of other spinal needles. Analyzing the performance of the existing needles, the conclusion was drawn that the criteria of an ideal spinal needle may be as follows: (1) the external diameter of the needle should be as thin as possible and the tip should be a dural fiber-spreading variety; (2) the shaft and tip should be capable of withstanding forces during needle placement; and (3) it should also have a drug delivery hole that does not weaken the needle or become obstructed by tissue. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This article introduces a new type of needle for performing spinal anesthesia techniques. According to the authors, classic Quincke-type needles are associated with postdural puncture headache (PDPH), while side port blunt needles may be associated with mechanical problems such as back flow or having tissue obstruct side port. Therefore, the authors designed a new type of needle that is pencil point in shape, but the removal stylet is the component that forms the pencil point. When the stylet is removed, the needle has a conical distal shape with the opening at the end. The authors believe that this ?new spreading beveled needle tip? will help alleviate problems with PDPH as well as the problems associated with side port holes. While the idea is very intriguing, it remains to be seen how successful the needle will be.

AB  - Preventing postoperative pain by local anesthetic instillation after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery: a placebo-controlled comparison of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. (Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Paris, France) Anesth Analg 2000;91:403?407. This study tested the hypothesis that local anesthetics instilled at the end of laparoscopic gynecologic procedures are able to prevent postoperative pain at wake-up and during the first 24 h. A total of 180 patients were randomly assigned into three groups to receive an intraperitoneal instillation of 20 mL of either bupivacaine 0.5% (Group B), ropivacaine 0.75% (Group R) or saline (Group S) at the end of surgery. All patients received analgesia with acetaminophen and ketoprofen IV infusions. Pain was assessed by using a 0-10 graded numerical scale (NS) every 5 min in the postanesthesia care unit and IV morphine was administered if NS was> 4. Assessment of pain continued every 4 h on the ward, and subcutaneous morphine was injected if needed to keep the NS score <4. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was rated on a 4-point scale. The morphine consumption at wake-up and over the first 24 h was significantly lower (P<0.05) in Group B (mean, 0.92 mg at wake-up; 3.08 mg over 24 h) and in Group R (mean, 0.25 mg at wake-up; 0.69 mg over 24 h), than in Group S (mean, 4.18 mg at wake up; 12.93 mg over 24 h). The morphine-sparing effect of ropivacaine was significantly greater than that of bupivacaine. Both local anesthetics were effective in the prevention of PONV. Conclude that local anesthetics should be instilled in all gynecologic patients at the end of all laparoscopic procedures.

AB  - Small-dose clonidine prolongs postoperative analgesia after sciatic-femoral nerve block with 0.75% ropivacaine for foot surgery. (University of Milan, Milan, Italy) Anesth Analg 2000;91:388?392. This study evaluated the effects of adding small-dose clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine during peripheral nerve blocks, 30 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing hallux valgus repair under combined sciatic-femoral nerve block were randomly allocated in a double-blinded fashion to receive block placement with 30 mL of either 0.75% ropivacaine alone (Group Ropivacaine, n = 15) or 0.75% ropivacaine plus ?g/kg clonidine (Group Ropivacaine-Clonidine, n = 15). Hemodynamic variables, oxygen saturation, and levels of sedation, as well as the time required to achieve surgical block and time to first analgesic request, were recorded by a blinded observer. Time to surgical blockade required 10 min in both groups. Patients in the Ropivacaine-Clonidine Group were more sedated than patients in the Ropivacaine Group only 10 min after block placement. No differences in oxygen saturation and hemodynamic variables, degree of pain measurement at first analgesic request, and consumption of postoperative analgesics were observed between the two groups. The mean time from block placement to first request for pain medication was shorter in Group Ropivacaine (13.7 h; 25th?75th percentiles: 11.8?14.5 h) than in Group Ropivacaine-Clonidine (16.8; 25th?75th percentiles: 13.5?17.8 h) (P = 0.038). Conclude that adding 1 ?g/kg clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine provided a 3-h delay in first request for pain medication after hallus valgus repair, with no clinically relevant side effects.

AB  - Analgesic mechanisms of ketamine in the presence and absence of peripheral. (Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan) Anesthesiology 2000;93:520?528. In this study, the authors investigated the contribution of the supraspinal monoaminergic descending inhibitory system to ketamine analgesia for acute nociception and inflammation-induced hyperalgesia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The paw withdrawal latencies to radiant heat stimuli were measured to assess the thermal nociceptive threshold. The analgesic effects of intrathecal or intraperitoneal ketamine were examined in the rats that received unilateral intraplantar carrageenan and in those that were untreated. In addition, it was examined whether pretreatment with intrathecal yohimbine or methysergide inhibited the analgesic effects of ketamine. Using an intrathecal microdialysis method, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid were measured after intraperitoneal ketamine in both saline- and carrageenan-treated rats. In the untreated rats, intraperitoneal but not intrathecal ketamine produced antinociceptive effects in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with intrathecal yohimbine or methysergide inhibited these antinociceptive effects. Intraplantar carrageenan significantly reduced paw withdrawal latencies on the injected paw, but not on the contralateral paw. Both intraperitoneal and intrathecal ketamine reversed the shortened paw withdrawal latencies on the injected side in a dose-dependent manner without any effects on the contralateral side. Neither yohimbine nor methysergide inhibited these antihyperalgesic effects. In analyses of monoamines, the magnitiute of increase in monoamines after intraperitoneal ketamine was significantly smaller in the carrageenan-treated rats than in the saline-treated rats. Conclude that these results demonstrated that ketamine produced antinociceptive effects through an activation of the monoaminergic descending inhibitory system, whereas, in a unilateral peripheral inflammation-induced hyperalgesic state, the monoaminergic system did not contribute to the antihyperalgesic effects of ketamine. The mechanisms of the antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic properties of ketamine are different.

AB  - Epidural infusion of ropivacaine for postoperative analgesia after major orthopedic surgery. (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands) Anesthesiology 2000;93:395?403. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine administered by 72-h epidural infusion to provide postoperative analgesia. Twenty-eight patients scheduled for major orthopedic surgery during combined epidural and general anesthesia received a bolus dose of ropivacaine (50 or 70 mg), followed by constant-rate (10 mL/h) epidural infusion of ropivacaine 2 mg/mL (Group 1) or 3 mg/mL (Group 2). Total and unbound plasma concentrations of ropivacaine and pipecoloxylidide and plasma concentrations of α1-acid glycoprotein were determined. The urinary excretion of ropivacaine and major metabolites was measured. Results showed that total plasma concentrations of ropivacaine increased steadily during infusion and unbound ropivacaine concentrations reached average steady levels of approximately 0.06 and 0.07 mg/l. Total and unbound concentrations of pipecoloxylidide increased to 1.0 ± 0.4 and 0.4 ± 0.2 mg/l (Group 1) and 1.2 ± 0.4 and 0.5 ± 0.1 mg/l (Group 2) after 72 h infusion. α1-Acid glycoprotein concentrations initially decreased, but thereafter increased steadily to approximately twice the baseline values. Conclude postoperative increases in plasma α1-acid glycoprotein concentrations enhance the protein binding of ropivacaine and pipecoloxylidide, which causes divergence of total and unbound plasma concentrations.

AB  - Recurrent rejection of a spinal cord stimulation system. (Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands) Contact Dermatitis 2000;42:304?305. This case report involved a 52-year old male reflex sympathetic dystrophy patient. This brief report describes a patient who responded to spinal cord stimulation positively, but who could not continue to undergo this treatment because of inflammatory-type reactions of unknown pathophysiology. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. This is a case report communication describing a patient who responded to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) positively, but who could not continue to undergo this modality because of inflammatory-type reactions of unknown pathophysiology. Once signs and symptoms of infection with negative bacteriological cultures had occurred for 2 consecutive times, the authors suspected contact hypersensitivity to materials of the SCS system to be the cause of rejection. Although a very rare condition, allergic reactions to cardiac pacemakers have previously been reported. In this case, a striking feature was the lack of any visible skin reaction such as rash, erythema, local swelling, or pruritus.

AB  - Applying the American Pain Society's QA standards to evaluate the quality of pain management among surgical, oncology, and hospice inpatients in Taiwan. (Taipei Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan) Pain 2000;87:43?49. The purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to apply the American Pain Society (APS) outcome questionnaire to examine and compare the quality of pain management provided in surgical, oncology, and hospice inpatient units in the Taipei area of Taiwan, and second, to provide baseline data of pain management quality in advance of the implementation of national guidelines for cancer pain management. Data revealed that hospice patients reported that they received pain medication within 15 min after they complained of pain. However, a large number of patients never asked for pain medication during hospitalization. Moreover, most patients never requested medication changes even when their perception was that their medication was not effective. The findings of this study may provide support for the effectiveness of hospices in Taiwan in pain management and provide information on the validity of the APS quality standards.

AB  - Gabapentin enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in healthy volunteers. (Dr. Margarete Fischer Bosch Institut fuer Klinische Pharmakologie, Stuttgart, Germany) Anesth Analg 2000;91:185?191. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study investigated the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction of Gabapentin (GBP) and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Morphine (60 mg, controlled release) or placebo was administered at 8:00 a.m., and GBP (600 mg) or placebo was administered at 10:00 a.m., thus comparing the analgesic effect of placebo + GBP (600 mg) with placebo + placebo and morphine (60 mg) + GBP in comparison to morphine plus placebo by using the cold pressor test. The duration and intensity of the side effects were assessed by using visual analog scales. The analgesic effect was evaluated by the change in the area under the curve of pain tolerance. Placebo + GBP did not present any significant analgesic effect compared with placebo + placebo. A siginificant increase in pain tolerance was observed comparing the combination of morphine and GBP with morphine and placebo. The observed adverse events after placebo + GBP were not significantly different compared with placebo + placebo. Morphine + placebo led to the expected opioid-mediated side effects. They were significantly more pronounced compared with placebo + placebo, but did not differ significantly compared with the combination of morphine + GBP. Concerning the pharmacokinetic variables of morphine and its glucuronides, no significant difference between morphine + placebo and morphine + GBP was observed, whereas the area under the curve of GBP significantly increased, and apparent oral clearance and apparent renal clearance of GBP decreased when morphine was administered concomitantly. These results suggest 2 different sites for the pharmacokinetic interaction?1 at the level of absoption and the other at the level of elimination. The study reveals both a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between morphine and GBP, leading to an increased analgesic effect of morphine + GBP. These results and the good tolerability of GBP should favor clinical trials investigating the clinical relevance of the combination of morphine and GBP for treating severe pain.

AB  - Pure trigeminal motor neuropathy: a case report. (Korea University Medical Center, Guro-gu, Korea) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:995?998. A 38-year-old man complaining of progressive weakness and wasting of the right masticatory muscles after a bout of mild cold symptoms is presented in this case report. No sensory symptoms were present. History, neurologic examination, electrophysiologic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain led to the diagnosis of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The cause may have been an autoimmune reaction to a viral infection. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article is a case report of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. Trigeminal motor neuropathy is defined as a trigeminal motor paralysis accompanied by no trigeminal sensory signs or other cranial nerve involvement. The author described the history of the patient and their work up including examination, laboratory tests, and electro diagnostic examinations, which all pointed to the pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The strength of this case report is the detailed description of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve and the muscular innervations of the mandubular branch. The authors attributed the motor neuropathy to a possible post viral infection autoimmune response that predominantly affected the motor division of the trigeminal nerve. They have stressed that all other potential causes of motor neuropathy should be ruled out including malignancy in mass lesions.

AB  - Glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in hemiplegic patients. (Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1999; 81:944?946. This is a case-controlled study of the relationship between glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) in hemiplegic patients set in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Thirty-five hemiplegic patients with RSD (RSD group) and 35 hemiplegic patients without RSD (non-RSD group) were included in this study. Patients with rotator cuff rupture, brachial plexus injury, or spasticity greater than stage 2 on the Ashworth scale were excluded. Both the RSD and non-RSD groups were assessed for presence and grade of subluxation from radiographs using a 5-point categorization. The degree of shoulder pain of the non-RSD group was assessed by a visual analogue scale of 10 points. Glenohumeral subluxation was found in 74.3% of the RSD group and 40% of the non-RSD group (P = 0.004). In the non-RSD group, 78.6% of the patients with subluxation and 38.1% of the patients without subluxation reported shoulder pain (P = 0.019). No correlation was found between the degree of shoulder pain and grade of subluxation in the non-RSD group (P = 0.152). Conclude that the findings suggest that shoulder subluxation may be a causative factor for RSD. Therefore, prevention and appropriate treatment of glenohumeral joint subluxation should be included in rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. Comment by Miles Day, MD. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shoulder subluxation in hemiplegic patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. They also examined if subluxation is associated with shoulder pain and the grade of subluxation in patients with subluxation and no reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Patients with injuries to the rotator cuff of the brachial plexus, marked spasticity, and major trauma to joint structures were excluded as these can be precipitating factors for RSD. The study noted a significantly higher presence of shoulder subluxation within the RSD group and the presence of pain was significantly high in patients with shoulder subluxation in the non-RSD group. The take home message of this article is that any measure or treatment that can be applied to the glenohumeral joint should be performed to eliminate the possibility of the patient developing RSD and subsequently hindering further rehabilitation in these patients.

AB  - Paraspinal electromyography in high lumbar and thoracic lesions. (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2000;79:336?342. This study aimed to use needle electromyography in the paraspinal muscles to localize the root level of a radiculopathy. Nine cases of clinically proven, isolated high lumbar or thoracic disk herniations of patients who underwent MiniPM were collected. Four were from a prospective study of 114 persons with low back pain (MiniPM had 100% sensitivity to magnetic resonance imaging-documented high disks). In the most medial ?S? column, mean MiniPM scores were 0.7 for the level above the radiologically documented lesion (3.1 at the lesion and 1.6, 1.6, and 1.1 at the 3 spinous processes below the lesion). Similar numbers were obtained in the ?M? column (slightly lateral), with no significant differences between S and M. Differences were significant between and at the level of the lesion for S (P < 0.06) and M (P < 0.01), and between the lesion level and 3 levels below for the M column (P < 0.01). Conclude that paraspinal electromyography has a higher than previously reported sensitivity for high lumbar lesions. Electromyography using MiniPM can localize some radiculopathies. The individual cases suggest that, consistent with the anatomy of the caudi equina, thoracic lesions and lateral lumbar lesions denervate only at 1 level, but more central lumbar lesions also denervate distally innervated paraspinal muscles. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This study is designed to assess the sensitivity of many MiniPM for higher-level rediculopathies, ie, lower thoracic and high lumbar, and to determine if findings are specific to the root level involved. The MiniPM is thought to assess the multifidus portion of the paraspinal muscles that are innervated from L2 to the sacrum. The clinical protocol tests the paraspinal extensively and provides a numerica score, thus eliminating some subjectivity of the EMG. The study demonstrates that MiniPM has good sensitivity for high lumbar and thoracic lesions and provides information on the level of the lesion independent of limb EMG. After reviewing the study, I agree with the authors that MiniPM is in itself not diagnostic for radiculopathy, but is only an additional test to help support other neuro physiological studies when evaluating for radiculopathy. It is not specific for diagnosing radiculopathy.

AB  - Aerobic fitness testing in patients with chronic low back pain?Which is the best test? (New England Medical Center, Boston, MA) Spine 2000;25:1704?1710. In this study, 30 participants with chronic low back pain performed three symptom-limited maximal exercise tests: a treadmill, an upper extremity ergometer, and a bicycle ergometer. The tests were administered in randomized order. Heart rate was continuously monitored and oxygen consumption in terms of mL/kg/minute was measured by indirect calorimetry each 30 seconds. The statistical difference among the tests was highly significant (P < 0.0001). The treadmill test yielded the highest peak and predicted oxygen consumption followed by the bicycle and the upper extremity ergometer test, respectively. Conclude that the treadmill test is the best test for measuring aerobic fitness levels in patients with chronic low back pain. It yielded the highest peak oxygen consumption compared with the other tests, coming closest to measuring maximal oxygen consumption. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. Aerobic conditioning has been a component of several treatment approaches in the reduction of back pain disability. The specific contribution of aerobic fitness achieved through these approaches is not always known. Chronic pain patients tend to be inactive. As a result of this inactivity muscles become inefficient at using oxygen and this results in a loss of muscle endurance and cardiac output. The purpose of this study was, 1) to determine which testing protocol yields the highest peak values of VO2, heart rates, and respiratory changes ratio in a sample of patients with CLBP; 2) to determine whether the VO2 measures between the tests are significantly different from each other; 3) to determine which factors limit performance in each of these tests; and 4) to compare values of peak VO2 and predicted VO2 max with aerobic fitness values published for normal subjects. Chronic low back pain was defined as pain persisting for 3 months or more. Patients were excluded from this study if they were taking medications that influenced heart rate or blood pressure or if they had coexisting major medical disease, amputations of one or more extremities, or acute upper or lower extremity muscular skeletal pain that would interfere with exercise testing or acute psychiatric illness. Thirty participants with chronic low back pain performed 3 symptom limited maximal exercise tests: a treadmill, upper extremity ergometer, and a bicycle ergometer. These tests were randomly administered and heart rate was continuously monitored along with oxygen consumption. Of the 3 tests, the treadmill test is the most functional because of its uses in walking, a function of everyday life. This advantage to bicycle testing is that most Americans are unaccustomed to bicycle riding. Many of the patients reported increased burning in the thigh and buttocks for sitting on a hard saddle. Most clinics have access to a treadmill making this a practical test. The treadmill test is, thus, the best measure of cardiovascular performance; deconditioning of these patients expressed itself as early fatigue of peripheral muscles due to inactively, and limiting their performance on the bicycle and UBE test.

AB  - Use of computed tomography for maxillary nerve block in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. (Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Mibu, Tochigi, Japan) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:417?419. A report of a 90-year-old woman who had a 30-year history of episodic pain in her right maxillary region is presented. An attempt to block the nerve with classic technique was made, but eliciting paresthesia could not identify the nerve. In addition, bleeding was noted after repeated attempts. To minimize complications and confirm the correct position of the needle tip, the block was planned with a suprazygomatic approach using computed tomography (CT) guidance. The needle was inserted without paresthesia. The CT scan showed the needle tip was placed at the entrance of the pterygopalatine fossa and the distribution of contrast medium spread appropriately around the pterygopalatine fossa. After confirming the clinical effect and lack of complications of the block using the local anesthetic, 0.5 mL of 7% phenol was injected. The technique resulted in complete sensory loss in the area innervated by the maxillary nerve and did so without complications. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article in which the authors describe their technique for treating trigeminal neuralgia. The authors were faced with a significant problem, which was to perform a maxillary nerve block in a patient with difficult anatomy. The approach and technique were clearly thought out with an excellent result. The axial cuts demonstrate needle position under CT scan and the appropriate spread of contrast material through the pterygopalatine fossa.

AB  - The addition of dilute epinephrine produces equieffectivenes of bupivacaine enantiomers for cutaneous analgesia in the rat. (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:410?416. This study investigated the effectiveness for cutaneous analgesia of bupivacaine (Bup) stereoisomers in male rats. As a model of infiltration anesthesia, inhibition of a nocifensive reflex by subcutaneous injection of 0.6mL of different concentrations of R-, S-, and racemic-Bup was evaluated quantitatively by the fraction of times a pinprick failed to evoke a nocifensive motor response. R-Bup was more potent in the extent of the block; however, S-Bup had a longer-lasting action at smaller doses. This significant difference was apparent when R-Bup and S-Bup were administered in equipotent doses of 0.06% and 0.075%, respectively. Co-injection of epinephrine (Epi) with these equipotent doses enhanced and prolonged the blocking effects of both Bup stereoisomers, although the dilutions of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 Epi itself induced partial, transient analgesia. At 1:2,000,000 dilution, Epi alone had no analgesic effect; however, when co-injected with the shorter-acting R-Bup (0.06%), Epi prolonged its blocking effect to equal the duration of the block evoked by equipotent S-Bup (0.075%). Conclude that R-Bup is more potent for cutaneous analgesia and that the longer duration of the block by S-Bup probably originates from vasoconstrictor activity.

AB  - Sympathetic-sensory coupling after L5 spinal nerve lesion in the rat and its relation to changes in dorsal root ganglion blood flow. (Christian-Albrechts-Universität, Kiel, Germany) Pain 2000;87:335?345. In rats 3-56 days after L5 spinal nerve lesion, the authors of this study tested the responses of axotomized afferent fibers recorded in the dorsal root of the lesioned segment to norepinephrine (NE, 0.5 ?g/kg) injected intravenously and to selective electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST). In some experiments, blood flow was measured in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by laser Doppler flowmetry. The majority of lesioned afferent fibers with spontaneous activity responded to neither LST stimulation (82.4%) nor NE (71.4%). In those that did react to LST stimulation, responses occurred only at high stimulation frequencies and they could be mimicked by nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor drugs (angiotensin II, vasopressin). Excitatory responses to LST stimulation were closely correlated with the stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG. Therefore, the activation of lesioned afferents might be brought about indirectly by an impaired blood supply to the DRG. To test this hypothesis, a strong and sustained baseline vasoconstriction in the DRG was induced by blocking endothelial nitric oxide synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) applied systemically. L-NAME enhanced baseline vascular resistance in the DRG about threefold and also increased stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions. After L-NAME, the majority of axotomized neurons with spontaneous activity were activated by LST stimulation (76%) or NE (75%). Again, activations closely followed stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG provided that a critical level of vasoconstriction was exceeded. Inhibitory responses to LST stimulation were generally rare and could be reversed to activation by prolonged stimulation or after L-NAME. These results show that sympathetic-sensory coupling occurs only in a minority of axotomized afferents after L5 spinal nerve injury. Like previous studies, they cast doubt on the notion that L5 spinal nerve lesion is a good model for sympathetically maintained pain. Since responses of lesioned afferent neurons to LST stimulation and NE could be provoked with high reliability after inducing vasoconstriction in the DRG, and since they mirrored stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions in the DRG, it appears that in this model the association of sympathetic activity with afferent discharge occurs mainly when perfusion of the DRG is impaired. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Animal research has revealed that massive ectopic afferent discharge is generated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following nerve injury. This source of ectopic firing is in addition to activity that may be generated at the nerve injury site (Tinel sign). The combined impulse barrage is almost certainly an important cause of neuropathic pain. It has been discovered recently that the intensity of the ectopic DRG barrage is modulated by sympathetic efferent activity. This is a potential link between sympathetic activity and symptomatology in sympathetic related pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy. But what is the mechanism of the sympathetic-sensory coupling? Considerable evidence indicates that axotomized DRG neurons become abnormally adrenosensitivity. Habler et al now point out an additional, indirect, coupling mechanism ? modulation of intrinsic DRG blood flow. That is, sympathetic activity may reduce DRG blood flow inducing partial ischemia, with the ischemia causing neural excitation. This finding may also have broader implications as spinal pathology can also compromise DRG blood flow. Might low back pain and sciatica, for example, derive from this same process? It is surprising that ectopic firing in the DRG has played so little part in clinical thinking and practice in patients with neuropathic pain. So far.

AB  - Perfusion of the mechanically compressed lumbar ganglion with lidocaine reduces mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in the rat. (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR) J Neurophysiol 2000;84:798?805. This study used an animal model of lumbar radiculopathy to investigate the neurological mechanisms of cutaneous hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. The rat L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was chronically compressed by inserting a hollow perforated rod into the intervertebral foramen. The DRG was constantly perfused through the hollow rod with either lidocaine or normal saline delivered by a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Behavioral evidence for neuropathic pain after DRG compression involved measuring the incidence of hindlimb withdrawals to both punctate indentations of the hind paw with mechanical probes exerting different bending forces and to light stroking of the hind paw with a cotton wisp. Behavioral results showed that for saline-treated control rats: the withdrawal thresholds for the ipsilateral and contralateral paws to mechanical stimuli decreased significantly after surgery and the incidence of foot withdrawal to light stroking significantly increased on both ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws. Local perfusion of the compressed DRG with 2% lidocaine for 7 days at a low flow-rate (1 ?l/h), or for 1 day at a high flow-rate (8 ?l/h) partially reduced the decrease in the withdrawal thresholds on the ipsilateral foot, but did not affect the contralateral foot. The incidence of foot withdrawal in response to light stroking with a cotton wisp decreased significantly on the ipsilateral foot and was completely abolished on the contralateral foot in the lidocaine treatment groups. Conclude that compression of the L5 DRG induced central pain syndrome that included bilateral mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Results also suggest that a lidocaine block, or a reduction in abnormal activity from the compressed ganglia to the spinal cord, could partially reduce mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Tonic compression of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in animal preparations, and presumably also in man, causes sensory cells to become electrically hyperexcitable. The resulting spontaneous discharge is a cause of ongoing paresthesias and pain. Many believe that in addition, this ectopic activity can trigger and maintain central sensitization in the spinal cord, resulting in tactile hypersensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in the body parts innervated by the ganglion. This second effect of ectopic DRG activity, however, is controversial. Zhang and collaborators now provide strong new support for this idea by showing that lidocaine infusion into the DRG, with consequent block of the ectopic DRG firing, considerably reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia for the duration of the infusion (weeks). Here is a novel therapeutic approach that deserves a try.
