AB  - Phantom limb pain as a manifestation of paclitaxel neurotoxicity. (Providence Hospital, Southfield, MI) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:740?742. This case report described 2 patients with prior amputation who experienced phantom limb pain (PLP) after receiving paclitaxel therapy. A third patient experienced disabling neurotoxicity in the extremity of a prior ulnar nerve and tendon transposition after receiving paclitaxel. This unique syndrome should be identified as a direct causal effect of paclitaxel. The pathophysiology of PLP and the treatment options are reviewed. Conclude that physicians should be aware that PLP can occur after initiation of paclitaxel.

AB  - Epidural abscess: case report and literature review. (Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:428?431. A case of a 72-year-old woman who underwent adrenalectomy and groin dissection for recurrent malignant melanoma under combined general and epidural anesthesia was presented. On the fourth postoperative day, she developed signs of localized infection at the epidural site and a band of reduced sensation. Further neurological signs developed before the diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging scans. She subsequently underwent emergency laminectomy and drainage of the epidural abscess. Conclude that delayed diagnosis allowed the development of significant morbidity before neurosurgical intervention and antibiotics were instituted.

AB  - Herpes zoster in the elderly: issues related to geriatrics. (Durham Veterans Affairs medical Center, Durham, NC) Clin Infect Dis 1999;28:736?739. This article reviews specific clinical and research issues of herpes zoster related to geriatric medicine. Salient epidemiological and clinical issues include the increasing probability of zoster and postherpetic neuralgia with aging, age-related decline in immunity to varicella-zoster virus, the functional and psychosocial impact of zoster on the quality of life of the elderly, illness behavior in elderly patients with zoster, and varicella-zoster virus transmission and control in the nursing home. The role of antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, and analgesics; the measurement and analysis of pain, health-related quality of life, and functional status; and the development of varicella vaccine in the management of zoster in the elderly are also emphasized. Fertile research opportunities exist within these areas for investigators interested in infectious diseases, geriatrics, and other zoster-related disciplines.

AB  - Can exercise therapy improve the outcome of microdiscectomy? (University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom) Spine 2000;25:1523?1532. This study determined the effects of a postoperative exercise program on pain, disability, psychological status, and spinal function. Twenty patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy were randomized into EXERCISE and CONTROL groups. After surgery, all patients received normal postoperative care that included advice from a physiotherapist about exercise and a return to normal activities. Six weeks after surgery, patients in the EXERCISE group undertook a 4-week exercise program that concentrated on strength and endurance of the back and abdominal muscles and mobility of the spine and hips. Assessments of spinal function were performed in all patients during the week before the surgery and at 6, 10, 26, and 52 weeks after. On each occasion, patients completed questionnaires that asked about pain, disability, and psychological status. Surgery improved pain, disability, back muscle endurance capacity and hip and lumbar mobility in both groups of patients. After the exercise program, the EXERCISE group showed further improvements. The only further improvement showed by the CONTROL group was an increase in back muscle endurance capacity. Conclude that a 4-week postoperative exercise program can improve pain, disability and spinal function in patients who undergo microdiscectomy.

This report discussed the clinical manifestations and the treatment outcome of a patient with a known diagnosis of congenital insensitivity to pain who developed a herniated cervical disc. The patient had neurologic motor weakness with ?neck and shoulder pain.? A clear radicular pattern could not be elicited. The patient underwent a successful anterior discectomy and fusion with long-term clinical and radiographic results. Conclude that patients with congenital insensitivity to pain who develop a cervical disc herniation may present with atypical symptoms not manifesting in the classic radicular pattern. Higher index of suspicion by the clinician must be practiced to make the appropriate diagnosis. Successful surgical outcome may be achieved in these patients.

AB  - Pain children: a common experience. (Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) Pain 2000;87:51?57. This study analyzed the prevalence of pain in Dutch children from 0 to 18 years of age. A random sample of 1300 children 0?3 years of age was taken from the register of population in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. In the Rotterdam area, 27 primary schools and 14 secondary schools were selected to obtain a representative sample of 5336 children from 4?18 years of age. Depending on the age of the child, a questionnaire was either mailed to the parents (0?3 years) or distributed at school (4?18 years). Of 6636 children surveyed, 5424 (82%) responded; response rates ranged from 64% to 92%, depending on the subject age and who completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents, 54% had experienced pain within the previous 3 months. Overall, a quarter of the respondents reported chronic pain (recurrent or continuous pain for more than 3 months). The prevalence of chronic pain increased with age, and was significantly higher in girls (P < 0.001). In girls, a marked increase occurred in reporting chronic pain between 12 and 14 years of age. The most common types of pain in children were limb pain, headache, and abdominal pain. Half of the respondents who had reported pain reported to have multiple pain, and one-third of the chronic pain sufferers experienced frequent and intense pain. These multiple pains and severe pains were more often reported by girls (P < 0.001). The intensity of pain was higher in the case of chronic pain (P < 0.001) and multiple pains (P < 0.001), and for chronic pain the intensity was higher for girls (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that chronic pain is a common complaint in childhood and adolescence. In particular, the high prevalence of severe chronic pain and multiple pain in girls aged 12 years and over calls for follow-up investigations documenting the various bio-psycho-social factors related to this pain.

AB  - Influence of tramadol on the ventilatory response to hypoxia in humans. (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom) Br J Anaesth 2000;85:211?216. In this study, the effect of tramadol on the ventilatory response to 7 min acute isocapnic hypoxia during steady mild hypercapnia in 14 healthy volunteers (7 male, 7 female) was studied. The acute hypoxic response was measured before and 1 h after oral placebo or tramadol (100 mg). After tramadol, ventilation during mild hypercapnia (mean 11.28 liters min?1) was significantly less (P < 0.05) than during placebo baseline (13.93 liters min?1), tramadol baseline (14.63 liters min?1), or after placebo (14.9 liters min?1), confirming that tramadol has a small depressive effect on the hypercapnic ventilatory response. There was no significant difference in the hypoxic ventilation/Spo2 response measured during the placebo baseline (0.99), placebo (1.18), tramadol baseline (0.78) or tramadol (0.68) runs. These data suggest that tramadol does not depress the hypoxic ventilatory response.

AB  - Use of computed tomography for maxillary nerve block in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. (Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Mibu, Tochigi, Japan) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:417?419. A report of a 90-year-old woman who had a 30-year history of episodic pain in her right maxillary region is presented. An attempt to block the nerve with classic technique was made, but eliciting paresthesia could not identify the nerve. In addition, bleeding was noted after repeated attempts. To minimize complications and confirm the correct position of the needle tip, the block was planned with a suprazygomatic approach using computed tomography (CT) guidance. The needle was inserted without paresthesia. The CT scan showed the needle tip was placed at the entrance of the pterygopalatine fossa and the distribution of contrast medium spread appropriately around the pterygopalatine fossa. After confirming the clinical effect and lack of complications of the block using the local anesthetic, 0.5 mL of 7% phenol was injected. The technique resulted in complete sensory loss in the area innervated by the maxillary nerve and did so without complications. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article in which the authors describe their technique for treating trigeminal neuralgia. The authors were faced with a significant problem, which was to perform a maxillary nerve block in a patient with difficult anatomy. The approach and technique were clearly thought out with an excellent result. The axial cuts demonstrate needle position under CT scan and the appropriate spread of contrast material through the pterygopalatine fossa.

AB  - The addition of dilute epinephrine produces equieffectivenes of bupivacaine enantiomers for cutaneous analgesia in the rat. (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) Anesth Analg 2000;91:410?416. This study investigated the effectiveness for cutaneous analgesia of bupivacaine (Bup) stereoisomers in male rats. As a model of infiltration anesthesia, inhibition of a nocifensive reflex by subcutaneous injection of 0.6mL of different concentrations of R-, S-, and racemic-Bup was evaluated quantitatively by the fraction of times a pinprick failed to evoke a nocifensive motor response. R-Bup was more potent in the extent of the block; however, S-Bup had a longer-lasting action at smaller doses. This significant difference was apparent when R-Bup and S-Bup were administered in equipotent doses of 0.06% and 0.075%, respectively. Co-injection of epinephrine (Epi) with these equipotent doses enhanced and prolonged the blocking effects of both Bup stereoisomers, although the dilutions of 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 Epi itself induced partial, transient analgesia. At 1:2,000,000 dilution, Epi alone had no analgesic effect; however, when co-injected with the shorter-acting R-Bup (0.06%), Epi prolonged its blocking effect to equal the duration of the block evoked by equipotent S-Bup (0.075%). Conclude that R-Bup is more potent for cutaneous analgesia and that the longer duration of the block by S-Bup probably originates from vasoconstrictor activity.

AB  - Sympathetic-sensory coupling after L5 spinal nerve lesion in the rat and its relation to changes in dorsal root ganglion blood flow. (Christian-Albrechts-Universität, Kiel, Germany) Pain 2000;87:335?345. In rats 3-56 days after L5 spinal nerve lesion, the authors of this study tested the responses of axotomized afferent fibers recorded in the dorsal root of the lesioned segment to norepinephrine (NE, 0.5 ?g/kg) injected intravenously and to selective electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST). In some experiments, blood flow was measured in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by laser Doppler flowmetry. The majority of lesioned afferent fibers with spontaneous activity responded to neither LST stimulation (82.4%) nor NE (71.4%). In those that did react to LST stimulation, responses occurred only at high stimulation frequencies and they could be mimicked by nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor drugs (angiotensin II, vasopressin). Excitatory responses to LST stimulation were closely correlated with the stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG. Therefore, the activation of lesioned afferents might be brought about indirectly by an impaired blood supply to the DRG. To test this hypothesis, a strong and sustained baseline vasoconstriction in the DRG was induced by blocking endothelial nitric oxide synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) applied systemically. L-NAME enhanced baseline vascular resistance in the DRG about threefold and also increased stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions. After L-NAME, the majority of axotomized neurons with spontaneous activity were activated by LST stimulation (76%) or NE (75%). Again, activations closely followed stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG provided that a critical level of vasoconstriction was exceeded. Inhibitory responses to LST stimulation were generally rare and could be reversed to activation by prolonged stimulation or after L-NAME. These results show that sympathetic-sensory coupling occurs only in a minority of axotomized afferents after L5 spinal nerve injury. Like previous studies, they cast doubt on the notion that L5 spinal nerve lesion is a good model for sympathetically maintained pain. Since responses of lesioned afferent neurons to LST stimulation and NE could be provoked with high reliability after inducing vasoconstriction in the DRG, and since they mirrored stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions in the DRG, it appears that in this model the association of sympathetic activity with afferent discharge occurs mainly when perfusion of the DRG is impaired. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Animal research has revealed that massive ectopic afferent discharge is generated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following nerve injury. This source of ectopic firing is in addition to activity that may be generated at the nerve injury site (Tinel sign). The combined impulse barrage is almost certainly an important cause of neuropathic pain. It has been discovered recently that the intensity of the ectopic DRG barrage is modulated by sympathetic efferent activity. This is a potential link between sympathetic activity and symptomatology in sympathetic related pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy. But what is the mechanism of the sympathetic-sensory coupling? Considerable evidence indicates that axotomized DRG neurons become abnormally adrenosensitivity. Habler et al now point out an additional, indirect, coupling mechanism ? modulation of intrinsic DRG blood flow. That is, sympathetic activity may reduce DRG blood flow inducing partial ischemia, with the ischemia causing neural excitation. This finding may also have broader implications as spinal pathology can also compromise DRG blood flow. Might low back pain and sciatica, for example, derive from this same process? It is surprising that ectopic firing in the DRG has played so little part in clinical thinking and practice in patients with neuropathic pain. So far.

AB  - Perfusion of the mechanically compressed lumbar ganglion with lidocaine reduces mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in the rat. (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR) J Neurophysiol 2000;84:798?805. This study used an animal model of lumbar radiculopathy to investigate the neurological mechanisms of cutaneous hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. The rat L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was chronically compressed by inserting a hollow perforated rod into the intervertebral foramen. The DRG was constantly perfused through the hollow rod with either lidocaine or normal saline delivered by a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Behavioral evidence for neuropathic pain after DRG compression involved measuring the incidence of hindlimb withdrawals to both punctate indentations of the hind paw with mechanical probes exerting different bending forces and to light stroking of the hind paw with a cotton wisp. Behavioral results showed that for saline-treated control rats: the withdrawal thresholds for the ipsilateral and contralateral paws to mechanical stimuli decreased significantly after surgery and the incidence of foot withdrawal to light stroking significantly increased on both ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws. Local perfusion of the compressed DRG with 2% lidocaine for 7 days at a low flow-rate (1 ?l/h), or for 1 day at a high flow-rate (8 ?l/h) partially reduced the decrease in the withdrawal thresholds on the ipsilateral foot, but did not affect the contralateral foot. The incidence of foot withdrawal in response to light stroking with a cotton wisp decreased significantly on the ipsilateral foot and was completely abolished on the contralateral foot in the lidocaine treatment groups. Conclude that compression of the L5 DRG induced central pain syndrome that included bilateral mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Results also suggest that a lidocaine block, or a reduction in abnormal activity from the compressed ganglia to the spinal cord, could partially reduce mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Tonic compression of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in animal preparations, and presumably also in man, causes sensory cells to become electrically hyperexcitable. The resulting spontaneous discharge is a cause of ongoing paresthesias and pain. Many believe that in addition, this ectopic activity can trigger and maintain central sensitization in the spinal cord, resulting in tactile hypersensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in the body parts innervated by the ganglion. This second effect of ectopic DRG activity, however, is controversial. Zhang and collaborators now provide strong new support for this idea by showing that lidocaine infusion into the DRG, with consequent block of the ectopic DRG firing, considerably reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia for the duration of the infusion (weeks). Here is a novel therapeutic approach that deserves a try.

AB  - Effect of peripheral morphine in a human model of acute inflammatory pain. (Hvidovre University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark) BR J Anaesth 2000;85:228?232. This study used a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design in a human model of acute inflammatory pain (heat injury). Eighteen healthy volunteers were studied who each received morphine locally (2 mg), morphine systemically (2 mg), or placebo on three separate study days. The subjects received morphine infiltration subcutaneously (s.c.) 1 h before heat injury (47°C, 7 min) and naloxone infiltration s.c. (0.2 mg) 2.5 h after the heat injury. Hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli were examined using von Frey hairs and thermodes, and pain was rated using a visual analogue scale. The burns produced significant hyperalgesia, but local morphine infiltration neither reduced pain during the burn, nor primary or secondary hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli after the burn. Conclude peripherally applied morphine had no acute antinociceptive effects in this human model of acute inflammatory pain. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. This study is well controlled for placebo effect and the systemic effect of subcutanuously injected morphine. One of the few criticisms that can be made is the amount of narcotic injected. This may not be enough to bind to a sufficient number of receptors. One would expect some role for peripheral opioid receptors. The other comment would be that this type of injury (mainly small fiber involvement in this case) does not represent all types of nociception and, therefore, the peripheral action of morphine can not be excluded for different types of nociception. But overall this is a convincing study, consistent with the literature.

AB  - Prospects for the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia in herpes zoster patients. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S90?100. This review discussed the results of recent studies that have identified risk factors for the development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and have implicated several peripheral and central mechanisms in its pathophysiology. These risk factors and mechanisms of PHN provide a basis for hypothesizing that combining antiviral therapy with analgesic treatment beginning as soon as possible after the onset of herpes zoster would reduce the risk of PHN beyond that achieved by antiviral therapy alone. Conclude this treatment approach would be expected to reduce the risk of PHN in herpes zoster patients by attenuating acute pain and thereby preventing the initiation of central mechanisms of chronic pain.

AB  - Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: an update. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Drugs 2000;59:1113?1126. This article provided an update on recent developments in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also been demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated. Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred antidepressant for treatment of PHN. The topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as effective as tricycline antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments for patients with PHN.

AB  - A validated, practical classification procedure for many persistent low back pain patients. (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) Pain 2000;87:89?97. This article discussed the development of a simple procedure for assigning persistent low back pain (LBP) patients to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive, hierarchically organized classes. This procedure relies on the spatial distribution of a patient's pain and the results of straight leg raise tests to make the assignment. The procedure was applied to a large group of patients who sought treatment for persistent LBP at several university affiliated tertiary care clinics, and found that the resulting 4 classes of patients were significantly different from one another in their presentation, and in the way they were evaluated and treated by physicians. Conclude that the procedure may have practical research and clinical applications.

AB  - Simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness. (University of California, Sacramento, CA) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:938?943. This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects, and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. Measurement of 3 tasks was performed on a work simulation device on 2 different days separated by 1 week. Associations between work task performance and previously reported strength measures in 6 muscle groups by hand-held dynamometry (HHD) were examined. This study was conducted in the human performance laboratory of a university and consisted of a convenience sample of ambulatory outpatients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, type I (n = 9), myotonic muscular dystrophy (n = 10), and able-bodied controls (n = 11). Mean between-session differences for work simulation tasks ranged from ?11% to +4% for peak torque and from ?12% to +12% for total work; test sessions did not differ significantly for either patient or control groups. All groups had between-session intraclass correlation coefficients usually> 0.80, which indicated good consistency. In general, correlations between peak torque during work simulation and HHD were strongest in the control group. Conclude that persons with neuromuscular weakness reliably performed the simulated work tasks examined in this investigation. Work simulation tasks may be a useful tool to assess muscular performance in persons with neuromuscular weakness. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article addresses something that is very important when evaluating patient progress during rehabilitation. It is common in rehab to evaluate muscle groups and to determine a muscular performance by using isolated muscle group testing. The problem with this is that it doesn't necessarily correlate with tasks that patients perform on a day-to-day basis. The purpose of the study was to determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work performance tasks in patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control subjects and the association between muscular performance during these work tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. The work simulation tasks included knob-turning (alternating pronation and supination), linear motion (alternating push/pull motion), and lever arm (push-down motion). This study did accomplish its goals. The peak torque and total work measured in work simulation tasks did not differ significantly between test and retest sessions for either the patients with neuropathic and myopathic weakness or the control groups. This study addresses an issue that other studies have not. Just because a patient shows improvement in strength measure by hand held dynamometry does not necessarily mean that he or she will be able to accomplish tasks that are performed at home. The main goal of rehabilitation is for patients to be able to perform activities of daily living around the house and at work. If this is not accomplished then their rehabilitation is for naught.
