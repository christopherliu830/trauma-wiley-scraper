AB  - Summary Ureteral obstructions are a major clinical problem in small animal veterinary patients most commonly associated with ureteroliths, ureteral strictures, and trigonal neoplasia of the ureterovesicular junction (UVJ). With the invasiveness and morbidity associated with traditional surgical treatments, interventional options have become the mainstay of treatment in the author's practice. The main treatment options discussed in this chapter are the use of nephrostomy tubes, ureteral stents, and subcutaneous ureteral bypass devices (SUB). Ureteral stenting is most commonly accomplished using endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance in canine patients, and surgically-assisted with fluoroscopy in feline patients. These devices are used for a variety of obstructive disorders in both dogs and cats. The main type of ureteral stent used in veterinary medicine is an indwelling soft double pigtail ureteral stent that can remain in place for numerous months to years if necessary.

AB  - The case of a 13-year-old girl with a gastric leiomyosarcoma and a pulmonary osteochondroma is presented. The association of these two tumours and extra-adrenal paraganglioma has been described as a triad by Carney. The patient is free of recurrence of the gastric tumour with no evidence of paraganglioma 10 months after the operation. To our knowledge this is the first case of the triad reported in the UK.

AB  - Abstract Brain organoids are self-assembled, three-dimensionally structured tissues that are typically derived from pluripotent stem cells. They are multicellular aggregates that more accurately recapitulate the tissue microenvironment compared to the other cell culture systems and can also reproduce organ function. They are promising models for evaluating drug leads, particularly those that target neurodegeneration, since they are genetically and phenotypically stable over prolonged durations of culturing and they reasonably reproduce critical physiological phenomena such as biochemical gradients and responses by the native tissue to stimuli. Beyond drug discovery, the use of brain organoids could also be extended to investigating early brain development and identifying the mechanisms that elicit neurodegeneration. Herein, the current state of the fabrication and use of brain organoids in drug development and medical research is summarized. Although the use of brain organoids represents a quantum leap over existing investigational tools used by the pharmaceutical industry, they are nonetheless imperfect systems that could be greatly improved through bioengineering. To this end, some key scientific challenges that would need to be addressed in order to enhance the relevance of brain organoids as model tissue are listed. Potential solutions to these challenges, including the use of bioprinting, are highlighted thereafter.

AB  - Abstract Among the variety of transducer concepts proposed for label-free detection of biomolecules, the semiconductor field-effect device (FED) is one of the most attractive platforms. As medical techniques continue to progress towards diagnostic and therapies based on biomarkers, the ability of FEDs for a label-free, fast and real-time detection of multiple pathogenic and physiologically relevant molecules with high specificity and sensitivity offers very promising prospects for their application in point-of-care and personalized medicine for an early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The presented paper reviews recent advances and current trends in research and development of different FEDs for label-free, direct electrical detection of charged biomolecules by their intrinsic molecular charge. The authors are mainly focusing on the detection of the DNA hybridization event, antibody-antigen affinity reaction as well as clinically relevant biomolecules such as cardiac and cancer biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention by researchers worldwide in recent years for their small dimensions and unique architecture, and for having immense potential in nanomedicine as biocompatible and supportive substrates, as a novel tool for the delivery of therapeutic molecules including peptides, RNA and DNA, and also as sensors, actuators and composites. Key findings? CNTs have been employed in the development of molecular electronic, composite materials and others due to their unique atomic structure, high surface area-to-volume ratio and excellent electronic, mechanical and thermal properties. Recently they have been exploited as novel nanocarriers in drug delivery systems and biomedical applications. Their larger inner volume as compared with the dimensions of the tube and easy immobilization of their outer surface with biocompatible materials make CNTs a superior nanomaterial for drug delivery. Literature reveals that CNTs are versatile carriers for controlled and targeted drug delivery, especially for cancer cells, because of their cell membrane penetrability. Summary? This review enlightens the biomedical application of CNTs with special emphasis on utilization in controlled and targeted drug delivery, as a diagnostics tool and other possible uses in therapeutic systems. The review also focuses on the toxicity aspects of CNTs, and revealed that genotoxic potential, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of different types of CNTs must be explored and overcome by formulating safe biomaterial for drug delivery. The review also describes the regulatory aspects and clinical and market status of CNTs.
