AB  - Abstract Objective Cognitive problems are commonly reported by hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors and are associated with poorer physical and mental well-being. It was hypothesized that adverse effects of subjective cognitive impairment occur because cognitive difficulties reduce survivors' confidence that they can manage HSCT-related symptoms?that is, self-efficacy for symptom management. Methods Hematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors (n?=?245), 9?months to 3?years post-HSCT, completed measures of subjective cognitive functioning, self-efficacy for symptom management, and clinically important outcomes: depressed mood, anxiety, and quality of life. Mediation analyses using bootstrapping were conducted to investigate whether effects of subjective cognitive impairment on these outcomes were mediated by self-efficacy for cognitive, emotional (SE-Emotional), social (SE-Social), and physical (SE-Physical) symptom management. Results Self-efficacy mediated relations between subjective cognitive impairment and depressed mood (total indirect effect?=??0.0064 and 95% CI ?0.0097 to ?0.0036), anxiety (total indirect effect?=??0.0045, CI ?0.0072 to ?0.0021), and quality of life (total indirect effect?=?0.0952, CI 0.0901 to 0.2642). SE-Emotional was a unique mediator when the outcome was depressed mood and anxiety. SE-Social, SE-Physical, and SE-Emotional were specific mediators when outcome was quality of life. Conclusions Findings support the conclusion that subjective cognitive impairment reduces HSCT survivors' confidence in their ability to manage common post-HSCT symptoms, with implications for physical and mental well-being. Interventions that help enhance survivors' self-efficacy, particularly self-efficacy for the management of emotional symptoms, are likely to benefit HSCT survivors who report subjective cognitive impairment.

AB  - Summary The brain and other parts of the nervous system undergo complex changes with age. Loss of brain weight and volume, changes in neurons and synapses, and oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical changes have all been described in the aging brain. Moreover, the aging brain and nervous system show an increased vulnerability to a variety of distinct pathologies, particularly degenerative and vascular. This chapter provides an overview of the neuropathology of the aging brain, including ?normal? aging, the pathology of cognitive impairment and dementia, movements disorders, brain tumors, vascular disease, motor impairments, and other common geriatric brain conditions, such as toxic metabolic conditions, neoplasms, infections, and traumatic injury that may affect the elderly. The section on cognitive impairment and dementia explains the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mixed dementias, vascular dementia (also known as vascular cognitive impairment), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

AB  - Summary The safe use of anesthetics and sedatives in children has recently been questioned based largely on results from neonatal animal studies. Widespread neuronal cell death was observed immediately following an exposure to all clinically used anesthetics and long-term neurological sequelae were subsequently demonstrated in adulthood. However, human applicability of these findings remains controversial. Several factors characteristic to the perioperative period, such as pain, stress, inflammatory response, and hypoxic-ischemic episodes, can all negatively influence brain development. Anesthetic drugs may mitigate some of these factors, potentially rendering them neuroprotective. Co-morbidities, exposure to opioids, and genetic predisposition represent other confounders of neurodevelopment. Accordingly, several recent epidemiological studies have associated these perioperative stressors with subsequent learning abnormalities. Therefore, this chapter provides a synopsis of the currently available preclinical and clinical data regarding the potential impact of the perioperative period on brain development, with a special emphasis on the effects of anesthetics.

AB  - Abstract Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a large group of viruses (more than 200 types identified) that infect the epithelium of the skin and mucous membranes. The infections can be latent, subclinical, or clinically manifest, causing lesions that range from the benign (warts, papillomas, condylomas) to the malignant. Some of these viruses are responsible for cutaneous warts; a different group of HPVs (types 6 and 11) is responsible for most genital warts. The major importance of HPVs is because 20 types (especially HPV-16 and -18) are regarded as the necessary, if not sufficient, cause of cervical cancer as well as other cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and oropharynx. Although most sexually active individuals get infected with genital HPVs, most of these infections are transient and innocuous. It is the persistence of the high-risk oncogenic HPVs that leads to malignant transformation. Cancer caused by these viruses is preceded by a precancerous stage whose detection is the basis of cytologic screening (Pap smear) for cervical cancer. Ten years ago HPV vaccines were introduced for the prevention of diseases associated with HPV-16 and -18 and for the prevention of anogenital warts caused by HPV-6 and -11. The introduction of HPV vaccination has been a major advance because it is the first time a vaccine has been able to directly prevent virally induced cancers. When used broadly before the onset of sexual activity, HPV vaccination has caused a dramatic reduction in the incidence of genital warts and HPV-related cervical lesions. This should be the harbinger of a decline in the rates of cervical and other cancers.
