AB  - α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and its murine homolog spi2 are serine protease inhibitors present in plasma, that are locally up-regulated during wound healing. Ad-spi2 and Ad-ACT expression vectors were constructed to address the biological activity of locally expressed serpins. The condition medium of infected COS-1 cell at 2?d postinfection contained 1.23?ng/ml spi2 and 2.61?ng/ml ACT. Ad-LacZ or Ad-spi2 108?pfu was injected into the sponges after 3?d subcutaneous implantation in rats. Histological analysis showed that overexpression of spi2 improves granulation tissue organization and collagen deposition at d7 implantation. Moreover, overexpression of spi2 increases the contents of tissue DNA (23.8%, p?<?0.05) and protein (25.3%, p?<?0.05) in sponge implantation model in rats. In incisional wound models in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats, Ad-spi2 increases tensile strength by 26%(p?=?0.011) and 29%(p?=?0.022) as well as Ad-ACT increases by 10.3%(p?=?0.037) and 32%(p?=?0.004), respectively. In adriamycin-induced wound model in rats, histological analysis displayed less inflammatory cells infiltrating in Ad-ACT injected wound than in Ad-LacZ after 21?d injection of adriamycin. Inflammation enzymes MPO and elastase levels were decreased by 32.3% and 29.2% in Ad-ACT injected wound tissue. Our data concluded that overexpression of spi2 and ACT improves wound healing in rats probably via inflammatory resolution. (Supported by Switch Biotech and the Department of Veterans Affairs)

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Tissue ischemia is a common occurrence in many disease processes including chronic wounds, stroke, solid tumors, and myocardial infarction. The application of gene delivery for healing of wounds has demonstrated increasing therapeutic promises in animal models. Adenoviral vectors have been successfully used for gene delivery to the ischemic wound. However, these vectors typically demonstrate short, transient transgene expression while eliciting significant cytotoxic immune response. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) do not have those limitations; however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. The goal of this study was to compare AAV vector with adenoviral vector in terms of relative efficiency of gene delivery and cytotoxic immune response in ischemic wounds. Reporter constructs Ad5-LacZ and AAV-LacZ (108?pfu/wound) were injected onto the dermis of rabbit ear prior to creation of ischemic wounds. Wounds were harvested at postoperative day 10. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with an in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed with both vectors; however, transduction rates with AAV vector was approximately 10-fold lower than Adenovirus. Unlike Adenovirus, no noticeable inflammatory cell infiltration was observed with AAV injection. Even when the dosage of AAV was increased to 109?pfu/wound inflammatory cell infiltration remained negligible. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and adenoviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in ischemic tissues. The particular advantage of AAV is the ability to transfect with higher doses while at lower dose maximal transfection rate seems to be more with Adenovirus.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. In vitro cell culture bioactivity experiments are planned. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated.

AB  - Wound repair is described as a delicately balanced and well-orchestrated progression of events, which ultimately results in healing in the majority of acute cases. However, time taken to complete healing can vary greatly between patients and any alteration in this physiological process could delay healing further. Thus, a wound treatment, which facilitates healing independent of wound type and in patients where healing is compromised or impeded, would be extremely advantageous. Previous studies suggest a beneficial role for biomaterials such as collagen/ORC in modifying the chronic wound environment; however, their effect on the acute wound environment is unknown. While it is generally accepted that acute wounds heal at an optimum rate due to a positive wound environment, we wanted to determine if current advanced wound healing treatments could augment or impact this healing rate. In this study we evaluated the effect of advanced wound therapies in the presence of acute wound fluid on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. We hypothesize that an enhanced effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid may be indicative of a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute wounds. Results demonstrate that of the wound treatments tested only collagen/ORC containing therapies exhibited a positive effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid. We conclude, therefore, that collagen/ORC biomaterials, already shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wounds, may also be a valuable therapy in the treatment of acute wounds.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)

AB  - Introduction:? There is growing clinical evidence that moist wounds show improved wound healing in terms of less scar tissue formation and better cosmesis. Increased levels of wound fluid improve migration of keratinocytes along the wound surface. Occlusive dressings provide such a hydrated wound environment. However, the underlying mechanisms on how occluded wounds exert the clinical observed effect are yet barely understood. We hypothesized, that keratinocytes play a keyrole in hydrated wounds by sending cytokine signals to upper epidermal layers and even more important to the dermis. We therefore focused on connexins, intercellular channels that are strongly involved in cell-cell communication, hemostasis, and small molecule exchange. Methods:? Full thickness incisions to the panniculus carnosus were made on female Fisher rats. Both incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 5-0 polypropylene suture. One incision on each rat was randomly covered with an occlusive dressing until harvest. Wounds were harvested on PODs 3, 7, and 10. RNA was selectively extracted from both the epidermis and dermis. Histo'logy slides were preliminary evaluated by using a 0?4 scale rating cellularity count in the epithelium, subepithelium, and peripanniculous as well as epithelial thickness. Results:? Cellularity count was significantly reduced in the epithelial and subepithelial compartment of occluded wounds as well as the epithelial thickness in occluded wounds (p?<?0,05). QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of Cx30-mRNA on POD10 in occluded wounds versus nonoccluded wounds. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that occlusion promotes epithelialization and maturation of incisional wounds most likely through hydration. Up-regulation of Connexin30 on POD10 supports that thesis, as it suggests an advanced communication process in keratinocytes in occluded wounds.

AB  - Laser therapy has been considered useful for the treatment of chronic wounds. Different research groups have been working with fibroblastic metabolism, after culture irradiation with red and infrared sources of laser. Previously it has been demonstrated that lasers stimulate collagen synthesis and [3H]tymidine uptake when fibroblasts are irradiated and grown in the presence of fetal bovine serum (5?10%). Our group has been evaluating the in vitro effects of low-level laser (??=?650?nm) activity on fibroblast metabolism. In this work, fibroblast activity was evaluated after 24, 48, and 72?h from G0 using synchronized fibroblast cultures previously irradiated with a single dose of low-level laser at different power densities (3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30?mW/cm2), during different times of exposure (15, 30, 60, and 120?sec). Proliferation was measured by [3H]tymidine uptake, and ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 were evaluated by ELISA. Significant changes in proliferation were only observed after 48?h when 'cultures were irradiated during 30?sec with 3.75, 7.5, and 15?mW/cm2, or during 60 seconds at 15?mW/cm2. However, ProMMP-1 diminished significantly after 24 and 48?h when cultures were irradiated with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 30 and 60?sec, and with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 15 seconds, after 48?h. TIMP-1 expression was significantly lower than the control during each dose and they were assayed 24?h after each irradiation. Based on the above data, fibroblast proliferation is stimulated 48?h after irradiation, using low-level laser to incorporate cells from G0 to the cell cycle, almost in the absence of serum (1%), although ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 responses were observed 24?h after irradiation with the same doses. These results indicate that low-level laser can stimulate normal human fibroblasts to reduce collagen turnover, and consequently can be useful to stimulate normal fibroblast activity in a wound. As a result, this therapy could be administered every 2 days and may be more effective.

AB  - Percutaneous devices play a central role in modern medicine, but are associated with significant risk of infection. One approach to circumvent this risk is to heal the wound around the device by creating a seal at the skin/device interface. We previously showed, using cell adhesion assay and organ culture model, that surface modification of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)[poly(HEMA)] with 1,1?-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) dramatically enhanced keratinocyte attachment to poly(HEMA). Although the organ culture model addresses epithelial response to an implanted biomaterial, to fully evaluate the cutaneous interaction with biomaterials, we tested implants in a mouse model. Porous poly(HEMA) rods with 40??m pore size were implanted into two different sites on dorsal skin of forty eight, 6?8 week old male C57BL/10?J mice. Porous poly(HEMA) rods were treated with 1) PBS, 2) CDI, and 3) CDI plus laminin 5. Samples were harvested at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery and analyzed morphologically using H&E and immunohistochemistry. Implanted rods remained intact and infection free at all time points. Morphological analysis showed diffuse dermal cellular infiltration in all samples and evidence of epidermal integration into the pores of CDI treated poly(HEMA) and CDI plus laminin 5 treated poly(HEMA). Immunohistochemistry showed laminin 5 expression at the skin/poly(HEMA) interface resembling the junctional epithelium of the tooth. Engineering this type of attachment to percutaneous devices is attractive since the tooth is a natural example of percutaneous material, where bacterial invasion of bone is prevented by epithelial attachment.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - Introduction:? Based on the results of a study showing increased healing rates in a rabbit wound healing model, a clinical study was initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of a new electric stimulation bandage (POSiFECT dressing). Four patients have completed the study for the first-generation system and two are currently enrolled in the evaluation of the second-generation system. Materials and Methods:? Spinal cord-injured pressure ulcer patients were treated with the POSiFECT dressing in a randomized double-blind crossover study. During the first 8 weeks, subjects received a dressing supplying 50??A of current or one with an unconnected battery. During the treatment, bandages were changed every other day and wounds were assessed weekly to determine size, depth, and condition. At the end of 8 weeks the patients were unblinded and the control group was treated with working bandages for 8 weeks. After cessation of treatment, assessments continued each month for 2 months. Results:? The treatment led to statistically significant increases in healing rates during the first week (0.19?±?0.11?cm/wk) and the first 2 weeks (0.10?±?0.07?cm/wk) compared to both the control group (?0.03?±?0.0?cm/wk) and the follow-up period (?0.02?±?0.08?cm/wk). For each patient, however, there was a time frame during the 3rd to 5th week of treatment in which significant decreases in healing rate occurred (?0.31 to ?0.096). Conclusions:? The POSiFECT dressing appears to increase healing during the first few weeks after application. A modified clinical study is under way with a new dressing design as well as a treatment protocol providing 3 weeks of stimulation followed by 2 weeks without stimulation and then 3 more weeks of stimulation.

AB  - Several lines of evidence demonstrate that limited inflammation is key for scarless healing to take place in early fetal skin. Because inflammation and angiogenesis are often linked in pathological processes, we hypothesized that angiogenesis may play a significant role in the regulation of scar formation. A mouse model of fetal wound repair was utilized to study angiogenesis in wounds generated at either embryonic day 15 (E15), when scarless healing takes place, or embryonic day 18 (E18), when significant scarring occurs. CD31 immunohistochemical staining and image analysis were used to calculate blood vessel density at 7 days post-wounding. Wounds generated at E15 showed no increase in vessel density above levels found in unwounded, age-matched skin. In contrast, wounds generated at E18 displayed a 45% increase in vessel density compared to control skin, similar to what is seen during adult wound healing. Increased protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 3 day wounds generated at E18 (8.06?±?1.89?pg VEGF/?g protein compared to 1.99?±?0.4 in wounds made at E15) likely contribute to the increase in vascularity. In addition, injection of E15 wounds with 0.05??g of VEGF resulted in the production of a scar, compared to control wounds which healed without a scar. To further explore the idea that VEGF may contribute to scarring, we examined the effects of VEGF neutralization on scar formation in adult murine skin. Anti-VEGF antibody injections resulted in a significant reduction in scar formation compared to control scars based on histological and ultrastructural analysis. Our studies suggest a novel role for VEGF in promoting scar tissue deposition, and suggest that VEGF inhibitors may be useful for limiting cutaneous fibrosis.

AB  - Hypothesis:? Both hypoxia and lactate independently induce VEGF synthesis. However, an adequate supply of oxygen is required for new vessels to mature. Materials and Methods:? We used in vivo matrigel (growth factor reduced) angiogenesis assay and Swiss Webster mice n?=?36 (3 groups of 12 with 6 control and 6 experimental in each). Each mouse received a 1?ml subcutaneous matrigel injection. Matrigel solidifies into a gel implant when injected subcutaneously. Control injections/implants were matrigel with no added substance and experimental implants were matrigel supplemented with 30?mgs of crushed lactate polymer or PL (poly DL-Lactide-co-Glycolide 50:50; av. mol.wt. 50?75,000 kilo Daltons). The first group of mice was maintained in 12?14% oxygen, the second group in 21% oxygen, and the third group in 50?52% oxygen continuously for 11 days, at which time the implants were harvested, fixed, sectioned, and stained with Mason?s Trichrome to identify new vessels and collagen. Results:? 1.?13% oxygen control: Half showed new blood vessels with thin or incomplete walls and hemorrhages. Few collagen fibers 2.?13% oxygen with PL: same as above 3.?21% oxygen control: none showed new blood vessels/collagen fibers 4.?21% oxygen with PL: five out of six showed new blood vessels. Almost all were mature, with complete walls, collagen fibers, and no hemorrhages 5.?51% oxygen control: None showed new blood vessels/collagen fibers 6.?51% oxygen with PL: all six developed new vessels with some hemorrhage seen in two out of six. Collagen fibers present Note: matrigel contains collagen and stained a pale blue, collagen fibers were seen as dark blue, endothelial cells and RBCs as dark red and red. All blood vessels contained RBCs. Conclusions:? Hypoxia and lactate induce VEGF. However, hypoxia limits vascular growth by inhibiting collagen deposition. The largest and most mature new vessels result from a combination of oxygen and lactate.

AB  - It has been postulated that elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and reactive oxygen species detected in fluids and biopsies of chronic wounds contribute to the failure of wound to heal by degrading essential growth factors, receptors and extracellular matrix proteins. This stimulated the development of a formulation containing metal ions (polyhydrated ionogen or PHI) and citric acid that reduced reactive oxygen species in cultures of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (J Wound Care 12:10, 2003). The effect of PHI on synthesis of MMPs was studied in cultures of tumor cells and human dermal fibroblasts. Dose response curves of PHI ranging from 0.02% to 10%(W/V) established no toxicity in cultures of human dermal fibroblasts after 24 hours of incubation with PHI at concentrations below 1.25%, as measured by MTT assay. Levels of MMP-2 activity measured by antibody capture assay were reduced approximately 80% in culture medium of Mor-86 glioma tumor cells after 24 hours of exposure to 1% PHI. These results suggest that PHI reduced the synthesis of MMP-2 protein, presumably by reducing transcription and/or translation of MMP-2 gene. Clinical case reports of chronic wounds treated by PHI dressing (DerMax) suggest that PHI treatment stimulated healing and reduced MMP-2 immunostaining in biopsies of the chronic wounds.

AB  - Scarless fetal wound healing in connective tissue is characterized by organized collagen deposition that leads to regeneration and apparently normal tissue structure and function. In contrast, adult wound healing is characterized by the deposition of unorganized collagen that leads to scar formation and a loss of functionally relevant structural organization. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis and deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix molecules, and the subsequent remodeling and contraction during the wound healing process. Therefore, fibroblasts play a key role in the different outcomes observed in fetal and adult wound healing. The hypothesis is that fetal fibroblasts, relative to adult fibroblasts, have an altered capacity to contract collagen gels and remodel collagen fibrils due to inherent differences in their contractile phenotype. In this study, an anchored collagen gel model was used to evaluate matrix contraction and remodeling by these different fibroblast phenotypes. Video microscopy was used to measure the changes in surface area of contracting collagen gels. Collagen gel reorganization was evaluated using a fitting algorithm to predict the distribution and orientation of collagen fibrils from scanning electron microscopy images. In addition, fibroblast morphology and proliferation on contracting collagen gels were examined. Understanding these phenotypic variations will elucidate key differences in the wound healing process that can be used for potential clinical applications involving cell therapy and tissue engineered constructs.

AB  - Currently, skin cells or tissues intended for therapeutical or cosmetic applications are typically cultured using standard in vitro culture techniques. The avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has been traditionally used for many years to assess angiogenesis of exogenous substances. Avian embryos have also been used to generate viruses for vaccine development. Most of the uses of the avian CAM cultures are typically conducted in ovo. However, xenobiotic cultures of ex ovo avian embryos and explanted organs, tissues or cells from human or other mammalian origin have not been used in the past with the explicit purpose of achieving the appropriate extent of expansion, differentiation or vascularization required for therapeutic or cosmetic implantation into humans or animals. Here, a novel method of xenobiotic skin culture was developed that can be employed for wound healing studies or for tissue engineering applications to sustain the culture of live skin explants through the benefit of a xenobiotic vascularization. The method uses fertile Japanese quail (Cortunix cortunix japonica) eggs. The eggs were incubated for at least 3 days in ovo using a static egg incubator. On day 3 the egg is opened under sterile conditions through the air chamber and placed in a cylindrical culture dish slightly larger than the overall diameter of the egg yolk. The embryo was then cultured at 37?°C for an additional 24 to 48 hours until a well-vascularized CAM covers the entire surface of the culture dish. Next, fragments of skin were placed directly over the CAM. The cultures were continued for 8 days and then the skin explants were transferred to new CAMs. These changes, every 8 days, were done at least five times allowing the skin to be maintained in culture for several weeks without apparent damage in viability. The skin fragments remained viable and capable of reepithelialization when wounded. Skin explants from both mouse and human were successfully cultured in this manner. Because immunological response cannot occur in the embryonic culture environment, it was possible to xenotransplant skin fragments without risk of rejection. The ensuing embryonic vessels developed into the xenotransplanted skin and generated a permeable vascular network that provided oxygen and nutrients necessary to ensure viability and promote proliferation and differentiation. Viability of the explants was evaluated by immunohisto chemical methods using proliferation and apoptosis markers (Caspase-3, BrdU, and PCNA). Vascularization was assessed using species-specific anti endothelial antibodies (anti-PECAM human and mouse and QH1 and QH2 monoclonal antibodies). The new method described herein has the distinct advantage of sustaining live, functional skin cultures by means of a rich vascular supply that provides cells with nutrients and oxygen.

AB  - Exposure to cigarette smoke has detrimental effects on the early stages of wound repair but not much is known about the effects of smoke on the development of the healing (granulation) tissue. Cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and deposition of ECM are critical processes for normal granulation tissue (GT) formation. Here we investigate the effects of MSW (?first-hand smoke?) and SSW (the main component of ?secondhand smoke?) smoke on wound healing in mice that have been smoking for 9 months. We show that both MSW and SSW smoke adversely affect wound contraction and closure. The keratinocytes accumulate at the edge of the wound and the GT is deficient in fibroblasts and ECM. Moreover, by immunolabeling for α-SMA, we found that the myofibroblasts remained at the edges of the wound rather than penetrating the GT, potentially contributing to the lack of wound contraction. To test the possibility that smoke inhibits cell migration, we plated primary human fibroblasts in between two interstitial collagen gels, treated the cultures with the smoke solutions and found that cell migration into the gels was inhibited. Furthermore, using the collagen gel contraction assay, we showed that cigarette smoke components inhibit gel contraction. To further decipher which components of the smoke contribute to delayed wound closure, we fractionated SSW smoke solutions into polar and nonpolar components using solid phase extraction cartridges. We show that both the polar and nonpolar fractions delay wound closure in vivo and that the nonpolar fraction inhibits cell migration whereas the polar faction increases cell survival. We are currently pursuing these studies by further fractionation of these two phases with the goal of identifying the specific component(s) in each fraction that cause these effects on cell migration and survival. Identification of the components in cigarette smoke that lead to delayed wound healing and eliminating them from cigarettes could help those exposed to secondhand smoke heal faster.

AB  - Chronic nonhealing wounds have been long associated with an imbalance between the degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Human and animal studies have shown psychological stress to impair healing and differentially regulate gene expression. We hypothesized that psychological stress-impaired healing is mediated by altered expression of MMP and TIMP. SKH-1 mice were subjected to restraint stress 3 days before and 5 days after placement of 3.5?mm biopsy wounds. The wounds were biopsied at various time points and analyzed for gene expression by real-time PCR. The wounds of stressed mice showed significantly delayed healing when compared to the wounds of controls through day 5 postwounding. There was a significantly higher expression of MMP-8 in the stressed groups on days 1 (172%, p?<?0.0003) and 3 (204%, p?<?0.0003) postwounding. Stress decreased MMP-9 expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.02), but showed no significant difference to controls on the other days. TIMP-1, which is known to inhibit most activated MMPs, had significantly lower expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.0003). TIMP-2, which is constitutively expressed, did not show any difference in expression between the stress and the control groups. During stress, increased MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) activity is in agreement with previous studies in our model that have demonstrated a increase in neutrophil recruitment on days 3 and 5 postwounding. Likewise, lower expression of TIMP-1 during stress is similar to findings in chronic wounds as opposed to healing surgical wounds. Hence, altered expression of the metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, may lead to increased damage early in healing and decreased repair later in stress-impaired wound healing.

AB  - Introduction:? Chronic, nonhealing wounds are often observed in tissues with poor oxygen supply. Impaired reepithelialization is a hallmark of these wounds; however, the pathogenesis of the retarded reepithelialization in chronic, ischemic wounds remains poorly understood. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) is involved in both normal and hypoxic wound healing response and exogenous overexpression of Smad3, a TGF-beta signaling intermediate, has been known to accelerate reepithelialization. In a recent study, Ad-Smad3 injection in the rabbit ear dermal ulcer model showed enhanced reepithelialization and granulation tissue area suggesting a positive effect of Smad3 on wound healing. However, little is known about the role of Smad3 in the ischemic wound healing process. In this study we examined the effect of Smad3 in an ischemic wound model. Methods:? Ad-Smad3 or LacZ (108?pfu/wound) empty vector was injected in either ear of White New Zealand Rabbits. Twenty-four hours later, these ears were rendered ischemic using an established model and four 7-mm full-thickness punch wounds were made on each ear. Results:? Histological evaluation showed a highly significant increase in reepithelialization, epithelial ingrowth and percentage of epithelialization in Ad-Smad3 transfected wounds versus ischemic wounds transfected with LacZ-empty vector (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Our data confirm the enhancing effect of Smad3 on reepithelialization in an ischemic wound model. The deficiency in reepithelialization, as evident in chronic ischemic wounds, could thus be ameliorated by excess Smad3. Therapeutic interventions using overexpressed Smad3 may improve wound healing through accelerated epithelialization in chronic wounds.
