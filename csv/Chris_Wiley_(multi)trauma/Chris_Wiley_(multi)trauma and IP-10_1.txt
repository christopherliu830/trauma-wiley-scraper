AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Early life trauma is a risk factor for life-long disorders related to emotional processing, but knowledge underlying its enduring effect is incomplete. This study was motivated by the hypothesis that early life trauma increases amygdala-dependent threat responses via reduction in inhibition by parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNN) supporting PV cells, thus increasing excitability of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). From postnatal day (PN) 8?12, rat pups of both sexes were reared under normal bedding or under insufficient nest-building materials to induce maternal-to-infant maltreatment trauma (Scarcity-Adversity Model, SAM). At weaning age of PN23, the SAM group exhibited increased threat responses to predator odor. The SAM-induced increase in threat response was recapitulated in normally reared PN22?23 rats that were unilaterally depleted of PNN in the BLA by the enzymes, chondroitinase-ABC plus hyaluronidase at PN19?20. Light and electron microscopic analysis of the BLA revealed that anterior-to-mid levels of SAM group's BLAs exhibited decreased PNN intensity and decreased axo-somatic synapses between PV-to-principal pyramidal-like neurons and PV-to-PV. PV and PNN densities (cells/mm2) in the BLA of both control (CON) and SAM groups were still low at PN12 and SAM delayed the ontogenetic rise of PV intensity and PNN density. Moreover, PV cell density in the anterior-to-mid BLA correlated negatively with threat response of CON animals, but not for SAM animals. Thus, reduction of PNN-supported, PV-mediated somatic inhibition of pyramidal cells provides a mechanistic support for the enduring effect of early life maltreatment manifested as increasing innate threat response at weaning.

AB  - Abstract The restoration of a traumatized tooth may require minimally invasive or more extensive treatment options. The majority of injuries occur in the younger population, so management should consider the long-term outcome, failure and future treatment needs over the course of, often, many decades. The aim should be to provide a tooth-restoration complex that closely mimics the functional and aesthetic qualities of an intact tooth for as long as possible. This narrative review will assess the relevant literature pertinent to restoration of traumatized teeth in order to provide guidance for the practising clinician.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The optional filter is gaining ground, supplementing anticoagulation in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients, this despite knowledge gaps relating to its efficacy. We studied the literature and audited our experience with inferior vena cava filters to educate ourselves on this mode of VTE prophylaxis, particularly its practical implications, if any, for the surgeon. Methods:? A retrospective clinical study on inferior vena cava filter (IVCF)-related events in a Western Australian tertiary centre in 2008 was performed. Literature on IVCFs was reviewed. Results:? The 118 IVCF-related events at our centre in 2008, involved either Recovery-G2 75(88%) or Cook-Celect nine (11%). Of these, 78 were insertions and 36 were retrievals with four failed retrievals (10% of the attempts). Major indications for insertion included multi-trauma 32 (38%), prothrombotic state 29 (34%), head injury/intracranial bleeding 16 (19%) and others eight (9%). The mean dwelling time was 100 days (12?349 days). The mean age was 43 and the retrieval rate was 58%. Conclusion:? Optional filters have presented both versatility and challenge to the management of VTE in high-risk patients. An underlying concern about the quintessential efficacy of IVCFs lingers on, while the impact of lost follow-ups in young patients is still at large. Class 1 studies on optional filters would add certainty to the use of this generation of filters, be a step forward in relevance from the seminal work of Decousus and garner the willingness needed to engage teamwork and institutional proactiveness against loopholes such as lost follow-ups that can undermine the portrayed benefits of a potentially lifesaving device.

AB  - Abstract Astrocytes become activated in response to many CNS pathologies. The process of astrocyte activation remains rather enigmatic and results in so-called reactive gliosis, a reaction with specific structural and functional characteristics. Astrocytes play a vital role in regulating aspects of inflammation and in the homeostatic maintenance of the CNS. However, the responses of different human astroglial cell-lines in viral encephalitis mediated inflammation are not well documented. We have shown that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection causes morphological and functional changes in astrocytic cell-lines. We have demonstrated that besides reactive oxygen species (ROS) JEV infection differentially regulated the induction pattern of IL-6, IL-1? and IL-8. IP-10, MCP-1, MIG and RANTES secretions in different astroglial cell-lines. The expression of different proteins such as astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the glutamate aspartate transporter/essential amino acid transporter-1 (GLAST/EAAT-1), glutamate transporter-1/essential amino acid transporter-2 (GLT-1/EAAT-2), Ceruloplasmin and Thioredoxin (TRX) expression level also differ in different human astrocyte cell-lines following infection.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a chromosomal deletion of region containing PMP-22 gene or point mutations causing loss-of-function of PMP-22. HNPP usually presents with acute nerve paresis following mild trauma or compression, or as a chronic demyelinating neuropathy mimicking CMT1A. We describe a family composed by a woman (I-1), her 3 young children (II-1, II-2, III-3) and her sister (I-2). All patients showed weakness in flexor hallucis brevis and lumbricales muscles, with consequent poor stabilization of the metatarsophalangeal joints and toe hyperextension by the long toe extensors. I-1 (35?y/o) complained of short episodes of numbness, pain and weakness associated to mild traumas and postures since the age of 12. She traveled often and got easily tired. Her leg-sole angle during active dorsiflexion (LS) was 95 because of forefootdrop. She had varus heels, curled toes, hyperextended knees, antiverted pelvis, passive foot dorsiflexion (PFD), and reduced hip external rotation (ER). I-2 (38?y/o) had severe toe deformities requiring surgery, varus heels and LS?=?93. II-1 (male, 10?y/o) is asymptomatic. His LS was 85, whereas hip ER was reduced. II-2 (male, 6?y/o) complained of pain in the calves, soles, and behind the knees. He trips 5/day, falls 1/day and runs clumsily. His LS was 82, with hyperextended knees (8) and markedly reduced hip ER. II-3 (female, 4?y/o) had the same picture of II-2. Her LS was 85, PFD was reduced (7), hip ER reduced, and pelvis antiverted. In this patients, rehabilitation included proper shoes and foot orthoses, standing exercises on a table oscillating on the sagittal plane to recover ankle dorsiflexion and prevent knee hyperextension, active exercises to recover hip ER, postural and ambulation training. We expect that an early treatment of mild abnormalities presented by the children can prevent them from developing severe deformities and functional impairment.

AB  - Abstract Background The Virtopsy project, a multi-disciplinary project that involves forensic science, diagnostic imaging, computer science, automation technology, telematics and biomechanics, aims to develop new techniques to improve the outcome of forensic investigations. This paper presents a new approach in the field of minimally invasive virtual autopsy for a versatile robotic system that is able to perform three-dimensional (3D) surface scans as well as post mortem image-guided soft tissue biopsies. Methods The system consists of an industrial six-axis robot with additional extensions (i.e. a linear axis to increase working space, a tool-changing system and a dedicated safety system), a multi-slice CT scanner with equipment for angiography, a digital photogrammetry and 3D optical surface-scanning system, a 3D tracking system, and a biopsy end effector for automatic needle placement. A wax phantom was developed for biopsy accuracy tests. Results Surface scanning times were significantly reduced (scanning times cut in half, calibration three times faster). The biopsy module worked with an accuracy of 3.2 mm. Discussion Using the Virtobot, the surface-scanning procedure could be standardized and accelerated. The biopsy module is accurate enough for use in biopsies in a forensic setting. Conclusion The Virtobot can be utilized for several independent tasks in the field of forensic medicine, and is sufficiently versatile to be adapted to different tasks in the future.

AB  - Abstract PSD-95 inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in stroke, but have only to a very limited extent been evaluated in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that has pathophysiological mechanisms in common with stroke. The aims of the current study were to assess the effects of a novel dimeric inhibitor of PSD-95, UCCB01-147, on histopathology and long-term cognitive outcome after controlled cortical impact (CCI) in rats. As excitotoxic cell death is thought to be a prominent part of the pathophysiology of TBI, we also investigated the neuroprotective effects of UCCB01-147 and related compounds on NMDA-induced cell death in cultured cortical neurons. Anesthetized rats were given a CCI or sham injury, and were randomized to receive an injection of either UCCB01-147 (10 mg/kg), the non-competitive NMDAR-receptor antagonist MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline immediately after injury. At 2 and 4 weeks post-trauma, spatial learning and memory were assessed in a water maze, and at 3 months, brains were removed for estimation of lesion volumes. Overall, neither treatment with UCCB01-147 nor MK-801 resulted in significant improvements of cognition and histopathology after CCI. Although MK-801 provided robust neuroprotection against NMDA-induced toxicity in cultured cortical neurons, UCCB01-147 failed to reduce cell death and became neurotoxic at high doses. The data suggest potential differential effects of PSD-95 inhibition in stroke and TBI that should be investigated further in future studies taking important experimental factors such as timing of treatment, dosage, and anesthesia into consideration.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma can result in tooth loss despite best efforts at retaining and maintaining compromised teeth (Dent Traumatol, 24, 2008, 379). Upper anterior teeth are more likely to suffer from trauma, and their loss can result in significant aesthetic and functional problems that can be difficult to manage (Endod Dent Traumatol, 9, 1993, 61; Int Dent J 59, 2009, 127). Indeed, teeth of poor prognosis may not only present with compromised structure but trauma may also result in damage to the support tissues. Injury to the periodontium and alveolus can have repercussions on subsequent restorative procedures (Fig. 19). Where teeth are identified as having a hopeless prognosis either soon after the incident or at delayed presentation; planning for eventual tooth loss and replacement can begin at the early stages. With advances in both adhesive and osseointegration technologies, there are now a variety of options for the restoration of edentate spaces subsequent to dental trauma. This review aims to identify key challenges in the provision of tooth replacement in the traumatized dentition and outline contemporary methods in treatment delivery.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Abstract Background: Proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to be elevated in individuals experiencing chronic stress as well as in those with major depressive disorder. Much less is known about cytokines in anxiety disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder (PD). We hypothesized that PD and PTSD would be associated with a generalized proinflammatory cytokine signature. Method: We utilized Luminex technology to examine 20 cytokines and chemokines in serum from 48 well-characterized individuals with a primary DSM-IV PD or PTSD diagnosis, and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We conservatively employed a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (α=.05/20=.0025). Results: Individuals with primary PTSD or PD had significantly elevated median peripheral cytokine levels for 18 of 20 different cytokines compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (all P<.0025). To assess for the presence of a generalized proinflammatory state, we also examined the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of at least six of nine common proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1?, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, and IFN-α). For men and women, 87% of anxiety patients had six or more detectable levels of these proinflammatory cytokines, compared with only 25% of controls (Fisher's Exact Test (FET) P=.000). Confirmatory analysis of the subset of individuals without current psychiatric medication use or comorbid depression was of comparable significance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a generalized inflammatory state may be present in individuals with PD or PTSD. Depression and Anxiety, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction. We have demonstrated that wounds treated with adenoviral overexpression of Il-10 (AdIl-10) heal scarlessly, resembling fetal wound healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is elevated in fetal wounds. We hypothesized that IL-10 creates a permissive environment for scarless healing through the differential mediation of hyaluronic acid synthases (Has1?3).?Methods. Adult C57 mice (n?=?24) were pretreated with 5???108 PFU AdIL-10, AdLacz, or PBS. 48?hrs post-injection, 2-cm incisional wounds were created at the site of injection. Wounds harvested at 1, 3, and 5 days were analyzed for mRNA transcript levels of Has 1?3 and GAPDH via RT-PCR and band densitometry. Data expressed as signal intensity ratio relative to GAPDH?±?SEM. ?Results. The three Has transcripts were expressed after pre-treatment and wounding at day 1, 3, and 5. At day 1, there is no significant difference in Has mRNA levels. At Day 3, Has1 transcript levels are significantly decreased in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. (Il-10 0.28?±?0.04; LacZ 0.53?±?0.06; PBS 0.43?±?0.43, p?<?0.005) At Day 5, there was a significant increase in Has1 transcript levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds compared to controls. (Il-10 0.82?±?0.08; LacZ 0.41?±?0.06; PBS 0.57?±?0.03, p?<?0.005) At Day 3 and 5, there was no significant difference in Has2 and Has3 levels in AdIl-10 treated wounds vs. controls. ?Conclusions. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of Il-10 results in the differential expression of Has1 at day 3 and 5. Has1 encodes for high molecular weight HA, which is associated with inhibition of angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltrates as observed in the HA-rich environment of fetal wounds. The effects of AdIl-10 may in part be due to the differential expression of Has1 creating a permissive environment for fetal-like scarless wound repair.

AB  - Background The prognostic value of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in dogs after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear. Objectives Determine whether MRI findings are associated with prognosis after TBI in dogs. Animals Fifty client-owned dogs. Methods Retrospective study of dogs with TBI that underwent 1.5T MRI within 14 days after head trauma. MRI evaluators were blinded to the clinical presentation, and all images were scored based on an MRI grading system (Grade I [normal brain parenchyma] to Grade VI [bilateral lesions affecting the brainstem with or without any lesions of lesser grade]). Skull fractures, percentage of intraparenchymal lesions, degree of midline shift, and type of brain herniation were evaluated. MGCS was assessed at presentation. The presence of seizures was recorded. Outcome was assessed at 48 h (alive or dead) and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results Sixty-six percent of the dogs had abnormal MRI findings. MRI grade was negatively correlated (P < .001) with MGCS. A significant negative correlation of MRI grade, degree of midline shift, and percentage of intraparenchymal lesions with follow-up scores was identified. The MGCS was lower in dogs with brain herniation (P = .0191). Follow-up scores were significantly lower in dogs that had brain herniation or skull fractures. The possibility of having seizures was associated with higher percentage of intraparenchymal lesions (P = 0.0054) and 10% developed PTE. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Significant associations exist between MRI findings and prognosis in dogs with TBI. MRI can help to predict prognosis in dogs with TBI.
