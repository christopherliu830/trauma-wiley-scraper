AB  - Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracoronary administration of prourokinase via balloon catheter during primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods Acute STEMI patients underwent primary PCI were randomly divided into two groups: intracoronary prourokinase (IP) group (n?=?118) and control group (n?=?112). During primary PCI, prourokinase or saline were injected to the distal end of the culprit lesion via balloon catheter after balloon catheter dilatation. Demographic and clinical characteristics, infarct size, myocardial reperfusion, and cardiac functions were evaluated and compared between two groups. Hemorrhagic complications and MACE occurred in the 6-months follow up were recorded. Results No significant differences were observed between two groups with respect to baseline demographic, clinical, and angiographic characteristics (P?>?0.05). In IP group, more patients had complete ST segment resolution (>70%) compared with control group (P?<?0.05). Patients in IP group showed lower levels of serum CK, CK-MB and TnI, and a much higher myocardial blood flow (MBF) than those in control group (P?<?0.05). No significant differences of TIMI major or minor bleeding complications were observed between the two groups (P?>?0.05). At 6-months follow-up, there was a trend that patients in the IP group had a less chance to have MACE, though it was not statistically different (8.5% vs 12.5%, P?>?0.05). Conclusions Intracoronary administration of prourokinase via balloon catheter during primary PCI effectively improved myocardial perfusion in STEMI patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Despite extensive research in atherosclerosis, the mechanisms of coronary atherothrombosis in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients are undetermined. Objectives Our aim was to find candidate genes involved in STEMI by analysing leucocyte gene expression in STEMI patients, without the influence of secondary inflammation from innate immunity, which was assumed to be a consequence rather than the cause of coronary atherothrombosis. Methods Fifty-one patients were included at coronary angiography because of STEMI. Arterial blood was sampled in the acute phase (P1), at 24?48 h (P2) and at 3 months (P3). Leucocyte RNA was isolated and gene expression analysis was performed by Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. By omission of up- or downregulated genes at P2, secondary changes from innate immunity were excluded. Genes differentially expressed in P1 when compared to the convalescent sample in P3 were determined as genes involved in STEMI. Results Three genes were upregulated at P1 compared to P3; ABCG1 (P = 5.81 ? 10?5), RAB20 (P = 3.69 ? 10?5) and TMEM2 (P = 7.75 ? 10?6) whilst four were downregulated; ACVR1 (P = 9.01 ? 10?5), NFATC2IP (P = 8.86 ? 10?5), SUN1 (P = 3.87 ? 10?5) and TTC9C (P = 7.18 ? 10?6). These genes were also highly expressed in carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Conclusions We found seven genes involved in STEMI. The study is unique regarding the blood sampling in the acute phase and omission of secondary expressed genes from innate immunity. However, the results need to be replicated by future studies.

AB  - Objective To provide (1) a comprehensive description of hemipelvectomy; and (2) report clinical application and outcome of hemipelvectomy in dogs and cats. Study Design Descriptive report and retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?4) and 5 cats. Methods Cadaveric dissection was performed for imaging purposes using 4 mixed breed dogs euthanatized for reasons unrelated to this study. Medical records (2005?2012) were reviewed for dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy. Data collected included signalment, body weight, body condition score, clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging findings, location and extent of tumor, definitive diagnosis, use of adjuvant therapy, ability to ambulate postoperatively, complications, and survival. Results The most common indication for hemipelvectomy in cats was injection site sarcoma (ISS) and in dogs, osteosarcoma or peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST). Complete tumor excision was achieved in 6 (67%) cases. Incomplete excision occurred in 2 dogs with lumbosacral PNST and 1 cat having a 2nd surgery for ISS. Complications included intraoperative hemorrhage (n?=?2), postoperative soft tissue infection (2), and discharge from the incision site (1). All but 1 animal were ambulatory at the time of discharge. Hospitalization ranged from 1?10 days (median, 4 days). Survival after surgery was individually assessed. Conclusion With in-depth anatomic familiarity, hemipelvectomy can be successful for excision of neoplastic lesions of the proximal aspect of the pelvic limb, with only minor complications.

AB  - Citation information: Pointer JS  this is at the incipient phase of presbyopia (IP), where the amplitude of accommodation is much reduced and approaches the level where a first reading addition is anticipated. Significantly, informal clinical observation has suggested a low incidence of an unexpected abrupt increase in myopia during IP. Methods:? We investigated this alleged myopic shift retrospectively by mapping the longitudinal refraction histories of normally-sighted 35?44?years old British White patients previously examined in routine optometric practice. The refractive trends in the right eyes of healthy myopic subjects (spherical equivalent refraction, SER ≤?0.50?D: N?=?39) were analysed relative to that point at which a first near dioptric addition was considered to be clinically useful. Results:? A refractive change was evident in some subjects during IP; viz, an abrupt increase in myopic SER of between ?0.50 and ?0.75?D. These individuals (N?=?8) represented 20% of the study population of myopic incipient presbyopes. Beyond the pivotal point of the first near addition the longitudinal refraction stabilized in these subjects. In contrast, and as the extent of the available longitudinal data would permit, the remaining myopic eyes maintained an approximately stable refractive trend throughout IP and beyond. Conclusions:? The anatomical or physiological basis of this specific late (non-developmental) abrupt myopic refractive change is an intriguing issue. Axial (vitreous chamber elongation), corneal (contour) and lenticular (profile and index) power bases, alone or in concert, might be considered candidates for this hitherto unexplored refractive phenomenon. Although necessarily obtained under conventional conditions of central (0?deg) fixation, our data might also be a reflection of the recent recognition of the possible influence of the peripheral refraction upon the axial error. Consideration of this material provides an impetus for further research, including ocular biometry, a reappraisal of ciliary zonular functional anatomy, renewed investigation of the AC/A ratio, and the extent of a centripetal refractive influence on myopia development.

AB  - Summary The immune system is an intricate network of specialized tissues, which protect the host from insults and infection. It can be divided into two interactive systems, innate and adaptive immunity. Neuroinflammation occurs when there is chronic activation of the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS). Alterations in the permeability of the blood?brain barrier (BBB) may also occur during neuroinflammation due to changes in local vasculature, that is increased blood flow and vascular permeability. There are several anti-inflammatory systems that play a role in regulating microglia activation, which include CD200/CD200 receptor, vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Apoptosis is a highly orchestrated form of cell death when a number of caspases are activated in a sequential manner. The distinct morphological changes of the cell undergoing apoptosis are that the cell begins to shrink and pull away from other cells, and bubble-like formations appear at its surface.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman presented with multiple subungal lesions for the past forty years. These were associated with increasing pain with growth, relieved only by destruction. They were treated as subungal warts by electrocautery and surgical excision. A biopsy of one lesion was interpreted as squamous cell carcinoma with subsequent partial amputation of the affected digit. She continued to develop painful subungal growths involving all her fingers, requiring repeated surgeries. On physical examination, subungal tumors associated with hyperkeratosis and erythema of the nail bed were found on the right thumb and ring finger. Subungal hyperkeratosis involved all other fingers. On histological examination, there was marked dyskeratosis with features of subungal keratoacanthoma or squamous cell carcinoma. This patient has a history of incontinentia pigmenti (IP) since childhood and she has three daughters with IP. We report a case of painful subungal dyskeratotic tumors in IP, considered as keratoacanthomas by some, as they grow rapidly and may demonstrate spontaneous resolution, albeit rarely. The distinguishing features of subungal tumor in IP are its occurrence in young women with multiple lesions and signs of IP, and its tendency to erupt persistently over a course of several years.

AB  - Summary:? Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis are chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases with a heterogeneous clinical presentation and course. Both the adaptive and the innate immune systems have been suggested to contribute to their pathogenesis and recovery. In this review, we discuss the role of the innate immune system in mediating demyelinating diseases. In particular, we provide an overview of the anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory functions of dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK-T cells, ?δ T cells, microglial cells, and astrocytes. We emphasize the interaction of astroctyes with the immune system and how this interaction relates to the demyelinating pathologies. Given the pivotal role of the innate immune system, it is possible that targeting these cells may provide an effective therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases.

Little is known about associations of partner accommodation with other aspects of relationship functioning, like intimacy. Sixty-four male military veterans with at least subclinical PTSD and their partners participated in a 2-week daily diary study. Veterans completed nightly measures of PTSD symptoms, while female partners completed nightly measures of accommodating behaviors performed that day. Both partners reported feelings of intimacy each night. Multilevel models revealed that accommodation was significantly, negatively associated with feelings of intimacy, with stronger effects for partners (t = ?8.70) than for veterans (t = ?5.40), and stronger effects when veterans had lower (t = ?7.43) rather than higher (t = ?5.20) levels of daily PTSD symptoms. Therapists should consider accommodating behaviors as a potential impediment to relationship intimacy, particularly when veterans have less severe symptoms of PTSD. Accommodating behaviors are an ideal treatment target in behavioral couple therapies.

AB  - Abstract During pregnancy, traumas can threaten maternal and fetal health. Various trauma effects on a pregnant uterus are little investigated. In the present study, a finite element model of a uterus along with a fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, and two most effective ligament sets is developed. This model allows numerical evaluation of various loading on a pregnant uterus. The model geometry is developed based on CT-scan data and validated using anthropometric data. Applying Ogden hyper-elastic theory, material properties of uterine wall and placenta are developed. After simulating the ?rigid-bar? abdominal loading, the impact force and abdominal penetration are investigated. Findings are compared with the experimental abdominal response corridor, previously developed for a nonpregnant abdomen. ?Response corridor? denotes a bounded envelope in response space, within which the system responses usually lie. Results show that at low abdominal penetrations (less than 45 mm), the pregnant abdomen response is highly compatible with the nonpregnant case. While, at large penetrations, the pregnant abdomen demonstrates stiffer behavior. The reason must be the existence of a fetus in the model. This reveals that the existing response corridors would not be reliable to be extended for a pregnant abdomen. Hence, response corridor development for a pregnant abdomen is a crucial task. In this study, a new fixed-back rigid-bar loading response corridor is proposed for a pregnant abdomen using the load-penetration behavior of the developed model. This model and response corridor can help to study the pregnant uterus response to environmental loading and investigate the injury risk to the uterus and fetus.

AB  - Management of surgical defects following excisional and Mohs micrographic surgery for malignant skin lesions consists of autografting, skin flaps, primary closure, and healing by secondary intention. A fully differentiated bilayered cell-based therapy (BLCT/Apligraf), expresses multiple growth factors, provides a biologically active matrix, and appears to be immunologically inert. BLCT is FDA approved for venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. BLCT is effective in hard-to-heal venous ulcers and, in diabetic foot ulcers, it is significantly associated with less amputations and osteomyelitis. A previous open-label trial showed BLCT to be safe and effective in surgical excision wounds. However, we have been interested in rigorously identifying differences in chronic compared to acute wounds when using BLCT or other skin substitutes. In this report of a multicenter randomized study, we enrolled and treated 181 patients eligible for secondary intention healing after Mohs or excisional surgery for skin cancer, with 172 completing the study. Face wounds were excluded. In total, 84 patients were treated with BLCT and 88 with dressings alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was the quality of the healed wound using the Vancouver Burn Scar Assessment Scale (VBSAS). Pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and scar heights were assessed by the investigator and an independent observer as 0 (no scar) to 15 (worst scar). Scores of?≤?4 were assigned to 57 (65%) of BLCT-treated patients by both the investigator and observer, and to 60 (65%) and 54 (58%) of control patients according to the investigator and observer, respectively. There was no difference in healing time, and no severe adverse events or rapid cancer recurrence were observed in either group. In this randomized controlled trial of full thickness excision wounds after skin cancer removal, BLCT/Apligraf was safe and well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction:? Liposomal gene transfer is an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of several pathophysiologic states. The purpose of the present study was to define whether the biological or chemical structure of a liposome influences cellular and biological regeneration in the skin and to determine by which mechanisms possible changes occur. Methods:? Rats were inflicted a full-excision acute wound and divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of DMRIE liposomes plus the Lac-Z gene, or DOTAP/Chol liposomes plus the Lac Z gene, or saline. Planimetry, immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical 'techniques were used to determine molecular mechanisms after gene transfer, protein expression, dermal, and epidermal regeneration. Results:? DOTAP/Chol increased IGF-I and KGF protein concentration and caused concomitant cellular responses, e.g., by increasing IGFBP-3, p?<?0.05. DOTAP/Chol liposomes improved epidermal regeneration by exhibiting the most rapid area and linear wound reepithelization compared to DMRIE or control, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol and DMRIE exerted promitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on basal keratinocytes, p?<?0.05. Dermal regeneration was improved in DOTAP/Chol treated animals by an increased collagen deposition and morphology, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol liposomes increased VEGF concentrations and thus neovascularization when compared with DMRIE and saline, p?<?0.001. Summary:? In the present study we showed that different liposomes have different effects on intracellular and biological responses based on its chemical and molecular structure. For gene transfer in acute wounds the administration of DOTAP/Chol liposomes appears to be beneficial. Acknowledgments:? Clayton Foundation for Research

AB  - Introduction:? As an initial pilot effort a prospective, case-controlled trial examining the effects of treprostinil sodium (Remodulin?), by continuous, subcutaneous infusion, was performed in diabetic patients with recalcitrant lower extremity wounds. While the primary outcomes for the trial were wound healing and limb preservation, evaluation of local tissue perfusion with transcutaneous oximetry and laser Doppler analysis (TcPO2/LD) were included as secondary objectives, and with the expectation they would be useful monitors of any interventional modality. Methods:? All patients enrolled had nonhealing wounds (>3 months) in critically ischemic lower extremities (Fontaine Stage III-IV or Rutherford Stage 4, 5, or 6). Hyperbaric oxygen exposures were included as diagnostic/monitoring indices. In the last four enrolled subjects TcPO2/LD measurements were made at ambient pressure and at 2.0 or 2.4 ATA before Remodulin? was begun and at various points during drug infusion. Results:? Early, observational evaluation of the TcPO2/LD data shows: 1?? These examinations prognostically profile healing in ischemic limbs. 2?? TcPO2/LD values demonstrate the efficacy of Remodulin? in augmenting perfusion in ischemic wounds. While there is a broad range, all measured parameters increased on the drug (resting TcPO2 ? 5?30?mmHg, the rate of TcPO2 rise following ambient pressure O2-challenge ? 25?150% and periwound TcPO2 ? 90?300?mmHg at 2.0 and 2.4 ATA). 3?? The in-chamber TcPO2 on Remodulin? further defines patients who will not benefit from HBO2 therapy. 4?? The TcPO2/LD data will assist in determining dosages, duration, and maintenance requirements for this drug both as a single agent and when used as an adjuvant to HBO2 therapy. Conclusions:? Treprostinil sodium (Remodulin?) has significant laudatory effects on local wound perfusion in ischemic lower extremities. Acknowledgments:? United Therapeutics, Inc provided support for this study through an unrestricted educational grant.

AB  - One of the well-known enzymatic debriders is a papain?urea-chlorophyllin ointment. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of this ointment compared with single variable Papain-urea, Copper chlorophyllin, or Urea base ointment and moist wound care in porcine full thickness wounds. Twenty full thickness wounds were made on the dorsum of domestic pigs. Following hemostasis, the wounds were contaminated with wound-isolated bacteria, treated with test articles, and dressed with moisture-retentive dressing. All the wounds were evaluated 1, 4, 8, 11, 14, 18, and 21 days postsurgery visually and biopsies were obtained for microscopy. The results showed no impairment in the rate of epithelialization of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin treatment, nor with single variable actives compared with moist wound care. Microscopic examination revealed an increase in the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain-treated wounds, and an increase in the depth of rete pegs. Blood vessel formation was increased in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin, papain, and Copper chlorophyllin groups compared to the moist control tissue as seen with CD31 and von Willebrand Factor staining, and was most evident in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin-treated tissues. VEGF was increased after 1 week in the wounds treated with papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain compared to vehicle, indicating a possible mechanism for neovascularization. The increase was not seen in the Copper chlorophyllin group, indicating the possibility of another mechanism for blood vessel formation in this group. The healing appears to be most complete in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin group based on epidermal morphology and enhanced vascularization, which is vital in supplying nutrients to the newly healed wound.

AB  - The pathophysiology of wound repair is a delicately balanced, dynamic process involving both stimulatory and degradative factors to remove damaged tissue and synthesize new tissue. An imbalance of any of these factors may result in the formation of a chronic wound. Previous studies have indicated that the chronic wound environment is detrimental to cell and cytokine function, leading to delayed healing. The presence of a hostile chronic wound environment has been supported by many studies reporting elevated proteolytic activity in these wounds. However, it has not been determined if this elevation is due to an excess of a particular protease or a reduction in inhibitor levels. In this study we investigated the effect of PROMOGRANTM, a protease 'modulating matrix, on wound healing in patients with venous leg ulcers and examined the effect on the wound environment. Wound fluid samples were collected from a number of patients throughout the course of treatment and both protease and inhibitor levels were analyzed. Our results indicate that wounds which respond to PROMOGRANTM also exhibited an overall decrease in human neutrophil-derived elastase and MMP activity. An increase in the ratio of alpha-1-antitrypsin to human neutrophil-derived elastase was also observed suggesting a greater degree of regulation post therapy, and a return to a more acute-like wound environment. Wounds that did not respond to this treatment demonstrated a greatly reduced ratio, signifying a persistent excess of proteolytic activity and a continued delay in healing. It is unclear whether the observed biochemical changes in the wound environment are responsible for healing or merely symptomatic of the disease state. We have, however, shown that an overall reduction in proteolytic activity is concomitant with healing. This suggests that therapies that redress the balance of inhibitor to protease may be beneficial in treatment of chronic wounds.
