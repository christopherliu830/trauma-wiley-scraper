AB  - Vulnerable populations generally have decreased access to health care, often present with advanced disease processes and experience poorer health outcomes compared to the general population. Here we report on the epidemiology and economics of a vulnerable population with chronic wounds served by an academic medical center that is the tertiary health care provider and referral center for the state of Mississippi. Data are being collected to determine if aggressive management and treatment improves health outcomes. The epidemiology of our population indicates that 48% are over 60 years of age; 45% are between 41?59 years of age; and 7% are under 40 years of age. About 61% are female and almost 39% male. Our vulnerable population is composed of 51.6% African Americans; 6.5% Native Americans; and 3.2% Hispanic Americans; with the remaining population or 38.7% Caucasian. The etiologies of wounds seen are 31% diabetic/neuropathic and 28.5% venous; followed by smaller percentages of surgically treated diabetic and venous wounds. We have found that this population commonly presents with a single wound, but that more than half (>50%) present with two or more wounds. A majority of these individuals (77%) visit the clinic more than two times, with most, or 44% visiting the clinic from two to five times. A smaller percentage, or about 30% visit the clinic six or more times. About 61% are either Medicare or Medicaid, or a combination, while the remainder are covered by private insurance (23%), workman?s compensation (3.2%), or are self-pay (12.9%). Despite this profile, the aggressive integration of a social worker in our clinic results in 35.5% being followed by home health. Thus, we will present data on whether the opening of a specialized treatment center results in better health outcomes in vulnerable populations once individuals receive appropriate referral and treatment.

AB  - We have recently established a keratinocyte/fibroblast co-culture system and demonstrated a potent keratinocyte-derived antifibrogenic factor (KDAF) for dermal fibroblasts relative to that of control cells. Later experiments identified KDAF as being the keratinocytes releasable 14-3-3 sigma. It is also known as stratifin. In this study, we hypothesize that differentiated, but not proliferating, keratinocytes are the primary source of releasable 14-3-3 proteins in conditioned medium. We also suggested that fibroblasts are not the primary source of these proteins. To examine this hypothesis, in a longitudinal study, keratinocyte differentiation was induced by growing these cells in our test medium consist of 49% keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM), 49% DMEM and 2% fetal bovine serum up to 24 days. When KCM was collected every other day and added to fibroblasts, the expression of collagenase mRNA was undetectable in cells receiving either fresh or 48?hr conditioned KSFM. However, the level of collagenase mRNA expression was markedly increased in fibroblasts receiving KCM collected at either early (day 2 and 4) or later (day 12?22) time points of replacing the KSFM with test medium. To examine whether fibroblasts also release different 14-3-3 isoforms, cultured conditioned media from both fibroblasts and keratinocytes were collected and evaluated for the presence of different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins by western blot analysis. The results revealed that fibroblasts which are highly responsive to some of the 14-3-3 isoforms such as α/? and σ forms, are barely able to express and release these factors into conditioned medium. This was in sharp contrast to a very high level of 14-3-3 proteins found in KCM. In conclusion, keratinocytes, but not fibroblasts, release different forms of 14-3-3 proteins which may function as MMP-1 stimulating factors for fibroblasts. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Extended healing time and lack of documented effective treatments of sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease create substantial problems. Locally applied zinc oxide has been reported to promote wound healing. We have compared topical zinc oxide (3%) with placebo meshes for pilonidal wounds healing by secondary intention in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Sixty-four consecutive patients, 53 males, aged between 18 and 60 years (median 26 years) with excised pilonidal wounds were centrally randomized to local zinc oxide (30?mg/g, n?=?33) or to placebo (n?=?31) mesh treatment. Patients were followed with strict recording of beneficial and harmful effects. The median healing times were 54 days (42?71 days, interquartile range, n?=?33) for the zinc group and 62 days (55?82 days, n?=?31) for the placebo group. This difference was not statistically different (p?=?0.32). Based on Cox regression analysis initial wound volume influenced healing negatively (p?=?0.016) while smoking (p?=?0.011) was associated with faster wound healing. Significantly (p?<?0.01) more placebo (n?=?12) than zinc oxide-treated patients (n?=?3) needed antibiotics postoperatively. Although topical zinc oxide increased (p?<?0.001) wound fluid zinc levels (1830?±?405??M, mean?±?SEM) compared with placebo (3.1?±?1.6??M) serum-zinc levels did not differ significantly between the zinc (13.5?±?0.4??M) and placebo (12.8?±?0.4??m) groups on postoperative day 7. No adverse events were recorded. Topical zinc oxide treatment did not accelerate time to closure of open pilonidal wounds but was associated with reduced antibiotic usage.

AB  - It has been known for many years that low levels of laser or noncoherent light (LLLT) accelerate some phases of wound healing. LLLT can stimulate fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and migration. It is thought to work via light absorption by mitochondrial cytochromes, increase in reactive oxygen species and consequent gene transcription. However, despite many reports about the positive effects of LLLT on wound healing, its use remains controversial. Our laboratory has developed a model of a full thickness excisional wound in mice that allows quantitative and reproducible light dose healing response curves to be generated. We have found a biphasic dose response curve with a maximum positive effect at 2?J/cm2 of 635-nm light and successively lower beneficial effects from 3?25?J/cm2, the effect is diminished at doses below 2?J/cm2 and gradually reaches control healing levels. At light doses above 25?J/cm2 healing is actually worse than controls. Although analysis of action spectra revealed the most effective light to be 635?nm, dose response curves are likely to be of similar shape for different wavelengths of light but at different absolute fluences. We found no difference between filtered 635?±?15-nm light from a lamp and 633-nm HeNe laser. Light alone (or a combination with other agents such as photosensitive dyes or matrix degrading enzymes) could be used for stimulation of wound healing. Our future work will be focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying effects of light on wound healing processes. We propose to examine various knockout and overexpressing mice to determine the precise mechanisms operating and to study mouse models of impaired wound healing to more closely define which patients might most benefit from LLLT.

AB  - Homeobox genes are transcription factor that form nested patterns in specific regions throughout the body. Homeobox genes are important for wound healing study because some have been shown to be related to scarless fetal wound healing. Muscle segment homeobox-2 (Msx-2) is a homeobox gene commonly expressed at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during tissue morphogenesis. Overexpression of Msx-2 leads to craniosynostosis, epidermal dysplasia, and abnormal hair growth. A knockout of this gene causes pleiotropic defects in bone growth, cyclic alopecia, and a thinner dermis. While Msx-2 has been found to play many critical roles in development, no functional study has been conducted on Msx-2 and wound healing. We hypothesize that Msx-2 regulates skin morphogenesis during wound repair which was tested by studying excisional skin wound closure. Isolated keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of Msx-2 WT and KO mice were also studied to determine the effects of Msx-2. Results showed that Msx-2 mRNA was induced in epidermis and dermis during wound repair. Additionally, Msx-2 KO mice exhibited enhanced re-epithelialization and faster wound closure than the WT control. These repair phenotypes may be attributed to keratinocyte motility and fibroblast interaction with collagen matrix as, in vitro, Msx-2 KO keratinocytes exhibited increased motility, and fibroblasts show stronger collagen matrix contraction and expressed higher levels of α2?1 than WT control. Msx-2 KO fibroblasts were refractory to BMP4 in collagen matrix contraction, demonstrating a disruption in the Msx-2 pathway. In conclusion, Msx-2 may regulate skin morphogenesis during repair at both epithelial and mesenchymal levels. This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM055081(TLT).

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 [alpha], IL-1 [beta]) have been shown to play a significant role in early stages of wound healing. Previous studies also indicate that mucosal wounds heal faster in males. The purpose of this study was to assess gene expression of inflammatory cytokines before and during wound healing. Younger and older volunteers received two small oral wounds on the hard palate. One of the wounds (3.5?mm in diameter) was videographed daily until healed. The other wound (1???5?mm) was biopsied either 6 or 24?h postwounding. Real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000 SDS) was performed on the unwounded and wounded tissues to study gene expression. Preliminary analyses revealed that compared to unwounded tissue, wounding induced rapid gene expression for these cytokines. In males, IL-1 [beta] gene expression peaked at 6?h and was higher than in females. Since males have been shown to heal this type of wound faster than females, this earlier peak of IL-1 [beta] may be beneficial to wound healing. Regardless of gender, IL-1ra and IL-1 [alpha] levels peaked at 6 and 24?h, respectively. Interestingly, cytokine levels in unwounded tissue correlated with wound healing parameters (e.g., wound sizes, time to heal), but in females only. Specifically, women with higher basal levels of IL-1 [beta] and IL-1ra, and lower levels of IL-1 [alpha] tended to heal faster. Thus, the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in unwounded mucosal tissue may play a determinant role in wound healing outcomes. (Supported by NIH P50 DE-13749)

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear polysaccharide synthesized by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, 2, and 3) located on the plasma membrane. Evidence suggests that HA metabolism plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. More specifically, HA levels have been shown to rise in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce an increase in HAS1 transcript in adult dermal fibroblasts. To further examine the intricacies of HA metabolism, this study sought to characterize the HAS1 promoter and determine whether HAS1 regulation occurred at the level of transcription. This study characterized the genetic components needed for HAS1 promoter function, beginning with elucidation of the HAS1 transcription start site. 5? RLM-RACE of purified adult dermal fibroblast mRNA specified a transcription start site 22 nucleotides further upstream when compared to previous published start sites (gi:9454515). A luciferase reporter assay of three PCR-amplified HAS1 promoter constructs detected that the core promoter was contained in the immediate 500?nt upstream of the HAS1 transcription start site (table). Promoter activity was also detected 1150?nt and 1600?nt upstream of the transcription start site, albeit at lesser values. This may be an indication of the existence of a repressor upstream of the 500?nt core promoter construct. In addition, to test the hypothesis that IL-1 regulates HAS1 at the level of transcription, fibroblasts were transfected with each promoter construct and examined for an IL-1 response. Promoter activity showed no significant increase. Initial nuclear run-on studies, however, indicated that the IL-1-induced increase in HAS1 transcripts may be under transcriptional regulation. Vector 500?nt 1150?nt 1600?nt Luciferase Activity (RLU/s) 134 81051 7637 67 NIH, Grant GM58530, supported this study.

AB  - Purpose:? Gene therapy provides a useful method to enhance wound healing, but it has not been attempted in healing of wounds in flexor tendons in the hands, which inherently lack sufficient intrinsic healing capacity. To explore the potential of application of gene therapy to tendon wound healing, we genetically modified tenocytes with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and investigated the expression of the genes for collagen production in an in vitro model of the proliferating tenocytes. Method:? Tenocytes were obtained from cultures of rat intrasynovial tendons and randomly distributed to 34 dishes. The tenocytes in dishes in two experimental groups (n?=?9, each group) were treated for 12 hours with the plasmid containing the PDGF-B cDNA or the VEGF cDNA and were then cultured for 5 days; tenocytes in the other eight dished received sham vector and the tenocytes in the control dishes (n?=?8) did not receive the exogenous gene. Efficiency of the gene transfer was evaluated by detection of the presence of the transgene in the tenocytes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Levels of expression of type I and III collagen, and TGF-? genes were determined by quantitative analysis of the products of RT-PCR. Results:? Expression of the type I collagen gene was significantly increased by transfer of the exogenous PFDGF gene to the tenocytes (p?<?0.001). Transfer of the PDGF-B gene did not affect the expression of TGF-? and the type III collagen genes significantly. Expression of TGF-? gene increased significantly in the cells treated with exogenous VEGF cDNA (p?=?0.039). Expression of type I and III collagen genes by tenocytes was minimally affected by transfer of the VEGF gene to the tenocytes and was significantly weaker than that stimulated by PDGF-B gene therapy (p?=?0.001). Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by the presence of the PDGF-B gene or the VEGF gene in the tenocytes receiving the transferred genes. Conclusions:? Transfer of exogenous PDGF-B gene significantly enhances expression of the type I collagen gene of the tenocytes. Transfer of exogenous VEGF gene has very limited effects on promotion of collagen production in the proliferating tenocytes. In contrast, transfer of the VEGF gene significantly increases expression of the TGF-? gene. This study suggests that transfer of the PDGF-B gene may offer a novel way of effectively promoting healing of intrasynovial flexor tendons. VEGF gene therapy is not as beneficial as PDGF-B gene therapy to tendon healing and may increase activities of TGF-? that are associated with adhesion formations.

AB  - A delicate balance between synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) and degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of normal skin. Epidermal-mesenchymal interactions play a critical role in controlling the expression of MMPs during development and healing of skin. Disruption of this interaction increases the frequency of developing fibrotic conditions such as hypertrophic scarring and keloids. In the absence of epithelialization, ECM continues to accumulate until dermal fibroblasts receive signal(s) from epidermal cells to slow down the dynamic process of maturation and remodeling of the healing wound. We have recently demonstrated that keratinocyte releasable stratifin stimulates MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanism by which stratifin protein induces MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to identify elements of the signaling pathway mediating stratifin stimulation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression. We did so by examining the three distinct MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 as well as the expression of the main components of the AP-1 dimers, c-Jun and c-Fos, which are mediated by distinct MAPK pathways. Our data shows that treatment of fibroblasts with stratifin resulted in rapid and transient up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that stratifin activates fibroblast MMP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels and this is mediated by p38 MAP kinase. Subsequent cDNA microarray analysis of fibroblasts treated with stratifin show an increase in a ternary complex factor, Sap-1. In conclusion, our results describes the mechanism by which stratifin activates MMP-1 in fibroblast, and demonstrates that p38 MAP kinase is an important regulator of MMP-1 gene expression involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions in wound remodeling.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated and compared the effectivity of two modalities, gene therapy with adenovirus-mediated transforming growth factor-? and extracorporal shock waves (ESW) therapy, to treat ischemically challenged epigastric skin flaps in a rat model. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of ten rats each. An epigastric skin flap model, based solely on the right inferior epigastric vessels, was used as the model in this study. Rats received either subdermal injections of adenovirus encoding TGF-?(Ad-TGF-?) or ESW treatment with 750 impulses at 0.15?mJ/mm2. The third group received no treatment and served as a control group. A flap measuring 8???8?cm was outlined on the abdominal skin. The TGF-? injections were given subdermally in the left upper corner of the flap just prior to flap elevation, whereas the ESW treatment was immediately after the flap was sutured back to its bed. Flap viability was evaluated seven days after the initial operation. Digital images of the epigastric flaps were taken and areas of necrotic zones relative to total flap surface area were measured and expressed as percentages by using a software program. Overall, there was a significant increase in mean percent surviving area in the Ad-TGF-? group and the ESW-group compared to the control group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0% and control group: 82.6?±?4.3%; p?<?0.05). Furthermore, in the ESW group mean percent surviving areas were significantly larger than in the Ad-TGF-? group (ESW-group: 97.7?±?1.8% vs. Ad-TGF-?: 90.3?±?4.0%; p?<?0.05). We conclude that treatment with ESW enhances epigastric skin flap survival significantly more than Ad-TGF-? treatment and, thus, represents a modality that is more feasible, cost effective and less invasive compared to gene therapy with growth factors to improve blood supply to ischemic tissue.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Based on the results of a study showing increased healing rates in a rabbit wound healing model, a clinical study was initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of a new electric stimulation bandage (POSiFECT dressing). Four patients have completed the study for the first-generation system and two are currently enrolled in the evaluation of the second-generation system. Materials and Methods:? Spinal cord-injured pressure ulcer patients were treated with the POSiFECT dressing in a randomized double-blind crossover study. During the first 8 weeks, subjects received a dressing supplying 50??A of current or one with an unconnected battery. During the treatment, bandages were changed every other day and wounds were assessed weekly to determine size, depth, and condition. At the end of 8 weeks the patients were unblinded and the control group was treated with working bandages for 8 weeks. After cessation of treatment, assessments continued each month for 2 months. Results:? The treatment led to statistically significant increases in healing rates during the first week (0.19?±?0.11?cm/wk) and the first 2 weeks (0.10?±?0.07?cm/wk) compared to both the control group (?0.03?±?0.0?cm/wk) and the follow-up period (?0.02?±?0.08?cm/wk). For each patient, however, there was a time frame during the 3rd to 5th week of treatment in which significant decreases in healing rate occurred (?0.31 to ?0.096). Conclusions:? The POSiFECT dressing appears to increase healing during the first few weeks after application. A modified clinical study is under way with a new dressing design as well as a treatment protocol providing 3 weeks of stimulation followed by 2 weeks without stimulation and then 3 more weeks of stimulation.

AB  - Several lines of evidence demonstrate that limited inflammation is key for scarless healing to take place in early fetal skin. Because inflammation and angiogenesis are often linked in pathological processes, we hypothesized that angiogenesis may play a significant role in the regulation of scar formation. A mouse model of fetal wound repair was utilized to study angiogenesis in wounds generated at either embryonic day 15 (E15), when scarless healing takes place, or embryonic day 18 (E18), when significant scarring occurs. CD31 immunohistochemical staining and image analysis were used to calculate blood vessel density at 7 days post-wounding. Wounds generated at E15 showed no increase in vessel density above levels found in unwounded, age-matched skin. In contrast, wounds generated at E18 displayed a 45% increase in vessel density compared to control skin, similar to what is seen during adult wound healing. Increased protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 3 day wounds generated at E18 (8.06?±?1.89?pg VEGF/?g protein compared to 1.99?±?0.4 in wounds made at E15) likely contribute to the increase in vascularity. In addition, injection of E15 wounds with 0.05??g of VEGF resulted in the production of a scar, compared to control wounds which healed without a scar. To further explore the idea that VEGF may contribute to scarring, we examined the effects of VEGF neutralization on scar formation in adult murine skin. Anti-VEGF antibody injections resulted in a significant reduction in scar formation compared to control scars based on histological and ultrastructural analysis. Our studies suggest a novel role for VEGF in promoting scar tissue deposition, and suggest that VEGF inhibitors may be useful for limiting cutaneous fibrosis.

AB  - Hypothesis:? Both hypoxia and lactate independently induce VEGF synthesis. However, an adequate supply of oxygen is required for new vessels to mature. Materials and Methods:? We used in vivo matrigel (growth factor reduced) angiogenesis assay and Swiss Webster mice n?=?36 (3 groups of 12 with 6 control and 6 experimental in each). Each mouse received a 1?ml subcutaneous matrigel injection. Matrigel solidifies into a gel implant when injected subcutaneously. Control injections/implants were matrigel with no added substance and experimental implants were matrigel supplemented with 30?mgs of crushed lactate polymer or PL (poly DL-Lactide-co-Glycolide 50:50; av. mol.wt. 50?75,000 kilo Daltons). The first group of mice was maintained in 12?14% oxygen, the second group in 21% oxygen, and the third group in 50?52% oxygen continuously for 11 days, at which time the implants were harvested, fixed, sectioned, and stained with Mason?s Trichrome to identify new vessels and collagen. Results:? 1.?13% oxygen control: Half showed new blood vessels with thin or incomplete walls and hemorrhages. Few collagen fibers 2.?13% oxygen with PL: same as above 3.?21% oxygen control: none showed new blood vessels/collagen fibers 4.?21% oxygen with PL: five out of six showed new blood vessels. Almost all were mature, with complete walls, collagen fibers, and no hemorrhages 5.?51% oxygen control: None showed new blood vessels/collagen fibers 6.?51% oxygen with PL: all six developed new vessels with some hemorrhage seen in two out of six. Collagen fibers present Note: matrigel contains collagen and stained a pale blue, collagen fibers were seen as dark blue, endothelial cells and RBCs as dark red and red. All blood vessels contained RBCs. Conclusions:? Hypoxia and lactate induce VEGF. However, hypoxia limits vascular growth by inhibiting collagen deposition. The largest and most mature new vessels result from a combination of oxygen and lactate.

AB  - Scarless fetal wound healing in connective tissue is characterized by organized collagen deposition that leads to regeneration and apparently normal tissue structure and function. In contrast, adult wound healing is characterized by the deposition of unorganized collagen that leads to scar formation and a loss of functionally relevant structural organization. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis and deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix molecules, and the subsequent remodeling and contraction during the wound healing process. Therefore, fibroblasts play a key role in the different outcomes observed in fetal and adult wound healing. The hypothesis is that fetal fibroblasts, relative to adult fibroblasts, have an altered capacity to contract collagen gels and remodel collagen fibrils due to inherent differences in their contractile phenotype. In this study, an anchored collagen gel model was used to evaluate matrix contraction and remodeling by these different fibroblast phenotypes. Video microscopy was used to measure the changes in surface area of contracting collagen gels. Collagen gel reorganization was evaluated using a fitting algorithm to predict the distribution and orientation of collagen fibrils from scanning electron microscopy images. In addition, fibroblast morphology and proliferation on contracting collagen gels were examined. Understanding these phenotypic variations will elucidate key differences in the wound healing process that can be used for potential clinical applications involving cell therapy and tissue engineered constructs.

AB  - Currently, skin cells or tissues intended for therapeutical or cosmetic applications are typically cultured using standard in vitro culture techniques. The avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has been traditionally used for many years to assess angiogenesis of exogenous substances. Avian embryos have also been used to generate viruses for vaccine development. Most of the uses of the avian CAM cultures are typically conducted in ovo. However, xenobiotic cultures of ex ovo avian embryos and explanted organs, tissues or cells from human or other mammalian origin have not been used in the past with the explicit purpose of achieving the appropriate extent of expansion, differentiation or vascularization required for therapeutic or cosmetic implantation into humans or animals. Here, a novel method of xenobiotic skin culture was developed that can be employed for wound healing studies or for tissue engineering applications to sustain the culture of live skin explants through the benefit of a xenobiotic vascularization. The method uses fertile Japanese quail (Cortunix cortunix japonica) eggs. The eggs were incubated for at least 3 days in ovo using a static egg incubator. On day 3 the egg is opened under sterile conditions through the air chamber and placed in a cylindrical culture dish slightly larger than the overall diameter of the egg yolk. The embryo was then cultured at 37?°C for an additional 24 to 48 hours until a well-vascularized CAM covers the entire surface of the culture dish. Next, fragments of skin were placed directly over the CAM. The cultures were continued for 8 days and then the skin explants were transferred to new CAMs. These changes, every 8 days, were done at least five times allowing the skin to be maintained in culture for several weeks without apparent damage in viability. The skin fragments remained viable and capable of reepithelialization when wounded. Skin explants from both mouse and human were successfully cultured in this manner. Because immunological response cannot occur in the embryonic culture environment, it was possible to xenotransplant skin fragments without risk of rejection. The ensuing embryonic vessels developed into the xenotransplanted skin and generated a permeable vascular network that provided oxygen and nutrients necessary to ensure viability and promote proliferation and differentiation. Viability of the explants was evaluated by immunohisto chemical methods using proliferation and apoptosis markers (Caspase-3, BrdU, and PCNA). Vascularization was assessed using species-specific anti endothelial antibodies (anti-PECAM human and mouse and QH1 and QH2 monoclonal antibodies). The new method described herein has the distinct advantage of sustaining live, functional skin cultures by means of a rich vascular supply that provides cells with nutrients and oxygen.

AB  - Exposure to cigarette smoke has detrimental effects on the early stages of wound repair but not much is known about the effects of smoke on the development of the healing (granulation) tissue. Cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and deposition of ECM are critical processes for normal granulation tissue (GT) formation. Here we investigate the effects of MSW (?first-hand smoke?) and SSW (the main component of ?secondhand smoke?) smoke on wound healing in mice that have been smoking for 9 months. We show that both MSW and SSW smoke adversely affect wound contraction and closure. The keratinocytes accumulate at the edge of the wound and the GT is deficient in fibroblasts and ECM. Moreover, by immunolabeling for α-SMA, we found that the myofibroblasts remained at the edges of the wound rather than penetrating the GT, potentially contributing to the lack of wound contraction. To test the possibility that smoke inhibits cell migration, we plated primary human fibroblasts in between two interstitial collagen gels, treated the cultures with the smoke solutions and found that cell migration into the gels was inhibited. Furthermore, using the collagen gel contraction assay, we showed that cigarette smoke components inhibit gel contraction. To further decipher which components of the smoke contribute to delayed wound closure, we fractionated SSW smoke solutions into polar and nonpolar components using solid phase extraction cartridges. We show that both the polar and nonpolar fractions delay wound closure in vivo and that the nonpolar fraction inhibits cell migration whereas the polar faction increases cell survival. We are currently pursuing these studies by further fractionation of these two phases with the goal of identifying the specific component(s) in each fraction that cause these effects on cell migration and survival. Identification of the components in cigarette smoke that lead to delayed wound healing and eliminating them from cigarettes could help those exposed to secondhand smoke heal faster.

AB  - Chronic nonhealing wounds have been long associated with an imbalance between the degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Human and animal studies have shown psychological stress to impair healing and differentially regulate gene expression. We hypothesized that psychological stress-impaired healing is mediated by altered expression of MMP and TIMP. SKH-1 mice were subjected to restraint stress 3 days before and 5 days after placement of 3.5?mm biopsy wounds. The wounds were biopsied at various time points and analyzed for gene expression by real-time PCR. The wounds of stressed mice showed significantly delayed healing when compared to the wounds of controls through day 5 postwounding. There was a significantly higher expression of MMP-8 in the stressed groups on days 1 (172%, p?<?0.0003) and 3 (204%, p?<?0.0003) postwounding. Stress decreased MMP-9 expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.02), but showed no significant difference to controls on the other days. TIMP-1, which is known to inhibit most activated MMPs, had significantly lower expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.0003). TIMP-2, which is constitutively expressed, did not show any difference in expression between the stress and the control groups. During stress, increased MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) activity is in agreement with previous studies in our model that have demonstrated a increase in neutrophil recruitment on days 3 and 5 postwounding. Likewise, lower expression of TIMP-1 during stress is similar to findings in chronic wounds as opposed to healing surgical wounds. Hence, altered expression of the metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, may lead to increased damage early in healing and decreased repair later in stress-impaired wound healing.

AB  - Introduction:? Chronic, nonhealing wounds are often observed in tissues with poor oxygen supply. Impaired reepithelialization is a hallmark of these wounds; however, the pathogenesis of the retarded reepithelialization in chronic, ischemic wounds remains poorly understood. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) is involved in both normal and hypoxic wound healing response and exogenous overexpression of Smad3, a TGF-beta signaling intermediate, has been known to accelerate reepithelialization. In a recent study, Ad-Smad3 injection in the rabbit ear dermal ulcer model showed enhanced reepithelialization and granulation tissue area suggesting a positive effect of Smad3 on wound healing. However, little is known about the role of Smad3 in the ischemic wound healing process. In this study we examined the effect of Smad3 in an ischemic wound model. Methods:? Ad-Smad3 or LacZ (108?pfu/wound) empty vector was injected in either ear of White New Zealand Rabbits. Twenty-four hours later, these ears were rendered ischemic using an established model and four 7-mm full-thickness punch wounds were made on each ear. Results:? Histological evaluation showed a highly significant increase in reepithelialization, epithelial ingrowth and percentage of epithelialization in Ad-Smad3 transfected wounds versus ischemic wounds transfected with LacZ-empty vector (p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? Our data confirm the enhancing effect of Smad3 on reepithelialization in an ischemic wound model. The deficiency in reepithelialization, as evident in chronic ischemic wounds, could thus be ameliorated by excess Smad3. Therapeutic interventions using overexpressed Smad3 may improve wound healing through accelerated epithelialization in chronic wounds.
