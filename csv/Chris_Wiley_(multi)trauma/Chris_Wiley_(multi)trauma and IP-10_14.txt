AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. In vitro cell culture bioactivity experiments are planned. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated.

AB  - Wound repair is described as a delicately balanced and well-orchestrated progression of events, which ultimately results in healing in the majority of acute cases. However, time taken to complete healing can vary greatly between patients and any alteration in this physiological process could delay healing further. Thus, a wound treatment, which facilitates healing independent of wound type and in patients where healing is compromised or impeded, would be extremely advantageous. Previous studies suggest a beneficial role for biomaterials such as collagen/ORC in modifying the chronic wound environment; however, their effect on the acute wound environment is unknown. While it is generally accepted that acute wounds heal at an optimum rate due to a positive wound environment, we wanted to determine if current advanced wound healing treatments could augment or impact this healing rate. In this study we evaluated the effect of advanced wound therapies in the presence of acute wound fluid on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. We hypothesize that an enhanced effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid may be indicative of a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute wounds. Results demonstrate that of the wound treatments tested only collagen/ORC containing therapies exhibited a positive effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid. We conclude, therefore, that collagen/ORC biomaterials, already shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wounds, may also be a valuable therapy in the treatment of acute wounds.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)

AB  - Wound healing involves many cell types whose functions are dependent upon the coordinated production of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Recent data show that behavioral stress disrupts the cytokine profile and slows wound closure. For example, in mice, restraint stress (RST) suppressed IL-1?, PDGF, and MCP-1 production, and delayed healing of a 3.5?mm circular wound by more than 3 days. The RST-induced delay in healing was due, in part, to elevated glucocorticoids (GC) and could be blocked by administration of the androgen hormone, androstenediol (AED). Therefore, it was hypothesized that AED would antagonize GC-mediated regulation of cytokine gene expression at the transcriptional level, prevent RST-mediated/GC-dependent suppression of cytokine expression at the tissue level, and restore healing to that of controls. Total wound RNA was collected after injury, cDNA was synthesized, and real-time PCR was used to quantify IL-1? RNA as a measure of proinflammatory gene expression and I?Bα RNA as a measure of NF-?B transcriptional activation. Compared to controls, RST delayed wound closure (P?<?0.001) and decreased IL-1?(P?=?0.021) and I?Bα expression within 12?24 hours of wounding (P?=?0.021). In contrast, treatment of RST animals with AED restored IL-1? gene expression and restored wound closure to that of controls. Additionally, AED enhanced I?Bα RNA postinjury (P?<?0.001) suggestive of enhanced NF-?B activation. Because of the macrophage?s ability to coordinate inflammatory responses during healing, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were used to examine modulation of NF-?B activity in AED and GC-treated cells. The data showed that dexamethasone blocked translocation of active p65 which correlated with diminished cytokine gene expression. In contrast, AED restored cytokine gene expression and nuclear p65 levels in GC-treated cultures. In sum, these data suggest that AED antagonized GC-mediated regulation of cytokine gene expression at the transcriptional level and restored cutaneous wound healing to that of unstressed controls.

AB  - Background:? Activation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been linked to dermal wound healing in fetal and adult tissue. Activation of this pathway has been previously linked to interleukin (IL)-1? expression. This study addresses the mechanism by which IL-1? regulates both production of and response to PGE2 in cultured human fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts. Hypothesis:? IL-1? regulates fetal and adult dermal fibroblast PGE2 signaling. Methods:? Fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts were isolated from human skin explants. Secretion of soluble mediators was assayed using ELISA kits. Expression of COX-2 as well as the various PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4) was analyzed at both the mRNA and protein levels. Results:? Compared to adult fibroblasts, fetal fibroblasts produced decreased levels of IL-6 and IL-8, but similar levels of PGE2. IL-1?1 caused up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in both fetal and adult fibroblasts. However, administration of IL-1?, tumor necrosis factor-α or interferon-? did not significantly alter the mRNA or protein levels of any PGE2 receptor subtype. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results. IL-1? causes up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts, but does not alter the expression of PGE2 receptors. Therefore, proinflammatory mediator-induced changes in both fetal and adult skin fibroblasts appear to act through increased production of the signal molecules and not through increased or altered receptor expression for PGE2. This finding raises the possibility of increased autocrine signaling in the context of dermal inflammation, such as that associated with a wound healing response. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Permeability of the endothelium occurs early in the angiogenic process, resulting from the initial loss or disruption of endothelial cell-cell adhesions, which is followed by endothelial cell contraction, forming paracellular gaps. We are interested in the angiogenesis and endothelial permeability induced by inflammation; thus, we have chosen to study mechanisms involved in the endothelial permeability stimulated by the angiogenic chemokine Interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8). We have found that IL-8 induces permeability in a receptor-dependent process requiring the activation of Gαi and the regulation of PKA activity. Pertussis toxin abolishes the effect of IL-8 on endothelial permeability, while a PKA inhibitor, H89, results in a similar effect. Thus, regulation of the level of PKA activity appears critical in IL-8-induced permeability, potentially due to the differential regulation of molecules downstream of PKA, such as SREBP and RhoA. PKA and cAMP are thought to inhibit the activation of SREBP, a protein involved in lipid metabolism; we have also found, using inhibitors of SREBP that this molecule is likewise necessary for the permeability stimulated by IL-8. Furthermore, SREBP inhibitors block IL-8-induced activation of RhoA, a GTPase that has been implicated in permeability induced by multiple factors. Taken together, our results indicate a possible signal transduction pathway downstream of the IL-8 receptors, in which the inhibition of cAMP production, and, thus, of PKA activation, by Gαi increases SREBP activity, resulting in increased RhoA activity, leading to endothelial cell contraction and gap formation, increasing endothelial permeability. Because IL-8 plays important roles in the permeability observed in inflammatory disorders, knowledge of the signaling mechanisms induced by this chemokine during permeability increases may be used to identify targets for drug development. This project has been funded by the American Heart Association.

AB  - Cellular interaction with biomaterials determines the fate of the implant. Naturally derived biomaterials such as small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and renal capsule matrix (RCM) may provide optimal structure and composition for cellular repopulation in certain wound healing applications. Porcine renal capsule matrix (RCM) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix undergoing characterization and preclinical investigation for the treatment of soft tissue injury. Early studies have demonstrated that RCM constructs induce host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. RCM consists primarily of collagen, although the other proteins have been detected, including the growth factors basic FGF, VEGF, and CTGF. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to envision the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that RCM is a dense, heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse following lyophilization, much of the native structure seen in the hydrated isolate is preserved. These differences are maintained following rehydration in normal saline. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture likely facilitates host interaction at the cellular level. Further compositional characterization is under way. This work was supported by Cook Biotech Incorporated, West Lafayette, IN.

AB  - Fibroblasts in chronic wounds, and in skin in which ulcers develop, have been reported to show characteristics of senescence, presumably induced by conditions predisposing to chronic wounds or the wound environment. In monolayer culture, secretion of IL-8 declines to zero as the cells approach senescence (at about generations 50?55 in the cells tested). In three-dimensional scaffold-based tissue culture, fibroblasts, at about 30?35 population doublings, upregulate the IL-8 gene by comparison with monolayer cultures and secrete large amounts of IL-8 (30?50?ng/106 cells/day). However, it is inferred that a decline in secretion, similar to that seen in monolayer also occurs in three-dimensional culture and in the senescent fibroblasts of chronic wounds. This will result in decreased influx and activation of neutrophils. The hypothesis is proposed that chronic wounds arise because fibroblasts, following injury to ulcer-prone skin, do not recruit and activate neutrophils sufficiently to prevent bacterial colonization. As the result of the persistent presence of live bacteria, inflammatory cells or keratinocytes in a wound site may be expected to trigger mechanisms to inhibit keratinocyte migration and reepithelialization, leading to chronic ulceration.

AB  - Delayed healing can result for a number of reasons; however, one important factor in the wound healing process is the role of bacteria. An imbalance in the wound bioburden may lead to infection, and thereby severely delay healing. Thus to ensure healing progresses in a timely manner, it is necessary to maintain a healthy microbial balance and prevent any impending infection. Dermal cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes generate numerous chemokines and growth factors that regulate the immune response and the phases of healing. While topical antiseptics and antimicrobials can kill bacteria and are therefore used to help manage infection in wounds, they may also be cytotoxic to these important cell types. Cytotoxicity is acceptable when overt clinical infection is present, due to a greater need for bacterial balance. However, clinical signs of infection in chronic wounds may not be present, making it difficult to correctly determine diagnosis and appropriate use of these antimicrobial products. In these cases, a product which addresses both the antibacterial action of topical antiseptics/antimicrobials and their impact on key healing factors, (i.e., cytotoxicity to host cells), could help reduce the incidence of wound infection without impacting the rate of healing. In this study we investigated the effect of silver-ORC and an ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. The antimicrobial properties of the dressing was also investigated, in in vitro studies using common bacterial wound pathogens. While other silver-releasing dressings address the bioburden of nonhealing wounds, their in vitro cytotoxicity suggests that the rate of healing may not be optimal if the presence of infection is questionable. In contrast this in vitro work suggests the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC is not cytotoxic, but is still capable of controlling wound pathogens, suggesting it may be used on a broad spectrum of wounds independent of their bacterial bioburden.

AB  - Removal of necrotic tissue is essential for wound-bed preparation for the treatment of chronic wounds. Enzymatic debridement appears to be most useful in the removal of eschar when surgical techniques cannot be utilized. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of papain?urea chlorophyllin ointment compared to moist wound care using an infected, acute, porcine full thickness wound model. Twenty full thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of domestic pigs. Following hemostasis, the wounds were contaminated with wound-isolated bacteria then treated with test articles and dressed with moisture-retentive dressing. All the wounds were evaluated 1, 4, 8, 11, 14,18, and 21 days postsurgery for epithelialization and biopsies were obtained for microscopic evaluation. The results showed no adverse effect in reepithelialization in acute wounds when using papain?urea chlorophyllin 'ointment compared to moist wound care, TEWL measurements also showed no adverse affects from the treatment. Microscopic examination reveals an increase in the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis of the treated pigs as well as an increase in the depth of rete pegs. New blood vessel formation was increased at all examined time points in the papain?urea chlorophyllin ointment treated pigs, which was verified with CD31 and von Willebrand Factor staining. VEGF was increased after 1 week in the wound fluid from treated wounds compared to moist control. While the reepithelialization rate does not appear to be inhibited by papain?urea-chlorophyllin combination in acute wounds, the healing appears to be more complete based on the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis and the extensive rete peg formation. The wounds also appear to have enhanced vascularization which is vital in supplying nutrients to the newly healed wound.

AB  - Despite the use of antibiotics, antiseptics, and improved sterile techniques, infection remains one of the most frequent complications of wound healing. Infection must be avoided to permit proper wound healing. Systemic and topical antibiotics and antiseptics with broad antimicrobial spectra have been used. Antiseptics have not generally been reported to develop bacterial resistance like antibiotics. Several reports have suggested that antiseptics exhibit significant cytotoxicity toward wound bed cells and may interfere with the normal wound healing process. Thus, for chronic ulcers, the standard of care is debridment and moist dressing with saline. We will describe the properties of a new topical antimicrobial solution, NVC-101. These include its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against gram positive, gram negative bacteria, yeast and fungi pathogens, and its lower toxicity as compared to commonly used topical antiseptics. In addition, we will describe the in vivo safety profile of NVC-101 in the rabbit eye and guinea pig sensitization models, as well as 28-day application to full thickness wounds in rats and mini-pigs. Based on these findings, multicenter Phase II clinical trials on infected chronic ulcers are under way.

AB  - The MRL mouse is the only known strain of mouse that can regenerate cardiac lesions and completely heal ear punches without scarring. To determine if the MRL also has greater regeneration capabilities in amputated digit tips, right paw digit tips of neonatal mice were dissected, with the left front paws as uncut controls. Controls used for regeneration comparison were the DBA, B6, C3H, and 129 inbred mouse strains. Consecutive X-ray images were captured of the left and right paws at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postamputation. MRL mouse digit tips regenerated greater in comparison to all strains tested (p?<?0.05). We next undertook whole genome microarray analysis to identify the genetic mechanisms that contribute to differences in digit tip regeneration. Over 400 genes out of 15,000 were significantly differentially expressed (p?<?0.05) in MRL and DBA mice at day 4 in comparison to day 0 control tissue. Of these, 170 genes were upregulated and 280 were downregulated in both mouse strains. Pathway analysis reveals that genes in the BMP/TGF pathway are differentially expressed in both mouse strains (p?<?0.05). Multiple differences between MRL and DBA strains were found in transcription factors that are implicated in gastrulation, including FMN2 and SHRM. Additional differentially expressed genes include NET1 in the WNT signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry indicates that these proteins are highly expressed in the nuclei of chondrocytes in regenerating digits. We conclude that MRL mice show greater regenerative capacity to heal digit tips and that the increased regenerative capacity of MRL mice may be due to strain specific increased expression of genes involved in the WNT pathway and genes involved in embryonic pattern formation.

AB  - TGF?1 is a multipotent secreted cytokine that plays a pivotal role in wound healing. Previously, both positive and negative effects of TGF?1 on cutaneous wound healing have been reported. The mechanisms underlying these effects of TGF?1 remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we used a mouse model to examine the effects of cutaneous wound healing, wherein the latent form of TGF?1 is constitutively expressed in basal keratinocytes of the mouse epidermis, targeted by the keratin 5 promoter (K5.TGF?1). In wild-type mice with 6-mm full thickness excisional cutaneous wounds, TGF?1 protein levels were elevated immediately after wounding, and reached a peak level on day 3 postwounding, which was 3?5-fold higher than that in the nonwounded skin, and sharply declined afterward. This elevated expression pattern suggests that only transient TGF?1 overexpression is required for normal wound healing. In contrast, K5.TGF?1 mice with prolonged TGF?1 transgene expression at the level equivalent to the above peak level in wild-type mice exhibited a significant delay in healing of 6-mm full thickness excisional wounds when compared to wild-type mice. Histological analysis of wounds revealed delayed reepithelialization, increased inflammation and prolonged granular tissue accumulation in K5.TGF?1wt mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed excessive leukocyte infiltration in transgenic wounds when compared to wild-type wounds. Understandably, the accumulation of leukocytes was also accompanied by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, angiogenic factors and fibrotic factors as determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Although the above factors override the growth inhibitory effect of TGF?1 on epidermal proliferation away from the wound edge, proliferation at the leading edge of the migrating keratinocytes was reduced in transgenic skin compared to the nontransgenic skin, evident by PCNA staining. Keratinocyte proliferation was also reduced in vitro when assessed by H3-thymidine incorporation. To assess the direct effect of TGF?1 on keratinocyte migration, we performed an in vitro migration assay and found that K5.TGF?1 keratinocytes had delayed migration when compared with wild-type cells. Our study suggests that prolonged TGF?1 expression in keratinocytes delays cutaneous wound healing by excessive inflammation, coupled to a direct inhibitory effect on keratinocyte proliferation and migration.

AB  - Introduction:? Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an established treatment of chronic wounds. There is limited understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of NPWT. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the biochemical composition of wound fluid collected from chronic pressure ulcer wounds in adults treated with NPWT. Methods:? Nine stage III or IV pressure ulcer patients scheduled for NPWT (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI, San Antonio, TX) were recruited. Their ages ranged between 30 and 99. Concentrations of cytokines (IL-1?, TNF-α), metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in wound fluids were measured at baseline and after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days of continuous NPWT. Results:? At days 1, 3, and 7, TNF-α levels were significantly and comparably lower than baseline (p?<?0.05). MMP- 3 levels significantly decreased from baseline at days 1 and 3 (p?<?0.05) and significantly increased from baseline at day 7 (p?<?0.05) with continuous NPWT. IL-1? levels significantly increased at day 3 (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in TIMP-1 or MMP-2 levels at any of the time points when compared to baseline. Discussions and Conclusions:? A key finding of this study is that with NWPT, reductions in levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, from baseline levels were observed and this effect was sustained for at least 1 week. This, together with effects on IL-1 and MMP-3, may be an indication that the NPWT has a rapid and sustained effect on the inflammatory state of chronic wounds. Further studies are being conducted to expand sample size and to analyze other wound healing indicators.

AB  - Introduction:? Compelling evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO?) plays an important role in wound healing. Not only does it possess cytotoxic properties, but also regulatory functions on various cells involved in inflammation and proliferation. In wounds, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) catalyzes arginine to citrulline and NO?, whereas arginase converts arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine is an essential substrate for the synthesis of polyamines, which are important in cellular proliferation and repair. A model for regulation of wound healing proposes the importance of a strict reciprocal control of these enzymes in wounds. Human studies using impaired wound healing models, however, are lacking in this area. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate arginine metabolism in wound fluids of patients with pressure ulcers on Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.?) therapy. Methods:? Wound fluid extracts from 11 patients with stage III or IV pressure ulcer were analyzed for cytokines and metabolites of arginine. Sample age ranged from 31?92 years. Wound fluid was collected prior to V.A.C.? application and post-V.A.C.? within 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days. Subjects served as their own control in this quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Spectrophotometric quantification of nitrates and nitrites using the Griess diazotization reaction method was performed. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, and proline were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Results:? There was no significant differences between pre- and post-V.A.C.? concentrations of NO?, citrulline, ornithine, and proline. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in arginine levels measured at baseline and day'3 of V.A.C.? treatment. Also, NO? measured at 24 hours of V.A.C.? placement decreased significantly at day 7 of therapy. Furthermore, post-V.A.C.? levels of TNF-α decreased significantly from baseline. A less cytotoxic environment is created, thus indicating a healing wound following 1 week of V.A.C.? therapy. Discussion:? Arginine and its metabolites are detectable in wound fluids from patients with pressure ulcers. To our knowledge, the metabolism of arginine has not been described in human subjects with pressure ulcers on V.A.C.? therapy. The determination of NO? in these wound environments provides baseline information on the mechanisms involved in aberrant wound healing.

AB  - The use of fresh platelets has gained value in medicine as an essential part of wound treatments. This is not surprising since platelets contain a number of bioactive factors that contribute to the process of wound healing, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF). Fresh platelets? short shelf life limits platelet-based therapies. If platelets can be stabilized in freeze-dried form (FDP) then long-term storage as well as pathogen inactivation methods become possible. Adlyfe and Oregon Freeze-Dry have been developing technology to stabilize freeze-dried human platelets that can be subjected to gamma irradiation and stored for a long duration. Upon reconstitution, irradiated FDP retained growth factors PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-B1 in quantities similar to fresh platelets as judged by capture ELISA. The rehydrated FDP promoted new DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation of primary human dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs) similar to fresh platelets. The FDP also promoted remodeling of extracellular matrix by accelerating fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels and stimulated HUVECs to undergo angiogenesis and form capillary structures in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that FDP and fresh platelets have comparable in vitro wound healing potential. Preclinical wound healing stud'ies in diabetic mice are under way and further development will allow FDP to be a safe and well-suited alternative to fresh platelets for wound healing applications.

AB  - The inflammatory phase of wound healing performs vital acts of host defense, removing invading microorganisms and or devitalized tissue. Characterized by an infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes, within hours of injury inflammation begins to effectively clear the wound in a strictly regulated manner in preparation for the following stages of repair and regeneration. Chronic wounds are varied in their etiology, resulting from many underlying pathologies. However, collectively they are often described as being in a persistent state of inflammation. Production of proinflammatory cytokines, proteinases and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this unregulated manner can cause significant damage. By stopping the action of proinflammatory cytokines, further recruitment of neutrophils may be diminished, helping to stop protease production at its source. Chronic wound dressings that are able to help interrupt the self- perpetuating process may help to create the optimal wound healing environment. In this study we investigated the impact of silver and then an ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by lipopolysaccarhide (LPS) stimulated monocyte macrophages (THP-1 cells), an in vitro model of inflammation. The ability of the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC matrix to quench free radicals was also investigated. Results show that the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC is capable of reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This dressing also has antioxidant activity, quenching ROS. These influences on the biochemistry of a chronic wound may have an antiinflammatory action, limiting the destruction of new tissue and promoting wound closure.

AB  - Chronic wounds fail to heal in the timely, ordered continuum demonstrated by acute wounds. The hostile biochemical environment of the chronic wound is one of the well-documented differences, which is thought to be responsible for the delay in healing. Overproduction of proteases, in particular matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases, are thought to destroy essential wound healing components including growth factors, shifting the balance in favor of tissue destruction rather than deposition. Chronic wound management must, therefore, aim to restore a more normal local wound environment. In wounds with an imbalance in bioburden, the origin of destructive proteolytic enzymes may be bacterial as well as host. Therefore, treatment to achieve a biochemical balance may need to address, not only, the level of microorganism, but also, the virulent factors they produce. An ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC addresses the wound micro'environment specifically targeting excess proteases. In this study we investigated the effect of ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on serine and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as, its ability to preserve growth factors, as exem'plified by Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) from host and bacterial 'proteolytic degradation. The ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC inactivated serine and matrix metalloproteinases from chronic wound fluids, as well as the proteolytic enzymes present in bacterial supernatants. It is also capable of preserving PDGF from proteolytic degradation. When compared to other commonly used wound dressings this is a unique characteristic of ORC/collagen, demonstrating their exclusive ability to absorb noxious components of wound fluid and restore a more normal wound healing environment.

AB  - Charcoal-based odor-absorbing dressings for management of odiferous chronic wounds have been marketed for many years. However, the presence of wound serum deactivates the charcoal and inhibits the adsorption of odor molecules. Charcoal dressings also generally need adjunct fixation to hold them in place. Avery Dennison Medical has developed a new series of hydrocolloid adhesives that provides an alternative technology for the adsorption of chronic wound odors. Dressings incorporating this technology are suitable for direct wound contact. In presence of serum, superior odor absorption with these new 'materials in comparison with charcoal dressings has been demonstrated in vitro. These new dressings have significant fluid absorption potential, are self-adhesive, and require no additional fixation. Some of the factors affecting performance of these new materials in vitro will be presented, as well as preliminary results from in vivo performance on chronic wounds. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - We have developed a human fetal digit model of response to tip amputation to simulate the clinical phenomenon of digit tip regrowth or regeneration in children. We reported previously that younger estimated gestational age (EGA) digits respond to tip amputation with several layers of cells covering the phalangeal anlage, compared to older digits where such coverage comprises fewer cell layers or is absent. The proximal cut end of excised digits does not demonstrate such a response. We report here that the transcription repressor MSX1 is expressed beneath the developing nailfield in younger human fetal digits (57 to 67 days EGA), as has been shown in the mouse, and that cells expressing MSX1 are found at the digit tip by 4 days postamputation. Further, expression of keratins K14 and K19 is found, suggesting reforming of an epithelium. These findings are consistent with the mouse model of digit tip regeneration where MSX1-expressing cells are hypothesized to migrate to the amputation site and reconstitute the missing tip, and with the general observation that a wound epidermis is required for either regeneration or wound healing. 57?d EGA digits; left, MSX1 expression, control; left center, MSX1 and center, K19 expression, day 4 posttip amputation; right center, MSX1 and right, K19 expression, day 7 postamputation
