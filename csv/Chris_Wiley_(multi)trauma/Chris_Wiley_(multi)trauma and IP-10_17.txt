AB  - Summary The principal advantages of electronic radiography that have emerged in the course of early clinical experience may be summarised as follows: 1. Instantaneous availability of images for immediate and unhurried examination. 2. Greatly reduced radiation doses to patient and staff per recorded image. Reduced radiation exposure for given resolution and contrast required. Greater freedom to use x-ray examinations in pregnancy. 3. Increased spatial detail relative to standard spot-films and normal fluoroscopy. 4. Instantaneous production of arterial maps for selective catheterisation and interventional procedures. 5. Precise positioning of catheters and needles through the combination of live and stored reference images. 6. Reduced time for special procedures; reduced patient trauma; more efficient use of die radiologist's time. 7. Reduction in the total amount of contrast material needed in selective catheterisation, with reduction in the risk of contrast effects. 8. Replacement of life-sized images by smaller images, with reduction in film, display, filing and retrieval costs. Abstract New television techniques in diagnostic radiology have been developed as a result of the availability of high resolution imaging components. These electronic radiographic techniques record images with higher image quality than conventional films but with much less radiation dose to the patient and personnel. These methods are being developed for pelvimetry, intrauterine transfusion, gastrointestinal examinations, stereotaxic procedures, and selective catheterisation. Reduction in examination time, dosage of contrast media, and patient trauma can be effected, training can be facilitated, and substantial economies achieved.

AB  - Abstract Modern communities affiliated with the same culture have been shown to experience comparable levels of interpersonal violence, no matter what their size. It was hypothesized that a similar relationship would exist among ancient rural and urban people, but that accident-related trauma may be more prominent among rural dwellers due to their activity base. Through an analysis of antemortem trauma, this investigation contrasted the injury profile of Nubian adult villagers (N = 55) from the Kerma period (2500?1750 BC) to that of their urban neighbors (N = 223) at Kerma (2050?1500 BC). The injury pattern associated with interpersonal violence (cranial injury, direct-force ulna fractures, and multiple injuries) was similar between the two samples, as hypothesized. The rural group sustained significantly more nonviolence-related injuries that suggested occupational or environmental influences. The more severe cranial injuries observed among urban people are attributed to a preference for more lethal hand-wielded objects that may have accompanied increasing local tensions and incursions into Egypt during the 17th Dynasty.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents the detailed architecture of the WISECOM system, which can quickly re-establish and provide telecommunication services after a disaster by integrating terrestrial mobile radio networks, such as GSM, WiFi, WiMAX and TETRA, with satellite technologies. The system aims to be a useful tool to be deployed in the early hours after a disaster event, for both the victims and the rescue services who will be able to communicate in a reliable and robust way, improving the coordination of the different teams and reducing the time needed to provide victims with the proper treatment. The paper presents in detail the different services provided by the system taking into account its two different versions, based on two different satellite technologies, Inmarsat BGAN and DVB-RCS. Together with the presentation of the system capabilities, a business model is also proposed. Thereafter, the architecture of the general system and the demonstrators that have been developed are detailed, according to the two versions of the system. The work also presents the outcomes of the tests conducted with a prototype of the system, and of the final project demonstration, which was held in Germany in May 2008 with the involvement of real end-users (fire brigades and civil protection authorities).

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Abstract Localized tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) elevation has diverse effects in brain injury often attributed to signaling via TNFp55 or TNFp75 receptors. Both dentate granule cells and CA pyramidal cells express TNF receptors (TNFR) at low levels in a punctate pattern. Using a model to induce selective death of dentate granule cells (trimethyltin; 2?mg/kg, i.p.), neuronal apoptosis [terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ end labeling, active caspase 3 (AC3)] was accompanied by amoeboid microglia and elevated TNFα mRNA levels. TNFp55R (55?kDa type-1 TNFR) and TNFp75R (75?kDa type-2 TNFR) immunoreactivity in AC3+ neurons displayed a pattern suggestive of receptor internalization and a temporal sequence of expression of TNFp55R followed by TNFp75R associated with the progression of apoptosis. A distinct ramified microglia response occurred around CA1 neurons and healthy dentate neurons that displayed an increase in the normal punctate pattern of TNFRs. Neuronal damage was decreased with i.c.v. injection of TNFα antibody and in TNFp55R?/?p75R?/? mice that showed higher constitutive mRNA levels for interleukin (IL-1α), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), TNFα, transforming growth factor ?1, Fas, and TNFRSF6-assoicated via death domain (FADD). TNFp75R?/? mice showed exacerbated injury and elevated mRNA levels for IL-1α, MIP-1α, and TNFα. In TNFp55R?/? mice, constitutive mRNA levels for TNFα, IL-6, caspase 8, FADD, and Fas-associated phosphatase were higher; IL-1α, MIP-1α, and transforming growth factor ?1 lower. The mice displayed exacerbated neuronal death, delayed microglia response, increased FADD and TNFp75R mRNA levels, and co-expression of TNFp75R in AC3+ neurons. The data demonstrate TNFR-mediated apoptotic death of dentate granule neurons utilizing both TNFRs and suggest a TNFp75R-mediated apoptosis in the absence of normal TNFp55R activity.

AB  - Although numerous clinical attempts have been made to disintegrate mucin secreted by pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), none are clinically recommended. Through examination of the pharmacologic characteristics of two novel agents, we titrated an optimized combination of bromelain and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) that demonstrates in vitro and in vivo efficacy in the dissolution of mucinous ascites from PMP. In the in vitro experiments, 1 g of mucin was incubated in varying concentrations of bromelain (0?400 µg/ml) and NAC (0?5%) individually followed by a combination before arriving at a therapeutic combination dose of 300 µg/ml bromelain?+?4% NAC. This established an effective dose of bromelain 300 µg/ml?+?4% NAC at pH 7.0, when tested in a rat model implanted with 3 g of mucin intraperitoneally (IP). IP administration of the drug in a rat model of PMP was shown to result in mucin disintegration within 72 hr with no toxicity observed.

AB  - Gulf War illness (GWI) is a currently untreatable multi-symptom disorder experienced by 1990?1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) veterans. The characteristic hallmarks of GWI include cognitive dysfunction, tremors, migraine, and psychological disturbances such as depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have consistently linked these symptomatic profiles to the combined exposure of GW agents such as organophosphate-based and pyrethroid-based pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos (CPF) and permethrin (PER) respectively) and the prophylactic use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) as a treatment against neurotoxins. Due to the multi-symptomatic presentation of this illness and the lack of available autopsy tissue from GWI patients, very little is currently known about the distinct early pathological profile implicated in GWI (including its influence on synaptic function and aspects of neurogenesis). In this study, we used preclinical models of GW agent exposure to investigate whether 6-month-old mice exposed to CPF alone, or a combined dose of CPF, PB and PER daily for 10 days, demonstrate any notable pathological changes in hippocampal, cortical (motor, piriform) or amygdalar morphometry. We report that at an acute post-exposure time point (after 3 days), both exposures resulted in the impairment of synaptic integrity (reducing synaptophysin levels) in the CA3 hippocampal region and altered neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG), demonstrated by a significant reduction in doublecortin positive cells. Both exposures also significantly increased astrocytic GFAP immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, motor cortex and the basolateral amygdala and this was accompanied by an increase in (basal) brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. There was no evidence of microglial activation or structural deterioration of principal neurons in these regions following exposure to CPF alone or in combination with PB and PER. Evidence of subtle microvascular injury was demonstrated by the reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 levels in CPF+PB+PER exposed group compared to control. These data support early (subtle) neurotoxic effects on the brain following exposure to GW agents.

AB  - Abstract Climate change is expected to lead to greater extremes (droughts and floods) in river regimes around the world. While the number of major calamities is predicted to rise, the efforts of the public sector, experts and local stakeholders are badly coordinated. Consequently, aid does not reach target groups, resulting in unnecessary losses. Hence, there is a need for more participatory and integrative approaches. To ensure a more concerted response to climate-induced disasters, stakeholders could coordinate and negotiate within Multi-Stakeholder Platforms. Such roundtables are increasingly being established for vision-building and integrated water resource management, but could be employed in disaster management as well. After discussing the advantages and disadvantages of participation, this article trace the rise of and the problems facing two ?El Niño? platforms: one in Ica, a city on the Peruvian coast that flooded unexpectedly in January 1998, and one in Ayacucho, which saw a climate change-induced drought around the same time. The issue of internal and external legitimacy receives particular emphasis.

AB  - Improved healing occurs in nutritionally depleted rats given early postoperative compared with delayed feeding. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that delay in postoperative feeding of rats normally nourished at the time of operation would also be detrimental to wound healing. Fully nourished rats weighing 288 to 342 g were divided into three groups (10 rats per group). All rats had central vein catheters inserted, celiotomy with division and reanastomsis of the colon and dorsal skin incisions, under ip pentobarbital anesthesia. With no oral intake allowed postoperatively, groupl rats were maintained on iv 5% Dextrose electrolytes and vitamins (5% DSV); group 2 was given the 5% D/SV until the third postoperative day when they were placed on TPN (4.5% amino acids 15% Dextrose, 10% Intralipids); and group 3 was given TPN from the first postoperative day. Rats were sacrificed 6 days postoperatively and final weight, skin wound breaking strength (WBS) and colon anastomosis bursting pressure (CBP) were measured. Findings were % weight change ?27.8 ± 1.5 for Group 1, ?12.6 ± 1.0 for Group 2, and -6.9 ± 8 for group 3 (p < 0.0001). Wound measurements for STS on fresh specimens were 88.6 ± 10.0 g for group 1, 89.1 ± 8.4 g for group 2, and 87.1 ± 11.1 g for group 3. WBS for formalin-fixed specimens were 313.5 ± 29.7 g for group 1, 323.4 ± 38.4 g for group 2, and 382 ± 25.2 g for group 3 (NS). CBP was 155.7 ± 6.2 mm Hg for group 1, 169.7 ± 2.7 mm Hg for group 2, and 192.3 ± 2.5 mm Hg for group 3 (p < 0.0001 for group 3 us groups 1 and 2). It can be concluded that early postoperative TPN has a significant beneficial effect on postoperative weight loss and colonic anastomotic healing.

AB  - Systemic (family) therapy is a widely used psychotherapy approach. However, most systematic efficacy reviews have focused solely on ?family-based treatment? rather than on the theoretic orientation ?systemic therapy.? We systematically review trials on the efficacy of systemic therapy for the treatment of childhood and adolescent externalizing disorders. All randomized (or matched) controlled trials (RCT) evaluating systemic/systems-oriented therapy in various forms (family, individual, group, multi-family group therapy) with child or adolescent index patients (0?17 years) suffering from mental disorders were identified by data base searches and cross-references. Inclusion criteria were as follows: index patient diagnosed with a DSM- or ICD-listed mental disorder, and trial published in any language up to the end of 2011. The RCTs were analyzed for their research methodology, interventions applied, and results (postintervention; follow-up). A total of 47 trials from the United States, Europe, and China, published in English, German, and Mandarin, were identified. A total of 42 of them showed systemic therapy to be efficacious for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, conduct disorders, and substance use disorders. Results were stable across follow-up periods of up to 14 years. There is a sound evidence base for the efficacy of systemic therapy for children and adolescents (and their families) diagnosed with externalizing disorders.
