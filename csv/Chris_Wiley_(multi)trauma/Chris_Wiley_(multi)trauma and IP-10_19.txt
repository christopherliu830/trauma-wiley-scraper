AB  - Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neurons and astrocytes are attractive cellular tools for nervous system disease modeling and drug screening. Optimal utilization of these tools requires differentiation protocols that efficiently generate functional cell phenotypes in vitro. As nervous system function is dependent on networked neuronal activity involving both neuronal and astrocytic synaptic functions, we examined astrocyte effects on the functional maturation of neurons from human iPS cell-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). We first demonstrate human iPS cell-derived NSCs can be rapidly differentiated in culture to either neurons or astrocytes with characteristic cellular, molecular and physiological features. Although differentiated neurons were capable of firing multiple action potentials (APs), few cells developed spontaneous electrical activity in culture. We show spontaneous electrical activity was significantly increased by neuronal differentiation of human NSCs on feeder layers of neonatal mouse cortical astrocytes. In contrast, co-culture on feeder layers of isogenic human iPS cell-derived astrocytes had no positive effect on spontaneous neuronal activity. Spontaneous electrical activity was dependent on glutamate receptor-channel function and occurred without changes in INa, IK, Vm, and AP properties of iPS cell-derived neurons. These data demonstrate co-culture with neonatal mouse cortical astrocytes but not human isogenic iPS cell-derived astrocytes stimulates glutamatergic synaptic transmission between iPS cell-derived neurons in culture. We present RNA-sequencing data for an immature, fetal-like status of our human iPS cell-derived astrocytes as one possible explanation for their failure to enhance synaptic activity in our co-culture system.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with metabolic alterations in various disease states, including major trauma (e.g., burn injury). Metabolic derangements, including muscle insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia, are a clinically significant complication of major trauma. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor for mitochondrial electron transport, and its reduced form acts as a lipophilic antioxidant. Here, we report that burn injury induces impaired muscle insulin signaling, hyperlactatemia, mitochondrial dysfunction (as indicated by suppressed mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates), morphological alterations of the mitochondria (e. g., enlargement, and loss of cristae structure), mitochondrial oxidative stress, and disruption of mitochondrial integrity (as reflected by increased mitochondrial DNA levels in the cytosol and circulation). All of these alterations were significantly alleviated by CoQ10 treatment compared with vehicle alone. These findings indicate that CoQ10 treatment is efficacious in protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of burned mice. Our data highlight CoQ10 as a potential new strategy to prevent mitochondrial damage and metabolic dysfunction in burn patients.

AB  - Abstract Yamanaka and colleagues revolutionized stem cell biology and regenerative medicine by observing that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells. Evidence indicates that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells retain epigenetic memories that bias their spontaneous differentiation into the originating somatic cell type, therefore epigenetic memory may be exploited to improve tissue specific regeneration. We recently showed that iPS cells reprogrammed from ovarian granulosa cells using mouse and human tissue overwhelmingly differentiate homotypically into ovarian steroidogenic and primordial germ cells. Herein we detail a protocol for the culture of human ovarian granulosa cells. We review approaches for reprogramming human ovarian granulosa cells into iPS cells. Standard methods to induce pluripotency are outlined, concentrating on integrative retroviruses. Additionally, alternative protocols for lentivirus and Sendai virus are provided. Each approach has inherent limitations, such as reprogramming efficiency, insertional mutagenesis, and partial reprogramming. Major advances continue to be made in somatic cell reprogramming to identify an optimal approach and utilization in cell-based therapies. ? 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Abstract In 2000, the UK?s College of Optometrists commissioned a report to critically evaluate the theory and practice of behavioural optometry. The report which followed Jennings (2000; Behavioural optometry ? a critical review. Optom. Pract. 1: 67) concluded that there was a lack of controlled clinical trials to support behavioural management strategies. The purpose of this report was to evaluate the evidence in support of behavioural approaches as it stands in 2008. The available evidence was reviewed under 10 headings, selected because they represent patient groups/conditions that behavioural optometrists are treating, or because they represent approaches to treatment that have been advocated in the behavioural literature. The headings selected were: (1) vision therapy for accommodation/vergence disorders; (2) the underachieving child; (3) prisms for near binocular disorders and for producing postural change; (4) near point stress and low-plus prescriptions; (5) use of low-plus lenses at near to slow the progression of myopia; (6) therapy to reduce myopia; (7) behavioural approaches to the treatment of strabismus and amblyopia; (8) training central and peripheral awareness and syntonics; (9) sports vision therapy; (10) neurological disorders and neuro-rehabilitation after trauma/stroke. There is a continued paucity of controlled trials in the literature to support behavioural optometry approaches. Although there are areas where the available evidence is consistent with claims made by behavioural optometrists (most notably in relation to the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease/injury), a large majority of behavioural management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated.

AB  - ABSTRACT A mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal content injection (CCI) was developed with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the mechanism of sepsis. This model has a similar survival pattern to the conventional model with the added benefits of ability to vary the severity of sepsis and greater consistency. Administration of 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT) to inhibit indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in mice with CCI-induced sepsis increased the survival rate and tended to up-regulate IL-10/IL-12 serum concentrations. The effectiveness of 1-MT was confirmed by increases in IL-10 over IL-12 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) treated with LPS and 1-MT and a superior survival rate 24 hr after injection of these double treated BMDCs in the CCI-induced sepsis model. Therefore, CCI is both a useful and reliable technique for investigating polymicrobial sepsis. The present findings using this newly developed model suggest that inhibition of IDO alleviates the severity of polymicrobial sepsis and modulates the immune response even in cases of severe systemic septic inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Glucan phosphate is a water-soluble, yeast-derived, (1 ? 3)-?-D-glucopyranose polymer that has been demonstrated to be a potent immune stimulant. Glucan phosphate administration is associated with stimulation of immunity and a concomitant increase in resistance to a variety of experimentally induced disease states. Preclinical safety evaluation indicates that glucan phosphate does not induce mortality or significant toxicity over a wide dose range. Phase I clinical data indicate that glucan phosphate will ameliorate immunosuppression, stimulate immunity, decrease susceptibility to infection and alter ultimate outcome in trauma patients following laparotomy or thoracotomy. This work reviews the development, characterization, preclinal and clinical evaluation of glucan phosphate.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Keloids are disfiguring, proliferative scars that are a pathologic response to cutaneous injury. An organotypic tissue culture system (the Raft model 1?10) was used to investigate the feasibility of using photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an adjunctive therapy to treat keloids following surgical excision. The Raft co-culture system mimics skin by layering keratinocytes on top of fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. PDT uses drugs that produce singlet oxygen in situ when irradiated by light, and may lead to a number of effects in living tissues varying from the modulation of growth to apoptosis. PDT is already used to treat several benign and malignant diseases in organs such as the skin, retina, and esophagus. Study Design/Materials and Methods Normal adult, neonatal, and keloid fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated from skin obtained from patients undergoing elective procedures and used to construct the Rafts. Mature Rafts (after 4 days) were incubated with 5-amino levulinic acid (5-ALA), a photosensitizer, for 3 hours and were laser-irradiated (635 nm) for total energy delivery of 5 J/cm2, 10 J/cm2, or 20 J/cm2. Rafts were examined 24 hours and 14 days later. Cell viability was determined using confocal imaging combined with live-dead fluorescent dyes. Multi-photon microscope (MPM) imaged collagen structure and density. As Rafts contract over time, surface area was measured using optical micrometry daily. Results At 10 and 20 J/cm2, near-total cell death was observed in all constructs, while at 5 J/cm2 cell viability was comparable to controls. Cell viability in keloid and neonatal Rafts was greater than that observed in normal adult Rafts. Treated Rafts contracted less over the 14-day period compared to controls. Contraction and collagen density were greatest in keloid and neonatal Rafts. Conclusions A PDT dosimetry range was established, which reduces tissue contraction and collagen density while minimizing injury to fibroblasts. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary There is a clear hierarchy of key account relationships increasing in complexity and intimacy with the customer. Understanding where you are is crucial to adopting the right behaviour towards the customer. This chapter helps in understanding the nature of key relationships and the behaviour of companies involved in the profitable management of the business they represent. Five stages of key supplier/customer relationships have identified: To characterize the nature of the relationship from the point of view of either party, they are described as exploratory (precedes actual trading), basic, cooperative, interdependent and integrated. Relationships may develop progressively through each stage in turn, or they may not. They can also start at a mature stage in certain circumstances where multi-sourcing is inappropriate or they can remain at any given level indefinitely. The key features of the five types of relationship are summarized in this chapter. Both the key account manager and the supplier organization need to know what kind of relationship they have with each customer, and therefore what they can and cannot do with it.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.
