AB  - Abstract Cystic fibrosis patients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trauma, burn wound, or patients requiring ventilation are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physiological innate defense mechanisms against this pathogen, and their alterations in lung diseases, are for the most part unknown. We now demonstrate a role for the sphingoid long chain base, sphingosine, in determining susceptibility to lung infection by P. aeruginosa. Tracheal and bronchial sphingosine levels were significantly reduced in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients and from cystic fibrosis mouse models due to reduced activity of acid ceramidase, which generates sphingosine from ceramide. Inhalation of mice with sphingosine, with a sphingosine analog, FTY720, or with acid ceramidase rescued susceptible mice from infection. Our data suggest that luminal sphingosine in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells prevents pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in normal individuals, paving the way for novel therapeutic paradigms based on inhalation of acid ceramidase or of sphingoid long chain bases in lung infection.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the accuracy of an oscillometric blood pressure monitor in anesthetized sheep. Study design Prospective study. Animals Twenty healthy adult sheep, 11 males and nine females, weighing 63.6 ± 8.6 kg. Methods After premedication with buprenorphine or transdermal fentanyl, anesthesia was induced with ketamine-midazolam and maintained with isoflurane and ketamine, 1.2 mg kg?1 hour?1, ± lidocaine, 3 mg kg?1 hour?1. Invasive blood pressure measurements were obtained from an auricular arterial catheter and noninvasive measurements were from a cuff on the metatarsus or antebrachium. Simultaneous invasive and noninvasive measurements were recorded over a range (55?111 mmHg) of mean arterial pressures (MAP). Isoflurane concentration was increased to decrease MAP and decreasing the isoflurane concentration and infusing dobutamine achieved higher pressures. Invasive and noninvasive measurements were compared. Results Correlation (R2) was good between the two methods of measurement (average of three consecutive readings) for systolic (SAP) (0.87), diastolic (DAP) (0.86), and mean (0.90) arterial pressures (p < 0.001). Bias ± SD between noninvasive and invasive measurements for SAP was 3 ± 8 mmHg, for DAP was ?10 ± 7 mmHg, and MAP was ?7 ± 6 mmHg. There was no significant difference between the average of three measurements and use of the first measurement. Correlations using the first measurement were SAP (0.82), DAP (0.84), and MAP (0.89). Bias ± SD for SAP was 3 ±10 mmHg, for DAP was ?11 ± 7 mmHg, and MAP was ?7 ± 6 mmHg. The oscillometric monitor slightly overestimated SAP and underestimated DAP and MAP for both average values and the first reading. Conclusions and clinical relevance This oscillometric model provided MAP measurements that were acceptable by ACVIM standards. MAP measurements with this monitor were lower than those found with the invasive technique so a clinical diagnosis of hypotension may be made in sheep that are not hypotensive.

AB  - Summary Purpose:? We created a database that could be accessed via the Internet by any neurologist or pediatric neurologist in New Zealand. The database was designed to facilitate recruitment of patients for investigator-driven drug trials. Methods:? We established an epilepsy database, and invited neurologists and pediatric neurologists throughout New Zealand to register patients via the Internet when they were uncertain of the optimal management. Details regarding seizure type and frequency, epilepsy syndrome, etiology, drug history, and investigations were collected. We produced an algorithm to select patients who had failed to respond to a single antiepileptic drug (AED). These patients were randomized immediately via the Internet to receive a different drug. Participants were not reimbursed. Results:? The pilot study recruited patients from mid-June to December 2007. Sixteen neurologists participated; neurologists were based in eight different cities. One hundred thirty-seven patients were registered, of whom 113 were considered suitable for drug trials. Thirty-five patients who had used a single antiepileptic drug AED were enrolled, and 14 of these were successfully randomized online to a different drug. Follow-up information was entered via the Internet for all 108 patients who were seen again during the following year. Discussion:? We have demonstrated that patients can be recruited for trials and randomized from routine clinics via the Internet. Trials could compare AEDs or look at other aspects of epilepsy management. An international pilot study is planned. Neurologists are invited to enroll patients with epilepsy, who would be suitable for randomized controlled trials, into a Web-based register.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Although individual immunosuppression regimens vary, most patients are maintained on multi-drug regimens. As anticipated, metabolic, infectious, oncologic, and psychosocial complications have been reported in VCA recipients. The relatively few number of cases performed to date and the absence of uniformity in the reporting of results hinder the establishment of the long-term outcomes of VCAs. This chapter aims to review the reported outcomes and highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities available in this emerging field of transplantation.

AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.

AB  - ABSTRACT Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) is a powerful tool for imaging the effects of drugs on brain activity. In preclinical phMRI studies, general anesthesia used for minimizing head movements is thought to influence the phMRI responses to drugs. In this study we investigated the phMRI responses to a selective dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor, GBR12909, and a dopamine (DA) releaser, d-amphetamine (AMPH), in the isoflurane anesthetized and awake rats using a relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) method. AMPH (1 mg/kg i.p.) caused an increase in rCBV in the dopaminergic circuitry in the both anesthetized and awake rats. The striatal rCBV change was correlated with the change of the striatal DA concentration induced by AMPH in the both anesthetized and awake rats. GBR12909 (10 mg/kg i.p.) caused a positive rCBV response and showed a similar regional pattern of rCBV response to AMPH in the awake rats, and the correlation between the change of the striatal rCBV and the striatal DA concentration was observed. However, in the anesthetized rats, GBR12909 induced a widespread negative rCBV response, whereas an increase in striatal DA concentration was observed. These findings indicate that phMRI responses to activation of DA neurotransmission by GBR12909 or AMPH are overall identical in the awake state, while the phMRI response to a DAT inhibitor, GBR12909 but not to AMPH was changed by isoflurane anesthesia. For the evaluation of neuroactive drugs using phMRI, isoflurane anesthesia might be complicated the interpretation of pharmacodynamic effects of drugs in preclinical studies.

AB  - Abstract Deoxynivalenol (DON, also known as vomitoxin) is a common mycotoxin found worldwide, especially in contaminated food. DON is toxic to a variety of cells and tissues in humans. Three kinds of conjugated products (DON-3-glucuronide, DON-15-glucuronide and DON-7-glucuronide) can be found as major metabolites in human urine. Females and males show different patterns of exposure levels, and human exposure to DON also shows some geographical differences because of different DON levels in cereal-based foods, food intake habits and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression. Specifically, the C12, 13-deepoxy metabolite was found predominantly in French adults but was rarely detected in UK adults. However, a cohort of Spanish individuals demonstrated even lower DON levels than the levels in the UK populations, whereas a very high DON exposure level was detected in South Africa and Linxian, China. Recent publications have further indicated that DON could be detected in the urine of pregnant women from different countries, which suggests that there is a potential risk to both mothers and foetuses. Additionally, phytochemicals have been shown to be less toxic to cells and laboratory animals in research studies and may also be used as food additives for reducing the toxic effects of DON. In this review, we provide global information on DON metabolism, human exposure and gender differences in humans. Also, control strategies for this mycotoxin are discussed.

AB  - A five-month-old female Jack Russell terrier was presented for investigation of acute lethargy, anorexia, coughing, respiratory distress and weakness. Examination findings included cyanosis, a grade 3 of 6 systolic heart murmur and prolonged capillary refill time. Radiography and echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure. Indirect measurement of the systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated pressures over 100 mmHg. Despite treatment the patient died. Post-mortem examination did not identify a congenital cardiovascular anomaly. Histopathology confirmed acute necrotising pulmonary arteritis and immunohistochemistry failed to identify any immune complex or complement deposition.

AB  - Introduction and Aim:? Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a crucial process in physiological and pathological growth. Pathological angiogenesis is responsible for growth and metastasis of solid tumours, and, when blocked, improves prognosis. As a result of the angiogenic cascade in solid tumours an irregular, leaky capillary network develops. The aim of the present study was to define malignant tumours? vascular characteristics and reveal functional anatomy by quantification of the microvasculature and interstitial pressure (IP) in relation to tumour fluid dynamics as visualized by contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods:? Dynamic MRI and measurement of the IP was performed in 21 rats implanted with colon carcinomas subcutaneously. Angiogenesis was studied by morphometry of the capillaries, and immunolocalization of the angiogenic factor VEGF and VEGF-Receptor 2. Results and Conclusions:? Histology, immunohistochemistry and MRI confirmed concentric arrangement of 4 tumour zones. The tumour margin included loose connective tissue with abundant mononuclear cells. Many large microvessels were seen in this most intensely vascularized zone. IP measurement in this zone was adjusted to the zero level. Diameter of the peripheral zone of vital cells measured 1.3?mm. Capillaries were smaller and sparse. Dynamic MRI revealed peripheral washout of the contrast agent in this zone. After an initial increase of the signal intensity a hypo-intense rim was formed within a few minutes. The intermediate region was characterized by islands of vital tumour cells containing 3% capillaries (hot spots). The innermost area, the necrotic zone, took 35% of the total tumour area with less than 0.5% vessels. The IP increased from the periphery to the centre. VEGF and VEGF-receptor 2 was found in the vessels of the tumour margin and vital tumour cells of the peripheral zone. From this can be concluded that the peripheral washout phenomenon seems to be correlated with elevated interstitial pressure and increased capillary density and therefore may be a reliable sign of malignancy.
