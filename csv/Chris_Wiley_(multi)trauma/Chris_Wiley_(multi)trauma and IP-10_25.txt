AB  - Abstract Aim. Sphincter motor units (MUs) are continuously firing during relaxation. The quantification of this activity is a potentially useful electromyographic (EMG) parameter related to the number of MUs innervating the muscle and the level of motor neuron excitation. The aim of the present study was to develop a reliable, quantitative measure of continuous sphincter muscle activity during relaxation. Methods. EMG activity was analyzed during relaxation, 1 minute after insertion of the concentric needle electrode into four sites in the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle. In 10 control subjects, 8 interference pattern samples were obtained by ?turn/amplitude? analysis. In 35 control subjects, a multi-MUP count of continuously firing motor unit potentials (MUPs) was used, quadruplets with scores of 0?6 obtained, and the lower reference limits (95th percentile) calculated. This approach was then evaluated in 57 patients (182 muscles) with cauda equina or conus medullaris lesion (CECML) and 7 patients (13 muscles) with ?idiopathic fecal incontinence.? Results. The lower reference (?outlier?) limits for MUP count were 0 0 6 6 and 0 1 2 2 for the subcutaneous, and 0 0 0 6 and 0 0 1 1 for the deeper EAS muscles. Both patient groups had a significantly diminished number of continuously firing MUPs, which was below the reference range in 43% of the EAS muscles from CECM patients and in 85% of muscles from patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence. In patients with CECML, the decrease in MUP count correlated with the severity of the lesion, as defined by the sensory deficit. Conclusions. MUP count in sphincter muscles during relaxation is technically feasible, and it is a promising tool, particularly in patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence. Neurourol.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterium cultured from infected wounds. We hypothesized that diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or peripheral arterial disease would be patient predictors of severe outcomes, defined as amputation, sepsis, or death, and infections caused by resistant strains would be bacterial predictors of severe outcomes. Methods: With IRB approval, 50 S. aureus strains (45 wound, 5 central line) were isolated during routine clinical care. Investigations included antibiotic resistance (>5?mcg/ml), and PCR for STAR elements. Chart review included wound type, location, relevant comorbidities, antibiotic resistance, and outcome. Results: Outcome n(%of outcome total) Severe All others Total Diabetic 7 (70) 6 (17) 13 (29) Non-diabetic 3 (30) 29 (83) 32 (71) MRSA STAR groups 2 (20) 8 (23) 10 (22) All other STAR 8 (80) 27 (77) 35 (78) MRSA 4 (40) 8 (23) 12 (27) MSSA 6 (60) 27 (77) 33 (73) Total patients 10 (22) 35 (78) 45 No non-DM patient with arterial disease (n?=?6) had a poor outcome. Conclusions: The strongest predictor of outcome was the presence of DM. Patients with severe outcomes were slightly more likely to have MRSA infection, although only 33% of patients with MRSA had severe outcomes. Although STAR/arsRBC groups have been shown previously to predict antibiotic resistance, in this collection there was no correlation between these molecular markers and outcome. This study shows that the strongest predictor of clinical outcome in wound infection is patient-dependent, while bacterial factors appear to play a lesser role.

During hair transplantation sessions, we observed a significant reduction of the donor ellipse width while performing hemostasis with the infrared coagulator. objective. Quantitative assessment of the donor wound width after infrared coagulator use, and correlation to the number of previous transplant sessions and patients' age. methods. Twenty-four patients (22 men, two women) underwent hair transplantation. The infrared coagulator was utilized for hemostasis with a pulse duration of 2.5 seconds. results. The infrared coagulator produced an average donor area decrease of 42%, while achieving rapid hemostasis. No correlation was demonstrated to number of previous transplant sessions or patients' age. conclusions. The infrared coagulator significantly decreases the donor wound width while providing hemostasis. Advantages include the potential of larger donor strip harvest, minimal tissue manipulation, and less traumatic closure.

AB  - Abstract These studies demonstrate that murine hippocampal slice cultures possess neural-immune elements that show responses parallel to comparable in vivo models of neural-immune activation. Using immunocytochemical techniques, this study characterized the phenotypes of specific glial elements and the expression of the cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1?), in the hippocampal dentate gyrus over a period of 10 days in vitro (DIV). Preparation of organotypic slice cultures of neonatal mouse hippocampus produced cellular damage including axotomy of afferent fibers within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This form of lesion-induced injury caused activation of neural-immune elements in the slice cultures. Staining with the microglial specific, biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia B4-isolectin revealed reactive microglia were most prevalent at 2 DIV and decreased in number from 4 to 10 DIV, whereas the initial population of resting microglia at 2 DIV increased approximately four-fold from 4 to 10 DIV. The presence of a round IL-1?-like immunophenotype closely paralleled the temporal and spatial distribution of the reactive form of microglia observed in the dentate gyrus. In addition, between 4 and 10 DIV, some IL-1?-like immunoreactive cells exhibited a stellate-like morphology with numerous branching processes, similar to resting microglia. At 2 DIV, astrocytes showed minimal labeling with antibodies directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), while from 4 to 10 DIV, a dramatic hypertrophic astrocytic response occurred, resulting in a gliotic scar forming over the entire dentate gyrus. We conclude that neural-immune activation in the hippocampal organotypic slice culture preparation closely parallels similar responses observed in vivo and thus slice cultures represent an excellent model for further studies of neural-immune interactions resulting from lesion-induced injury in the central nervous system.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - A number of strategies have been explored for the treatment of cutaneous defects such as protein growth factor or gene therapy approaches. Alternative approaches include dermal or dermal-epidermal skin substitutes or clot substitutes such as fibrin sealants (FS?s). Here we test the fibrinogen-thrombin formulation of fibrin sealant combined with fibroblasts and PDGF in wound healing models. Four formulations varying in fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were applied to full-thickness biopsy wounds in the rabbit ear cutaneous wound-healing model with or without cultured rabbit dermal fibroblasts (RDFs; 3???105 cells/wound) embedded in the fibrinogen component. At post-wounding day 7, there was no difference in the diluted vs. non-diluted formulations for either the promotion of granulation tissue coverage of the open wounds or total granulation tissue area when tested without embedded cells. Including the RDFs, the highest degree of wound coverage by granulation tissue was observed in the combined dilution formulation (17.3?mg/ml fibrinogen, 167?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10) that was 167%(p?<?0.05) of the non-diluted FS containing cells (50?mg/ml fibrinogen, 250?U/ml thrombin; n?=?10). Inclusion of fibroblasts increased granulation tissue area within the wounds vs. FS alone (p?<?0.05) for each diluted formulation although no differences in this parameter was observed within each group (FS alone or with embedded cells). However, addition of the vulnerary growth factor PDGF-B (3??g; n?=?4) with the embedded RDFs in the combined dilution formulation increased granulation tissue area over 2-fold (p?<?0.01). Additionally, the presence of the RDFs promoted incorporation of the granulation tissue with and epithelial migration over the FS suggesting an active interaction between cells delivered to the wound by FS and the host repair cells. The findings suggest the progress of cutaneous defect repair can be enhanced by ex vivo cell delivery in Fibrin Sealant that is adjusted to balance hemostasis with promotion of wound healing processes.

AB  - Abstract: Background: The mitochondrion acts as a pivotal decision center in many types of apoptotic responses. To clarify the effects of the enhanced mitochondrial function on tumor necrosis factorα (TNFα)-induced apoptosis, we studied hepatic injuries in transgenic mice whose livers express creatine kinase (CK). Methods: Mice fed a diet containing 10% creatine, came to accumulate phosphocreatine and to enhance hepatic ATP levels and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activities. TNFα-mediated hepatic apoptosis in normally fed and Cr-feeding CK transgenic mice were assessed. Results: TNFα and actinomycin D cause severe liver failure in normally fed transgenic mice, and in the wild-type mice. In contrast, no significant elevations in transaminase levels after injection were observed in Cr feeding transgenic mice. The disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential at 2?h after TNFα injection, prior to ATP depletion, activation of caspase 3 like protease, and DNA fragmentation at 4?6?h after injection, were observed in normally fed transgenic mice. These were fully suppressed in Cr feeding transgenic mice. However, anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis was not inhibited in both groups. Conclusions: The results indicate that TNFα-induced apoptosis was inhibited in CK transgenic mice livers by maintaining mitochondrial function.

AB  - The clinical challenge in acute injury as in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is to halt the delayed neuronal loss that occurs hours and days after the insult. Here we report that the activation of CREB-dependent transcription in reactive astrocytes prevents secondary injury in cerebral cortex after experimental TBI. The study was performed in a novel bitransgenic mouse in which a constitutively active CREB, VP16-CREB, was targeted to astrocytes with the Tet-Off system. Using histochemistry, qPCR, and gene profiling we found less neuronal death and damage, reduced macrophage infiltration, preserved mitochondria, and rescued expression of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism in bitransgenic mice as compared to wild type littermates. Finally, with meta-analyses using publicly available databases we identified a core set of VP16-CREB candidate target genes that may account for the neuroprotective effect. Enhancing CREB activity in astrocytes thus emerges as a novel avenue in acute brain post-injury therapeutics. GLIA 2016;64:853?874

AB  - Significant progress has been made in the development of in vitro-engineered skin substitutes that mimic human skin, either to be used for the replacement of lost skin or for the establishment of in vitro skin research models. However, at the present time, there are no models of bioengineered skin that completely replicate the nature of uninjured skin. Obviously, there is still much room for improvement of the components of bioengineered skin and their interplay. This review summarises the important new discoveries in key elements of engineering of tissue-engineered skin including cell sources, biomaterials and growth factors, etc. Furthermore, basic and clinical applications for engineered skin substitutes in cell therapy, tissue engineering, and biomedical research continue to drive design improvements premised on these structure and function-based engineering paradigms.

AB  - Purpose To quantify spatial and temporal inflammation-induced changes in vascular permeability and macrophage infiltration in guinea-pig (GP) cochlea using MRI. Materials and Methods GPs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cochlear inflammation. One group was injected with a gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI was performed at 4, 7, and 10 days after LPS treatment. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to determine the apparent rate constant of GBCA extravasation (Ktrans). A second group was injected with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) and studied at 2, 3, and 7 days after LPS treatment to detect tissue USPIO uptake and correlate with histology. For both groups, control GPs were scanned similarly. Results The signal enhancement increased substantially and more rapidly at day 4 in LPS-treated than in control cochlea shortly following GBCA injection. Ktrans of LPS-treated cochlea was maximum on day 4 at 0.0218?±?0.0032 min?1 and then decreased to control level at 0.0036?±?0.0004 min?1 by day 10. In the second group, the relative signal intensity and T2 in cochlear perilymphatic spaces on day 2 decreased, on average, by 54% and 45%, respectively, compared with baseline and then remained under control levels by day 7. This suggests the infiltration of inflammatory cells, although unconfirmed by histology. Conclusion This provides the first measurement of cochlear vascular permeability using MRI and a quantitative evaluation of the development of cochlear inflammation. MRI holds considerable potential for the assessment of disease processes such as clinical diagnosis of conditions such as labyrinthitis. J. Magn. Reson.
