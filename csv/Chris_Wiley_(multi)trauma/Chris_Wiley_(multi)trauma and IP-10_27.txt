AB  - Abstract Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major microbial mediator for tissue injury and sepsis resulting from Gram-negative bacterial infection. LPS is an external factor that induces robust expression of serum amyloid A (SAA), a major constituent of the acute-phase proteins, but the relationship between SAA expression and LPS-induced tissue injury remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with inducible transgenic expression of human SAA1 are partially protected against inflammatory response and lung injury caused by LPS and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In comparison, transgenic SAA1 does not attenuate TNFα-induced lung inflammation and injury. The SAA1 expression level correlates inversely with the endotoxin concentrations in serum and lung tissues since SAA1 binds directly to LPS to form a complex that promotes LPS uptake by macrophages. Disruption of the SAA1-LPS interaction with a SAA1-derived peptide partially reduces the protective effect and exacerbates inflammation. These findings demonstrate that acute-phase SAA provides innate feedback protection against LPS-induced inflammation and tissue injury.

AB  - Summary Colibacillosis refers to any localized or systemic infection caused entirely or partly by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), including colisepticemia, hemorrhagic septicemia, coligranuloma (Hjarre's disease), air sac disease (chronic respiratory disease, CRD), swollen-head syndrome, venereal colibacillosis, coliform cellulitis (inflammatory or infectious process, IP), peritonitis, salpingitis, orchitis, osteomyelitis/ synovitis (including turkey osteomyelitis complex), panophthalmitis, omphalitis/yolk sac infection, and enteritis. Often colibacillosis is among the most frequently reported diseases in surveys of poultry health or condemnations at processing. The etiology of colibacillosis is APEC. Other infectious agents and noninfectious factors usually predispose a bird to infection or contribute to the severity of the disease. Two additional Escherichia species, E. fergusonii and E. albertii, have been isolated from birds and are capable of causing disease or are of public health significance. Escherichia coli possess no unique resistance capabilities and have a susceptibility pattern to chemical and physical agents typical of vegetative, Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Abstract Failure to downregulate inflammatory responses is often used to explain why chronic wounds fail to heal. The beneficial effects of surgical debridement are thought to be in part due to the transformation of a chronic wound to an acute wound, thereby allowing the inflammatory phase of acute wound healing to be reactivated. We tested the hypothesis that subcutaneous injection of the inducible isoform of the 70?kDa mammalian heat shock protein (iHSP70) will cause acute inflammatory swelling in an in vivo murine model. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Student?s t-test and significance was accepted when p?<?0.05. Subcutaneous injection of stress proteins iHSP70 was associated with significantly increased acute swelling in comparison to injections of saline, autologous serum (AS) or denatured iHSP70, *p?<?0.05, see figure below. Histological analysis demonstrated increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in those tissues receiving iHSP70. Stress proteins, within the acute wound environment, are proinflammatory and may set the stage for persistent inflammation within the chronic wound bed. Stress proteins may be future targets for therapeutic manipulation wherever acute inflammation fails to be downregulated. Exp.

AB  - Introduction: We hypothesize that interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6r) blockade with IL-6r antibody will increase matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) production in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts. To test this hypothesis, MMP-3 protein levels were measured in fibroblasts cultured from normal skin and hypertrophic scar with and without IL-6 receptor blockade. Methods: Primary cell cultures of normal skin (NSF) and hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HTS) were obtained from the same patient (n?=?5) and seeded into 6 well plates (40,000?cells/cm2) in complete media. Cells were treated with and without IL-6 receptor antibody and IgG (10?ng/ml) for 6 hours. Protein concentrations of MMP-3 are determined in equal volume of supernatants by ELISA. Statistical analysis was by unpaired t-test(*P?<?0.05). Results: Blocking IL-6 receptors with its antibody showed significant increase in MMP-3 protein concentration in HTS compared to NSF. MMP-3(ng/ml) MMP-3(ng/ml) NSF 1.6?±?0.13 HTS 0.7?±?0.37 NSF?+?IL-6r 0.3?±?0.15 HTS?+?IL-6r 2.3?±?0.5* NSF?+?IgG 0.26?±?0.16 HTS?+?IgG 0.75?±?0.14 Conclusion: IL-6 receptor mediated signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar formation and its blockade may reduce hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Abstract Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a brief motivational intervention to increase the breastfeeding duration in the first 6 months postpartum in mothers who began breastfeeding in the first hour after birth and to explore the role of general and breastfeeding self-efficacy in this relationship. Design A multi-centre randomized controlled clinical trial. Methods Data were collected from February 2018 - March 2019. Women were randomly assigned to an intervention group that received a brief motivational intervention (N = 44) or a control group that was offered standard education on breastfeeding (N = 44). Survival analysis techniques were carried out with a follow-up of 6 months. In addition, the roles of breastfeeding and general self-efficacy in the association between BMI and breastfeeding duration were explored through mediation/moderation analysis. Results Among 88 randomized patients (mean age, 32.82 years), 81 (92.04%) completed the trial. The survival analyses of exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding (exclusive and non-exclusive) showed reductions in the risk of abandonment in the intervention group of 63% (aHR: 0.37 [0.22?0.60] p < .001) and 61% (aHR: 0.39 [0.20?0.78] p = .008), respectively. We found that self-efficacy acted as a moderator of the effect of brief motivational intervention on breastfeeding self-efficacy. A discrete indirect effect of brief motivational intervention through increased breastfeeding self-efficacy was found on breastfeeding duration, with an index of moderated mediation of 0.08 (95% CI: 0.02?0.19). Greater positive variations in the breastfeeding self-efficacy scores during follow-up predicted exclusive and non-exclusive breastfeeding duration. Conclusion A brief motivational intervention conducted in the immediate postpartum period increases breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding duration in the first 6 months. Although breastfeeding self-efficacy seems to moderate the effect of brief motivational intervention on the increase in breastfeeding duration, other factors may influence its effectiveness. Further studies could focus on exploring how brief motivational intervention works and whether it also works for pregnant mothers who have not yet decided whether to breastfeed. Impact Brief motivational intervention could be introduced as part of routine care of women who begin breastfeeding to improve the low rates of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum.

AB  - Macrophages serve as the coordinators of the wound healing process. Since 1998 following the Israeli Ministry of health authorization, macrophage suspensions have been used for the treatment of ulcers, in more than 800 elderly and paraplegic patients suffering from decubital chronic ulcers. As previously published, a significant number of genes showed increased levels of expression in hypo-osmotic shock activated cells, using DNA microarrays technique. The majority of these genes are considered to be directly involved in the macrophage function and in the wound healing process. Macrophge suspensions are prepared from a whole blood unit of healthy, young volunteer blood donors in a closed, sterile system, as previously described. The activated cells are applied to the wounds either by local injection or by direct deposition to the wound. Between January 2000 and October 2003, 112 patients with postoperative sternal wound infection were treated with macrophage suspension. Full closure of the wounds was achieved in 104 (93%) of the patients. Original wound surface area 8?175?cm2 (mean 93) Days until treatment 6?180 (mean 47) Days until 50% closure 6?60 (mean 21) Days until full closure 10?138 (mean 49) No side effects were noted. The use of macrophage suspension is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that reduces risk of complications and morbidity and improves the quality of life for long -suffering patients. Length and cost of hospital stay may be reduced, as the treatment requires no hospitalization.
