AB  - Abstract Previous studies have shown that Schwann cell implantation offers a potential therapeutic approach to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries. In a clinically relevant paradigm, however, the implantation of autologous Schwann cells is problematic and the use of heterogenetic Schwann cells will be required. In the present study we addressed this important issue and analysed the immunogenicity and survival of allogeneic and xenogeneic Schwann cell suspension grafts in a prelesioned CNS fiber tract, the transected postcommissural fornix of the adult Wistar rat. Cultured Schwann cells from Wistar rat or human peripheral nerve were injected either immediately or after a delay into the transection site and the spatio-temporal pattern of leukocyte infiltration and of major histocompatibility antigen expression was characterized and semiquantified with immunocytochemical methods. Our main findings are that (1) invasive cerebral lesions induce the expression of MHC class I and II antigens, but only sparse infiltration of T-lymphocytes, (2) both allogeneic and xenogeneic discordant Schwann cell suspension grafts, from either neonatal or adult peripheral nerve, survive without any overt signs of rejection for up to 10 weeks after implantation; and (3) delayed implantation procedures have no effect on immune responses to allogeneic Schwann cell grafts. These results demonstrate that there is no marked ongoing immune reactions to heterogenetic Schwann cell suspension grafts and that long-term survival of cross-species Schwann cell grafts can be achieved in the absence of any immunsuppressive treatment. Thus the conditions for functional transplantation of Schwann cells across immunological barriers seem to be favourable and will have implications for future cross-species studies, and possibly also for clinical application.

AB  - Given the growing popularity of the open innovation model, it is increasingly common to source knowledge for new product ideas from a wide range of actors located outside of organizational boundaries. Such open search strategies, however, might not always be superior to their closed counterparts. Indeed, widening the scope of knowledge sourcing at the ideation stage typically comes at a price given the substantial monetary and nonmonetary costs often incurred in the process of identifying, assimilating, and utilizing external knowledge inputs. Considering both the benefits and costs of search openness, the authors develop a project-level contingency model of open innovation. This model suggests that search openness is curvilinearly (taking an inverted U-shape) related to new product creativity and success. They hence assume that too little as well as too much search openness at the ideation stage will be detrimental to new product outcomes. Moreover, they argue that the effectiveness of open search strategies is contingent upon the new product development (NPD) project type (typological contingency), the NPD project leader (managerial contingency), and the NPD project environment (contextual contingency). To test these propositions empirically, multi-informant data from 62 NPD projects initiated in the English National Health Service (NHS) were collected. The econometric analyses conducted provide considerable support for a curvilinear relationship between search openness and NPD outcomes as well as for the hypothesized contingency effects. More specifically, they reveal that explorative NPD projects have more to gain from search openness at the ideation stage than their exploitative counterparts. Moreover, the project-level payoff from search openness tends to be greater, when the project leader has substantial prior innovation and management experience, and when the immediate work environment actively supports creative endeavors. These findings are valuable for NPD practice, as they demonstrate that effective knowledge sourcing has much to contribute to NPD success. In particular, pursuing an open search strategy might not always be the best choice. Rather, each NPD project is in need of a carefully tailored search strategy, effective leadership, and a supportive climate, if the full value of external knowledge sourcing is to be captured.

AB  - The complexity of cellular and molecular events that occur during wound healing is given by the rapid and continuous changes of matrix structure, cell population, local cytokine composition, nutrient and oxygen availabilities and overall metabolic activity. Angiogenesis is an essential event in the repair of injured tissue. Transcriptional events leading to wound neovascularization begin immediately after the injury has occurred and continue throughout the process until scar remodeling becomes quiescent. This study investigated progression of wound angiogenesis by quantitatively measuring transcripts of multiple genes that participate in wound angiogenesis. The studies were done using a murine model of bilateral 3?mm excision wounds. Wound tissues were collected from 6 hours up to 10 days post-wounding. Each time point consisted of 8 wounds pooled from four different mice. After RNA purification, the samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using specific TaqMan probe/primer sets for selected transcripts that included the following groups: a) angiogenic factors; b) anti-angiogenic factors; c) receptors; d) cytokines and enzymes; e) matrix proteins; f) signaling molecules and transcription factors; g) apoptosis and proliferation markers; and h) housekeeping genes. A total of 58 genes were profiled including four housekeeping genes. The transcripts revealed several patterns of expression. Some genes such as angiopoietin 1(Ang1), e-selecting, placental growth factor (PlGF), MMP-9 and thrombospondin 1(TSP1) had a clear biphasic pattern where early peaks were detected within the first 24 hours after wounding and were followed by dowregulation and a second increase in transcription after several days. Other transcripts appeared early and had a sustained expression and they include fibroblast growth factor two (FGF2), FGF7, hypoxia inducile factor alpha (HIF-1a) and STAT3. Examples of late transcripts included HOXD3 and alpha smooth muscle actin. Results derived from this study largely confirm previous studies profiling a small number of individual genes such as VEGF, TSP1 and 2 and others. However, the present study integrates complete transcriptional profiles of large number of genes known to have a critical role in healing progression with a particular emphasis on revascularization. A more detailed model of event sequences that lead to tissue reperfusion after injury is derived from the results.

AB  - Summary Conifers have evolved complex oleoresin terpene defenses against herbivores and pathogens. In co-evolved bark beetles, conifer terpenes also serve chemo-ecological functions as pheromone precursors, chemical barcodes for host identification, or nutrients for insect-associated microbiomes. We highlight the genomic, molecular and biochemical underpinnings of the large chemical space of conifer oleoresin terpenes and volatiles. Conifer terpenes are predominantly the products of the conifer terpene synthase (TPS) gene family. Terpene diversity is increased by cytochromes P450 of the CYP720B class. Many conifer TPS are multiproduct enzymes. Multisubstrate CYP720B enzymes catalyse multistep oxidations. We summarise known terpenoid gene functions in various different conifer species with reference to the annotated terpenoid gene space in a spruce genome. Overall, biosynthesis of terpene diversity in conifers is achieved through a system of biochemical radiation and metabolic grids. Expression of TPS and CYP720B genes can be specific to individual cell types of constitutive or traumatic resin duct systems. Induced terpenoid transcriptomes in resin duct cells lead to dynamic changes of terpene composition and quantity to fend off herbivores and pathogens. While terpenoid defenses have contributed much to the evolutionary success of conifers, under new conditions of climate change, these defences may become inconsequential against range-expanding forest pests.

AB  - Introduction: Substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide released by sensory nerves in response to cutaneous injury, increases nitric oxide (NO) production by target cells. SP upregulates three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS). Topical SP application improves wound healing kinetics in NOS KO mice. Since nitric oxide may be a key intermediary mediator for SP induced response to injury, this study was designed to determine whether SP promotes inflammatory cell density in early wounds of NOS KO mice. Methods: Mice of each NOS null strain and appropriate background controls (C57BL/6J ? i/eNOS control;B6129SF2/J ? nNOS control) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine and xylazine. After shaving, full-thickness 1.5???1.5?sq. cm. dorsal excisional wounds were covered with a semi-occlusive dressing. Mice were randomly assigned to daily topical infusion of 10?7 M SP or NS onto wound beds. Wounds were harvested at day 3 and 7 (3 mice per group). Cells were isolated by sequential digestion in dispase and hyaluronidase. Cell counts were performed to determine total cell density. Flow cytometry was performed after staining cells with FITC ? labeled antibodies against F4/80 (macrophages), CD45 (pan leukocytes), CD31 (endothelial cells) or CD11c (dendritic cells). Results: Total cell number was higher at day 7 post-wounding than at day 3 (P?<?0.05) in both control and NOS null mice. Macrophage, pan-leukocyte and dendritic cell density was greater in the SP-treated wounds than in NS-treated wounds at both day 3 and 7 post-wounding (P?<?0.05) in all NOS KO mice. Whereas SP increased endothelial cell number in nNOS and iNOS mice, SP had no effect on endothelial cell number in the eNOS KO mice (P?>?0.05). SP did not affect cell density in background mice at either time point (P?>?0.05). Conclusion: SP upregulated inflammatory cell numbers in all NOS null mice suggesting that either SP activates NOS isoforms that are not reduced by targeted deletion or that SP induces inflammatory cell migration by NO-independent pathways. The lack of SP effect on endothelial cell number in eNOS KO wounds suggests that eNOS may mediate SP-induced wound angiogenesis.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Experimental diabetic neuropathy has a number of features in common with the human disease, including a reduction of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in nerve fibers, and alteration of the essential fatty acid metabolism leading to changes in membrane composition. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial in different pathological conditions including diabetic complications. Since the PUFA composition of cell membranes largely depends on the diet, most studies have supplemented the diet with fish oil (FO), particularly rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids, or DHA and EPA ethyl esters. We have prepared a new formulation of n-3 PUFA wax esters (WE) enriched in DHA and EPA that have a bioavailability comparable to oil and esters, are easily digestible and are free from most of the previous drawbacks. The present study was designed to measure Na+, K+-ATPase activity, NCV, and FA content in plasma phospholipids (PL) and to assess the preventive effect of newly formulated n-3 PUFA-WE, and individual EPA and DHA-WE (as compared with standard and FO-supplemented diets) on these abnormalities. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60?mg/kg/ip). After STZ injection, diabetic and non-diabetic control rats were fed the standard diet (St) without supplementation or supplemented with either FO or n-3 PUFA-WE or individual EPA and DHA-WE, to reach a daily dose of 0.15?g/kg, the experiment continued for five weeks. Analysis of the FA composition of plasma PL, which better reflects FA intake and content in biological membranes, showed that the sums of n-3 PUFA were double the St diet after n-3 supplement of independent of the dietary regimen, whereas those of FA of the n-6 family were not affected by n-3 supplementation. Thus, the n-6/n-3 ratios were reduced from 15:1 with the St diet to 7:1 for the FO and WE diets. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly lower in diabetic rats (?30?35%), significantly restored in diabetic rats that received FO, n-3 PUFA and EPA-WE supplementation, and partially restored by DHA-WE (9% lower than with non-diabetic controls). These effects were partially associated with a significant beneficial effect on NCV which was reduced by 20% in diabetic rats. FO protected against this decrease (3%), n-3 PUFA-WE were only partially protective (11%), and EPA and DHA-WE had scant effect. This study indicates that, like FO, n-3 PUFA-EPA and DHA-WE have beneficial effects on diabetic-induced alterations in sciatic nerve ATPase+-ATPase activity and, partially, also on NCV. The newly formulated n-3 PUFA WE offer a potential advantage over products in current use, on account of their greater stability.

AB  - Summary Older people are increasingly being referred for consideration for pancreas transplantation (PT). We investigated the outcomes after PT in our older recipient cohort. A prospectively maintained database was interrogated. The cohort was analysed for associations between outcome and older recipient age. A total of 444 transplants were performed in patients aged 23?54 years and 83 transplants in patients aged 55?67 years. There was no difference in death-censored pancreas or kidney graft survival between the groups. Patient death was associated with older recipient age (HR 1.63 per 10-year increase). In multivariate Cox regression, risk of mortality was also associated with post-transplant myocardial infarction (HR 7.25, P = 0.006), pancreas failure (HR 1.91, P = 0.003) and kidney failure (HR 3.55, P < 0.001). About 40% of recipients who died in the first year post-transplant suffered early graft loss. Those alive at a year post-transplant had inferior survival if they had lost their kidney graft (P < 0.001). Mortality is higher in older patients and is strongly associated with pancreas and kidney graft failure. This suggests that pancreas transplantation is feasible in older recipients, and careful selection of donor organs is important to optimize survival.

AB  - Abstract The 1555 A to G substitution in mitochondrial 12S A-site rRNA is associated with maternally transmitted deafness of variable penetrance in the absence of otherwise overt disease. Here, we recapitulate the suggested A1555G-mediated pathomechanism in an experimental model of mitoribosomal mistranslation by directed mutagenesis of mitoribosomal protein MRPS5. We first establish that the ratio of cysteine/methionine incorporation and read-through of mtDNA-encoded MT-CO1 protein constitute reliable measures of mitoribosomal misreading. Next, we demonstrate that human HEK293 cells expressing mutant V336Y MRPS5 show increased mitoribosomal mistranslation. As for immortalized lymphocytes of individuals with the pathogenic A1555G mutation, we find little changes in the transcriptome of mutant V336Y MRPS5 HEK cells, except for a coordinated upregulation of transcripts for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. Homozygous knock-in mutant Mrps5 V338Y mice show impaired mitochondrial function and a phenotype composed of enhanced susceptibility to noise-induced hearing damage and anxiety-related behavioral alterations. The experimental data in V338Y mutant mice point to a key role of mitochondrial translation and function in stress-related behavioral and physiological adaptations.

AB  - Summary Despite the presence of many studies on the role of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in cardiorenal tissues, the definitive role of mTOR in the pathogenesis of renal injury subsequent to ischaemia?reperfusion (IR) remains unclear. The aims of the current study were to characterize the role of mTOR in normal kidney function and to investigate the role of mTOR activation in IR-induced kidney injury. In euvolemic anaesthetized rats, treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin increased blood pressure (121 ± 2 to 144 ± 3 mmHg; P<.05), decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR; 1.6 ± 0.3 to 0.5 ± 0.2 mL/min; P<.05) and increased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV; 14 ± 1 to 109 ± 25 mmol/L per hour; P<.05). In rats subjected to IR, autophagy induction, p-mTOR expression and serum creatinine increased (1.9 ± 0.2 to 3 ± 0.3 mg/dL; P<.05); treatment with rapamycin blunted p-mTOR expression but further increased autophagy induction and serum creatinine (3 ± 0.3 to 5 ± 0.6 mg/dL; P<.05). In contrast, clenbuterol, an mTOR activator, blunted the effect of rapamycin on serum creatinine (4 ± 0.6 vs 2.3 ± 0.3 mg/dL; P<.05), autophagy induction and p-mTOR expression. IR also increased 24 hour protein excretion (9 ± 3 to 17 ± 2 mg/day; P<.05) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) expression, and rapamycin treatment further increased KIM-1 expression. Clenbuterol exacerbated protein excretion (13 ± 2 to 26 ± 4 mg/day; P<.05) and antagonized the effect of rapamycin on KIM-1 expression. Histopathological data demonstrated kidney injury in IR rats that was worsened by rapamycin treatment but attenuated by clenbuterol treatment. Thus, mTOR signalling is crucial for normal kidney function and protecting the kidney against IR injury through autophagy suppression.

AB  - Abstract The compound, palmate lamina of Lupinus palaestinus reorients photonastically, as well as phototropically in response to non-directional and directional light signals, respectively, by structural deformations of pulvini. When the excitation provided by directional light is maintained constant (fluence rate, angle of incidence and azimuth, with respect to the leaflet laminae), the entire lamina reorients towards it at a constant angular velocity over a considerable time interval and displacement. The laminar pulvinules are considerably longer than the subtending common petiolar pulvinus and therefore contribute most to laminar reorientation. The pulvinar region is characterized by transverse folds around its circumference, and longitudinal rib-like thickenings on the external walls of its epidermis that facilitate axial and transverse deformations. Specialized ?joints?, at the distal and proximal ends of each pulvinule, contribute most to its flexing. Anthocyanin is notable by its absence. Specialized ?motor? tissues surrounding the central vascular core participate in pulvinar deformation by undergoing directional and differential volume changes. The bundle sheath is characterized by numerous starch grains. The multi-layered cortical parenchyma exhibits an abundance of transversely oriented primary pit fields and associated plasmodesmata. When the leaflet lamina rotates around its midrib, the pulvinus twists along its axis, exhibiting epidermal and cortical deformation. The functional significance of these specializations is discussed.

AB  - This is the author's fifth revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately one-third of the previous references have been replaced by more current or more delimited articles. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited are primarily concerned with medical ailments of the elderly; legal, ethical, and sociological topics receive more limited coverage. The references are divided into categories. The first set (I) deals with some possible causes of aging; the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging; the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients; the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society; and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Summary Gastrointestinal fistulae commonly occur in association with abscesses. Advances in the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of intraabdominal abscesses, combined with newer imaging techniques, improved surgical management and medical therapies has led to an ability to manage a greater proportion without surgical intervention and has also resulted in decreased mortality. The clinical features are protean and are influenced by factors relating to the patient, the underlying pathology causing the abscess, and the site of the abscess. The diagnosis of abscesses within the abdomen is normally confirmed by typical presenting features in association with radiological investigation. Antimicrobial therapy represents the main aspect of treatment of intraabdominal abscesses. Prevention of intraabdominal abscesses relates largely to treating underlying disease processes that are associated with their formation. Prevention of postoperative fistulae also mirrors that of abscess prevention with regard to good surgical technique and preoperative optimization of patients.

AB  - Variation in water-holding capacity (WHC), which presents a major economic burden to the swine industry, is considered to be underpinned by variation at a molecular and biochemical level. High-resolution 2D DIGE followed by MS analysis and Western blot were used to unravel the proteome of muscle exudate, collected following centrifugation, in the pH 4?7 range. A first 2DE-based protein map of this substrate was produced where 89 spots were successfully characterised. Two phenotypes divergent for WHC plus one intermediate were compared with a view to deciphering the biochemical processes impacting on variation in WHC. Twenty spots were observed to be altered across the phenotypes. Of these, 14 represented sixteen proteins including metabolic enzymes, stress response proteins and structural proteins. Triosephosphate isomerase and transferrin showed a major difference between the two extreme phenotypes, and may have potential as biological markers for WHC prediction. Several members of the HSPs family were highlighted. This proteomic study makes an important contribution towards a more detailed molecular view of the processes behind WHC and will provide a valuable resource for future investigations.
