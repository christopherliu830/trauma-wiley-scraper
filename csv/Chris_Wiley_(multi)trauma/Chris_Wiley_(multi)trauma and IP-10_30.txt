AB  - Purpose:?? Preoperative radiotherapy (PRT) reduces the risk of local pelvic recurrence (LR) after rectal cancer surgery but is associated with considerable side-effects. This study aims to identify the LR rate associated with the present MRI based selection criterion for PRT (tumour threatening the fascia propria on MRI) at Auckland City Hospital (ACH), and to assess the likely influence on LR rates of a regimen using a PRT selection criterion based on a 5?mm clearance of the fascia propria. Methodology:?? All patients with rectal cancer treated at ACH from 1997?2005 who had preoperative MRI scans were identified from the National Cancer Registry. Details of demographics, MRI results, treatment and outcome were collated. Long-term outcomes were obtained from digital records, GPs, patient contact and death-certificates. All MRIs were re-reported using the new criterion of 5?mm clearance for the fascia propria. Results:?? There were 126 patients eligible patients, 20 were excluded with lack of MRI or follow-up. 106 patients (mean age 66.5?years, 67% male) were followed-up for a minimum 2?years (med 3?years). Using the present MRI based ACH criteria for PRT 29 (27%) patients were irradiated. Using a 5?mm tumour free margin 80 (75%) of patients would have been offered PRT. Overall 7 (6.6%) patients developed LR, 6 of these did not receive PRT, 4 of these fulfilled the new criterion and only 2 of these patients had a resection with curative intent. Conclusion:?? Selective PRT based on threatened fascia propria involvement on MRI lead to low PRT and LR rates. The use of a 5?mm tumour free lateral margin on MRI would result in three times as many patients receiving PRT and is likely to reduce the local recurrence rate by about 2%.

AB  - Summary The extracellular forms of the IL-1 cytokines are active through binding to specific receptors on the surface of target cells. IL-1 ligands bind to the extracellular portion of their ligand-binding receptor chain. For signaling to take place, a non-binding accessory chain is recruited into a heterotrimeric complex. The intracellular approximation of the Toll-IL-1-receptor (TIR) domains of the 2 receptor chains is the event that initiates signaling. The family of IL-1 receptors (IL-1R) includes 10 structurally related members, and the distantly related soluble protein IL-18BP that acts as inhibitor of the cytokine IL-18. Over the years the receptors of the IL-1 family have been known with many different names, with significant confusion. Thus, we will use here a recently proposed unifying nomenclature. The family includes several ligand-binding chains (IL-1R1, IL-1R2, IL-1R4, IL-1R5, and IL-1R6), 2 types of accessory chains (IL-1R3, IL-1R7), molecules that act as inhibitors of signaling (IL-1R2, IL-1R8, IL-18BP), and 2 orphan receptors (IL-1R9, IL-1R10). In this review, we will examine how the receptors of the IL-1 family regulate the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions of the IL-1 cytokines and are, more at large, involved in modulating defensive and pathological innate immunity and inflammation. Regulation of the IL-1/IL-1R system in the brain will be also described, as an example of the peculiarities of organ-specific modulation of inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Background End-of-day questionnaires, which are considered the gold standard for assessing abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are influenced by recall and ecological bias. The experience sampling method (ESM) is characterized by random and repeated assessments in the natural state and environment of a subject, and herewith overcomes these limitations. This report describes the development of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) based on the ESM principle, taking into account content validity and cross-cultural adaptation. Methods Focus group interviews with IBS patients and expert meetings with international experts in the fields of neurogastroenterology & motility and pain were performed in order to select the items for the PROM. Forward-and-back translation and cognitive interviews were performed to adapt the instrument for the use in different countries and to assure on patients? understanding with the final items. Key results Focus group interviews revealed 42 items, categorized into five domains: physical status, defecation, mood and psychological factors, context and environment, and nutrition and drug use. Experts reduced the number of items to 32 and cognitive interviewing after translation resulted in a few slight adjustments regarding linguistic issues, but not regarding content of the items. Conclusions and Inferences An ESM-based PROM, suitable for momentary assessment of IBS symptom patterns was developed, taking into account content validity and cross-cultural adaptation. This PROM will be implemented in a specifically designed smartphone application and further validation in a multicenter setting will follow.

AB  - Abstract The present study was designed to provide an appropriate micro-environment for regenerating axotomized neurons and proliferating/migrating cells. Because of its intrinsic permissive properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability, we chose to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of a chitosan-based biopolymer. The biomaterial toxicity was measured through in vitro test based on fibroblast cell survival on thermogelling chitosan lactate hydrogel substrate and then polymer was implanted into a C2 hemisection of the rat spinal cord. Animals were randomized into three experimental groups (Control, Lesion and Lesion?+?Hydrogel) and functional tests (ladder walking and forelimb grip strength tests, respiratory assessment by whole-body plethysmography measurements) were used, once a week during 10 weeks, to evaluate post-traumatic recoveries. Then, electrophysiological examinations (reflexivity of the sub-lesional region, ventilatory adjustments to muscle fatigue known to elicit the muscle metaboreflex and phrenic nerve recordings during normoxia and temporary hypoxia) were performed. In vitro results indicated that the chitosan matrix is a non-toxic biomaterial that allowed fibroblast survival. Furthermore, implanted animals showed improvements of their ladder walking scores from the 4th week post-implantation. Finally, electrophysiological recordings indicated that animals receiving the chitosan matrix exhibited recovery of the H-reflex rate sensitive depression, the ventilatory response to repetitive muscle stimulation and an increase of the phrenic nerve activity to asphyxia compared to lesioned and nonimplanted animals. This study indicates that hydrogel based on chitosan constitute a promising therapeutic approach to repair damaged spinal cord or may be used as an adjuvant with other treatments to enhance functional recovery after a central nervous system damage. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.

AB  - The sheath and prepuce are anatomically simple yet vital parts of the mating apparatus of the bull. They are also susceptible to a range of insults, and pathology of these structures is a common cause of infertility in both Bos taurus and Bos indicus bulls. Significant individual and breed-based variation occurs in the looseness of the skin, the presence and development of preputial muscles, the relative position of the opening to the cranial preputial muscles, the length of the prepuce, and the prominence of the umbilicus. Individual and breed-based susceptibility to different conditions is associated with these anatomical variations. Regardless of the cause, pathology of the prepuce generally results in sepsis, prolapse, stenosis or adhesions or a combination. Clinical examination should be aimed at determining the extent of these processes and the amount of healthy prepuce which would remain following successful treatment. The inclusion of evaluation of sheath conformation in the form of a sheath score is recommended. Current scoring systems do not reflect the diversity of predisposing factors to morbidity and may therefore fail to accurately reflect the risk of morbidity. A more detailed scoring system has been proposed. Further refinement of this system is outlined, consisting of a composite of scores for depth, umbilical skin fold, prepuce eversion, and distance from cranial muscle to opening (the ?Y? factor). Validation against actual bull performance is indicated to develop a valid and useful risk-management tool for use in evaluating sheath conformation.
