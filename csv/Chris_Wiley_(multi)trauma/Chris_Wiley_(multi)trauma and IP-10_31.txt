AB  - While cell cycle markers have been used to differentiate benign versus malignant lesions and to classify malignant lesions, benign keratoses have not been well studied using such markers, and the relation of the cell cycle to inflammation or irritation of benign keratoses is unclear. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of 10 seborrheic keratoses, 10 inflamed seborrheic keratoses, and 10 inverted follicular keratoses using antibodies to p53, bcl-1, and bcl-2. Staining with antibodies to p53 was increased in inverted follicular keratoses compared to inflamed or non-inflamed seborrheic keratoses. Bcl-1 staining was similar in all lesions. A population of bcl-2-positive dendritic cells was seen within the epidermal portion of inverted follicular keratoses. Keratinocyte bcl-2 staining was higher in seborrheic keratoses compared to the other two keratoses. Bcl-2 may be increased in seborrheic keratoses as an anti-apoptotic mechanism while increased p53 may trigger apoptosis in inverted follicular keratoses.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a leading nosocomial pathogen, infecting a wide range of anatomic sites including the respiratory tract and the bloodstream. In addition to being multi-drug resistant, little is known about the molecular basis of A. baumannii pathogenesis. To better understand A. baumannii virulence, a combination of a transposon-sequencing (TraDIS) screen and the neutropenic mouse model of bacteremia was used to identify the full set of fitness genes required during bloodstream infection. The lytic transglycosylase MltB was identified as a critical fitness factor. MltB cleaves the MurNAc-GlcNAc bond of peptidoglycan, which leads to cell wall remodeling. Here we show that MltB is part of a complex network connecting resistance to stresses, membrane homeostasis, biogenesis of pili and in vivo fitness. Indeed, inactivation of mltB not only impaired resistance to serum complement, cationic antimicrobial peptides and oxygen species, but also altered the cell envelope integrity, activated the envelope stress response, drastically reduced the number of pili at the cell surface and finally, significantly decreased colonization of both the bloodstream and the respiratory tract.

AB  - Neutrophil activation and adhesion must be tightly controlled to prevent complications associated with excessive inflammatory responses. The role of the anti-inflammatory peptide chemerin15 (C15) and the receptor ChemR23 in neutrophil physiology is unknown. Here, we report that ChemR23 is expressed in neutrophil granules and rapidly upregulated upon neutrophil activation. C15 inhibits integrin activation and clustering, reducing neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis in vitro. In the inflamed microvasculature, C15 rapidly modulates neutrophil physiology inducing adherent cell detachment from the inflamed endothelium, while reducing neutrophil recruitment and heart damage in a murine myocardial infarction model. These effects are mediated through ChemR23. We identify the C15/ChemR23 pathway as a new regulator and thus therapeutic target in neutrophil-driven pathologies.

AB  - 1. Simultaneous measurements of voltage-clamp currents and tension were made in shortened sheep Purkinje fibres exposed to various concentrations of strophanthidin, ouabain and digoxin. 2. In 5·4 mM-K moderate doses (mean 2·4 ? 10?7M) of the drugs produced an inward shift of the current?voltage relationship at very negative potentials, consistent with an increase in cleft K concentration (Cohen, Daut & Noble, 1976b), which was always accompanied by an increase in tension. This change, which has been attributed to Na?K pump inhibition, was often better correlated with an increase in voltage-dependent tonic tension than in twitch tension. 3. Exposure to dihydro-ouabain gave a monotonic increase in tension but a delayed increase in inward current. This suggests (cf. Lee, Kang, Sokol & Lee, 1980) that minor changes in pump activity may not always change the current?voltage relationship. 4. Low concentrations of strophanthidin (5 ? 10?9 to 5 ? 10?7 M) produced an outward current shift at very negative potentials, this change becoming smaller with a more rapid onset and reversing on increasing the dose. This change is attributed to pump stimulation. 5. The outward current shift was often associated with a negative inotropic effect, which always reversed either spontaneously or on removal of the drug. 6. The alternative response at a narrower dose range (1 ? 10?8 to 2 ? 10?7 M) was an increase in twitch (not tonic) tension, termed the low-dose positive inotropic effect. 7. After a low concentration of cardiotonic steroid had given an early negative inotropic effect the bulk Ca concentration was reduced and the drug re-applied. The low-dose positive inotropic mechanism was then observed. 8. Outward current shifts and negative inotropy were also obtained with low concentrations of the clinically used glycosides digoxin and ouabain. 9. Low concentrations of strophanthidin applied to externally stimulated sheep ventricular trabeculae produced negative inotropy with lengthening of the action potential duration. Positive inotropy and action potential shortening occurred with higher doses. 10. A computer model of ionic currents and distributions in Purkinje fibres satisfactorily reproduced the changes in membrane currents and ionic gradients observed with cardiotonic steroids. The only perturbations capable of explaining our results were Na pump stimulation and inhibition. 11. It is concluded that cardiotonic steroids possess two inotropic mechanisms. The first is a low-dose positive inotropic mechanism causally unrelated to changes in sodium pump activity and possibly a direct release of a membrane-associated calcium fraction. Should this mechanism be unavailable then net pump stimulation at low doses will produce negative inotropy. The second mechanism is the well known Na-lag process.

AB  - Summary There has been a recent dramatic increase in understanding how to replace neurons lost through aging, trauma or disease and how to repair brain damage with significant functional recovery in a variety of models of human neurodegenerative disease. Donor factors identified in various models indicate that underlying successful cell transplantation in the nervous system critically include cell harvesting at an appropriate stage notably in embryonic or neonatal development. Also necessary are an appropriate nutritive environment for cell growth and appropriate techniques of cell implantation. Animal and other models have demonstrated the potential feasibility of using cells for repair of central nervous system disorders but for the present time functional clinical use of such cells remains an innovation in development at least in part due to the complex and precisely organized anatomical structures involved. There are also donor supply and ethics issues and conflicting clinical trial work, however, clinicians are working to achieve consensus through the application of evidence-based medicine.

AB  - Abstract A risk analysis of in utero caffeine exposure is presented utilizing epidemiological studies and animal studies dealing with congenital malformation, pregnancy loss, and weight reduction. These effects are of interest to teratologists, because animal studies are useful in their evaluation. Many of the epidemiology studies did not evaluate the impact of the ?pregnancy signal,? which identifies healthy pregnancies and permits investigators to identify subjects with low pregnancy risks. The spontaneous abortion epidemiology studies were inconsistent and the majority did not consider the confounding introduced by not considering the pregnancy signal. The animal studies do not support the concept that caffeine is an abortafacient for the wide range of human caffeine exposures. Almost all the congenital malformation epidemiology studies were negative. Animal pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the teratogenic plasma level of caffeine has to reach or exceed 60?µg/ml, which is not attainable from ingesting large amounts of caffeine in foods and beverages. No epidemiological study described the ?caffeine teratogenic syndrome.? Six of the 17 recent epidemiology studies dealing with the risk of caffeine and fetal weight reduction were negative. Seven of the positive studies had growth reductions that were clinically insignificant and none of the studies cited the animal literature. Analysis of caffeine's reproductive toxicity considers reproducibility and plausibility of clinical, epidemiological, and animal data. Moderate or even high amounts of beverages and foods containing caffeine do not increase the risks of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation. Pharmacokinetic studies markedly improve the ability to perform the risk analyses. Birth Defects Res (Part B) 92:152?187, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Quantum dots (QDs) are novel tools with multiple biological and medical applications because of their superior photoemission and photostability characteristics. However, leaching of toxic metals from QDs is of great concern. Therefore, for the successful application of QDs in bioscience, it is essential to understand their biological fate and toxicity. We investigated toxicological effects and tissue distribution of mercaptopropionic acid-conjugated cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide (CdSe/CdS-MPA) QDs after repeated intraperitoneal injection into BALB/c mice. The mice were injected every 3?days with various doses of QDs (0, 5, 10 and 25?mg?kg?1). The subsequent effects of QDs on plasma levels of various biomarkers were evaluated at different time points (at 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 15?days). Various tissue samples (spleen, liver, lung, kidneys, brain, heart and thymus) were collected for toxicity analysis, distribution testing, histopathological examination and inflammation assessment. No abnormal clinical signs or behaviors were recorded but the body weight of mice treated with 25?mg?kg?1 QDs was significantly decreased from day 7 compared with control mice. QDs were observed in the liver, spleen, lung and kidneys, but not in brain or heart. Significantly higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase were found in the plasma, liver and spleen. Histopathological examination did not show any tissue toxicity but the levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory marker, were increased in the plasma, liver and spleen. All of these findings provide insight into the observed toxicological effect levels and tissue-specific distribution of CdSe/CdS-MPA QDs. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with the accumulation of wild-type human α-synuclein (SYN) in neurons and with prominent slowing of brain oscillations on electroencephalography (EEG). However, it remains uncertain whether the EEG abnormalities are actually caused by SYN. Methods To determine whether SYN can cause neural network abnormalities, we performed EEG recordings and analyzed the expression of neuronal activity-dependent gene products in SYN transgenic mice. We also carried out comparative analyses in humans with DLB. Results We demonstrate that neuronal expression of SYN in transgenic mice causes a left shift in spectral power that closely resembles the EEG slowing observed in DLB patients. Surprisingly, SYN mice also had seizures and showed molecular hippocampal alterations indicative of aberrant network excitability, including calbindin depletion in the dentate gyrus. In postmortem brain tissues from DLB patients, we found reduced levels of calbindin mRNA in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, nearly one quarter of DLB patients showed myoclonus, a clinical sign of aberrant network excitability that was associated with an earlier age of onset of cognitive impairments. In SYN mice, partial suppression of epileptiform activity did not alter their shift in spectral power. Furthermore, epileptiform activity in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice was not associated with a left shift in spectral power. Interpretation We conclude that neuronal accumulation of SYN slows brain oscillations and, in parallel, causes aberrant network excitability that can escalate into seizure activity. The potential role of aberrant network excitability in DLB merits further investigation.

AB  - Spitzoid melanoma in children is a rare tumor that can mimic Spitz nevus both clinically and histologically. Recently, dysregulation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signalling pathway was reported in 89% of sporadic melanomas due to activating mutations in the BRAF or NRAS gene. BRAF mutations are found in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi, whereas none are present in Spitz nevi. NRAS mutations occur in 5?37% of melanomas and 9?56% of common melanocytic nevi. The mutational status of NRAS in Spitz nevi is unknown. This is the first study analyzing the mutational profile of BRAF and NRAS in Spitzoid melanomas occurring in prepubertal children (10 years of age or younger). Primary tumor cells were isolated via laser capture microdissection from 10 typical Spitz nevi and 10 metastatic Spitzoid melanomas. Exons 11 and 15 of BRAF and exons 2 and 3 of NRAS were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Common activating mutations were not identified in BRAF or NRAS. Absence of the V599E hot-spot mutation in BRAF was further confirmed by allele-specific PCR. We conclude that Spitzoid melanomas in children share clinical, histological and genetic similarities to Spitz nevi, and are genetically distinct from other melanoma subtypes.

This review focuses on bark defenses, a front line against organisms trying to reach the nutrient-rich phloem. A major breach of the bark can lead to tree death, as evidenced by the millions of trees killed every year by specialized bark-invading insects. Different defense strategies have arisen in conifer lineages, but the general strategy is one of overlapping constitutive mechanical and chemical defenses overlaid with the capacity to up-regulate additional defenses. The defense strategy incorporates a graded response from ?repel?, through ?defend? and ?kill?, to ?compartmentalize?, depending upon the advance of the invading organism. Using a combination of toxic and polymer chemistry, anatomical structures and their placement, and inducible defenses, conifers have evolved bark defense mechanisms that work against a variety of pests. However, these can be overcome by strategies including aggregation pheromones of bark beetles and introduction of virulent phytopathogens. The defense structures and chemicals in conifer bark are reviewed and questions about their coevolution with bark beetles are discussed.

AB  - This is the author's fourth revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately one-third of the previous references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unrefereed article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society, and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.
