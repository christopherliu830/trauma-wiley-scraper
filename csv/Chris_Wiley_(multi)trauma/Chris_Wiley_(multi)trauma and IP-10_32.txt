AB  - Cecropia species, ranging from Mexico to northern Argentina and the West Indies, are pioneer trees that colonize cleared areas with high light. To determine their ages to help pinpoint the date of the area's disturbance, we need to understand their developmental and architectural changes over time. The simple architecture of Cecropia conforms to the model of Rauh; that is, it has orthotropic axes with lateral flowering and rhythmic branching. The axes are made of a succession of nodes and internodes whose length and associated lateral productions remain measurable for years. Thus, by describing the tree trunk node by node, we can depict the sequence of events involved in tree development. For 25 trees of C. sciadophylla, from two stations in French Guiana and Colombia, we recorded internode length and any presence of branches, and flowers for each node. Using autocorrelation coefficients, we found a high periodicity in flowering and branching, with inflorescences at every 25 nodes, stages of branches spaced by a multiple of 25 nodes, and alternation of long and short nodes every 25 nodes. Considering that flowering is annual for many Cecropia species, the main conclusion of this work is that C. sciadophylla has strong annual growth, branching, and flowering rhythms. In addition, the age of the tree can be estimated retrospectively by observing its adult morphology.

AB  - Summary The journey from emerging technology to therapeutic paradigm change follows a rocky road. The development of monoclonal antibodies as a commercially viable industry exemplifies this. Several technological S-curves have been navigated to make mAbs the conventional pharmaceuticals that they have become today: from discovery and engineering to clinical translation and industrial scale manufacturing. The transformational nature of these new molecules has generated a multi-billion dollar global industry. A historic recollection of the defining events that shaped the mAb technology is particularly relevant to regenerative medicine in general and therapeutic stem cells in particular. A point of inflexion in the value of mAb transactions occurred with the commercial success of the first mAb blockbuster (rituximab), triggering multi-billion USD licensing transactions and very large M (3) enhancement of biological attributes, (4) combination with conventional drugs, (5) delivery devices and formulation, and (6) solid organ transplantation. Each co-evolutionary advance contributes to the clinical, economic and access to care value proposition that makes or breaks a technology, as it transitions from bench to bedside.

AB  - Abstract Erythropoietin is a primary regulator of erythropoiesis in the hematopoietic system. More recently erythropoietin has been shown to play a role in neurogenesis and provide neurotrophic support to injured CNS tissue. Here the effects of large systemic doses of erythropoietin on basal levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice were examined. A 7-day period of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) administration increased the number of bromodeoxyuridine [BrdU(+)] cells in the sub-granular zone (SGZ) by 30%. Analysis of cell phenotype revealed an increase in mitotically active doublecortin(+) neuronal progenitor cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein(+) SGZ radial astrocytes/stem cells but not mature S100?(+) astrocytes. These effects appeared to be mediated, in part, by mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and potentially regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling-3. Hippocampal levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase 42/44 and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 were increased 2?6?h after a single systemic rhEPO injection. However, rhEPO had no observed effect on the long-term survival of new born cells in the SGZ, with similar numbers of BrdU(+) cells and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) co-labeled cells after 4?weeks. Therefore, systemically delivered rhEPO transiently increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis without any apparent long-term effects.

AB  - Abstract Background The medial sural artery perforator (MSAP) flap shows advantages for reconstruction in the foot and ankle, where bulk is a liability. We evaluated the versatility of this flap and provide further evidence on its use for covering small-to-moderate size defects by comparing the outcome depending on the region of reconstruction. Methods Twenty-two patients with variable defects of 4 ? 4 to 18 ? 7 cm underwent MSAP flap reconstruction. Final outcomes of all patients were evaluated 12-months postoperatively using the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot, midfoot and hallux scale for clinical-functional evaluation, and the SF-36 health survey for quality-of-life measurement. The scores were compared in three groups according to the anatomic region of MSAP flap reconstruction. Results The flap size ranged between 6 ? 4 and 21 ? 9 cm. One venous congestion was salvaged by venous thrombectomy and reanastomosis, and one marginal flap necrosis healed by secondary intention. All flaps survived, and all patients returned to ambulation. Patients with reconstruction of the ankle-hindfoot or hallux showed significantly lower AOFAS ankle-hindfoot (P?=?0.021) or hallux scores (P?=?0.034), whereas reconstruction of the midfoot led to equal AOFAS midfoot scores (P?=?0.265) as compared with patients without reconstruction in the respective region. Comparison of SF-36 physical (P?=?0.936) and mental (P?=?0.855) scores of all three regions remained insignificant. Conclusion The MSAP flap provides thin soft tissue coverage, enabling good functional recovery after defect reconstruction all around the foot and ankle, with evident advantages in the midfoot. However, the functional outcomes after reconstruction of the ankle-hindfoot or hallux region depend on the preexistent functional impairment.

AB  - Abstract Since 1970, when the concept of continuous passive motion (CPM) was originated by one of the authors (R.B.S.), he and a succession of his research fellows have investigated its biological effects on the healing and regeneration of articular tissues in a wide variety of experimental models in rabbits. From this basic research he concluded that CPM is well tolerated, seems to be painless, stimulates the healing and regeneration of articular tissues, prevents joint stiffness, and permits the normal healing of arthrotomy incisions. Beginning in 1975, one of the authors (H.W.H.), and in 1978, the remaining authors, (from two additional Canadian cities) applied the knowledge from the basic research on CPM to the orthopaedic care of human patients. The CPM devices for humans (CPM Mobilimbs?), which have been designed in collaboration with University of Toronto engineers, include, to date, devices for the ankle-knee-hip, the elbow, and the finger. Indications for CPM in patients have been the immediate postoperative management following such operative procedures as open reduction and internal fixation of fractures, arthrotomy and arthrolysis for post-traumatic arthritis, synovectomy, surgical drainage for septic arthritis, release of extraarticular contractures, metaphyseal osteotomies, total joint replacement, and ligamentous reconstruction. The case reports of nine selected patients are presented as examples of the clinical application of CPM. These patients have been relatively free of pain, have maintained the increased motion gained at operation, and have accepted the application of CPM well. There have been no complications of CPM; the operative wounds have healed well and the period of hospitalization has not been prolonged. The authors believe that the clinical application of CPM is feasible and that the clinical and radiographic results of CPM in these patients are encouraging. Long-term, prospective clinical investigations (including control patients in whom CPM is not used) will be requited to assess the efficacy of CPM in relation to the various stated indications.

AB  - Abstract Background Intervention on small targets in the lung is difficult, leading our team to develop a highly accurate respiratory correlated image guided surgery (RCIGS) system. Methods Simulated point source targets were implanted into ex vivo porcine and human cadaver lungs attached to a ventilator. The RCIGS system was utilized to guide intervention in the presence of respiratory motion using a commercially available electromagnetic tracking solution. After intervention, the lungs were imaged to determine the target registration error between the target and needle. Results The system tumor position modeling had sub-mm accuracy. The mean intervention error for 12 porcine targets was 3.8?mm. The mean target registration error on four targets in a human cadaver was 4.0?mm at a mean depth of 9?cm. Conclusions The system provides an accuracy for intervention on targets of less than 1?cm in diameter at depths of up to 10?cm. A system of this accuracy outperforms current clinical standards.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Previously, donors with asymptomatic stones found incidentally on CT were not considered ideal donor candidates because of the presumed risk of morbidity to both the donor and recipient. Increasingly, studies show that these risks are low. This study aims to evaluate the long-term safety of using ex vivo ureteroscopy to remove the stones from the donor kidney on the bench before donation. Outcomes so far suggest that this technique can safely render a kidney stone-free before transplantation. This has led to 20 more transplants in our institution than would otherwise be possible. Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic renal stones in our potential donor population. To assess the safety and success of ex vivo ureteroscopy (ExURS) to remove stones from explanted donor kidneys before transplantation. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 377 computed tomography (CT) angiograms of potential kidney donors between October 2004 and May 2007 to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic renal stones in our donor population. Between October 2005 and October 2011, kidneys from suitable donors underwent ExURS. Stones were removed using basket extraction or were fragmented with holmium laser on bench before transplantation. Immediate and long-term complications of the transplanted recipients were recorded. Donors were followed with yearly ultrasonography of the remaining kidney in addition to standard follow-up protocol. Results Review of 377 CT angiograms between October 2004 to May 2007 showed a 5% prevalence of asymptomatic renal stones. Out of 55 potential donors (19 identified between October 2004 to May 2007 and a further 36 identified since May 2007), 20 donors with stones proceeded to donation, with stone size ranging from 2 to 12?mm. Of the patients, 17 proceeded to ExURS. Stones were removed in 10 patients; five with basket retrieval, four with laser fragmentation and one with both laser fragmentation and basket retrieval. There were no early or late allograft stone-related complications and no evidence of stones on follow-up imaging at a mean (range) of 10 (1?24) months. There has been no reported stone recurrence in any of the donors to date and no stone on ultrasonography of eight donors with >1-year follow-up (mean 26 months, range 12?49 months). Conclusions Asymptomatic renal stones are present in 5% of our donors. ExURS can be safely used to remove stones in these kidneys before transplantation, without the risk of subjecting the donor to an additional stone-removing procedure. Continued long-term follow-up of donors and recipients is still required to ensure the safety of this approach.
