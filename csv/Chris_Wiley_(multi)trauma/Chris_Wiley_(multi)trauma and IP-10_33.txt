AB  - Abstract The brain swells over the several minutes that follow stroke onset or acute hypo-osmotic stress because cells take up water. Measuring the volume responses of single neurons and glia has necessarily been confined to isolated or cultured cells. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy enables real-time visualization of cells functioning deep within living neocortex in vivo or in brain slices under physiologically relevant osmotic and ischemic stress. Astrocytes and their processes expressing green fluorescent protein in murine cortical slices swelled in response to 20 min of overhydration (?40 mOsm) and shrank during dehydration (+40 or +80 mOsm) at 32?34°C. Minute-by-minute monitoring revealed no detectable volume regulation during these osmotic challenges, particularly during the first 5 min. Astrocytes also rapidly swelled in response to elevated [K+]o for 3 min or oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) for 10 min. Post-OGD, astroglial volume recovered quickly when slices were re-supplied with oxygen and glucose, while neurons remained swollen with beaded dendrites. In vivo, rapid astroglial swelling was confirmed within 6 min following intraperitoneal water injection or during the 6?12 min following cardiac arrest. While the astrocytic processes were clearly swollen, the extent of the astroglial arbor remained unchanged. Thus, in contrast to osmo-resistant pyramidal neurons (Andrew et al., 2007) that lack known aquaporins, astrocytes passively respond to acute osmotic stress, reflecting functional aquaporins in their plasma membrane. Unlike neurons, astrocytes better recover from brief ischemic insult in cortical slices, probably because their aquaporins facilitate water efflux. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Clinical neurophysiologic examination of the pelvic floor is performed worldwide, but there is no consensus on the choice of tests, nor on technical details of individual methods. Standardized methods are, however, necessary to obtain their valid application in different laboratories for the purpose of collection of normative data, comparison of patient data and organization of multi-center studies. It is proposed that in patients with suspected ?lower motor neuron? type lesions concentric needle electromyography (CNEMG) is the most informative test to detect pelvic floor denervation/reinnervation, and the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle is the most appropriate muscle to be examined (either in isolation?when a selective lesion is suspected?or in addition to examination of other muscles). An algorithm consisting of standardized tests including a standardized approach to CNEMG examination of the EAS is presented. The proposed electrophysiologic assessment consists of a computer-assisted analysis of denervation and reinnervation features of the CNEMG signal, a qualitative assessment of reflex and voluntary activation of EAS motor units, and of electrical (or mechanical) elicitation of the bulbocavernosus reflex in those patients in whom manual anogenital stimulation failed to elicit a robust response in the EAS. The proposed protocol could serve as a basis for further studies on validity, sensitivity and specificity of electrophysiologic assessment in patients with different types of ?lower motor neuron? involvement of pelvic floor muscles and sacral dysfunction.

AB  - Despite its past anonymity, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type is a disease with a major impact on our ageing society. It affects a considerable percentage of old and very old people (some 20% of people over the age of eighty), causing distress and discomfort for the sufferers and the carers; it causes close to 50% of all nursing home admissions and costs the nation probably more than $2 billion annually; it is, with cardiovascular diseases and cancer, a leading cause of death. One of the particular difficulties with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) is that the diagnosis only can be confirmed in the post-mortem ? during life the diagnosis can only be made with a limited degree of certainty by following established inclusion and exclusion criteria (Glen and Christie 1979); that is, by ruling out other known causes of dementia in a patient with a dementia syndrome it is concluded that it must be senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. One other interesting aspect is that in SDAT, a disease which I compared before with cancer and cardio-vascular disease, a defeatist attitude amongst the medical profession is frequently noticed. Had the same attitude been adopted in the past towards cancer and cardio-vascular disease, progress in diagnosis and treatment of these diseases would never have happened. I am suggesting that it is possible to adopt a less defeatist and more positive attitude towards SDAT and this then stimulates the development of working strategies and working hypotheses. A working hypothesis can never claim to be a final solution to the problem, it is merely a frame of thought that directs step by step research working towards piecemeal solution of the problem. Summary A working hypothesis is presented, describing SDAT as a multi-factorial condition, in which genetic factors, toxic factors and nutritional factors are interacting and may play an accelerating role in the development of SDAT. Depression, frequently co-existing with SDAT, contributes to symptomatology and can be considered as playing an accelerating role. A tremendous amount of research has to be done. A working strategy at present could be: 1. Increase research. 2. Maintenance of a good nutritional status in the individual patient is mandatory. Nutritional research deserves high priority, based on early indications that secondary changes in nutritional condition may accelerate the process. 3. More attention should be given, before the verdict of ?Alzheimer? is pronounced, to the possibility that toxic factors have been contributing to the condition. Extra attention should be given to careful prescription of medication. 4. Prevention, early recognition and vigorous treatment of depression seems to be a most important factor. The importance of psycho-social stimulation should be recognised. The influence of the depression-like state on the blood-brain barrier function and on nutritional status of the brain should have high priority in future research.

AB  - Abstract In the brain, the astroglial syncytium is crucially involved in the regulation of water homeostasis. Accumulating evidence indicates that a dysregulation of the astrocytic processes controlling water homeostasis has a pathogenetic role in several brain injuries. Here, we have analysed by RNA interference technology the functional interactions occurring between the most abundant water channel in the brain, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and the swelling-activated Cl? current expressed by cultured rat cortical astrocytes. We show that in primary cultured rat cortical astrocytes transfected with control small interfering RNA (siRNA), hypotonic shock promotes an increase in cellular volume accompanied by augmented membrane conductance mediated by volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC). Conversely, astroglia in which AQP4 was knocked down (AQP4 KD) by transfection with AQP4 siRNA changed their morphology from polygonal to process-bearing, and displayed normal cell swelling but reduced VRAC activity. Pharmacological manipulations of actin cytoskeleton in rat astrocytes, and functional analysis in mouse astroglial cells, which retain their morphology upon knockdown of AQP4, suggest that stellation of AQP4 KD rat cortical astrocytes was not causally linked to reduction of VRAC current. Molecular analysis of possible candidates of swelling-activated Cl? current provided evidence that in AQP4 KD astrocytes, there was a down-regulation of chloride channel-2 (CIC-2), which, however, was not involved in VRAC conductance. Inclusion of ATP in the intracellular saline restored VRAC activity upon hypotonicity. Collectively, these results support the view that in cultured astroglial cells, plasma membrane proteins involved in cell volume homeostasis are assembled in a functional platform.

AB  - Objectives To describe survival and cause of death in a nationwide cohort of Danish patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). To describe risk factors associated with prostate cancer mortality. Patients and Methods Observational study of 6489 men with localised prostate cancer treated with RP at six different hospitals in Denmark between 1995 and 2011. Survival was described using Kaplan?Meier estimates. Causes of death were obtained from the national registry and cross-checked with patient files. Cumulative incidence of death, any cause and prostate cancer-specific, was described using Nelson?Aalen estimates. Risk for prostate cancer death was analysed in a Cox multivariate regression model using the covariates: age, cT-category, PSA level and biopsy Gleason score. Results The median follow-up was 4 years. During follow-up, 328 patients died, 109 (33.2%) from prostate cancer and 219 (66.8%) from other causes. Six patients (0.09%) died ≤30 days of RP. In multivariate analysis, cT-category was a predictor of prostate cancer death (P < 0.001). Compared with T1 disease, both cT2c (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2) and cT3 (HR 7.2) significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer death. For every doubling of PSA level the risk of prostate cancer death was increased by 34.8% (P < 0.001). Biopsy Gleason score 4 + 3 and ≥8 were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer death compared with biopsy Gleason score ≤ 6 of 2.3 and 2.7 (P = 0.003), respectively. The cumulative hazard of all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality after 10 years was 15.4% (95% confide3nce interval [CI] 13.2?17.7) and 6.6% (95% CI 4.9?8.2) respectively. Conclusions We present the first survival analysis of a complete, nationwide cohort of men undergoing RP for localised prostate cancer. The main limitation of the study was the relatively short follow-up. Interestingly, our national results are comparable to high-volume, single institution, single surgeon series.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study examined whether social and physical peer victimization in adolescence led to changes in psychological and physical health outcomes. Methods One hundred and twenty adolescents (boys = 54) and a parent completed measures of peer victimization and health approximately 2 years apart. Results Results indicated that both social and physical victimization were related to increases in the frequency and severity of health problems over the assessment period. Conclusions Increases in social, but not physical victimization, were related to more internalizing problems as well as greater frequency and severity of health problems at the second assessment. Anxious depression and severity of health problems at the first assessment were related to increases in social, but not physical forms of victimization over the 2-year period. These results continue to shed light on the notion that being peer victimized is not a normal part of life and is not necessarily something that adolescents will reconcile with time.

AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.

AB  - Epithelial cysts are commonly encountered in clinical practice, most usually as epidermoid (infundibular) cysts, and trichilemmal (pilar) cysts. A multitude of other cystic structures can arise from the pilosebaceous unit, including dermoid cyst, pilonidal cyst, eruptive vellus hair cyst, steatocystoma, pilomatricoma, as well as eccrine and apocrine hydrocystoma. Epidermoid cysts are thought to derive from the follicular infundibulum, and express keratin 10 but not keratin 17, whereas trichilemmal cysts are believed to derive from the follicular isthmus, and express both keratins 10 and 17. Proliferating follicular cysts generally exhibit trichilemmal keratinization. In addition to the various aforementioned cysts, hybrid cysts have been reported. The majority of hybrid cysts described have been epidermoid-trichilemmal, in which the upper portion of the cyst shows epidermoid keratinization with a sharp transition inferiorly to trichilemmal keratinization. However other hybrid variants have been reported, including epidermoid-pilomatricoma, epidermoid-apocrine hydrocystoma, trichilemmal-pilomatricoma, eruptive vellus hair cyst-steatocystoma, and eruptive vellus hair cyst-trichilemmal cysts. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a proliferating hybrid cyst containing both epidermoid and trichilemmal components, which presented on the scrotum of a 44-year-old man.
