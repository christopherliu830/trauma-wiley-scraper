AB  - Abstract Most clinically demented elderly patients are found at autopsy to have Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We studied 5 patients clinically characterized by late onset dementia whose brains showed no pathological evidence of Alzheimer's disease, or any other specific neuropathological diagnosis. We found argyrophilic grains, coiled bodies, abundant Alz-50-positive and thioflavine S-negative neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, locus ceruleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and inferior olives, Ultrastructurally, the grains, threads, and tangles were composed of straight tubulofilamentous structures, 25 nm in diameter, similar to those found in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy but different from the paired helical filaments of patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that the late onset dementia with argyrophilic grains syndrome is also characterized by the presence of tangles and threads with the topographical distribution of progressive supranuclear palsy.

AB  - Abstract This study was designed to investigate the effect of quercetin (QE) on bone minerals and biomechanics in insulin-dependent diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by 50?mg?kg?1 intraperitoneal streptozotocin (STZ) in a single dose. The rats were randomly allotted into four experimental groups: A (control), B (non-diabetic?+?QE), C (diabetic), and D (diabetic?+?QE) each containing 10 animals. The diabetic rats received QE (15?mg?kg?1?day?1) for 4 weeks following 8 weeks of STZ injection. Blood samples were taken to determine glucose, insulin, calcium, and magnesium levels. The rats' femora were assessed biomechanically at femoral mid-diaphysis and neck. It was found that QE treatment increased insulin, calcium, and magnesium levels. Three-point bending of the femoral mid-diaphysis and necks showed significantly lower maximum load values (Fmax) in animals in the STZ group than the QE?+?STZ or control groups (p?<?0.05). The results support the conclusion that QE treatment may decrease blood glucose and increase plasma insulin, calcium, and magnesium. QE treatment may also be effective in bone mineral metabolism, biomechanical strength, and bone structure in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory properties of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) as well as microglia activation and inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that NBP improved the locomotor recovery of SD rats after SCI an significantly diminished the lesion cavity area of the spinal cord, apoptotic activity in neurons, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells at 7 days post-injury. NBP inhibited activation of microglia, diminished the release of inflammatory mediators, and reduced the upregulation of microglial TLR4/NF-?B expression at 1 day post-injury. In a co-culture system with BV-2 cells and PC12 cells, NBP significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of BV-2 cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. In addition, NBP reduced the activation of BV-2 cells, diminished the release of inflammatory mediators, and inhibited microglial TLR4/NF-?B expression in BV-2 cells. Our findings demonstrate that NBP may have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of SCI by inhibiting the activation of microglia via TLR4/NF-?B signalling.

AB  - Background and Purpose A non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), shows promising results as an effective potential antiepileptic drug in some forms of refractory epilepsy. To elucidate the mechanisms by which CBD exerts its anti-seizure effects, we investigated its effects at synaptic connections and on the intrinsic membrane properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and two major inhibitory interneurons: fast spiking, parvalbumin (PV)-expressing and adapting, cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons. We also investigated whether in vivo treatment with CBD altered the fate of CCK and PV interneurons using immunohistochemistry. Experimental Approach Electrophysiological intracellular whole-cell recordings combined with neuroanatomy were performed in acute brain slices of rat temporal lobe epilepsy in in vivo (induced by kainic acid) and in vitro (induced by Mg2+-free solution) epileptic seizure models. For immunohistochemistry experiments, CBD was administered in vivo (100 mg·kg?1) at zero time and 90 min post status epilepticus, induced with kainic acid. Key Results Bath application of CBD (10 ?M) dampened excitability at unitary synapses between pyramidal cells but enhanced inhibitory synaptic potentials elicited by fast spiking and adapting interneurons at postsynaptic pyramidal cells. Furthermore, CBD restored impaired membrane excitability of PV, CCK and pyramidal cells in a cell type-specific manner. These neuroprotective effects of CBD were corroborated by immunohistochemistry experiments that revealed a significant reduction in atrophy and death of PV- and CCK-expressing interneurons after CBD treatment. Conclusions and Implications Our data suggest that CBD restores excitability and morphological impairments in epileptic models to pre-epilepsy control levels through multiple mechanisms to reinstate normal network function.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders have traditionally been difficult to study due to the complexity of the human brain and limited availability of human tissue. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells provide a promising avenue to further our understanding of human disease mechanisms, but traditional 2D cell cultures can only provide a limited view of the neural circuits. To better model complex brain neurocircuitry, compartmentalized culturing systems and 3D organoids have been developed. Early compartmentalized devices demonstrated how neuronal cell bodies can be isolated both physically and chemically from neurites. Soft lithographic approaches have advanced this approach and offer the tools to construct novel model platforms, enabling circuit-level studies of disease, which can accelerate mechanistic studies and drug candidate screening. In this review, we describe some of the common technologies used to develop such systems and discuss how these lithographic techniques have been used to advance our understanding of neuropsychiatric disease. Finally, we address other in vitro model platforms such as 3D culture systems and organoids and compare these models with compartmentalized models. We ask important questions regarding how we can further harness iPS cells in these engineered culture systems for the development of improved in vitro models.

AB  - Abstract Endoneurial macrophages are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathies. Historically, the macrophage response in neuropathies is believed to be of hematogenous origin. However, recent studies could demonstrate an intrinsic generation of the early macrophage response by resident endoneurial macrophages after traumatic nerve injury and in a model of hereditary neuropathy. We hypothesized that the local macrophage response might suffice to generate an appropriate macrophage response in mild neuropathies, supplemented by infiltrating macrophages only in severe nerve pathology. To clarify this assumption, we investigated the macrophage response in acrylamide-induced neuropathy as a model of a slowly progressive neuropathy with a defined onset. We induced the neuropathy in bone marrow chimeric mice carrying green fluorescent protein transgenic bone marrow, allowing the differentiation of resident (GFP?) and invading hematogenous endoneurial (GFP+) macrophages. Quantification of GFP? and GFP+ endoneurial macrophages in the sciatic nerve revealed an increase only of resident macrophages in proximal parts, whereas in distal parts a minor additional influx of hematogenous macrophages was observed. The immunohistochemical profile of GFP? and GFP+ macrophages was similar but distal GFP? macrophages were differentially activated than their GFP+ counterparts. Characterization of CCR2-deficient mice revealed a function for this chemokine system in attracting hematogenous macrophages but not in generating the intrinsic macrophage response. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of resident macrophages in acrylamide-induced neuropathy. Resident endoneurial macrophages intrinsically generate the macrophage response in this slowly progressive neuropathy, which only becomes supplemented by hematogenous macrophages in distal areas of more pronounced damage. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A 74-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic, 20 by 10?cm, erythematous, indurated plaque on the sacrum with similar lesions in the folds of both legs. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated ANA and ESR but normal rheumatoid factor, TSH, Lyme, anti-DNA, and SSA/SSB antibodies. Biopsies from the sacrum and left leg showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of foamy histiocytes, epitheliod cells, and multinucleated giant cells, as well as lymphocytes and eosinophils in the entire dermis. The patient was diagnosed with interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with plaques. The lesions resolved spontaneously. IGD with plaques is a rare but benign disorder of uncertain etiology. Its characteristic histopathology and clinical appearance distinguish it from other granulomatous dermatitis.
