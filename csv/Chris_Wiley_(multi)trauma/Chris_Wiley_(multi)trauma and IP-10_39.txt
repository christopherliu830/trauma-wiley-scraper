AB  - Biofilms are a combination of microorganisms and extrapolysaccharide matrices. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that biofilms are present in both acute and chronic wounds. Once biofilms are established, phagocytosis and diffusion of antibiotics are impaired thus contributing to antimicrobial resistance due to increased bacterial virulence. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of two topical antimicrobial agents on partial thickness wounds containing Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. All wounds were inoculated with 106?CFU/ml and covered for 48 hrs under a polyurthene film to promote biofilm formation. Wounds were divided into three treatment groups; triple antibiotic ointment (Polymyxin B sulfate, bacitracin zinc, neomycin), mupirocin cream and untreated control. Wounds were treated twice daily. Wounds were cultured for bacterial quantitation at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120?hrs. Significant reduction in CFU/ml was observed only after several days of treatments. This finding supports the antimicrobial resistance that occurs when bacteria live within biofilms. Our previous studies demonstrated that both of these agents were able to completely eliminate planktonic S. aureus(106) at the early time points. This study demonstrates that when bacterial biofilms are established in wounds there is a longer response time for topical antimicrobial activity suggesting bacterial resistance.

AB  - The inflammatory events of atherosclerosis involve monocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and several cytokines, including chemokines. Atherosclerosis begins with recruitment of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel injury. In the vessel wall, these cells are activated to become macrophages that scavenge toxic material such as oxidized LDL and transition into ?foam cells? which will eventually lead to plaque formation. Tobacco smoke is known to exacerbate cardiovascular disease but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known. The chemokine MCP-1 is involved in recruiting monocytes to the injured blood vessel wall and is commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. Our data show that both ?first-hand? and ?second-hand? cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 production in cultured primary human aortic endothelial cells (EC), suggesting that cigarette smoke may contribute to plaque formation by stimulating aortic EC to produce MCP-1 in blood vessels after smoke injury. To test whether MCP-1 links smoking and cardiovascular disease, we are studying the expression of this molecule in mice that are either transgenic for human ApoB or are null for MCP-1 or its receptor, CCR2, by exposing the mice to smoke in a way that closely resembles human smoking. Blood samples from the mice were tested for carboxyhemoglobin, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and MCP-1 at successive weeks after initiation of smoking and the aortas isolated to analyze for plaque size and MCP-1 expression in the tissue. The carboxyhemoglobin test shows that the mice are exposed to smoke. Plasma MCP-1 and HDL levels are reduced in the smoking groups, whereas LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol remain unchanged. On one hand, the decrease in circulating HDL levels suggests that the reason smokers develop atherosclerosis may be because the rate of cholesterol clearance is slowed down. On the other hand, a decrease in circulating MCP-1 level may reflect that this chemokine accumulates in blood vessel walls, conferring stronger ability for attraction of monocytes. This work is supported by TRDRP and Phillip Morris.

AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scar is a devastating sequel to burns and other tangential skin injuries. It follows deep dermal injuries and does not occur after superficial injuries. Nitric oxide (NO) plays many important roles in wound healing from inflammation to scar remodeling. Studies have shown that expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production are decreased in human hypertrophic scar. However little is known about NO involvement in the early stages of hypertrophic scarring, because of the lack of an animal model. It was recently reported that the female red Duroc pig (FRDP) makes thick scar, which is similar to human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized that NO production in wounds on the female, red Duroc pig is similar to that of human hypertrophic scar and that NO involvement in deep wounds is different from that in superficial wounds. Methods: Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of four FRDPs. Biopsies were collected at weeks 1.5, 4, 8 and 21 post wounding including samples of uninjured skin. Nitric oxide levels were measured with the Griess reaction assay and normalized with tissue protein level. Results: Superficial wounds healed with an invisible scar whereas the deep wounds healed with scar resembling mild hypertrophic scar. The thickness of the scars from the deep wounds was significantly greater than uninjured skin and healed superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). NO levels were increased at 1.5 weeks in deep wounds compared to superficial wounds and uninjured skin (p?<?0.05). At 8 weeks, NO levels in deep wounds had returned to the level of uninjured tissue and superficial wounds. By 21 weeks, NO levels had decreased significantly when compared to superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). There were no differences in NO levels between uninjured skin and superficial wounds at any time point (p?>?0.05). Conclusions: NO production is similar in late, deep wounds on the female, red Duroc pig to that reported in the literature for human hypertrophic scar further validating this animal model. NO production is quite different after deep wounds as compared to superficial wounds in the FRDP. Early elevation in nitric oxide production might account for excessive inflammation in deep wounds that become thick scars in the FRDP. Nitric oxide regulators and effects at early stages of scar formation should be elucidated further and the FRDP appears to be a useful model.

AB  - Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection that often leaves patients with a large integumentary deficit to their penis and scrotum. Treatment of the skin defect has been described in a multitude of ways including split thickness skin grafting, burying the testes in the thighs, thigh flaps, and a variety of myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Many of the previously described techniques have worked well for smaller defects and for closure of wounds but fell short of aesthetic reconstruction of sexual organs. We describe a technique using split-thickness skin grafts with suction dressings or bolster. This was employed using the VAC?(Vacuum Assisted Closure Device, KCI?). This technique creates a natural appearing scrotum that holds the testes away from the body in a physiologic manner and surfaces the penis with a seemingly natural appearance in a functional manner. The technique provides a nearly 100% graft take and greatly decreases hospital length of stay. A case report demonstrates a patient?s full recovery to his professional, social, and sexual life within six weeks of initial reconstructive treatment. Our technique provides a reliable treatment with good functional and aesthetic outcomes to a difficult problem.

AB  - Celosia argentea is used in traditional medicine for sores, ulcers, and skin eruptions. Therefore, we investigated the healing efficiency of an ointment formulated on a alcohol extract of Celosia argentea leaves (CA) in a rat burn wound model. Wound closure occurred earlier in the treated rats (15 days versus 30 in the untreated group; P?<?0.05). Collagen and hexsoamine content of the granulation tissue increased at a faster rate in the treated wounds. To probe the cell biologic basis of this effect, we found that this extract promoted cell motility and proliferation of primary dermal fibroblasts but did not alter these responses in primary keratinocytes. In short, we demonstrate a salutary action of the Celosia argentea extract on wound healing and suggest that this may be due to mitogenic and motogenic promotion of dermal fibroblasts.

AB  - Bacteria reside in various forms, including planktonic, or free-floating, or as biofilms, which are a tightly adherent, potentially more treatment-resistant form. Biofilms, composed in part as polysaccharide matrices, can act as protection for bacteria by shielding them from antimicrobials and the innate immune system. It is estimated that bacterial biofilm are responsible for 65?80% of all chronic infections and may be responsible in part for non-healing of chronic wounds. An advance in the treatment of non-healing wounds has lead to the development of human skin equivalents (HSE), which can successfully treat many non-healing wounds. Better understanding the interaction between bacteria and HSE might improve patient outcomes. Studies involving planktonic E. coli and HSE have demonstrated the growth of bacterial colonies only on the dermal surface. Growth was not seen on the epidermal layer of the HSE, possibly due in part to the expression of innate antimicrobial peptides called human ? defensin-2 (hBD-2), which are expressed by HSE keratinocytes. The objective of this study was to determine if biofilm formation could occur on a bioengineered HSE. We used a commercially available HSE. Three (3) mm full-thickness incisions were made in a triangular section of HSE. Each section was inoculated on the epidermal aspect with 1.0???105CFU per gram of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 35 degrees Celsius for specified time points. Sections of HSE were sampled in areas of injury at various time points. Biopsy sections were processed for histologic analysis with H&E and epifluorescent microscopy to visualize Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that biofilm formation occurred at multiple time points on HSE. Colonies of adherent bacteria were visualized within the injured area of the epidermal layer of HSE by H & E staining. Eplifluoresecnt microscopy using calcofluor white staining revealed the characteristic exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix of biofilm. Visualization of the expression of human ? defensin-2 (hBD-2) with HSE after biofilm formation is underway. This knowledge will help to understand the role of bacterial biofilms within HSE and their effect on subsequent healing.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of skin graft fixation with fibrin sealant (FS) alone by means of spray application with a low setting time (thrombin concentration 4?5?IU/ml) in comparison to point suture fixation as a clinical reference method. Furthermore, the influence of two different quantities of FS were tested. ?Material and Methods: On the dorsum of 6 male pigs four full-thickness wounds (8???4?cm) were excised in each animal. Randomly the four defects were divided into 3 groups (FS 0.05?ml/cm2; FS 0.15?ml/cm2(Tisseel, Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria); Suture) and covered with autologous split thickness skin grafts. Outcome measurements included hematoma/seroma formation, graft dislocation, wound contraction, graft take rate and healed wound area. Observational time points were the 5th, 14th and 21st postoperative day.?Results: Hematoma formation on day of surgery was more pronounced in the suture group (FS 0.05?ml/cm2 vs. suture, p?<?0.05), similar the situation on the 5th postoperative day but without statistical significance. Graft dislocation revealed marked but not significant extended area in the suture group vs. the FS 0.05?ml/cm2 group. The FS 0.05?ml/cm2 graft take on day 5 was found to be enhanced in comparison to the suture group. Excellent wound healing was notable on final observation day in the FS 0.05?ml/cm2 group with a healed wound area of 99.7 (3.6/0.3). Corresponding values in the FS 0.15?ml/cm2 was 96.9 (4.7/2.1) and 95.9 (2.7/2.1) for the suture group. Values represents median (Q1/Q3). ?Conclusion: The application of a thin layer of FS (0.05?ml/cm2) in a low setting rate (4?5?IU thrombin) in split thickness skin transplantation via a spray device shows comparable results to those yielded with suture point fixation (surrogate for staples). Advantages are e.g. better cosmetic results and initial hemostasis with minimizing the incidence of early hematoma formation. Equal properties of manufactured low thrombin (4?IU; Canada) preparation vs. 500?IU (US) diluted to a 5?IU thrombin solution was also demonstrated.

AB  - Introduction: Adenoviral gene transfer of Angiopoietin-1 (AdAng1) recruits endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and improves diabetic wound healing. A suggested mechanism for EPC mobilization from the bone marrow (BM) is mediated through MMP-9 and stem cell factor (SCF). We hypothesize that Ang-1 recruits EPCs to diabetic wounds via an MMP-9 dependent mechanism. ?Methods: Lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with BM from transgenic TIE-2/LacZ mice. After engraftment, diabetes was induced with steptozotocin. 8?mm wounds were created in BM transplanted (BMT)(n?=?12) or MMP-9 knockout (KO)(n?=?12) mice and treated with 1???108 PFU of AdAng1, AdGFP or PBS. At 7 days wounds were analyzed for epithelial gap, vessel density, and EPCs. Serum levels of VEGF, proMMP9 and SCF were assessed. Data are expressed as mean?±?SEM ?Results: In diabetic BMT wounds, AdAng1 results in improved reepithelialization (Ang1 2.3?±?.2?mm; GFP 3.9?±?.2; PBS 4.0?±?.1 p?<?.0001) neovascularization (Ang1 6.8?±?.3Caps/Hpf; GFP 3.0?±?.4; PBS 2.9?±?.3 p?<?.0001) and EPC recruitment (Ang1 5.3?±?.4 EPCs/Hpf; GFP 2.1?±?.3; PBS 2.2?±?.3 p?<?.0001). AdAng1 treatment results in increased levels of proMMP-9 (Ang1 9.7?±?.8?ng/ml; GFP 6.3?±?.9; PBS 6.4?±?.4 p?<?.01) and SCF (Ang1 265?±?28?pg/ml; GFP 119?±?16; PBS159?±?12 p?<?.001). In MMP9 KO mice, AdAng1 accelerates reepithelialization (Ang1 3.2?±?.1?mm; GFP 4.1?±?.2; PBS 3.8?±?.2; p<.) but has no significant effect on neovascularization (Ang1 4.1?±?.5 Caps/HPF; GFP 3.9?±?.4; PBS 3.9?±?.6), EPC recruitment (Ang1 2?±?.3 EPC/Hpf; GFP 1.5?±?.3; PBS 1.6?±?.2) or SCF levels (Ang1 83?±?5?pg/ml; GFP 83?±?2; PBS 88?±?6). ?Conclusions: The effects of Ang-1 on EPC recruitment and neovascularization are dependent on MMP-9. Our data support the hypothesis that MMP-9 enables SCF to permit mobilization of EPCs.

AB  - At Ophidia Products, Inc. we have discovered Oxynor a synthetic therapeutic from snake venom for wound healing. The venom of Australian taipan snake (Oxyuranus s. scutellatus) is extremely potent due to the presence of taipoxin. The intact complex molecule of taipoxin having molecular weight 45.6?kDa is composed of three subunits α, ? and ?. Fractionation of crude venom by High pressure chromatography (HPLC) using ion exchange column permits separation of the subunits. The mitogenic activity was revealed in non toxic ? taipoxin. Non toxic ? taipoxin showed mitogenic activity on variety of eukaryotic cells. Its activity as a mitogen extended to wound healing in experimental animals. We identified the active domain for wound healing in ? taipoxin. after trypsin digestion were separated on HPLC, resolved into 11 different fragments. Each fragment was tested on PC12 cells to test mitogenic/neurotrophic activity. The fragment which showed the highest activity consisted of 21 amino acids. A synthetic peptide consisting of ten amino acids, from the N-terminal ?? was named Oxynor. Oxynor mimics the biological properties of natural ? taipoxin when tested in vitro and in vivo systems. The biological results showed that Oxynor was not toxic at the concentration of 100??g/ml for PC12 cells and 500??g/adult mouse. Oxynor was mitogenic to various eukaryotic cells. Oxynor is neurotrophic showing neurite outgrowth on PC12 cells. Growth of human skin fibroblast cells indicates that Oxynor has keratinous activity. Experimentally produced 4?mm punched wounds on the back of mice were treated with ? taipoxin 100??g/mouse or Oxynor at 500??g/mouse for seven consecutive days. The results showed complete closure of the wounds after six days while the wounds of control treated with PBS were open. Histology examination of the skin around the wounds revealed that treated mice showed re-epithelization of the epidermis, which looked close to the normal mouse skin biopsy. Whereas the controls showed distortion of epithelium. ? taipoxin and Oxynor were tested for in vivo at the concentration of 100??g/ml in hydrogel vehicle applied once daily to help heal 6?mm ischemic skin wounds in rats. At days 7 and 14 wound treated with ? taipoxin were about 15% smaller than the wounds treated with Oxynor. This shows that synthetic Oxynor is as efficacious as natural ? taipoxin under the conditions of the test. On increasing the concentration of Oxynor to 500??g/ml should give equivalent wound closure to 100??g/ml of ? taipoxin. In 1997 the US FDA approved for sale the first recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) for treatment of human non-healing wounds. Oxynor will be next therapeutic for wound healing Currently, Oxynor is in clinical trials, it has passed toxicity tests.

AB  - Fibroblast migration from the peri-wound collagenous stroma into the fibrin-laden wound is critical for granulation tissue formation and subsequent healing. Previously we found that fibroblast transmigration from a collagen matrix into a fibrin matrix required the presence of fibronectin (FN). Several cell surface receptors, namely integrins α4?1, α5?1 and αv?3 were also required for this invasive migration. Here we demonstrated that syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, known to bind FN at the highly cationic HepII domain is also required for fibroblast invasive migration of a fibrin/FN gel. This conclusion was based on fibroblast migration using two independent means of disrupting syndecan-4: heparinase degradation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans or suppression of syndecan-4 core protein with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Isolated syndecan-4 from these fibroblasts bound the Hep II recombinant constructs FN III12?15v?>?FN III12?15?>?FN III12?14 but did not bind the alternatively spliced IIICs (V) domain. Furthermore, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is required to stimulate fibroblast migration, markedly increased cell levels of syndecan-4 core protein in a time and dose dependent fashion. PDGF also induced up-regulation of syndecan-4 at transcriptional level as determined by RT-PCR. These results demonstrate that syndecan-4 is essential for fibroblast invasive migration into fibrin clot and that PDGF, the stimulus for migration, induces increased syndecan-4 core protein expression.

AB  - Introduction: Venous ulcers are the most common chronic wounds of the lower limbs. In our laboratory, the self-assembly method is used to reconstruct autologous skin that can be used as a biological dressing (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318; J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). Goals and Methods: The aim of this study was to establish if our self-assembled skin substitute (SASS) allows the closure of nonhealing venous leg ulcers. A case study of a 68-year-old woman with a chronic venous leg ulcer present for over one year and measuring 135?cm2 is thus herein presented. The autologous cells were isolated from a cutaneous biopsy (1?cm2) and cultivated in vitro(J Chem Eng, 2001: 79, 663). The autologous SASS was produced and assembled by the cells thus it does not contain any exogenous or synthetic material (In Vitro Cell Dev Bio Anim, 1999: 35, 318). The wound was debrided, covered with grafts of SASS and maintained in place with a compressive dressing (Coban, 3M, St-Paul, MN). A new SASS was applied weekly until wound closure. The SASS seemed to lessen the pain caused by the ulcer. Seven applications of the SASS were necessary to lead to a full wound closure. Conclusion: Venous leg ulcer quickly reepithelialized after application of our SASS This case indicates that use of the SASS can reduce pain and promote closure of nonhealing leg ulcers Furthermore, we thus hope that our SASS biological dressing maybe clinically useful to treat difficult-to-heal leg ulcers. This study was approved by the Health Canada?s Therapeutic Products Directorate and by the Ethic Committee of the CHAUQ, Saint-Sacrement Hospital.

AB  - The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on soft tissue are not well characterized. This study utilized a diabetic wound model to examine the effects of PEMF effects on soft tissue healing. Methods: Wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db and wild type C57BL6 mice. Mice were exposed to PEMF (4.5?ms pulse/15?hz) for 8?hrs/day for 14 days. Gross closure was assessed with digital analysis of area changes over time. Histological examination assessed granulation and epithelial gap, cell proliferation (BrdU), and endothelial cell density (CD31). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated in the presence or absence of PEMF for 8?hrs and VEGF/FGF2 was measured in culture supernatants by ELISA. Results: Mice exposed to PEMF had accelerated wound closure at day 7 (wound area as % of original, db/db: 60%(PEMF) vs. 78%(control), C57BL6: 15% vs. 42%, p?<?0.05) and day 14 (db/db: 21% vs. 55%, C57BL6: 8% vs. 28%, p?<?0.05), with increased granulation and cell proliferation (db/db day 7: 52?±?8 vs. 31?±?5 cells/HPF (200x)). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed significantly higher CD31 density in wounds exposed to PEMF at day 7 (vessels/HPF, db/db: 28?±?4 vs. 17?±?4, C57BL6: 41?±?7 vs. 28?±?6) and day 14 (db/db: 32?±?6 vs. 21?±?5, C57BL6: 48?±?5 vs. 40?±?5). HUVECs in PEMF exhibited 5-fold higher levels of FGF2 compared to controls after 30?min (20.50?pg/ml?±?6.75 vs. 4.25?pg/ml?±?0.75), with no change in VEGF through 8?hrs. Conclusions: PEMF accelerates closure time and endothelial cell proliferation in wound healing. Upregulation of FGF2 in HUVECs exposed to PEMF suggests that release of angiogenic growth factors may explain increased vascular density and accelerated wound closure. Clinical uses include treatment for diabetic ulcers and other non-healing wounds. This work is supported in part by the Alumni Fund, Alumni Association of SUNY Downstate College of Medicine (MJC).

AB  - A critical limitation of using retroviral vectors for gene therapy is their inability to infect non-dividing cells. Although, the adenoviral vectors have the advantage of being able to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, they elicit inflammatory response, thus making the interpretation of in vivo experiments harder. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral vectors do not have those limitations, however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. To determine if low-oxygen microenvironment affects viral vector-mediated gene transfection, we have used two other viral vectors, Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentiviral constructs in vitro and in vivo to express foreign genes in hypoxic cultured human dermal fibroblasts and ischemic rat wounds. Both cultured normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) human dermal fibroblasts were identically transfected by the AAV vector. A lenti6-LacZ construct was injected onto the periphery of rat ischemic and non-ischemic wound (106 pfu/wound) at the time of wounding. Wounds were harvested at post-operative day 7. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with a in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed without any inflammatory response. No significant difference of transfection efficiency was observed between the ischemic and non-ischemic wounds. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and Lentiviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in both ischemic and non-ischemic cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Introduction: Fetal mouse skin wounds heal without scar before gestational day E17. Because scarless repair is inherent to fetal skin and occurs superimposed on skin differentiation, genome-wide gene expression during skin development was tested. Methods: Dorsal skin from BALB/C mice fetuses at E14, E15, E18 and E20 was collected. RNAs from individual fetuses were hybridized to mouse microarrays with 42,000 gene elements. The E14/E18 hybridizations were repeated three times, and the E15/E20 repeated twice with different samples. (?x??=?fold change). Results: Increased genes on E18 and E20 were clustered into several groups: 1) ECMs: type I (2.8x), III (2.3x), VI, and XIV procollagens; 2) Cell surface: integrin beta1 binding protein2 (5.2x), integral membrane protein2A and 2B (avg 3.8x); 3) Proteases: mast cell protease4 (15x) and 5 (24x), MMP23 (3x); 4) Growth factor-related: acidic FGF (3.7x), FGF receptor3 (2.9x), TGF-alpha (2.3x). Decreased genes on E18 and E20 included: 1) Growth factors: TGF-beta2 (0.42x), PDGF-alpha (0.41x), PDGF receptor-beta (0.37x), NGF receptor associated protein (0.18x); 2) Proteases: MMP 11 (0.27x), 14 (0.39x); 3) ECM: fibromodulin (0.5x), Vcam1 (0.22x), keratin18 (0.2x) and 19 (0.46x), collagen XVIII (0.36x). Conclusions: Genes with increased expression at E14, E15 and decreased expression at E18, E20 have possible antifibrotic function. These data identify hundreds of possible anti-fibrotic and pro-fibrotic genes as candidates for further functional analysis as regulators of repair. Supported by NIH DE00463?03

AB  - Bone marrow cells have been used to potentiate wound healing in chronic wounds (Badiavas and Falanga, 2003). We postulate that the performance of these autografted cells may be enhanced by seeding them into scaffolding with normal skin architecture; indeed that the differentiation of the precursor cells may be determined by the juxtaposition of intact extracellular matrix. This might in turn lead to a prefabricated skin substitute capable of recapitulating fully functional skin. We are seeding murine gfp+ bone marrow cells, containing mixed mesenchymal and hematopoietic precursor cells into Alloderm?, a decellularized preserved skin graft. This seeding is potentiated by meshing the skin and gentle centrifugation of fresh marrow into the dermal aspect of the allograft. Other samples were merely co-cultured with the cells in Dexter?s media. Duplicate samples were fixed and stained with DAPI at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Viewed under fluorescence, gfp+ cells are bright green.Comparing these images with DAPI-staining allows viable cells to be identified which are gfp+. H the spindle shape suggests a fibroblast (Fig 2). In addition, the population of gfp+ cells has markedly expanded by day 14, attaining near confluence in some sections (Fig 3). No cells were seen in controls (Fig 4). Conclusion: True skin replacement will only be possible when the panoply of skin appendages can be recapitulated. The experiments presented here are evidence that pluripotential precursor cells can be seeded into dermal matrices providing an optimal environment for regeneration. 1 2 3 4

AB  - Background: Over the last two decades, there have been a number of studies in Europe on contact sensitivity in patients with chronic leg ulcerations with a frequency of positive patch test results ranging from 40 to 82.5%. The prevalence of sensitization has not been studied in North America. Furthermore, many of the newer dressings and wound care products in the market have not been studied for contact sensitivity in patients with chronic wounds. Objectives: 1) To determine the prevalence of allergen sensitivity in patients with history of leg ulcers in two North American study centers, 2) to compare our results to the European studies and to the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) database and 3) to help delineate a standard battery of allergens for patch testing in North American leg ulcer patients Methods: 54 patients with an active or past leg ulcer were prospectively entered in the study. The patients were patch tested to both the NACDG Standard series, as well as, a comprehensive supplemental series of 48 allergens including wound care medicaments and dressings. Results: 63% of patients were sensitized to at last one allergen. The most common allergens were Balsam of Peru (29.6%), bacitracin (24.1%), fragrance mix (20.4%), wood tar mix (20.4%), propylene glycol (13.5%), neomycin sulfate (13%), benzalkonium chloride (13%), carba mix (11.1%), nickel sulfate (11.1%) and Duoderm CGF (11.1%). Duoderm CGF was the most allergenic dressing in our study group. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of positive patch tests in patients with past or current leg ulcerations. Using a modified leg ulcer series along with the standard NACDG series is very important in evaluating patients with leg ulcers.

AB  - Transforming growth factor ?(TGF?) has both positive and negative effects on cutaneous wound healing. Smad7 acts as a major downstream antagonist of TGF? signaling in keratinocytes and its role in wound healing has not been defined. We have established a Smad7 transgenic mouse line using a keratin 5 (K5) promoter (K5.Smad7) which expresses Smad7 transgene at a mild level (?2 fold of the endogenous Smad7 in the skin). These mice did not have overt skin defects as shown from our previous Smad7 transgenic mice expressing much higher levels of the Smad7 transgene (EMBO J 2002, 21:2580?90). K5.Smad7 mice from the above low expressor line and non-transgenic littermates were subject to 6-mm full-thickness excisional wounding. K5.Smad7 mice exhibited early scab rejection, reduced inflammation, and accelerated re-epithelialization as compared to non-transgenic mice. To further determine the stage-specific effects of Smad7 on wound healing, we generated a transgenic model in which Smad7 transgene expression can be induced in the epidermis and hair follicles (gene-switch-Smad7) by topically RU486 application. Smad7 induction from day 3 to day 7 after excisional wounding reduced inflammatory responses through suppressing expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in gene-switch-Smad7 mice as compared to control mice. Meanwhile, overexpression of Smad7 exhibited accelerated re-epithelialization, which correlated with increased expression of metalloproteinases and elevated Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signaling in the leading epidermal edges in gene-switch-Smad7 wounds compared to control wounds. Smad7 induction from day 7 to day 20 after excisional wounding reduced dermal fibrotic response and angiogenesis in the dermis, resulting in a better tissue repair. We conclude that the effectsof Smad7 on wound healing are likely due to blocking the negative effects of TGF? on cutaneous wound healing.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), is a non-classical HLA class I molecule. Over the past few years, HLA-G has been considered as a tolerogenic antigen and a tissue protective molecule in inflammatory diseases. Objectives: This study was performed to analyze HLA-G expression in pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients and to assess its possible anti-inflammatory role in skin disorders. Methods: With observing ethical issues, skin biopsies from 4 normal subjects and 3 PV patients were prepared. The epidermal layer of these biopsies was separated using Dispase enzyme treatment. After trypsinization, single cell suspensions of keratinocytes were cultured in MCDB-153 serum-free medium. Three weeks supernatants were collected and applied for a sandwich ELISA to detect total soluble isoforms of HLA-G antigen. Two species of antibodies used for ELISA were made in our laboratory, i.e. anti-HLA-G polyclonal and 5E6H7 monoclonal. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed for pan HLA-G transcript to assess the regulation level of HLA-G expression. Results: The data on ELISA experiments showed significant HLA-G expression by PV kertainocytes (p?<?0.001). No traces of HLA-G production were seen in normal cells. RT-PCR revealed, however, variation in HLA-G mRNA expression. These findings indicate that regulation of HLA-G gene might occur both at transcriptional and translational levels. Conclusions: Collectively, our data show the presence, and hence, advocate the possible protective contribution of HLA-G isoforms in skin inflammatory processes.

AB  - Background: Physiological healing in acute wounds generally occurs by granulation from the wound base and by migration of epithelium from the wound edges toward the center of the wound in a uniform, concentric fashion. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) compared this phenomenon in acute wounds treated with standard care versus acute wounds pharmacologically stimulated with growth factor therapy. Methods: With informed consent, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies of the flexor surface of both forearms. The biopsy sites were randomly assigned to a control arm (daily bacitracin) or to one of three treatment arms: i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel Q.D., ii) rhPDGF-BB Q.O.D., iii) daily rhPDGF-BB (Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone daily). Wound morphology was carefully examined and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Results: There were distinct differences in the morphological pattern of healing seen between control wounds and growth factor-stimulated wounds. Acute wounds treated with bacitracin tended to heal in circumferential fashion, as predicted. Growth factor-stimulated wounds, by contrast, exhibited accentuated angiogenesis (granulation), with non-uniform epithelial islands streaming into the wound. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that rhPDGF-BB influences acute wound healing by promoting accelerated granulation and epithelialization. Accelerated healing is manifest by different healing morphologies. The biological basis for these differences requires further histological and molecular analyses.
