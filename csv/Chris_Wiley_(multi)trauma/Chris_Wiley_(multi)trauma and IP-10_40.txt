AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) transiently expresses in acute wound. In non-healed wounds, MMP-9 together with other proteinases persistently elevate, which may lead excessive ECM degradation and failure of wound closure. To understand the molecular regulation of MMP-9 we investigated the signal transduction for TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9 by dermal fibroblasts. TNF-alpha initiates three major signal pathways including NF-11B, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. On the other hand, Rho-GTPase plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, angiogenesis, and mitosis. It remains unknown if the ?cross talk? of these signals having a role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study we found that over expression of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) specifically attenuates TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-9. However, TNF-alpha mediated induction of MMP-3 and proMMP-2 activation was intact. NF-?B signal is regarded as a common pathway for many MMPs. Indeed, PAK did not affect TNF-alpha mediated degradation of Ikappa B, suggesting additional signal is targeted by PAK. In contrast, MMP-3 but not MMP-9 expression is specifically blocked by p38 MAK. Thus TNF-alpha induced expression of multiple MMPs in wound healing may utilize different intracellular signal pathways.

AB  - Research on abnormal scarring, such as excessive scars, has been hampered by the lack of relevant animal models. Recent studies suggest that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 are stimulators of fibrosis or scarring. We developed a rabbit ear cutaneous excessive scarring model using the growth factor stimulators TGF-?1 (0.25, 0.5 or 1??g per wound), PDGF-BB (1, 2 or 3??g per wound) and FGF-2 (0.5, 1, 3 or 5??g per wound). Three 8-mm diameter wounds were created on each ear in NZW rabbits (n?=?6 wounds). The test growth factors were injected intradermally immediately after wounding. Controls consisted of PBS, BSA and wounding only without injections. Scar thickness of wounds was measured with a micrometer at days 14 and continued twice a week thereafter until sacrifice at day 28. Results showed that the greatest measurement of elevated scars was observed at day 14. Significant differences of scar thickness were observed in TGF-?1 at a dose of 0.25??g, PDGF-BB at a dose of 3??g, and FGF-2 at a dose of 3??g per wound groups when compared to PBS and wounding only groups (p?<?0.05). Interestingly, BSA, a protein stabilizer for TGF-?1 and FGF-2 proteins, also significantly elevated scar thickness at day 14 over PBS alone (p?<?0.05). Trichrome stained tissue sections on day 28 showed an increase in cellularity and thicker epithelium in all doses of TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 protein treated groups when compared to wounding only, PBS or BSA treatments. In general, FGF-2 treated wounds showed more vascularity than TGF-?1 and PDGF-BB treated wounds. By contrast, PDGF-BB treated wounds showed richer collagen deposition than TGF-?1 and FGF-2 treated wounds. Results from these studies demonstrated that TGF-?1, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 contributed to the scar formation in the rabbit ear scar model. BSA may contribute in stimulating scar formation in the early stage of wound healing in this model. Enhancing elevated scar formation in the rabbit ear model will be useful in evaluating anti-scarring agents for excessive scars such as hypertrophic scars and keloids.

AB  - Many silver-dressings have been recently developed to prevent infection of burn and chronic wounds. Antimicrobial therapies are usually studied in in-vitro assays, which evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy against free-floating bacteria. In a wound environment bacteria attach to tissues and establish bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are communities of colonies of bacteria and other microorganisms encased in a self produced exopolymeric substance. Biofilms help protect the bacteria from the environment and limit the effectiveness of antimicrobials. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of two silver dressings to eradicate biofilm-associated and planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells using our biofilm burn wound animal model. Three pigs were used in this study. Second-degree burn wounds were made on one-half of the animal?s back and inoculated with a burn wound isolate of P. aeruginosa. These wounds were then covered for 72 hours with a polyurethane dressing to allow biofilm formation. After 72 hours, additional burn wounds were made on the unwounded half of the animal. The new burns were then inoculated with the same P. aeruginosa strain. At this 72 hour point we had established two bacterial groups, one side of the animal had burns with planktonic bacteria and the other half with biofilm bacteria. Both sides of the animal were treated 20 minutes after inoculation of the planktonic group with the following dressings: 1) Nanocrystalline Silver, 2) Hydrocolloid Silver, or 3) untreated. Wounds were cultured from all treatment groups at 24, 48 and 72 hours post treatment. Sites were cultured quantitatively using a novel flush-scrub technique to obtain both planktonic and biofilm bacterial counts. The baseline biofilm bacterial count was 7.56 LogCFU/ml (prior to treatment). The hydrocolloid dressing significantly reduced planktonic bacteria counts as compared to untreated and nanocrystalline silver dressing at 24, 48 and 72 hours. However, biofilm bacteria counts for both dressings were similar to untreated control at all sample points. Our study demonstrates that both silver dressings showed limited effect against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated cells when compared to untreated wounds. Based on our results we question the effectiveness of silver dressings for infected wounds that are colonized with biofilm associated-cells. We conclude that anti-biofilm susceptibility models may improve on current antimicrobial sensitivity assays.

AB  - Biofilms are a combination of microorganisms and extrapolysaccharide matrices. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that biofilms are present in both acute and chronic wounds. Once biofilms are established, phagocytosis and diffusion of antibiotics are impaired thus contributing to antimicrobial resistance due to increased bacterial virulence. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of two topical antimicrobial agents on partial thickness wounds containing Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. All wounds were inoculated with 106?CFU/ml and covered for 48 hrs under a polyurthene film to promote biofilm formation. Wounds were divided into three treatment groups; triple antibiotic ointment (Polymyxin B sulfate, bacitracin zinc, neomycin), mupirocin cream and untreated control. Wounds were treated twice daily. Wounds were cultured for bacterial quantitation at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120?hrs. Significant reduction in CFU/ml was observed only after several days of treatments. This finding supports the antimicrobial resistance that occurs when bacteria live within biofilms. Our previous studies demonstrated that both of these agents were able to completely eliminate planktonic S. aureus(106) at the early time points. This study demonstrates that when bacterial biofilms are established in wounds there is a longer response time for topical antimicrobial activity suggesting bacterial resistance.

AB  - The inflammatory events of atherosclerosis involve monocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and several cytokines, including chemokines. Atherosclerosis begins with recruitment of circulating monocytes to sites of blood vessel injury. In the vessel wall, these cells are activated to become macrophages that scavenge toxic material such as oxidized LDL and transition into ?foam cells? which will eventually lead to plaque formation. Tobacco smoke is known to exacerbate cardiovascular disease but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known. The chemokine MCP-1 is involved in recruiting monocytes to the injured blood vessel wall and is commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. Our data show that both ?first-hand? and ?second-hand? cigarette smoke stimulate MCP-1 production in cultured primary human aortic endothelial cells (EC), suggesting that cigarette smoke may contribute to plaque formation by stimulating aortic EC to produce MCP-1 in blood vessels after smoke injury. To test whether MCP-1 links smoking and cardiovascular disease, we are studying the expression of this molecule in mice that are either transgenic for human ApoB or are null for MCP-1 or its receptor, CCR2, by exposing the mice to smoke in a way that closely resembles human smoking. Blood samples from the mice were tested for carboxyhemoglobin, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and MCP-1 at successive weeks after initiation of smoking and the aortas isolated to analyze for plaque size and MCP-1 expression in the tissue. The carboxyhemoglobin test shows that the mice are exposed to smoke. Plasma MCP-1 and HDL levels are reduced in the smoking groups, whereas LDL, triglyceride, and total cholesterol remain unchanged. On one hand, the decrease in circulating HDL levels suggests that the reason smokers develop atherosclerosis may be because the rate of cholesterol clearance is slowed down. On the other hand, a decrease in circulating MCP-1 level may reflect that this chemokine accumulates in blood vessel walls, conferring stronger ability for attraction of monocytes. This work is supported by TRDRP and Phillip Morris.

AB  - Introduction: Hypertrophic scar is a devastating sequel to burns and other tangential skin injuries. It follows deep dermal injuries and does not occur after superficial injuries. Nitric oxide (NO) plays many important roles in wound healing from inflammation to scar remodeling. Studies have shown that expression of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production are decreased in human hypertrophic scar. However little is known about NO involvement in the early stages of hypertrophic scarring, because of the lack of an animal model. It was recently reported that the female red Duroc pig (FRDP) makes thick scar, which is similar to human hypertrophic scar. We hypothesized that NO production in wounds on the female, red Duroc pig is similar to that of human hypertrophic scar and that NO involvement in deep wounds is different from that in superficial wounds. Methods: Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of four FRDPs. Biopsies were collected at weeks 1.5, 4, 8 and 21 post wounding including samples of uninjured skin. Nitric oxide levels were measured with the Griess reaction assay and normalized with tissue protein level. Results: Superficial wounds healed with an invisible scar whereas the deep wounds healed with scar resembling mild hypertrophic scar. The thickness of the scars from the deep wounds was significantly greater than uninjured skin and healed superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). NO levels were increased at 1.5 weeks in deep wounds compared to superficial wounds and uninjured skin (p?<?0.05). At 8 weeks, NO levels in deep wounds had returned to the level of uninjured tissue and superficial wounds. By 21 weeks, NO levels had decreased significantly when compared to superficial wounds (p?<?0.01). There were no differences in NO levels between uninjured skin and superficial wounds at any time point (p?>?0.05). Conclusions: NO production is similar in late, deep wounds on the female, red Duroc pig to that reported in the literature for human hypertrophic scar further validating this animal model. NO production is quite different after deep wounds as compared to superficial wounds in the FRDP. Early elevation in nitric oxide production might account for excessive inflammation in deep wounds that become thick scars in the FRDP. Nitric oxide regulators and effects at early stages of scar formation should be elucidated further and the FRDP appears to be a useful model.

AB  - Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing soft tissue infection that often leaves patients with a large integumentary deficit to their penis and scrotum. Treatment of the skin defect has been described in a multitude of ways including split thickness skin grafting, burying the testes in the thighs, thigh flaps, and a variety of myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Many of the previously described techniques have worked well for smaller defects and for closure of wounds but fell short of aesthetic reconstruction of sexual organs. We describe a technique using split-thickness skin grafts with suction dressings or bolster. This was employed using the VAC?(Vacuum Assisted Closure Device, KCI?). This technique creates a natural appearing scrotum that holds the testes away from the body in a physiologic manner and surfaces the penis with a seemingly natural appearance in a functional manner. The technique provides a nearly 100% graft take and greatly decreases hospital length of stay. A case report demonstrates a patient?s full recovery to his professional, social, and sexual life within six weeks of initial reconstructive treatment. Our technique provides a reliable treatment with good functional and aesthetic outcomes to a difficult problem.

AB  - Celosia argentea is used in traditional medicine for sores, ulcers, and skin eruptions. Therefore, we investigated the healing efficiency of an ointment formulated on a alcohol extract of Celosia argentea leaves (CA) in a rat burn wound model. Wound closure occurred earlier in the treated rats (15 days versus 30 in the untreated group; P?<?0.05). Collagen and hexsoamine content of the granulation tissue increased at a faster rate in the treated wounds. To probe the cell biologic basis of this effect, we found that this extract promoted cell motility and proliferation of primary dermal fibroblasts but did not alter these responses in primary keratinocytes. In short, we demonstrate a salutary action of the Celosia argentea extract on wound healing and suggest that this may be due to mitogenic and motogenic promotion of dermal fibroblasts.

AB  - Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) constitute 5?10% of all cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and are usually considered mimics of melanocytic proliferations rather than fibrous lesions. We report two cases of pigmented fibrous proliferations that demonstrate features of both dermatofibromas and DFSP. The first case is a 19-year-old man with a three year history of a slowly growing pigmented lesion on the right arm. On clinical exam the lesion was a 7?mm firm pigmented papulonodular lesion. The second case is a 31-year-old woman with a 4?5 year history of a slowly enlarging, asymptomatic ?dark area? on the right buttock. On clinical exam the lesion is a 2?cm darkly pigmented flat nodule. Morphologically both lesions are primarily dermal proliferations of spindled cells admixed with pigmented dendritic melanocytes. The lesional cells trap collagen fibers at the periphery and there is basal cell hyperpigmentation. Adnexal structures are effaced but significant trapping of subcutaneous fat is not present. By immunohistochemistry both lesions show focal CD34 positivity but are negative for Factor XIIIa and melanocytic markers. Although overlap between dermatofibromas and DFSP is well documented in the literature, pigmented fibrous lesions with features of both entities are not well described.

He also reported seeing ?dark spots? at night. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced and appeared smaller than his age. The skin examination revealed numerous 2?8?mm follicular, keratotic papules on the extensor surfaces of the patient?s arms and legs. H&E preparation of the skin biopsy revealed distention of the upper portion of the follicles with prominent keratotic plugging, as well as focal follicular perforation and acute inflammation. Laboratory examination revealed a vitamin A level of 11, carotene level of less than 2, and retinol binding protein of 2.1. The patient was diagnosed with phrynoderma and initiated on vitamin A therapy. After a two-months course of vitamin A therapy, his serum vitamin A increased to 67, and he had dramatic improvement of the follicular eruption. This is a fascinating case of phrynoderma in a child with biliary dysfunction. The presence of perforating folliculitis on histology is curious, as there are less than 10 documented cases of perforating folliculitis in phrynoderma. This case illustrates the intriguing clinical and pathological presentations of phrynoderma.

AB  - Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, characterised by recurrent crops of necrotic self-healing papules and nodules. Although chronic, LyP typically has a benign clinical course in the majority of cases. Histologically, a malignant appearing T-cell lymphoid infiltrate is seen. The atypical cells often resemble the cerebriform cells of mycosis fungoides or Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately 10?20% of the patients go on to develop lymphomas, including mycosis fungoides, CD30-positive anaplastic large cell and Hodgkin lymphoma. We report a case of LyP associated with a B-cell lymphoma. A 50-year-old male, presented with scattered erythematous scaly papules, some with central crust, located on the arms, trunk and leg of one-month duration. A skin biopsy revealed a polymorphous infiltrate with many large atypical lymphocytes, resembling Reed Sternberg cells. By immunohistochemistry, the large cells were positive for T-cell markers and CD30. Subsequently, he developed fever, night sweats and diffuse lymphadenopathy. A lymph node biopsy showed a vaguely nodular proliferation of small to medium lymphocytes. Immunophenotypic and flow cytometric studies best characterised the process as mantle cell lymphoma. Although, LyP has been previously associated with lymphomas of above-mentioned types, this is an extremely unusual case presenting with a low-grade B-cell lymphoma.

AB  - Hyaline globules (HG) are frequently found in neoplastic cells of Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS). Presence of HG, characteristic of but not specific of KS, has been considered to represent erythrophagocytosis. In order to further characterize the nature of HG, we studied 10 cases of cutaneous KS with distinct HG using immunohistochemistry for hemoglobin A, Kappa and Lambda. All KS cases were of nodular type. Also included were 3 cases of glomeruloid hemangioma with similar HG in endothelial cells for the comparision. In selected cases electron microscopic examination was performed. PAS stain with diastase digestion was also done in all cases. Results: HG were diastase resistant and PAS positive. All HG in neoplastic cells of KS and endothelial cells of GH were negative for hemoglobin A. There was variable staining for light chains: focal but strong positivity for kappa, weak and variable staining for Lambda. Some HG was positive for both kappa and lambda. Electron microscopic study demonstrated HG as homogeneous electron dense inclusions with internal small vacuoles, whorled or granular materials. Conclusions: All HG in neoplastic cells and endothelial cells of GH represent phagolysosomes. Negative stain for hemoglobin A in KS and GH do not support the inclusions being fragmented RBC?s.

AB  - Cutaneous plexiform schwannoma is a rare multilobulated variant of benign schwannoma. When presenting as the cellular subtype with significantly increased proliferative rate, diagnostic consideration of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is prompted. However, follow up demonstrates a benign natural history with propensity for local recurrence and typical lack of association with neurocutaneous syndromes. These lesions most commonly occur as cutaneous and subcutaneous masses of the extremities in the first four decades. Only 9 cases of congenital tumors are reported. A case of congenital plexiform cellular schwannoma, presenting as a cutaneous mass measuring 3.5???2.5???2.0?cm, excised from the left upper arm of a 16 month old female is discussed. Regions of increased cellularity and proliferation co-localized and were unassociated with nuclear anaplasia. Mitotic figures numbered 7 per 10 400x fields. The tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive for S-100 protein. The MIB-1index was multifocally 25% and p53 protein over expression was present in 50% of nuclei. Following excision with free margins the tumor locally recurred after 16 months. The recurrence was morphologically identical to the original lesion. Recognition of the clinical and morphological characteristics of this rarely encountered benign neoplasm will facilitate in diagnosing this entity.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.

This definition is acceptable for in-vitro research but a clear definition for biofilm-associated diseases has yet to be elucidated. A structural/morphological definition is currently used to define biofilms; additionally, physiological or molecular criteria will allow us to define biofilms in disease infection accurately. Our objective over the past several years has been to characterize and observe bacterial biofilms in wound infections using different wound models. To broaden our current understanding of biofilm morphology in wounds for this study we used epifluorescent and light microscopy to visualize wound pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in a porcine partial thickness infection model. Three experimental animals were used for this study. After animal preparation, partial thickness wounds were created on the backs of 3 animals. Wounds were then inoculated with 106 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and covered for 48 hours to allow bacteria to colonize and infect the wound. Biopsies were obtained from normal skin, wounds before inoculation, wounds at 48 hours and wounds 48 hours after inoculation. Biopsies were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin for light microscopy and Calcofluor White and Ethidium Bromide for epifluorescence microscopy. Images obtained using epifluorescent and light microscopy demonstrate that bacteria form aggregates of microcolonies. These structures are representative of bacterial biofilms and support the hypothesis that bacteria live as biofilms in wound infection. Although currently there is no established and accepted definition for biofilm associated diseases, we anticipate that more studies looking into physiological changes of these structures will clarify our current understanding of wound infection and treatment.

AB  - There is a wide spectrum of treatment modalities to manage hypertrophic scars, techniques like surgical excision, intralesional application of corticosteroids, pressure therapy or laser therapy are extensively used. From a cosmetic and physiological point of view scars are predominantly a concern of the patients, the cosmetic relevance for doctors is often of less importance. Therefore a treatment that can be performed by the patient her-/himself might be advantageous if it is efficacious and safe. Since the early 1980s so-called ?silicone gel sheeting? has been a widely used safe clinical management option for hypertrophic scars and keloids. The principle of the latter treatment has now been adapted and optimised towards a specific easily applicable adhesive polyurethane patch. This breathable, hypoallergenic patch is very well tolerated and avoids ? in contrast to silicone sheets ? moisture accumulation on the skin. Several clinical studies on both mature scars and on scar formation after surgical incisions show a reduction in visibility, redness, and roughness of the scars. The recommended eight weeks treatment might even be interrupted daily for twelve hours; the scar reducing effect is achieved as well. Extensive investigations on the polyurethane patch in vivo and in vitro propose an improved remodelling process of the scar tissue due to thermal and pressure effects of the patch but not by stratum corneum hydration. In vivo a better microcirculation can be observed in the scar tissue after treatment and in vitro an activation of enzymes involved in the remodelling process can be measured. In summary, physical effects are likely to be responsible for the successful results in clinical studies and individual applications of the new polyurethane patch for the reduction of hypertrophic scars.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the development of wound dressings that possess functionality beyond providing physical protection and optimal moisture environment. To this end, a novel dressing material based on a sulfonated-hydrocarbon backbone has been developed for the controlled release of therapeutic agents into chronic wounds. This versatile polymer possesses an ion-exchange capability that makes it amenable for binding and releasing a variety of potential agents. Polymer backbone was coated onto polyester fabric and then modified by ion exchange to incorporate Na+, Ag+, or doxycycline onto the polymer. The ability of several formulations of this hydrocarbon backbone product to sequester elastase and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) was then examined. Wound fluids containing elastase and MMP-8 were obtained from pooled wound fluids obtained from consented patients with pressure ulcers. Equivalent weights of product formulations were incubated for 2?4 hours at 25?°C with the wound fluids and then the remaining activities of elastase and MMP-8 determined using specific substrates (methoxysuucinyl-ala-ala-pro-val-p-nitroanilide and collagen type I respectively). Untreated polyester fabric served as a control and weight equivalents of gauze and Promogran? were also included for the purposes of comparison. The average reduction in apparent elastase activity in the wound fluid was 4%, 20.4%, 14%, 29%, and 55% for gauze, Promogran?, doxycycline, Ag+, and Na+ formulations respectively. Only Promogran? and the doxycycline formulation affected a decrease in apparent collagenolytic activity. These preliminary results provide evidence in support of the versatility of these new biomaterials for the controlled modulation of the chronic wound environment.

AB  - Background: Physiological differences between dominant and non-dominant arms may play an important role in wound healing of the upper extremities. The Wound Healing Cooperative Group (WHCG) studied this phenomenon in a human forearm model of acute wound healing. Methods: With informed consent, sixteen normal healthy volunteers underwent four 6?mm biopsies on the flexor surface of both forearms: 2 biopsies on the dominant arm, and 2 on the non-dominant arm. The acute wound sites were then treated with i) rhPDGF-BB 0.01% gel topically at various dosing intervals (Q.D. versus Q.O.D.), ii) rhPDGF-BB alone Q.D.???7 days followed by bacitracin alone, or iii) bacitracin alone. Time-to-complete healing was measured as the primary endpoint. Results: The average time-to-complete healing for the dominant arm was shorter than the time required to heal the biopsies on the non-dominant arm, irregardless of the treatment applied. Conclusion: In the forearm biopsy model of acute wound healing, arm dominance is an independent variable and must considered in study designs. We postulate that this effect may be due to variation in microvascular perfusion. These results provoke further investigation into the physiological mechanisms underlying increased rate of healing in the dominant extremity.

AB  - Maththaan thailam, the Datura leaf juice is traditionally used for healing of wounds and related ailments in India. However, the scientific validity of the thailam has not been explored in the literatures. In the present study, the efficacy of maththaan thailam on healing of three types of wounds namely Open, Burn and Diabetic wound in animal models has been studied. Healing pattern and biochemical characterization of granulation tissue were assessed over the healing periods. Studies were more concentrated on to evaluate the change in the matrix metallo proteinase profile in the three different types of wound with respect to the applied thailam. Further supports were also expected from the antioxidant levels and histopathological examination of granulation tissue. It has been observed that among the three types of wounds, delayed healing was observed with diabetic wound. Complete healing of 2???2?cm2 wound size was achieved only after 22 days, whereas burn and open wound took only 16 and 9 days for complete closure. Further, MMP?s profile also showed a variation in the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 with respect to healing property. Biochemical and histochemical results and the antioxidant levels are highly correlated with the healing property irrespective of the wounds
