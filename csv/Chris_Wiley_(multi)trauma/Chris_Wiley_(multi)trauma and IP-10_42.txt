AB  - Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory condition of the skin and muscles, and an underlying malignancy is noted in 10% or more of cases. Clinical features of dermatomyositis include increasing general fatigue and proximal (thighs and shoulders) muscle weakness accompanied by erythematous lesions of the skin. There have been several distinct types of dermatomyositis described. Here we describe a case of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis, which is a rare variant of dermatomyositis. A 49-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a painful erythematous vesicular eruption of the face, trunk and extremities. In addition, edema of the face and fever were observed. Clinically, dermatomyositis was considered because of typical skin rashes (Gottron?s papules, periorbital heliotrope rash and poikiloderma) and serum creatine phosphokinase level of 1,031 IU/L. A skin biopsy was performed. Microscopically, subepidermal vesiculation with marked edema was present. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was also observed in the upper dermis. So far only a few case reports of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis have been reported in the literature. It should be kept in mind that dermatomyositis may present subepidermal vesiculation in order to avoid a misdiagnosis and unnecessary delayed treatment. Furthermore, an internal malignancy should be considered in such a variant of dermatomyositis.

AB  - Abstract The transplantation of neural progenitors or stem cells has been attempted for several decades, in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS), to repair tissue damage or cell degeneration. In most circumstances the success of cell replacement in the brain depends on the capability to rewire precisely patterned connections. Several concurrent factors determine the outcome and efficacy of this approach, including the intrinsic properties of donor progenitors, the environmental cues provided by the recipient environment, and the complexity and precision of the connection patterns that must be restored in order to recover adaptive function. In this chapter, some major concepts concerning these issues are reviewed, with special attention being paid to studies involving neural transplantation in the rodent cerebellum and in animal models of cerebellar disorders. These approaches are considered the most suitable for the design and testing of cell-based therapeutic approaches aimed at reconstructing specific connections in point-to-point circuits.

AB  - We present the findings of a rare and very aggressive primary skin tumor, composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumor (CERT) with features of rhabdomyosarcoma. Clinical history: A 53-year-old woman presented with a 2.5?cm ulcerated nodule on her right medial calf. On exam, she also exhibited inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pathology: Fine needle aspiration of a lymph node and punch biopsy of the skin nodule disclosed an epithelioid cell morphology with rhabdoid cells, solid growth, and a high mitotic rate (>70 figures/10 HPF). Upon wide excision of the tumor, electron microscopy (EM) and special stains were performed. Since the differential diagnosis was broad, a large number of stains were performed: tumor was positive for vimentin, desmin, muscle specific actin, WT-1, CD56, and CD10, and negative for S-100, melan A, cytokeratins, EMA, CD34, fast myosin, myoglobin, myogenin, myoD1, smooth muscle actin, and NSE. EM revealed rhabdoid cells with perinuclear globules of intermediate filaments corresponding to the positive desmin stain. Summary: The patient was treated with chemotherapy without regression of presumed lung metastases. The CERT is a rare, aggressive tumor that extraordinarily presents as a primary skin tumor. The differential is broad and nomenclature confusing. Extensive ancillary pathology studies are required for appropriate diagnosis.

AB  - In order to closely mimic the actual mechanism of wound debridement by an enzymatic debriding agent, a synthetic wound eschar substrate (SWES) has been developed. The SWES is prepared by the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of fibrous bovine collagen and elastin, to form an insoluble planar matrix composed of the three major proteins present in wound eschar. Each of the proteinaceous components is uniquely labeled prior to formation of SWES with different dye, and the debridement test is conducted using a Franz Diffusion System. The debriding agent is applied to the SWES mounted on the donor compartment of the cell, and the digested hydrolysate containing dye-labeled peptide fragments is sampled from the receptor compartment. Accordingly, the progress of digestion is obtained in real time. Since the three proteins are labeled with spectrally distinct dyes, data on the hydrolysis of the substrates can be collected simultaneously. This method facilitates the testing of formulated debriding products in a manner that closely mimics application to a wound and provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of formulated enzymatic debriding agents.

AB  - Caspases are a family of at least 14 highly conserved aspartate proteases that are the major effector arm of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Previous immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have implicated two of the family members, caspase 3 and caspase 14, as having a role in the process of epidermal terminal differentiation. Reepithelialization of epidermal defects after wounding requires coordination between signals that initiate growth and migration as well as signals that initiate differentiation. We therefore examined the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 14 in the epidermis of early (up to 48 hour) human wounds. Two excisional wounds were created on the inner arm using a 3?mm biopsy punch and allowed to heal via secondary intention. Wounds were excised at 24 and 48 hours using a 6?mm biopsy punch, placed in OCT, frozen, cryosectioned and immunohistochemically labeled using affinity purified antisera for caspases 3, 9 and 14. At 24 hours, the distribution of caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression was unchanged from non-wounded skin. Caspase 3 was found in the upper differentiating cells of the granular layer, while caspase 9 was expressed in scattered dendritic cells in the epidermis. At 48 hours, caspase 3 expression was lost in the epithelial tongue, while caspase 9 expression was found in keratinocytes at the tip of the migrating tongue. Caspase 14 expression at 24 hours was noted at the tip of the migrating epithelial tongue, while at 48 hours, the normal expression of caspase 14 in the granular layer was lost. These results suggest that in 48 hour wounds, loss of caspase 3 and 14 expression in the migrating epithelium reflects the activated state of this tissue. The onset of caspase 9 expression at 48 hours in the leading edge of the wound suggests a role for caspase 9 in wound remodeling, as caspase 9 is known to participate in tissue remodeling during development. Characterization of the caspases involved during wound healing may lead to future therapies utilizng caspases or caspase inhibitors in situations of poor or aberrant wound healing.

AB  - Burns have been associated with high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines which promote systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), immunosuppression and sepsis for which no effective treatment is currently available. Defensins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are considered important components of the innate immune system and enhance adaptive immunity. We have examined the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1?-(IL-1?), gamma-interferon (IFN?) and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNFα) on human ?-defensin-2 (HBD-2) levels in cultured keratinocytes. We have also examined the effects of heat shock at 42?°C. Our results demonstrate that only TNFα shows significant induction of HBD-2 but this induction was not sustained in the long term. In addition, endogenous levels of defensin were significantly reduced by exposure to heat shock. The keratinocytes also responded to IL-1? by becoming hypertrophic. These results indicate that stress-related, pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce keratinocytes to synthesize HBD-2, while heat shock appears to reduce its production. Understanding the roles cytokines play in the continued problems associated with severe wounding, and in particular, major burn injury, is important. This study provides further insight into the role of natural anti-microbial peptides under conditions of stress.

AB  - Calreticulin (CRT) is a major classic Ca-binding chaperone protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently, CRT has been recognized to have widespread extracellular effects as well. In the current study we show that CRT increases both epithelial migration and granulation tissue formation in models of porcine and murine wound repair. Partial thickness wounds were created on the paravertebral area of pigs (n?=?4) and 0.1% and 0.5% CRT, and PDGF (positive control) applied for 4 consecutive days. In wounds harvested at 5 days, CRT induced a 28 and 22% greater extent of reepithelialization than PDGF and Tris/Ca buffer control, respectively (% healed?=?56/CRT; 40.5/PDGF; 44/control). In addition, CRT stimulated earlier granulation tissue formation in a dose-dependent manner (cumulative dermal depth, microns: 1615/CRT; 1250/PDGF; 1325/control). A similar granulation tissue inducing effect of CRT was also observed in a steroid-impaired pig model. As a diabetic model of wound repair, two 5?mm circular full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of db/db mice; the wounds were splinted open with silicone rings and covered with occlusive dressing (n?=?24). After 5 days of treatment with 0.1, 0.5, and 5% CRT, a dose-dependent 8-, 4.5-, and 2-fold increase in granulation tissue formation was observed (p?<?0.05). However, there was no apparent effect on wound closure. Tissue sections showed a highly cellular dermis in the CRT treated wounds. In addition, CRT (50?pg/ml) stimulated wound closure in a scratch plate assay using fibroblasts by 45%, in 48?hrs, compared to 2% for the control. Therefore, CRT may be a novel agent for wound healing by acting as a chemoattractant for cells involved in wound remodeling and in epithelial migration. Suppported by Calretex, LLC.

AB  - Biocompatible matrices, such as bovine collagen, have demonstrated usefulness in delivering gene therapy vectors that express growth factors to local environments for tissue repair. Unlike animal derived matrices, we have developed a new synthetic matrix consisting of a linear cyclodextrin-polyethyleneglycol co-polymer that is non-covalently cross-linked with di-adamantane-polyethyleneglycol via inclusion complex formation between adamantane and cyclodextrin (CD-Ada). We performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments for biocompatibility and localized transgene expression using a recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vector containing either the reporter gene, GFP, or the therapeutic gene, PDGF-B. In vitro results demonstrated cell migration, adenoviral transduction, and gene expression with no visible signs of toxicity in human skin fibroblasts. Qualitative gene expression from the CD-Ada containing rAd was delayed by approximately two days when compared to collagen, but the level of expression was greater over a longer period of time. In vivo experiments demonstrated gene expression after local delivery to mouse skin using rAd-GFP in CD-Ada. Again, the expression was slightly delayed but duration of expression was comparable to collagen. Expression studies using rAd-PDGF-B, were performed in the rat polyvinyl alcohol sponge model and showed comparable quantitative DNA and RNA levels between CD-Ada and collagen (DNA: 4.1???1010 and 4.5???1010 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively; RNA: 7.0???108 and 3.2???108 MEQ of PDGF-B/assayed sponge, respectively). Additionally, we explored the use of plasmid DNA with the CD-Ada matrix and observed PDGF-B expression in vivo. Our results show that this new delivery system provides a safe, efficient, and adaptable medium for both viral and non-viral gene delivery.

AB  - Fibrin Sealant products such as TisseelR have been used over the last 25 years to reach hemostasis during surgery or to seal tissues. Moreover, there were many studies on the use of fibrin sealant in cell and bioactive substance delivery. Our In Vitro and In Vivo studies, over the last 2 years, have focused on the use of fibrin sealant to deliver human fibroblasts or keratinocytes to overcome the healing deficiency in chronic wounds. We have shown that some fibrin formulations supported a high fibroblast proliferation and other fibrin formulations supported a high proliferation of human keratinocytes. In this study, we examined the use of fibrin sealant in the co-delivery of both human ? derived keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The study report examined the cell proliferation of these two cell types in various formulations of fibrin sealant. Fibroblasts and keratinocytes were mixed with various dilutions of the Sealer Protein solution and added to culture plates before adding the Thrombin solution to form fibrin clots containing both cell types. We found that a low to medium sealer protein concentration (1?34?mG/mL) and a very low thrombin concentration (1?U/mL) in the final fibrin clots provided for an optimal cell proliferation for both cell types within these fibrin clots. This profile of proliferation was different from that seen when keratinocytes alone or fibroblasts alone were incorporated in the fibrin clots. Morphologically, it was difficult to determine the cell type from examining cell morphology, thus, it was difficult to determine the cell distribution. In conclusion, we found that various modified formulations of fibrin sealant may be chosen when co- delivering fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Moreover, there seems to be a positive feedback between keratinocytes and fibroblasts when they were co ? introduced in the fibrin clots. This feedback could be carried by growth factors. Future studies will determine his signaling process.

AB  - Composition and structure determine the fate of biomaterials in the body, encouraging or discouraging acceptance, cellular infiltration, and degradation or incorporation into host tissue. Most biomaterials research has been focused on composition, while structure remains a relatively uninvestigated factor in biomaterial success. Naturally derived biomaterials may provide optimal structure for cellular repopulation in certain applications. Porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is an acellular, naturally occurring extracellular matrix used in the clinical treatment of soft tissue injury, including pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Numerous studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, tissue-specific remodeling, and repair. SIS consists primarily of collagen, although the presence of other proteins, growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, and proteoglycans has been reported. SEM was used to characterize the cellular environment provided by this biomaterial. Cryo-SEM was used to image mechanically isolated, oxidatively disinfected, lyophilized, sterilized, and rehydrated SIS. The fractured cross-sectional faces of intact intestine, oxidatively disinfected SIS, and lyophilized SIS were imaged with traditional SEM. Comparison of the images utilizing cryo and traditional preparation techniques show that SIS is a heterogeneous matrix consisting of textured fibers of mixed size. There are differences in the structure of the mucosal and serosal surfaces. Although the matrix architecture shows signs of collapse and delamination following lyophilization, much of the native structure is preserved. These changes are preserved following rehydration. The effects of these structural changes on cellular reaction and infiltration are unknown, but the naturally complex architecture-clearly facilitates host interaction on thecellular and subcellular levels.

AB  - Although electrical stimulation (ES) has been successful in the treatment of various types of wounds, the popularity of the treatment has waned due to a lack of optimal methods of administration. The goal of this study has been to develop and evaluate a method of delivering ES that is easy to use and suitable for delivery in a home-health environment.[0] Specifically, a novel bandage system developed to provide an electric field in a manner resembling the natural wound current was tested in vivo. In this study, a full-thickness wound model in New Zealand white rabbits was used to measure the effects of such a bandage system on healing of [0]skin defects. Different levels of current were evaluated initially, with 50 and 20??A selected for the focus of this study, along with a non-stimulated control. Using histomorphometry healing rates, cellularity, and blood vessels were quantified at one and two week time points. The study showed the ability of this ES bandage to speed the healing process. An increase in overall healing rate over non-stimulated wounds of 45%(p?=?0.04) was observed in wounds stimulated with 50??A of current for 1 week. In wounds treated for 2 weeks, contraction rate decreased as well as the ratio of contraction rate to epithelialization rate. The stimulated wounds also showed an increase in the amount of macrophages, with a 79% increase in number of macrophages in wounds stimulated with 20??A for 2 weeks and a 198% increase in macrophages in those stimulated with 50??A compared to non-stimulated wounds. The performance of the bandage in the animal model has led to a limited clinical study on pressure ulcer patients using the 50??A system.

AB  - Abstract Mixed striatal cell cultures containing neurons and glial cells were grown either in neurobasal medium (NBM) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicated that, if at all, only a single, low amplitude spike was evoked shortly after starting the injection of a depolarizing current pulse into NBM neurons. In contrast, DMEM neurons fired series of high amplitude action potentials, without apparent spike frequency adaptation. The possible reason for the observed action potential failure in NBM neurons was a low density of Na+ channels per unit of membrane surface area. However, both in NBM and DMEM neurons, ATP did not induce inward current responses via P2X receptor-channels, although GABAA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-channels could be activated by muscimol and NMDA, respectively. Ca2+ imaging experiments by means of the Fura-2 method were utilized to measure intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in neurons and glial cells. NBM, but not DMEM neurons responded to ATP with [Ca2+]i transients; glial cells grown in either culture medium were equally sensitive to ATP. ATP caused an increase of [Ca2+]i by a mechanism only partly dependent on external Ca2+; the residual ATP effect was blocked by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and was therefore due to the release of Ca2+ from its intracellular pools. The receptor involved was characterized by P2 receptor antagonists (PPADS, MRS 2179, AR-C69931MX) and was found to belong to the P2Y1 subtype. CPA caused an early [Ca2+]i response due to release from intracellular storage sites, followed by a late [Ca2+]i response due to the influx of this cation from the extracellular space, probably triggered by the opening of store-operated channels (SOCs) in the plasma membrane. It is concluded that in partial analogy with the effect of CPA, ATP releases [Ca2+]i via the Gq/phospholipase C/inositoltrisphosphate (IP3) pathway, thereby opening SOCs. It is hypothesized that this effect of ATP may have an important role for the proliferation and migration of striatal neuronal progenitors. J. Cell. Physiol. 209: 81?93, 2006. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
