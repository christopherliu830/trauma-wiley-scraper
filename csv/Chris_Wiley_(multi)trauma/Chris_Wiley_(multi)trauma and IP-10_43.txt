AB  - We describe the effects on group I and II afferents as well as alpha- and gamma-efferents of gastrocnemius muscles elicited by stretch and release of the triceps surae muscle performed by a dorsiflexion movement, a maintained dorsiflexion and release of the ankle joint. The experiments were made in decerebrated cats in which the neural loops between the muscles and the spinal cord were intact. Multi-unit discharges of each kind of fibre were obtained, electronically on-line, from two monopolar electrodes 4 mm apart on a small branch of the gastrocnemius lateralis or medialis nerve. Sensory and motor impulses were separated according to the opposite directions of their propagation, then both groups were further subdivided according to conduction velocity. The stretch reflex induced by ankle flexion was associated in eighteen out of nineteen experiments with reflex changes in the activity of the gamma-axon population of the gastrocnemius nerve branch. Facilitatory, depressor and biphasic (facilitatory-depressor) effects were observed, the particular type seeming to depend on the level of gamma tone and gamma-motoneurone size. Flexion release led to cessation of the alpha stretch reflex and to a rebound firing of the gamma-axon population. The lengthening reaction and the clasp-knife phenomenon occurred in certain preparations and were associated with reflex inhibition of the gamma-motoneurones. The over-all responses of group I fibres to triceps stretch showed dynamic and static components, whereas those of the group II fibres were, except in two examples, almost devoid of dynamic sensitivity. During release of stretch and as a result of the simultaneous rebound in gamma activity, the afferent discharges showed a very short pause, no pause, or even a rebound. The origins of the discharges of groups I and II muscle afferents and the factors (muscle length, active and passive muscle tension, reflex changes in fusimotor drive) influencing the activity of the receptors involved are considered as far as possible. Some aspects of the mechanisms of the fusimotor reflex are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that has few treatment options. Riluzole, a sodium channel blocker used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been initially trialed in human SCI. We performed a systematic review to critically assess the efficacy of riluzole in locomotor recovery and damage extension in SCI rat models, and the potential for clinical translation. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases were searched from their inception date to March 2018. Two reviewers independently selected animal studies that evaluated neurological recovery and lesion area following riluzole treatment in SCI rat models, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Pairwise meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and network meta-analysis were performed to assess the effects of riluzole on SCI. Ten eligible studies were included. Two studies had high methodological quality. Overall, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were increased in riluzole-treated animals versus controls, and effect sizes showed a gradual increase from the 1st (five studies, n = 104, mean difference = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.11 to 2.37, p = 0.03) to 6th week after treatment (five studies, n = 120, mean difference = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.42, p < 0.0001). Riluzole was associated with improved outcomes in the inclined plane test and the tissue preservation area. Subgroup analyses suggested an association of locomotor recovery with riluzole dose. Network meta-analysis showed that 5 mg/kg riluzole exhibited greater protection than 2.5 and 8 mg/kg riluzole. Collectively, this review suggests that riluzole has a protective effect on SCI, with good safety and a clear mechanism of action and may be suitable for future clinical trials or applications. However, animal results should be interpreted with caution given the known limitations in animal experimental design and methodological quality.

AB  - Abstract Previous research has identified potential issues of establishing and maintaining breastfeeding among women who experience severe maternal morbidity associated with pregnancy and birth, but evidence in the UK maternity population was scarce. We explored the association between severe maternal morbidity and breastfeeding outcomes (uptake and prevalence of partial and exclusive breastfeeding) at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum in a UK sample. Data on breastfeeding outcomes were obtained from a large cohort study of women who gave birth in one maternity unit in England to assess the impact of women's experiences of severe maternal morbidity (defined as major obstetric haemorrhage, severe hypertensive disorder or high dependency unit/intensive care unit admission) on their post-natal health and other important outcomes including infant feeding. Results indicated that among women who responded (n?=?1824, response rate?=?53%), there were no statistically significant differences in breastfeeding outcomes between women who did or did not experience severe morbidity, except for women with severe hypertensive disorder who were less likely to breastfeed either partially or exclusively at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum. Rather, breastfeeding outcomes were related to multi-dimensional factors including sociodemographic (age, ethnicity, living arrangement), other pregnancy outcomes (neonatal intensive care unit admission, mode of birth, women's perceived control during birth) and post-natal psychological factors (depressive symptoms). Women who experience severe maternal morbidity can be reassured that establishing successful breastfeeding can be achieved. More studies are required to understand what support is best for women who have complex health/social needs to establish breastfeeding.

AB  - Abstract Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are up-regulated following spinal cord injury and are partly responsible for failed regeneration. Experimental paradigms in vivo that degrade chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains with the bacterial enzyme, chondroitinase, greatly enhance the ability of axons to regenerate through the glial scar. Unfortunately, enthusiasm for this treatment paradigm is diminished by the lack of a minimally invasive and sustained delivery method. To address these deficits, we have engineered a Tet-On adenoviral vector encoding chondroitinase AC and have characterized its enzymatic function in vitro. U373 human astrocytoma cells were transduced with adenovirus and subsequently induced with doxycycline to secrete enzymatically active chondroitinase as detected by western blot and kinetic analyses. Enzymatic activity demonstrated biological relevance in studies where neurite outgrowth into and across CSPG-adsorbed regions pre-treated with conditioned media from chondroitinase secreting astrocytes was significantly increased compared with untreated controls (p?<?0.0001). We also measured important parameters of enzyme activity including: pH, temperature, and enzyme stability that are fundamental to harnessing the true therapeutic potential of this approach. The use of resident cells for continuous secretion of CSPG-degrading enzymes at the site of the glial scar promises to be of greater clinical relevance than contemporary methods.

AB  - 1 Anu Muraja-Murro, 1 Ari Pääkkönen, 2 Leena Jutila, 2 Reetta Kälviäinen, 3 Arto Immonen, 1 Sara Määttä, and 1 Esa Mervaala ( 1 Clinical Neurophysiology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; 2 Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: Mismatch-negativity (MMN) is an auditory event-related potential (ERP) produced by a deviant stimuli that occurs infrequenty among standard stimuli. MMN is thought to reflect the activation of an automatic change-detector system that compares new auditory input with a short-term memory trace generated by the previous auditory stimuli. MMN in human has been demonstrated from several cortical sites, but not to our knowledge from hippocampus or amygdala. This is surprising, given that these limbic structures are so essential for learning and memory functions. We could obtain MMN from these temporomesial structures using intracranial electrodes in adult patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Methods: 4 adults with intractable temporal lobe seizures (age 32?48 years) had each 2?4 stereotactically implanted 6-contact depth-electrodes at amygdalo-hippocampal complex. The electrodes were implanted via lateral approach and their exact anatomical localizations were confirmed by MRI and CT in situ. After the post hoc anatomical localization of the depth-electrodes, the presence of MMN could be studied from 6 hippocampi and 5 amygdalas (i.e., the electrode tips were exactly within amygdalo-hippocampal complex). The most mesial depth-electrode contacts were chosen for the MMN analysis with the MMN latency range of 120?250 ms, as well as with the P300 range of 250?500 ms. We analyzed possible statistically significant differences between the ERPs to deviant and standard tones. Results: A definite MMN within 120?250 ms latency range could be recorded from 4/6 hippocampi and 3/5 amygdalas. MMN was also detected within 250?500 ms latency range in 3/6 hippocampi and 2/5 amygdalas, respectively. In only one patient the hippocampal MMN resembled typical scalp-recorded MMN. In all, the MMN decreased from the deepest contacts towards the cortex, suggesting a local maximum of MMN at the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Conclusions: Our data implicates that a local and early (120?500 ms post-stimuli) automatic electrophysiological change-detector system exists within the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. This data is the first to demonstrate that also these temporomesial structures are activated and involved in mismatch detection, and is in line with recent sensory mismatch fMRI studies. Other sensory stimuli might also produce MMN in the same structures, possibly thus revealing a common function for hippocampus and amygdala in early sensory stimulus detection. 1 Tobias Loddenkemper, 2 Gabriel Moeddel, 1 Elia M. Pestana, 1 Deepak K. Lachhwani, 1 Ajay Gupta, 1 Prakash Kotagal, and 1 Elaine Wyllie ( 1 Department of Epilepsy and Sleep Disorder, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Universitaetsklinikum Muenster, Muenster, Westfalen, Germany ) Rationale: The intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) is part of the presurgical workup of patients scheduled for epilepsy surgery to determine language and memory lateralization. Most information on results and complications are derived from adults. Little is known about children undergoing IAT. Difficulties arise from anxiety, need for barbiturate dosage adjustment, and impaired baseline memory in children with mental retardation [4]. The goal of this study was 1) to describe language lateralization in children with epilepsy and 2) to outline complications during IAT. Methods: 126 consecutive pediatric IAT performed at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation during a seven year period were reviewed. Results: 44 patients were age 5?12 years, 82 were age 13?18. 102 were right-handed. Amobarbital (n = 96, average dose: 100 +- 25 mg) or Methohexital (n = 30, average dose 5 +- 1 mg) was injected into the left (n = 18), right (n = 13), or both (n = 95) ICA. Language was localized in 95 patients (75.4%): 75 [78.9%] were left, 6 [6.3%] were right, 14 [14.7%] bilateral language dominant. Neurological complications included prolonged lethargy impairing language and memory evaluation in 4 patients. Four children had a seizure after injection. Additionally, valid data could not be obtained due to fear or agitation in three children age 5?9 years. No lasting neurological deficits were seen. General complications included shortness of breath after contrast injection in one boy. One girl presented with fever of 38.5 C the night after the procedure complaining of groin pain. No other major complications were seen. Conclusions: This is one of the largest pediatric IAT series studied so far. The data on language lateralization agree with those previously reported [1, 2, 3]. The IAT in children is an invasive test with a potential for complications, as in adults, occuring in 10 out of 126 patients [7.9%]. Our series highlights the need for refinement and further development of novel methods to establish language lateralization in children during the evaluation for epilepsy surgery.

Isojärvi ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ; and 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ) Rationale: To prospectively evaluate changes in interictal heart rate (HR) variability in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after 4 years follow-up. Methods: A 24-hour ECG recording was obtained at baseline and four years after first recording in 18 patients with refractory TLE, 18 patients with well controlled TLE, and once in 36 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Time and frequency domain measures, along with fractal and complexity measures of HR variability, were analysed from the ECG recordings. Results: At baseline most of the measures showed decreased HR variability in the TLE patients compared to control subjects. After four years follow-up, most of the HR variability measures were further decreased in patients with TLE, and the RR interval (p = 0.015), the Poincaré component SD2 (p < 0.002), and ApEn (p = 0.000) value decreases from the baseline were statistically significant. Conclusions: TLE was associated with reduced HR variability at the baseline of the study. Further decrease in HR variability in patients with TLE was observed after four-year follow-up 1 Manjari Tripathi, 1 Shalini Mukherjee, 1 K.K. Deepak, and 1 Padma Vasantha ( 1 Department of Neurology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; and Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India ) Rationale: Changes in cardiovascular tone is noted in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy patients. The dysfunction of sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity is a potential cause of sudden unexpected death in epileptic patients. The present study was aimed at finding out the effect of epilepsy surgery on autonomic functions in intractable epileptic patients. Methods: 27 patients of mean age 27.3 +/?10.8 who were intractable for over two years or more and selected for surgery. They underwent a battery of tests that assessed their autonomic reactivity. Baseline autonomic activity (tone) was also measured by Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The patients underwent the same tests again 3 months later. Results: The indices of Deep Breathing test (DBT)- before and after surgery, i.e. E:I ratio (1.27 +/?0.13 vs. 1.4 +/? 0.1) and delta changes in heart rate (20.5 +/? 8.75 vs. 23.0 +/? 1.3) show an increase, though not significant, in parasympathetic reactivity after surgery. No changes were observed in the Valsalva Maneuver or in the 30:15 ratio in the Head Up Tilt test (HUT). The rise in Diastolic BP in Hand Grip Test (28.0 +/? 7.0 vs. 16.0 +/? 10.4) was significantly less after surgery. The reactivity tests show that there may be a trend towards increase in parasympathetic and decrease in sympathetic reactivity after surgery. Among the parameters in the HRV which denote the autonomic tone, most of the time domain measures between pre and post surgery patients, i.e. SENN (1.4 +/? 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/? 1.2), SDSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), RMSSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), NN50 (0.55 +/? 3.3 vs. 5 +/? 26.1), pNN50 (0.4 +/? 0.1 vs. 0.51 +/? 0.2) showed an increase in values post surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone. In the frequency domain measures, LF (nu) and% LF denote the sympathetic tone; LF (nu) ((45.5 +/? 19.6 vs. 34 +/? 14.6) showed a significant decrease after surgery and%LF (20.8 +/? 13.1 vs. 22.2 +/? 8.8) was also reduced, thereby showing a decrease in sympathetic tone. HF (nu) and% HF denote parasympathetic tone and HF (nu) showed an increase (48.6 +/? 21.5 vs. 57.2 +/? 22.8), while%HF (36.5 +/? 21.8 vs. 43.2 +/? 16.9) showed a significant increase after surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone after surgery. The LF/HF ratios, which show the sympathovagal balance, also showed a significant decrease (1.1 +/? 1.1 vs. 0.63 +/? 0.4) after surgery. Two patients who had abnormal tone before surgery showed normalization after surgery. Conclusions: The present study shows that the autonomic functions are modulated after surgery; exhibiting a decrease in sympathetic reactivity and increase in parasympathetic reactivity. An increase in parasympathetic tone and a significant decrease in sympathetic tone is also noted after surgery.

AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Ying Yang 1 (YY1), a ubiquitously expressed GLI-Krüppel zinc finger transcription factor, plays a regulatory role in a variety of fundamental biological processes, such as embryonic development, growth, apoptosis, differentiation and oncogenic transformation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of YY1 in normal and cancerous esophageal tissues and its function in ESCC development. We found that the expression of YY1 mRNA was significantly increased in the tumor tissues, compared with the para-tissues or normal esophageal tissues. The increased expression of YY1 in tumor samples was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the overexpression of YY1 conferred radioresistance to the ESCC TE-1 cells and resulted in markedly reduced cell proliferation. Accordingly, the small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of YY1 expression in TE-1 cells resulted in increased proliferation by enhancing the binding of P21 to Cyclin D1 and CDK4, a protein complex known to mediate cell cycle progression. Moreover, besides P21, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was identified as a YY1 downstream effector, as YY1 stimulated HO-1 expression in esophageal cancer cells. YY1 mediated biological function through transcription of HO-1. Forced expression of HO-1 could moderately suppress proliferation of TE-1 cells. The expression of YY1 significantly correlated with that of HO-1 in ESCC tissues. Taken together, we demonstrated overexpression of YY1 in esophageal carcinoma and identified HO-1 as its target.
