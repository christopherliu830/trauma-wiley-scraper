AB  - Background The aim of this study was to determine whether young haemophilic boys with and without MRI-based signs of ankle arthropathy demonstrate reduced balance ability during a transition task with eyes open and eyes closed. Methods Thirty-four haemophilic bodies and 28 typically developing boys aged 6-20 years participated to this study. Structural integrity of the tarsal foot joints of all haemophilic boys was assessed with MRI. All participants performed a standard transition task from double-leg stance to single-leg stance with eyes open and eyes closed. Comparison of balance features derived from the centre of pressure displacement captured by a single force platform was performed between the different haemophilia subgroups and sex-age-height matched peers. Findings The haemophilic boys without signs of arthropathy presented only a higher intermediate phase velocity during the eyes closed condition (P = .05). The haemophilic boys with signs of arthropathy had significantly higher displacement after the time to new stability point, and 95% Ellipse Sway Area and Balance Area compared to their matched peers during eyes open test (P < .05). Similar findings were observed during the eyes closed test for the displacement after the time to new stability point and 95% Ellipse Sway Area (P < .05). No significant differences were observed between affected and non-affected side of the unilateral affected patients. Interpretation We suggest that the pathophysiological cascade associated with chronic bleeding episodes should not be considered as a ?simple? musculoskeletal injury, hence more as a complex neurophysiological dysfunction which may originate both from unilateral and bilateral deterioration of the musculoskeletal system.

AB  - Monoclonal IgM antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) are associated with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy characterized by predominant involvement of large sensory fibers, although nerve conduction study reveals preferential demyelination of distal motor fibers. In sural nerve biopsy, deposits of monoclonal IgM are found at sites of MAG localization such as Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and paranodal loops, but also on the surface of myelinated nerve fibers (mesaxon). Distal involvement in sensory fibers cannot be assessed by routine studies. Therefore, we investigated sensory fibers by skin biopsy in 13 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. Patients with CIDP (n?=?8) and with IgM anti-MAG negative paraproteinemic neuropathy (n?=?3) were used as diseased controls. Skin biopsy was performed using a 3?mm punch at the proximal thigh (n?=?20), at the distal leg (n?=?21), at the hand or arm or fingertip (n?=?23). Specimens were processed to quantify the density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) using the anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Both anti-MAG patients and CIDP patients showed a proximal-distal gradient in IENF density decrease, indicating a length-dependent fiber loss, as typically seen in other neuropathies. Further, we investigated anti-MAG immunoreactivity and the presence of IgM deposits in dermal myelinated fibers by confocal microscopy. IgM deposits were detected on the surface of MAG positive fibers in the dermis of 11 anti-MAG patients (85%), but not in diseased controls. IgM deposits were also located at paranodal loops. Our study shows that small myelinated fibers in the skin are involved in anti-MAG neuropathy, and that IgM deposits can be demonstrated in terminal sensory fibers. Skin biopsy provides a useful, minimally traumatic method for early diagnosis as well as for follow-up studies of anti-MAG neuropathy. Supported by a Fellowship of the European Neurological Society.

AB  - A 40-year-old smoker complained of pain, deep and burning in character, constant, and persistent, associated with paresthesias in his feet for a period of two years. Furthermore, he developed aching non-traumatic foot ulcers. There was no history of diabetes and systemic illness. Neurological examination revealed loss of all modalities of sensation and hyperhidrosis in the limbs with a prominent distal-to-proximal gradient. The following laboratory tests were normal: blood count; test for liver, kidney, and thyroid function; cryoglobulins; anti-HCV antibodies and HIV. Neurophysiological investigation revealed an axonal neuropathy with a distal-to-proximal distribution in the limbs. Sural nerve biopsy showed a severe chronic axonal neuropathy. Prominent thickening of endoneurial microvessel endothelial cells was present with narrowing of lumen. Congo Red staining was negative. He initiated treatment with alprostadil alfa-ciclodestrina and stopped smoking. The patient reported prompt improvement of neurologic symptoms as well as skin abnormalities few months after the begin of therapy. Ischemic neuropathy in which nerve damage occurs in the more distal portion of the limbs has been reported. In our patient, clinical presentation, neurophysiological and neuropathological findings suggest the diagnosis of a Lower Extremity Ischemic Neuropathy probably triggered by smoke.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

AB  - Key points Absence epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges concomitant with an alteration of consciousness and is associated with cognitive comorbidities. In a genetic model of absence epilepsy in the rat, the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), spike-and-wave discharges are shown to be initiated in the barrel field primary somatosensory cortex that codes whisker-related information, therefore playing an essential role in the interactions of rodents with their environment. Sensory-information processing is impaired in the epileptic barrel field primary somatosensory cortex of GAERS, with a delayed sensory-evoked potential and a duplicated neuronal response to whisker stimulation in in vivo extracellular recordings. Yet, GAERS present no defaults of performance in a texture discrimination task, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism within the epileptic neuronal network. The results of the present study indicate that physiological primary functions are processed differently in an epileptic cortical network. Abstract Several neurodevelopmental pathologies are associated with disorganized cortical circuits that may alter primary functions such as sensory processes. In the present study, we investigated whether the function of a cortical area is altered in the seizure onset zone of absence epilepsy, a prototypical form of childhood genetic epilepsy associated with cognitive impairments. We first combined in vivo multichannel electrophysiological recordings and histology to precisely localize the seizure onset zone in the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). We then investigated the functionality of this epileptic zone using extracellular silicon probe recordings of sensory-evoked local field potentials and multi-unit activity, as well as a behavioural test of texture discrimination. We show that seizures in this model are initiated in the barrel field part of the primary somatosensory cortex and are associated with high-frequency oscillations. In this cortex, we found an increased density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in layer 5 in GAERS compared to non-epileptic Wistar rats. Its functional investigation revealed that sensory abilities of GAERS are not affected in a texture-discrimination task, whereas the intracortical processing of sensory-evoked information is delayed and duplicated. Altogether, these results suggest that absence seizures are associated with an increase of parvalbumin-inhibitory neurons, which may promote the functional relationship between epileptic oscillations and high-frequency activities. Our findings suggest that cortical circuits operate differently in the epileptic onset zone and may adapt to maintain their ability to process highly specialized information.

AB  - Abstract Crushing or transecting the chorda tympani nerve of the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) caused ipsilateral degeneration of taste buds in the fungiform papillae. In less than two weeks some taste fibers regenerated into the tongue and formed new taste buds and receptor cells. The recovery process was evaluated electrophysiologically in 53 gerbils by acute recording proximal to the nerve injury site. Initially the chorda tympani was electrically silent. In gerbils tested at later times spontaneous activity appeared. This was followed by responses to pressure on the tongue. Taste responses returned as early as dasy 11. The receptive field of regenerated taste fibers was limited to a small number of fungiform papillae. Taste responses were always associasted with the presence of one or more taste buds in the receptive field. Taste buds identified as responsive to chemicals contained some fusiform cells. We found thast the taste responses of single fiber, few-fiber and multi-unit preparations reflected the diversity of responses found in normal taste axons as determined by recording from 26 normal single fibers and 27 normal whole nerves. The early emergence of a variety of fiber types and responses to many chemicals in regeneration is inconsistent with the proposition that the relative chemical responsiveness of a receptor cell is strictly a function of its age; the response of a given young taste receptor is not necessarily limited to a few of the standard taste stimulants.
