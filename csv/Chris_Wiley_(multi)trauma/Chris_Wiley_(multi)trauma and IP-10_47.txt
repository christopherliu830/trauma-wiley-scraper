AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a limbic structure that is involved in the expression of conditioned contextual fear. Among the numerous neural inputs to the BNST, noradrenergic synaptic terminals are prominent and some evidence suggests an activation of this noradrenergic neurotransmission in the BNST during aversive situations. Here, we have investigated the involvement of the BNST noradrenergic system in the modulation of behavioural and autonomic responses induced by conditioned contextual fear in rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Male Wistar rats with cannulae bilaterally implanted into the BNST were submitted to a 10 min conditioning session (6 footshocks, 1.5 ma/ 3 s). Twenty-four hours later freezing and autonomic responses (mean arterial pressure, heart rate and cutaneous temperature) to the conditioning box were measured for 10 min. The adrenoceptor antagonists were administered 10 min before the re-exposure to the aversive context. KEY RESULTS L-propranolol, a non-selective ?-adrenoceptor antagonist, and phentolamine, a non-selective α-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduced both freezing and autonomic responses induced by aversive context. Similar results were observed with CGP20712, a selective ?1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and WB4101, a selective α1-antagonist, but not with ICI118,551, a selective ?2-adrenoceptor antagonist or RX821002, a selective α2-antagonist. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These findings support the idea that noradrenergic neurotransmission in the BNST via α1- and ?1-adrenoceptors is involved in the expression of conditioned contextual fear.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the estimated death rates associated with alcohol and tobacco use for Australian Aboriginals in Western Australia with those for non-Aboriginals. Method: Deaths attributable to tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were estimated for 1989?1991 with the aetiological fractions method, using data from the Health Department of Western Australia's mortality database. Results: Tobacco smoking was responsible for 15.4% of all deaths and 13.9% of Aboriginal deaths, and alcohol consumption for 5% and 9.2%, respectively. The age-standardised death rates per 100000 person-years for tobacco and alcohol were: Aboriginal males, 271 and 152; other males, 113 and 29; Aboriginal females, 118 and 56; and other females, 32 and 15. Of those who died as a result of tobacco use, 49% of Aboriginal males and 48% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 11% and 10%, respectively, in non-Aboriginal males. For alcohol-related deaths, 62% of Aboriginal males and 70% of Aboriginal females died before 55 years of age, compared with 35% and 23%, respectively, in non-Aboriginals. Conclusion: During 1989?1991 tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption were responsible for much higher death rates among Aboriginals than among non-Aboriginals in Western Australia.

AB  - Cytokines such as interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) may play an important role in ocular inflammation. We studied a patient with clinical features of sympathetic ophthalmia secondary to previous penetrating ocular injuries, and compared the ocular and systemic levels of IL-1? and TNF to control serum, and correlated these findings to histopathological sections of the patient's eye. Histology showed the present-c of a diffuse chronic inflammatory infiltrate within the choroid and in a perivascular distribution in the retina. The significantly elevated ocular and systemic levels of IL-1? and TNF suggest that there is not only a localized ocular response hut a systemic response as well. The presence of IL-1? TNF may play a role in the pathogenesis of ocular inflammation once the blood ocular barrier has been breached and ocular antigens have been exposed to the systemic immune system.

AB  - Abstract Background To examine the organization of medical specialist care and hospital costs for low back pain (LBP) in the Netherlands. Methods Aggregated health insurance claims data were provided on all diagnosis treatment combination (DTC) declarations for LBP patients first referred to the hospital in the 2nd half of 2008 and retrieved from Vektis, an organization that collects health insurance claims data. Data were available up to 1 January 2012. The data included patient characteristics, DTC-specific information including: neurology, neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, anaesthesiology and radiology. Results In total 80,652 LBP patients were referred to the hospital for the first time in the second half of 2008 accumulating to a total of 173,620 DTC's with total costs of ?194 million. Of these patients, 56% were female and 61% aged above 50 years at first referral to the hospital. The average number of DTC's and costs per patient were 2.15 and ?2410, respectively (during the follow-up period of 3.0?3.5 year). Moreover, 51% of the patients needed only one DTC; less than 10% of patients needed 5 DTC's. Following the DTC number, the share of consultations to the neurologist decreased, whereas that of the anaesthesiology specialism increased. The largest portion of costs was allocated to the anaesthesiology and neurosurgery specialisms. Conclusions In the Netherlands, LBP patients consult a variety of medical specialists, in particular, the neurology, hospital costs for LBP patients are expected to increase given the rising incidence. Optimal diagnosis and tailored treatment plans might result in reduced costs and improved patient outcomes. Significance Low back pain patients consult various specialists, with the majority first referred to the neurologist. More than half of the LBD patients require only one DTC and less than 10% needed five DTC's or more. The largest portion of the hospital costs for LBP patients is allocated to the anaesthesiology and neurosurgery specialisms.

AB  - Summary The present study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro (CGP) in mice. Antinociceptive activity was assessed by employing different pain models, such as formalin test, acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate test, and carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia, in mice. The number of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) was evaluated in CGP-treated mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using paw oedema induced by carrageenan, compound 48/80, serotonin, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and analyzed by plethysmometry. Quantitation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the paw was carried out to analyze the presence of neutrophils in the tissue. Intraperitoneal injection of CGP produced a significant inhibition in both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of formalin-induced pain. The antinociceptive effect of CGP, evaluated in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, was detected for up to 6 h after treatment. Further, in the hot plate test, antinociceptive behaviour was evoked by CGP, and this response was inhibited by naloxone. Animals treated with CGP did not present changes in motor performance. In CGP-treated mice there was an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive neurons in the periaqueductal gray. In another set of experiments, CGP attenuated the hyperalgesic response induced by carrageenan. Furthermore, CGP also reduced the carrageenan-increased MPO activity in paws. In addition, CGP also reduced the paw oedema evoked by compound 48/80, serotonin, and PGE2. Taken together, these results may support a possible therapeutic application of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro toward alleviating nociception and damage caused by inflammation conditions.

AB  - Abstract Although both heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy have enjoyed clinical success in the treatment of patients with end-stage heart disease, newer left ventricular assist devices currently undergoing testing are likely to have a tremendous impact on the management of these patients. Smaller, more durable devices with improved safety profiles will allow for longer duration of therapy and make biventricular support more feasible, obviating the need for the total artificial heart. In this article we review the historical aspects of both forms of therapy and highlight the current use of left ventricular assist device therapy on patients awaiting heart transplantation.

AB  - Abstract This chapter presents a systematic summary overview of coordinated efforts taking place at the environmental bioinformatics and Computational Toxicology Center (ebCTC.org) towards developing a mechanistic modeling framework that integrates multiple scales of coupled toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic processes. This framework employs highly modular ?whole body? computational descriptions of the human and of selected model organisms that incorporate a hierarchy of alternative formulations representing biological events in ?virtual? tissues and organs. This approach allows the mechanistic consideration of multiple scales of interlinked phenomena that include molecular interactions; dynamics of intracellular biomolecular networks; spatial and stochastic aspects of cell biochemistry; integrative coupling of cellular-level processes related to common endpoints; extracellular signaling and cell-cell communication and interaction; aspects of functional heterogeneity in multicellular structures; dynamics of histomorphological and histopathological processes at the tissue level; and integrative coupling of processes across scales, resulting in different physiosystem phenotypes for health and disease states. The ebCTC framework offers a range of combined approaches for coupling processes and ?transferring and integrating? information across multiple strata of biological organization, ranging from formal methods of multiscale analysis, including statistical descriptions of multicellular kinetics and dynamics, to simplified ?top-down? approaches, incorporating both mechanistic and phenomenological formulations that rely on point and distributional parameterizations of the finer scales. The computational implementation of the framework employs a combination of agent-, network-, and field-based modeling methods. Example applications of various components of this framework are presented, spanning the range from molecular interactions to bionetwork and cellular dynamics to multiscale problems at the tissue and organ levels.

AB  - Abstract Background Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes motor and sensory defects, has strong impact on life quality and still has no effective therapy. Miconazole is one of the most widely used antifungal drugs; the aims of the study were to investigate the effects of miconazole during sciatic nerve regeneration in a mouse model of sciatic nerve crush injury. Methods We established peripheral nerve crush model and investigated the effects of miconazole by multiple aspects. We further studied the potential mechanism of action of miconazole by Western blotting, fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and PCR analysis. Results Miconazole improves the symptoms of crushed nerve by improving inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelinating myelin of sciatic nerve. Affected by miconazole, the proportion of inflammatory M1 macrophages in the distal part of the sciatic nerve was reduced, and the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was increased. Finally, the neuroprotective properties of miconazole may be regulated by the nuclear factor (NF)-?B pathway. Conclusions Our data suggest that miconazole can effectively alleviate PNI, and the mechanism involves mediating a phenotype change of M1/ M2 macrophages. Thus, miconazole may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for nerve crush injury.
