AB  - Abstract Given what evidence there is for the molecular and functional nature of cytokines and their cognate binding proteins in the immune system and the emerging similarities or even identities for these ligands and receptors in the nervous system, two general models may be relevant. The first emerging pattern is that receptors for related but distinct trophic factors in the CNS are in many instances multichain complexes with one or more shared components. The shared components of the receptor complex may be either signal- or nonsignal-transducing chains. A second emerging motif is that related ligands and related receptors fall into gene families. Undoubtedly, these models will facilitate the cloning of novel members of these families whose function is quite specific to the nervous system and in particular to glial cells. This article will review the function of the receptors for cytokines and families of differentiation/survival/growth factors as they operate on astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in development, health, and disease. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Stem cells are emerging as promising treatment strategies for several brain disorders and pathologies. In this study, we explored the potential of creating induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (ipNSC) by using either unmodified or gene-modified somatic cells and tested their fate and therapeutic efficacies in vitro and in vivo. We show that cells engineered in somatic state lose transgene-expression during the neural induction process, which is partially restored by histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment whereas cells engineered at the ipNSC state have sustained expression of transgenes. In vivo, bimodal mouse and human ipNSCs engineered to express tumor specific death-receptor ligand and suicide-inducing therapeutic proteins have profound anti-tumor efficacy when encapsulated in synthetic extracellular matrix and transplanted in mouse models of resected-glioblastoma. This study provides insights into using somatic cells for treating CNS disorders and presents a receptor-targeted cancer therapeutic approach for brain tumors. Stem Cells 2018;36:932?942

AB  - Abstract Background Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes motor and sensory defects, has strong impact on life quality and still has no effective therapy. Miconazole is one of the most widely used antifungal drugs; the aims of the study were to investigate the effects of miconazole during sciatic nerve regeneration in a mouse model of sciatic nerve crush injury. Methods We established peripheral nerve crush model and investigated the effects of miconazole by multiple aspects. We further studied the potential mechanism of action of miconazole by Western blotting, fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and PCR analysis. Results Miconazole improves the symptoms of crushed nerve by improving inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelinating myelin of sciatic nerve. Affected by miconazole, the proportion of inflammatory M1 macrophages in the distal part of the sciatic nerve was reduced, and the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was increased. Finally, the neuroprotective properties of miconazole may be regulated by the nuclear factor (NF)-?B pathway. Conclusions Our data suggest that miconazole can effectively alleviate PNI, and the mechanism involves mediating a phenotype change of M1/ M2 macrophages. Thus, miconazole may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for nerve crush injury.

AB  - The role of entrepreneurs in stimulating growth in the small business economy has received significant interest in the last three decades. This growing interest is prompted, in part, by the government?s assumption that the establishment and expansion of existing small firms could be greatly enhanced by the promotion of entrepreneurial education programmes in colleges and universities. Whilst there has been significant interest in the role, type and effect of entrepreneurs in the economy, few studies have examined the effect of entrepreneurial programmes on the progression of an idea through to commercialisation. This is because such research, whilst seemingly desirable, is problematic. Evidence can be gleaned through the development of suitable conceptual frameworks and methods, to assess the role and impact of entrepreneurial programmes on the commercialisation of products or processes, and the enhancement of entrepreneurial capabilities. To address this problem, the research will examine different approaches and frameworks that have been developed and applied hitherto. The objective of this will be to highlight the difficulties in assessing the motivations, cognitive and behavioural changes of entrepreneurs. Also, the research will demonstrate the need to undertake adequate controls, which illustrate possible improvement in entrepreneurial capabilities, networks, and credibility in comparison to students that embarked on courses without entrepreneurial elements. The process will confine itself to business development within the higher education (HEI) context. The MSEC has as its remit to provide opportunity, education, awareness and training to foster entrepreneurship within science and engineering departments across four universities in Greater Manchester. This setting will provide a unique situation in which to investigate the development of germinal technology businesses from the inception of an idea to the point of incubation, prototype development and investment. There is a requirement to understand the needs of the virgin entrepreneur, possible obstacles to commercialisation and the process of new venture creation. The methodology to be adopted has been identified, and forges new ground on combining positivist and phenomenological paradigms. The multi?paradigm approach supports the use of critical incident technique to reveal greater insights in to the personal and cognitive development of virginal entrepreneurs, the suitability of enterprise programmes to act as catalysts for venture creation, and their role in supporting technology transfer. The research will not only confine itself to examining undergraduate and postgraduate projects within MSEC?s business creation unit, but will also continue to assess the experience of entrepreneurs? when they leave the programme. The research also documents the economic contribution of the programme, in terms of generation of new technology?based firms and the impact of entrepreneurs joining established small firms. Ultimately the aim is to build a long?term picture of the role of enterprise programmes in HEIs that will inform policy and practice.

AB  - Abstract The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated in ischaemic, traumatic and excitotoxic brain damage. The results presented here reveal novel actions of IL-1 in the striatum which markedly exacerbate cortical neuronal damage elicited by local excitotoxins in the striatum or cortex. Intrastriatal infusion of IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1ra, markedly inhibited striatal neuronal damage caused by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor activation in the rat. In contrast, intracortical infusion of IL-1ra failed to inhibit NMDA or AMPA receptor-induced damage in the cortex. Intrastriatal co-infusion of IL-1? with the NMDA or AMPA receptor agonist did not affect local striatal damage induced by activation of either glutamate receptor subtype, but caused extensive cortical damage when administered into the striatum with AMPA. This secondary damage was significantly reduced by pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801), which did not affect local (striatal) damage caused by AMPA. Infusion of IL-1? into the striatum (but not the cortex) markedly enhanced cortical damage caused by infusion of an NMDA or AMPA receptor agonist into the cortex. These data reveal selective actions of IL-1 and IL-1ra in the striatum, which influence cortical neuronal loss and suggest that IL-1 selectively enhances damage caused by AMPA receptor activation.
