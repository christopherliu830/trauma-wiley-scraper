AB  - Abstract To test whether a spontaneous and functional regeneration of severed axons could occur within the adult mammalian central nervous system, a long-term recovery of microelectrode-mapped visual response was sought in the superior colliculus (SC) after its total or near-total abolition by a precise guillotine cut of the retinocollicular pathway. Recoveries were found 3?weeks or later in 15 of the 36 animals studied; in 10 of these recoveries, half or more of the width of the SC was involved. The recovered responses were often activated from within a normally small area of the visual field. Appropriate retinotopic maps were restored. Intraocular horseradish peroxidase tracing revealed a variety of novel optic trajectories, passing around lesions even of totally cut pathways, which eventually terminated in normally retinorecipient layers of those recovered SCs. Such detours could not be explained by a mechanical reorientation of brain structures. When exactly comparable lesions were examined within a few days, there were no detours: severed optic axons faced the cuts. In long-term animals where responsiveness remained absent, optic axonal reorientations were observed near lesions but the SC was not innervated. Extensive long-term recoveries were in marked contrast to the occasional rapid ones, found within a few days postlesion, which involved only an outermost silenced border of SC. These were attributed to a rapid reversal of conduction failure in spared, bordering, axons of this topographically organized pathway. The findings support the conclusion that, after they are cut, numbers of optic axons can regenerate to the SC and restore appropriate circuitry therein.

AB  - Summary Objective In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), pathologic high frequency oscillations (pHFOs, 200?600 Hz) are present in the hippocampus, especially the dentate gyrus (DG). The pHFOs emerge during a latent period prior to the onset of spontaneous generalized seizures. We used a unilateral suprahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA) mouse model of TLE to characterize the properties of hippocampal pHFOs during epileptogenesis. Methods In awake head-fixed mice, 4?14 days after KA-induced status epilepticus (SE), we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) with 64-channel silicon probes spanning from CA1 alveus to the DG hilus, or with glass pipettes in the DC mode in the CA1 str radiatum. Results The pHFOs, are observed simultaneously in the CA1 and the DG, or in the DG alone, as early as 4 days post-SE. The pHFOs ride on top of DC deflections, occur during motionless periods, persist through the onset of TLE, and are generated in bursts. Burst parameters remain remarkably constant during epileptogenesis, with a random number of pHFOs generated per burst. In contrast, pHFO duration and spectral dynamics evolve from short events at 4 days post-SE to prolonged discharges with complex spectral characteristics by 14 days post-SE. Simultaneous dural EEG recordings were exceedingly unreliable for detecting hippocampal pHFOs; therefore, such recordings may deceptively indicate a ?silent? period even when massive hippocampal activity is present. Significance Our results demonstrate that hippocampal pHFOs exhibit a dynamic evolution during the epileptogenic period following SE, consistent with their role in transitioning to the chronic stage of TLE.

AB  - Aims Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibition has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improved glucose control. This Phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of a novel MetAP2 inhibitor, ZGN-1061. Methods This clinical trial included a single ascending dose (SAD) phase in healthy subjects (BMI, 23 to <30?kg/m2) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase in otherwise healthy subjects (BMI, 27 to 40?kg/m2). SAD phase doses, administered subcutaneously (SC), were 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8?mg and the MAD phase evaluated doses of 0.2, 0.6 and 1.8?mg twice weekly SC for 4?weeks. Results The SAD phase included 39 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?28; placebo, N?=?11); 90% were male and BMI was 26.4?kg/m2. ZGN-1061 was well tolerated across all doses, with the most frequent adverse events being mild headache and procedural-related irritation. There were no severe or serious adverse events. All doses of ZGN-1061 were rapidly absorbed and cleared, resulting in short duration of exposure that is anticipated to minimize potential off-drug target risks. The MAD phase included 29 subjects (ZGN-1061, N?=?22; placebo, N?=?7); 76% were male and BMI was 33.5?kg/m2. Safety observations were consistent with SAD findings. Efficacy measures in the MAD phase indicated trends for weight change (?1.5?kg total ZGN-1061 vs ?0.2?kg placebo) and other biomarker changes. Conclusions ZGN-1061 was well tolerated with no safety signals in all doses tested. In addition, the desired pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy observations with ZGN-1061 support evaluation in larger and longer clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Ultrastructure of the medium sized ?spiny? neuron in rat dorsal-lateral caudate-putamen was assessed after administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) and exposure to pulsed microwaves. Sprague?Dawley male rats were given two daily intraperitoneal doses of 0 or 10 mg/kg 3-NP and 1.5 h after each dose were exposed to microwave radiation at a whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0 (sham exposure), 0.6, or 6 W/kg for 30 min. Microwave exposure consisted of 1.25 GHz radiation delivered as 5.9 ?s pulses with repetition frequency 10 Hz. Tissue samples taken 2?3 h after the second sham or microwave exposure showed no injury with light microscope methods. Blinded qualitative assessment of ultrastructure of randomly selected neurons from the same samples did reveal differences. Subsequent detailed, quantitative measurements showed that, when followed by sham exposure, administration of 3-NP significantly increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) intracisternal width, ER area density, and nuclear envelope thickness. Microwave exposure at 6 W/kg alone also significantly increased these measures. Exposure of 3-NP treated animals at 6 W/kg significantly increased effects of 3-NP on ultrastructure. Although exposure at 0.6 W/kg alone did not affect ultrastructure measures, exposure of 3-NP treated animals at 0.6 W/kg reduced the effects of 3-NP. We concluded that 3-NP changed neuronal ultrastructure and that the microwave exposures used here changed neuronal ultrastructure in ways that depended on microwave SAR and neuron metabolic status. The apparent cancellation of 3-NP induced changes by exposure to pulsed microwaves at 0.6 W/kg indicated the possibility that such exposure can protect against the effects of mitochondrial toxins on the nervous system.

AB  - Abstract The macro electromyography method was developed in the 1980s.1 Since then, technical modifications have been made, and a number of conditions have been explored.2, 3 This study is a methodological introduction and an update of findings in some nerve?muscle disorders. The spike component of a motor unit potential (MUP) recorded by a concentric or monopolar needle electromyography (EMG) electrode is generated primarily by fibers within 1?2 mm of the needle recording area. Given that a MUP's typical anatomical reach is 5?15 mm in diameter, it follows that conventional EMG is unable to record activity from the entire motor unit. Such information could promote understanding of muscle in health and disease. Macro EMG, with its large recording area, appears to provide this information by recording the activity from most of the fibers in a given motor unit. The value of combining macro EMG with single-fiber EMG and conventional EMG recordings is discussed. Muscle Nerve, 2011
