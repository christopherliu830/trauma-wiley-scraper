AB  - Burn injury results in immunosuppression; previous work implicated a combination of altered T lymphocyte subpopulations and the elaboration of macrophage-derived mediators. However, the conclusions were based on T cell stimulations in the setting of high-dose polyclonal mitogenic stimuli and a single kinetic time-point. In this study, splenocytes from burned animals were used to examine lymphocyte responses over a multi-day time course following saturating and subsaturating anti-CD3, as well as mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) stimulation. Burn injury resulted in suppressed splenocyte-proliferative responses to high-dose anti-CD3 (2 ?g/ml) at all culture time-points (Days 2?5); this inhibition was eliminated by removing macrophages from the splenocyte cultures, by blocking NO production, or by using splenocytes from burned animals congenitally deficient in IFN-? (IFN-??/?). The results are consistent with immunosuppression attributable to burn-induced IFN-? production, which in turn, drives macrophage NO synthesis (NOS). In MLR cultures, lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-? production were depressed at later time-points (Days 3?5). APC from burned animals showed no defects as MLR stimulators; T cells from burned animals showed defective, proliferative responses, regardless of the stimulator population. Removing macrophages, adding a NOS inhibitor, or using IFN-??/? splenocytes did not restore the MLR response of burned splenocytes. T cells from burned IFN-??/? animals also showed depressed proliferation with subsaturating levels of anti-CD3 (0.1 ?g/ml); anti-CD-28 augmented the proliferative response. We conclude that burn-induced immunosuppression to authentic antigenic stimulation is related at least in part to defective CD3 signaling pathways and not simply to increased IFN-? or NO production.

AB  - ABSTRACT As access to the Internet becomes increasingly available, research applications in medicine will increase. This paper describes the use of the Internet, and, more specifically, the World Wide Web (WWW), as a channel of communication between EDs throughout the world and investigators who are interested in facilitating the collection of data from multiple sites. Data entered into user-friendly electronic surveys can be transmitted over the Internet to a database located at the site of the study, rendering geographic separation less of a barrier to the conduction of multisite studies. The electronic format of the data can enable real-time statistical processing while data are stored using existing database technologies. In theory, automated processing of variables within such a database enables early identification of data trends. Methods of ensuring validity, security, and compliance are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Recent studies have suggested that changes in serum phosphate levels influence pathological states associated with aging such as cancer, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular function, even in individuals with normal renal function. The causes are only beginning to be elucidated but are likely a combination of endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and cell autonomous effects. We have used an integrated quantitative biology approach, combining transcriptomics and proteomics to define a multi-phase, extracellular phosphate-induced, signaling network in pre-osteoblasts as well as primary human and mouse mesenchymal stromal cells. We identified a rapid mitogenic response stimulated by elevated phosphate that results in the induction of immediate early genes including c-fos. The mechanism of activation requires FGF receptor signaling followed by stimulation of N-Ras and activation of AP-1 and serum response elements. A distinct long-term response also requires FGF receptor signaling and results in N-Ras activation and expression of genes and secretion of proteins involved in matrix regulation, calcification, and angiogenesis. The late response is synergistically enhanced by addition of FGF23 peptide. The intermediate phase results in increased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production and is necessary for the late response providing a functional link between the phases. Collectively, the results define elevated phosphate, as a mitogen and define specific mechanisms by which phosphate stimulates proliferation and matrix regulation. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the cellular response to elevated extracellular phosphate, functionally connecting temporally coordinated signaling, transcriptional, and metabolic events with changes in long-term cell behavior.

AB  - Abstract This article examines the normative underpinnings of ?trust talk?, asking how biomedical discourse constructs racial group boundaries and what implications this has for our understanding of the politics of medicine more broadly. Drawing upon a 2-year multi-method study of the world's largest stem cell research initiative and extending key insights from the sociology of race?ethnicity and social studies of science and medicine, this paper identifies three ways in which discourse in the stem cell field constructs racial group boundaries ? through diversity outreach, clinical gatekeeping, and charismatic collaborations. In so doing, the paper also explicates counter-narratives ? medical racial profiling, subversive whiteness, and biopolitical minstrelsy ? as forms of discursive resistance that challenge the normative underpinnings of recruitment discourse.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim:? Inflammation plays a pivotal role in liver injury. Gabexate mesilate (GM, a protease inhibitor) inhibits inflammation by blocking various serine proteases. This study examined the effects of GM on hepatic encephalopathy in rats with acute and chronic liver failure. Methods:? Acute and chronic liver failure (cirrhosis) were induced by intraperitoneal TAA administration (350?mg/kg/day for 3?days) and common bile duct ligation, respectively, in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were randomized to receive either GM (50?mg/10?mL/kg) or saline intraperitoneally for 5?days. Severity of encephalopathy was assessed by the Opto-Varimex animal activity meter and hemodynamic parameters, mean arterial pressure and portal pressure, were measured (only in chronic liver failure rats). Plasma levels of liver biochemistry, ammonia, nitrate/nitrite, interleukins (IL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined. Results:? In rats with acute liver failure, GM treatment significantly decreased the plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (P?=?0.02), but no significant difference of motor activity, plasma levels of ammonia, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α or survival was found. In chronic liver failure rats, GM significantly lowered the plasma TNF-α levels (P?=?0.04). However, there was no significant difference of motor activity, other biochemical tests or survival found. GM-treated chronic liver failure rats had higher portal pressure (P?=?0.04) but similar mean arterial pressure in comparison with saline-treated rats. Conclusions:? Chronic GM treatment does not have a major effect on hepatic encephalopathy in rats with TAA-induced acute liver failure and rats with chronic liver failure induced by common bile duct ligation.

AB  - Abstract Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes continuous neurological deficits and major sensory-motor impairments. There is no effective treatment to enhance sensory-motor function following SCI. Thus, it is crucial to develop novel therapeutics for this particular patient population. Astaxanthin (AST) is a strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. In the present study, it was tested in a severe compression SCI model with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes, signalling pathway, along with other complications. Methods A severe SCI was induced by compression of the rat thoracic spinal cord with an aneurysm clip and treatment with AST or the vehicle was carried out, 30 min after injury. Behavioural tests including open field, von Frey, hot plate and BBB were performed weekly to 28 days post-injury. Rats were assigned to measure blood glucose, weight and auricle temperature. Western blot and histological analysis also were performed at the same time points. Results AST decreased mechanical and thermal pain and also improved motor function performance, reduced blood glucose and auricle temperature increases and attenuated weight loss in SCI rats. Western blot analysis showed decreased activation of ERK1/2 and increased activation of AKT following AST treatment. The histology results revealed that AST considerably preserved myelinated white matter and the number of motor neurons following SCI. Conclusion Taken together, the beneficial effects of AST to improve sensory-motor outcomes, attenuate pathological tissue damage and modulate ERK and AKT signalling pathways following SCI, suggest it as a strong therapeutic agent towards clinical applications. Significance Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs sensory-motor function and causes complications, which astaxanthin (AST) has the potential to be used as a treatment for. The present study investigates the effects of AST in a compression model of SCI with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes alongside other complications, histopathological damage and also related signalling pathways.

AB  - GBS is characterized by ascending motor paresis, hypo/areflexia, minimal objective sensory symptoms, electrophysiological evidence of demyelination, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation. Several related syndromes are regarded as variants being the pathogenesis considered an autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve antigens. A 42-year-old veterinary was admitted because of severe myalgias following one-day high fever. Twelve hours later, he experienced dysphonia, dysphagia, and difficulty in chewing. Clinical examination showed: normal eye movements, bilateral facial weakness, tongue paralysis, limb and trunk sensory ataxia. Muscle strength was minimally affected and deep jerks were weakened. Sensory testing revealed distal loss for pin-prick, vibration, and position sense in the four extremities. Normal laboratory included emato-urinary tests, CK, rheumatology and endocrine profiles, microbiological and viral screenings. Search for enteric Campylobacter jejuni was negative. CSF protein was 160?mg/dl (normal?<?45). In serum, antiGQ1b IgG were elevated. On admission, electrophysiology was normal. Twenty days later, in motor nerves conduction velocity was normal whereas evidence of demyelination was limited to prolonged F-waves and terminal latencies. IVIG (0.4?g/kg/daily for five days) produced transient improvement. Because of relapse of sensory symptoms, 10 days later a course of PE was performed with benefit. Patient was followed clinically during six months showing almost complete recovery. In conclusion, we report an acute neuropathy with benign course, high protein in CSF, predominant involvement of sensory fibers, electrodiagnostic evidence of demyelination. The nosologic position of this case seems to fit the criteria of GBS sensory variant. The detection in serum of antiGQ1b IgG proposes similarities with FS and with ataxic GBS suggesting a continuity and a possible common autoimmune mechanism attacking either Schwann cells or motor axons.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children in the United States. Despite steady improvement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of acquired brain injuries, there has been remarkably little improvement in brain injury therapies and/or pharmacologic treatments over the past decade. One of the reasons may be the inability to properly stratify subjects for clinical trials and/or to have real-time assessment of the effectiveness of a given intervention. It has been recognized for several decades that serum biomarkers may allow for more objective subject stratification as well as act as surrogate markers of treatment efficacy. Despite numerous studies, however, biomarkers are not currently part of clinical practice in either acquired brain injury or other neurologic or musculoskeletal disorders. The goals of this review article, therefore, are to use traumatic brain injury as a example to discuss the use of biomarkers in clinical and randomized controlled trials; to briefly discuss the field of neuroproteomics and its interface with neurologic interventions; and to provide an overview of the collaborative pathway between academia and industry, which needs to be an integral part of the translation of biomarkers from the bench to the bedside in any clinical population. Introduction of the concept of rehabilomics and implications of biomarker use for the physical medicine and rehabilitation physician also are discussed.

AB  - Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. An important dose limiting side-effect of long term thalidomide treatment is peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide induces mainly an axonal sensory neuropathy whose incidence is scarcely known. We prospectively evaluated thalidomide-induced neuropathy using neurological examination and neurophysiological studies. 50 patients with diagnosed Multiple Myeloma were studied. Thalidomide was given at a dosage ranging from 100 to 400?mg/die, orally. Neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were evaluated prior and at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Neurological examination included Neurological Symptom Score and Neurological Disability Score. For NCS, amplitude of sensory and motor action potentials (SNAP and MAP) and conduction velocities of median, peroneal and sural nerves, with F wave recording, were evaluated. All patients were asymptomatic at baseline, with a normal neurological examination and NCS. A decline of the SNAP index of 40 % or more (SNAP amplitude at first examination was considered 100 %) was set as the diagnostic marker of axonal neuropathy. Out of 50 patients, 15 discontinued thalidomide for lack of therapeutic response, 15 remained on therapy for 3 months and 20 completed the treatment at 12 months. Incidence of neuropathy, as judged by clinical and neurophysiological criteria, was high (90%) in the group of patients with a 12 months follow up. On the contrary, the incidence of neuropathy in the group of patients with a 3 months follow up and in those treated with a lower dosage, was low (10?20%). In all the patients, who developed a neuropathy, the subjective symptoms preceded NCS abnormalities. Most common symptoms were paresthesias and reduced sensation with a stock and glove distribution. Our data support the view that thalidomide induces very frequently a dose-dependent axonal neuropathy with only a partial reversibility, and that NCS findings lack of a predictive value.

AB  - A 69-year-old right-handed man was recently referred to our institution with a two-month history of diplopia and ptosis in his left eye: the ocular symptoms typically fluctuates during the day, being least severe in the morning and worsening as the day progress or while reading or driving. Neostigmine injection produced a clear improvement of weakness. The serum concentration of anti-AChR antibody was elevated >?8.4?nmol/L (NV?<?0.4); a chest CT scan was unremarkable with no evidence of mediastinal mass. The clinical picture and laboratory tests support the diagnosis of ocular myasthenia. His past medical history was insignificant until the age of 59. At that time, he complained with a diffuse, slightly asymmetrical muscle weakness both in the upper and lower limbs and sensory symptoms of glove and stocking distribution (numbness). A progressive course over months was seen with hand and anterior leg muscles hypertrophy becoming evident. Strength was decreased distally greater than proximally in the upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent. The cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a protein level of 72?mg/dl (NV?<?45?mg/dl). Nerve conduction study showed a multifocal sensory-motor polyneuropathy with both conduction block/temporal dispersion of the C-MAP and slowing of the velocity. A diagnosis of chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) was considered and the patient was treated with steroids, plasmapheresis and azathiaprine: after a slight improvement, the condition has been stabilized. Both MG and CIDP have been individually associated with disorders of presumed autoimmune pathogenesis. Their concurrence is rarely found (less than 10 cases to the best of our knowledge): although the existence of this syndrome can be strongly supported by the clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory data, a common basic abnormality of immune regulation is still unknown.
