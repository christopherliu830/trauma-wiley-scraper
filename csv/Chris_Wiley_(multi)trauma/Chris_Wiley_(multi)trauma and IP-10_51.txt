AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetic neuropathy characterized by a length-dependent degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers. Whereas all authors agree that weakening starts from the intrinsic foot muscles, there is still controversy whether the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) is weak or not in the early stages of the disease. To know this could be important either to understand how the cavus deformity develops or, consequently, to adopt surgical (tendon transfers) and conservative (orthotics, physiotherapy) strategies for prevention or early correction. We measured the power of TA in 110 feet of 62 patients (41 CMT1A, 1 CMT1B, 9 CMT1 without genetic evaluation, 5 CMTX, and 6 CMT2) fitting in the first two stages of the functional classification proposed by Vinci and Perelli. Thirty-one feet were at stage 1 (forefootdrop or mild footdrop: leg-sole angle?>90<?=?100) and 79 at stage 2 (same as stage 1 plus foot rotation on the longitudinal axis: heel angle <0 or >10). Muscle strength was measured by the manual muscle testing and scores according to the Medical Research Council scale. TA power graded 5/5 in 87 (79.1%) feet, 4/5 in 17 (15.5%) and 2/5 in 6 (5.4%). TA was strong (MRC 4/5 and 5/5) in the large majority (94.6%) of the feet in the two earlier stages of the disease. Interestingly, the 6 patients with weaker TA had CMT2. These results support our hypothesis that, in the earliest phase of CMT, foot rotation is due to a stronger and hyperactivated TA, which compensates the footdrop caused by the deficit of the metatarsophalangeal joint stabilization and, in many cases, is not balanced by the weak peroneal muscles.

AB  - Abstract Guanosine (Guo) is an endogenous neuroprotective molecule of the CNS, which has various acute and long-term effects on both neurones and astroglial cells. Whether Guo also modulates the activity/expression of ion channels involved in homeostatic control of extracellular potassium by the astrocytic syncytium is still unknown. Here we provide electrophysiological evidence that chronic exposure (48?h) to Guo (500??m) promotes the functional expression of an inward rectifier K+ (Kir) conductance in primary cultured rat cortical astrocytes. Molecular screening indicated that Guo promotes the up-regulation of the Kir4.1 channel, the major component of the Kir current in astroglia in vivo. Furthermore, the properties of astrocytic Kir current overlapped those of the recombinant Kir4.1 channel expressed in a heterologous system, strongly suggesting that the Guo-induced Kir conductance is mainly gated by Kir4.1. In contrast, the expression levels of two other Kir channel proteins were either unchanged (Kir2.1) or decreased (Kir5.1). Finally, we showed that inhibition of translational process, but not depression of transcription, prevents the Guo-induced up-regulation of Kir4.1, indicating that this nucleoside acts through de novo protein synthesis. Because accumulating data indicate that down-regulation of astroglial Kir current contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dysregulation of extracellular K+ homeostasis, these results support the notion that Guo might be a molecule of therapeutic interest for counteracting the detrimental effect of K+-buffering impairment of the astroglial syncytium that occurs in pathological conditions.

AB  - Abstract Body awareness and reactivity dysfunction are characteristic of a range of psychiatric disorders. Although the neural pathways communicating between the body and brain that contribute to these experiences involve the autonomic nervous system, few research tools for studying subjective bodily experiences have been informed by these neural circuits. This paper describes the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the Body Awareness and Autonomic Reactivity subscales of the Body Perception Questionnaire-Short Form (BPQ-SF). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to data from three samples collected via the internet in Spain and the US and a college population in the US (combined n = 1320). Body awareness was described by a single factor. Autonomic reactivity reflected unique factors for organs above and below the diaphragm. Subscales showed strong reliability; converged with validation measures; and differed by age, sex, medication use, and self-reported psychiatric disorder. Post hoc analyses were used to create the 12-item Body Awareness Very Short Form. Results are discussed in relation to the distinct functions of supra- and sub-diaphragmatic autonomic pathways as proposed by the Polyvagal Theory and their potential dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The vanilloid receptor VR-1 is a non-selective ligand-gated channel, structurally related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. It responds to noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heating in the noxious range, and extracellular acidification. It is able to integrate simultaneous exposure to these stimuli and is involved in different forms of tissue hypersensitivity. VR-1 is predominantly expressed in small-diameter neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which give rise to unmyelinated sensory nerve fibers, but its immunoreactivity in human nerve fibers is not known. We assessed the expression of VR-1 in human intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of hairy and glabrous skin and in sural nerve biopsy. Skin biopsies were taken from proximal thigh, distal leg, trunk, arm, and fingertip in 10 healthy subjects. Immunohistochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies using polyclonal anti-PGP 9.5 (PGP), monoclonal anti-unique b-tubulin (TuJ1), and polyclonal anti-human VR-1 antibodies were performed. Double staining studies were carried out in the following combinations: PGP-TuJ1 and TuJ1-VR-1. In each site, PGP-positive IENF showed TuJ1 labeling and, most interestingly, VR-1 diffusely co-localized with all TuJ1-positive IENF. These findings indirectly demonstrated the co-localization between VR-1 and the panaxonal marker PGP in IENF. VR-1 immunoreactivity was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sural nerve sections from a patient without morphological signs of sensory involvement. Almost 2/3 of unmyelinated fibers showed an intense VR-1 immunoreactivity, which was present also in smooth muscle cells of perineurial and epineurial arterioles. VR-1 immunolabeling was absent in myelinated fibers and in part of unmyelinated fibers, which possibly represented autonomic fibers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that VR-1 is widely expressed in somatic human unmyelinated nerve fibers. Particularly, the diffuse immunoreactivity of IENF, which are naked terminals of small-diameter DRG sensory neurons, suggests that they are essential for selective modalities of nociception and primarily involved in neuropathic hyperalgesia.

AB  - Background Approximately 5%?10% of newly born babies need intervention to assist transition from intra- to extrauterine life. All providers in the delivery ward are trained in neonatal resuscitation, but without clinical experience or exposure, training competency is transient with a decline in skills within a few months. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether neonatal resuscitations skills and team performance would improve after implementation of video-assisted, performance-focused debriefings. Methods We installed motion-activated video cameras in every resuscitation bay capturing consecutive compromised neonates. The videos were used in debriefings led by two experienced facilitators, focusing on guideline adherence and non-technical skills. A modification of Neonatal Resuscitation Performance Evaluation (NRPE) was used to score team performance and procedural skills during a 7 month study period (2.5, 2.5 and 2 months pre-, peri- and post-implementation) (median score with 95% confidence interval). Results We compared 74 resuscitation events pre-implementation to 45 events post-implementation. NRPE-score improved from 77% (75, 81) to 89% (86, 93), P < 0.001. Specifically, the sub-categories ?group function/communication?, ?preparation and initial steps?, and ?positive pressure ventilation? improved (P < 0.005). Adequate positive pressure ventilation improved from 43% to 64% (P = 0.03), and pauses during initial ventilation decreased from 20% to 0% (P = 0.02). Proportion of infants with heart rate > 100 bpm at 2 min improved from 71% pre- vs. 82% (P = 0.22) post-implementation. Conclusion Implementation of video-assisted, performance-focused debriefings improved adherence to best practice guidelines for neonatal resuscitation skill and team performance.

AB  - *Software NEUROPA based on the ?consensus? Committee for standardization of measurements on polyneuropathy of the Gruppo di Studio Sistema Nervoso Periferico (Antonimi G, Cavaletti G, Di Iorio G Fabrizi G, Galardi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Ghirlanda P, Lori S, Nobile-Orazio E, Padua L, Scarpini E, Schenone A, Tonali P, Uncini A, Vita G). Kind of study: survey prospective multicentric multidimensional study. Aim of the study: to evaluate the characteristic (including disability and Health Related Quality of life - HRQoL) a representative sample of patients with suspected, or diagnosed, polyneuropathy (or multineuropathy) admitted in neurological centers. The HRQoL dimension of the study was developed with the collaboration of the Quality of Life Study group of the Italian Neurological Society. Timing: The period of enrollment started on 1-10-02 e will end on 30-01-03. Acquired data: Besides clinical data we acquire data on the diagnostic pathway the patients have done, disability, HRQoL. All the data are monthly sent to the Department of Neuroscience of Università Cattolica where statistical analysis will be performed. Conclusion: The acquired data will provide information on 1) the frequency of the different type of disease we have to study in the different kind of centers; 2) the clinical picture and the actual involvement in daily activity of this kind of patients and therefore the priority we have to give them; 3) the necessities of the neurological centers where this kind of patients are admitted and therefore what we have to requests to the national and regional sanitary service to better study this kind of patients and to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. # Antonini G, Bacci A, Cardinali P, Cavalletti G, Cocito D, Corbo, Di Iorio, Fabrizi GM, Fazio R, Galassi G, Gemignani F, Giannini F, Girlanda P, Insola A, Liguori R, Maggio M, Mazzeo A, Messina C, Murasecco D, Nemni R, Nobile Orazio E, Pareyson D, Porazzi D, Quattrini A, Ragno M, Rizzuto N, Romano M, Santoro L, Sartucci F, Sabatelli M, Schenone A, Sghirlanzoni, Siciliano G, Villacara A, Vita G.

AB  - Thalidomide seems to be effective in the treatment of cutaneous forms of lupus erythematosus refractory to other therapies. Peripheral neuropathy is the most severe side effect, but the incidence of neuropathy and its relation to thalidomide doses are still unclear. We prospectively monitored 12 patients treated with thalidomide for cutaneous lupus erythematosus in order to estimate the occurrence of side effects, particularly peripheral neuropathy. A total of 12 female patients, median age 38,6 years (range 26?56), with subacute or chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus were considered. The patients were treated with low dose thalidomide (starting dose 100?mg, tapered to 50?mg/day or 50?mg alternative day) for up to 18 months. The average follow-up period was 8,6 months (range 2?18). Prior to, and regularly during treatment patients underwent neurological evaluation and electrophysiological study of at least 8 nerves in the 4 arms (ulnar, median, sural, peroneal nerves). At recruitment, one patient presented a sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy. Of the remaining 11 patients, six did not present electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy, one had a carpal tunnel syndrome and four showed slowing of ulnar nerve velocity at elbow. No patients developed neuropathy neither worsening of electrophysiological parameters during thalidomide treatment. The most common side effect was tremor, always reversible after withdrawing or reducing thalidomide. Paresthesias, somnolence, amenhorrea, constipation were also present. Only one patient had to stop the therapy for the occurrence, 10 days after taking 50?mg of thalidomide, of a severe, stabbing, ?zoster-like? thoracic pain, which disappeared upon withdrawal of the drug. Started again on thalidomide, the symptoms reappeared and the patient definitely interrupted the therapy with benefit. All the 11 patients who continued on the therapy presented a significant improvement or remission of the cutaneous alterations. These preliminary data seem to indicate that low dose thalidomide is efficacious and tolerable for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Peripheral neuropathy seems not to be a major side effect. A longer follow-up and the study of more patients are needed to confirm the results.

AB  - Adhesions are a common and unfortunate consequence of most abdominal surgical operations, which start to form within three hours of surgery. Some patients form extensive permanent adhesions that can cause abdominal or pelvic pain, infertility and bowel obstruction. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the extent of this problem and the cost to the Health Service, and although there are numerous approaches to prevent adhesion formation by careful laparoscopic or microsurgical techniques or the use of various adhesion barriers, no method so far has proved completely efficacious in randomised controlled trials. This article reviews the pathogenesis of adhesions, the epidemiological data and the various methods used to try to prevent their formation.

AB  - Abstract This work demonstrates how the rapid steady state T1 MRI technique for cerebral blood volume fraction (BVf) quantification can be used with intraperitoneal Gd-DOTA injections in mice at 4.7 T. The peak signal amplitude after intravenous administration (0.7 mmol/kg) and the steady state signal amplitude reached 15 min after intraperitoneal administration (6 mmol/kg) in the same mice lead to equivalent BVf measures in the order of 0.02 in the brain. The resulting time window for BVf quantification is ≈30 min and allows for cerebral BVf mapping with increased spatial resolution or signal-to-noise ratio, or for monitoring functional BVf changes. A cerebral BVf increase of up to 25% induced by the vasodilator acetazolamide was observed, validating the vascular origin of the signal. The noninvasive and quantitative rapid steady state T1 technique can be used in serial studies to evaluate new drugs or disease models, such as antiangiogenic therapies in tumors.

AB  - Abstract Neural stem cells (NSCs) exist in vascularized niches. Although there has been ample evidence supporting a role for endothelial cell-derived soluble factors as modulators of neural stem cell self-renewal and neuronal differentiation there is a paucity of data reported on neural stem cell modulation of endothelial cell behavior. We show that co-culture of NSCs with brain-derived endothelial cells (BECs) either in direct contact or separated by a porous membrane elicited robust vascular tube formation and maintenance, mediated by induction of vascular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of vascular VEGFR2 and TrkB by NSC NO. Nitric oxide (NO) scavengers and sequestration of VEGF and BDNF blunted this induction of tube formation, whereas addition of exogenous NO donor, rBDNF and rVEGF rescued the induction of tube formation. Further, rBDNF enhanced NSC eNOS activation and NO generation, suggesting an inducible positive feed-back signaling loop between NSCs and BECs, providing for homeostasis and responsiveness of the resident NSCs and BECs comprising the neurovascular niche. These findings show the importance of reciprocal modulation of NSCs and BECs in induction and maintenance of the neurovascular niche and underscores their dynamic interactions. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
