AB  - Abstract The need to develop a blood substitute is now urgent because of the increasing concern over Europe's BSE outbreak and the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic, which have cut blood supplies. Extracellular soluble hemoglobin has long been studied for its possible use as a safe and effective alternative to blood transfusion, but this has met with little success. Clinical trials have revealed undesirable side effects?oxidative damage and vasoconstriction?that hamper the application of cellfree hemoglobin as a blood substitute. We have addressed these problems and have found a new promising extracellular blood substitute: the natural giant extracellular polymeric hemoglobin of the polychaete annelid Arenicola marina. Here we show that it is less likely to cause immunogenic response; its functional and structural properties should prevent the side effects often associated with the administration of extracellular hemoglobin. Moreover, its intrinsic properties are of interest for other therapeutic applications often associated with hemorrhagic shock (ischemia reperfusion, treatment of septic shock and for organ preservation prior to transplantation). Moreover, using natural hemoglobin is particularly useful since recombinant DNA techniques could be used to express the protein in large quantities.

AB  - Abstract Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been known to play an important role in pathological conditions, specifically in response to inflammation, infection and injury to cells. Recently, several research teams have been interested in investigating its association with cognition during the progression of pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that LCN2 is not correlated with cognitive function under normal physiological conditions, although LCN2 has been negatively associated with cognition and some neuropathologies. Increasing LCN2 production is associated with reduced cognitive performance in a rodent model. However, further studies are needed to explore the potential underlying mechanisms of LCN2 on cognitive dysfunction, as well as its clinical relevance. This review aims to summarise the evidence available from in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies concerning the possible role of LCN2 on cognitive function following the onset of pathological conditions. Any contradictory evidence is also assessed and presented.

AB  - ABSTRACT Inflammatory factors secreted by microglia play an important role in focal ischemic stroke. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a known regulator of immune responses, but the role that mTORC1 signaling plays in poststroke neuroinflammation is not clear. To explore the relationship between microglial action in the mTORC1 pathway and the impact on stroke, we administered the mTORC1 inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus to mice. Presumably, disrupting the mTORC1 pathway after focal ischemic stroke should clarify the subsequent activity of microglia. For that purpose, we generated mice deficient in the regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) in microglia, whose mTORC1 signaling was blocked, by crossing Raptor loxed (Raptorflox/flox) mice with CX3CR1CreER mice, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 promoter. mTORC1 blockade reduced lesion size, improved motor function, dramatically decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduced the number of M1 type microglia. Thus, mTORC1 blockade apparently attenuated behavioral deficits and poststroke inflammation after middle cerebral artery occlusion by preventing microglia polarization toward the M1 type.?Li, D., Wang, C., Yao, Y., Chen, L., Liu, G., Zhang, R., Liu, Q., Shi, F.-D., Hao, J. mTORC1 pathway disruption ameliorates brain inflammation following stroke via a shift in microglia phenotype from M1 type to M2 type.

AB  - Because there have been few comprehensive histopathologic studies of meningomyeloceles and related malformations, we undertook a systematic study of these lesions. One hundred and thirty two cases were obtained from our surgical pathology files; these included 38 meningoceles, 71 meningomyeloceles, and 23 encephaloceles. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin; special stains included trichrome, alcian blue, Fontana-Masson, Nissl, Holzer, and immunoperoxidase for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Epithelial changes included ulceration, atrophy, or nevoid hyperplasia of the epidermis, and loss of appendages. Mesodermal features included fibrous zones resembling dura, subarachnoid tissue or scar (99% of cases), increased numbers of blood vessels (83%), hypertrophy of arrector pili muscle (42%), lipoma formation (38%), and immature skeletal muscle fibers (5%) that rarely intermingled with neuropil-like matrix. The latter tissue was identified in 71% of cases and included neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and ependyma. Forty-eight percent of cases included peripheral nerve fibers or roots, and some fibers formed onion bulb or Pacinian corpuscle-like structures. Meningothelial cells were observed in 26% of cases and sometimes formed recognizable whorls. Choroid plexus was noted in 3 cases, one example showing an unusual dystrophic calcification that formed long parallel spicules. Pigmented dendritic cells were observed within zones of fibrous tissue in 10% of cases. These malformations involve complex arrangements of cutaneous, neuroectodermal, and mesodermal elements. Because they may be encountered by dermatopathologists, familiarity with the microscopic features of dysraphic lesions is essential.

AB  - Abstract We report on a 5-year-old female born to consanguineous parents, ascertained at the age of 23?months for an elevated plasma methionine level, a mildly abnormal total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), and elevated aminotransferases. She had global developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, hypotonia, nystagmus and tremor in her upper extremities. Metabolic investigations demonstrated elevations in plasma methionine, plasma S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), with normal urine adenosine levels. Some of the elevations persisted for over 1?year. Sequencing of the ADK and AHCY genes was negative for causative variants. Plasma methionine normalized 1?year after ascertainment, but SAM and SAH continued to be elevated for six more months before normalization, and aminotransferases remained mildly elevated. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated a homozygous pathogenic variant; NM_018297.3(NGLY1):c.1405C>T (p.Arg469*) in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene, for which both parents were heterozygous. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NGLY1 deficiency with elevations in plasma methionine, SAM and SAH and a slight elevation of tHcy. Less than 20 patients have been reported with NGLY1 deficiency worldwide and this case expands on the biochemical phenotype of this newly discovered inborn error of metabolism.

AB  - SUMMARY Treatment by injection or infusion is widespread in China. Using the common cold as a tracer condition, we explored the reasons for over-prescription of injections and infusions in Guizhou, China. Interviews with prescribers, patients and key informants were supplemented by focus groups. These revealed how historical ideas encourage unnecessary use of percutaneous treatment: faith in the healing power of needles is locally attributed to association with acupuncture. Many patients and some staff believe that injections per se are therapeutic. However, the structure of health service financing and remuneration now reinforces this irrational faith. Market-based reforms have attempted to control costs and increase productivity with an incentive scheme which rewards prescribers financially for over-prescription in general and for use of injections and infusions in particular. Aggressive marketing has displaced oral treatment from health facilities into independent pharmacies, leaving doctors functioning mainly as injection providers. There is a need for a multi-faceted response encompassing education and reform of financial incentives to reduce the use of unnecessary treatment. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary In plants, there can be a trade-off between resource allocations to growth vs defense. Here, we use partial correlation analysis of gene expression to make inferences about the nature of this interaction. We studied segregating progenies of Interior spruce subject to weevil attack. In a controlled experiment, we measured pre-attack plant growth and post-attack damage with several morphological measures, and profiled transcriptomes of 188 progeny. We used partial correlations of individual transcripts (expressed sequence tags, ESTs) with pairs of growth/defense traits to identify important nodes and edges in the inferred underlying gene network, for example, those pairs of growth/defense traits with high mutual correlation with a single EST transcript. We give a method to identify such ESTs. A terpenoid ABC transporter gene showed strongest correlations (P = 0.019); its transcript represented a hub within the compact 166-member gene?gene interaction network (P = 0.004) of the negative genetic correlations between growth and subsequent pest attack. A small 21-member interaction network (P = 0.004) represented the uncovered positive correlations. Our study demonstrates partial correlation analysis identifies important gene networks underlying growth and susceptibility to the weevil in spruce. In particular, we found transcripts that strongly modify the trade-off between growth and defense, and allow identification of networks more central to the trade-off.
