AB  - Summary In plants, there can be a trade-off between resource allocations to growth vs defense. Here, we use partial correlation analysis of gene expression to make inferences about the nature of this interaction. We studied segregating progenies of Interior spruce subject to weevil attack. In a controlled experiment, we measured pre-attack plant growth and post-attack damage with several morphological measures, and profiled transcriptomes of 188 progeny. We used partial correlations of individual transcripts (expressed sequence tags, ESTs) with pairs of growth/defense traits to identify important nodes and edges in the inferred underlying gene network, for example, those pairs of growth/defense traits with high mutual correlation with a single EST transcript. We give a method to identify such ESTs. A terpenoid ABC transporter gene showed strongest correlations (P = 0.019); its transcript represented a hub within the compact 166-member gene?gene interaction network (P = 0.004) of the negative genetic correlations between growth and subsequent pest attack. A small 21-member interaction network (P = 0.004) represented the uncovered positive correlations. Our study demonstrates partial correlation analysis identifies important gene networks underlying growth and susceptibility to the weevil in spruce. In particular, we found transcripts that strongly modify the trade-off between growth and defense, and allow identification of networks more central to the trade-off.

AB  - Summary The most morbid form of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains critical limb ischemia (CLI) associated with rest pain, gangrene or limb loss. This chapter reviews the basic epidemiology of distal tibial and forefoot disease, outlines the indications for percutaneous therapy of this vascular territory, and explores procedural considerations for modern distal extremity endovascular interventions. Patients with history and physical exam findings concerning for CLI should generally have non-invasive testing to establish a diagnosis. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a simple yet powerful tool and usually the first test of choice to detect PAD. Contralateral femoral access remains the most common approach to treat infrainguinal PAD, but may have limitations when trying to treat infrapopliteal lesions. To address the limitations of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), stenting has been employed to treat flow-limiting dissections or persistent restenosis. To combat the risk of restenosis, antineoproliferative therapy has been explored in both drug-eluting stents (DESs) and drug-eluting balloons (DEBs).

AB  - Abstract EFSA received a request from the Hellenic Food Authority for a scientific opinion on estimation of the risk to human health from the presence of chromium (Cr) in food, particularly in vegetables, and Cr(VI) in bottled water. The CONTAM Panel derived a TDI of 0.3 mg/kg b.w. per day for Cr(III) from the lowest NOAEL identified in an NTP chronic oral toxicity study in rats. Under the assumption that all chromium in food is Cr(III), the mean and 95th percentile dietary exposure across all age groups were well below the TDI and therefore does not raise concerns for public health. In the case of drinking water, the Panel considered all chromium in water as Cr(VI). For non-neoplastic effects the lowest BMDL10 for diffuse epithelial hyperplasia of duodenum in female mice and the lowest BMDL05 for haematotoxicity in male rats in a 2-year NTP study were selected as reference points. The MOEs indicate that for non-neoplastic effects the current exposure levels to Cr(VI) via drinking water are of no concern for public health. For neoplastic effects, the CONTAM Panel selected a lowest BMDL10 for combined adenomas and carcinomas of the mouse small intestine as the reference point. Overall, the calculated MOEs indicate low concern regarding Cr(VI) intake via drinking water (water intended for human consumption and natural mineral waters) for all age groups when considering the mean chronic exposure values with the exception of infants at the upper bound (UB) exposure estimates. MOEs below 10 000 were calculated at the UB 95th percentile exposure estimates, particularly for ?Infants?, ?Toddlers? and ?Other children?, which were highly influenced by the relatively high occurrence values under the UB assumption. To improve the risk assessment, there is a need for data on the content of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in food and drinking water.

AB  - ABSTRACT Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by episodic yet cumulative heterotopic ossification (HO) in skeletal muscles, tendons, and ligaments over a patient's lifetime. FOP is caused by missense mutations in the type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor ACVR1. We have determined that the formation of heterotopic bone in FOP requires activation of mutant ACVR1 by Activin A, in part by showing that prophylactic inhibition of Activin A blocks HO in a mouse model of FOP. Here we piece together a natural history of developing HO lesions in mouse FOP, and determine where in the continuum of HO Activin A is required, using imaging (T2-MRI, ?CT, 18F-NaF PET/CT, histology) coupled with pharmacologic inhibition of Activin A at different times during the progression of HO. First, we show that expansion of HO lesions comes about through growth and fusion of independent HO events. These events tend to arise within a neighborhood of existing lesions, indicating that already formed HO likely triggers the formation of new events. The process of heterotopic bone expansion appears to be dependent on Activin A because inhibition of this ligand suppresses the growth of nascent HO lesions and stops the emergence of new HO events. Therefore, our results reveal that Activin A is required at least up to the point when nascent HO lesions mineralize and further demonstrate the therapeutic utility of Activin A inhibition in FOP. These results provide evidence for a model where HO is triggered by inflammation but becomes ?self-propagating? by a process that requires Activin A. ? 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Membrane lesions play an early role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Using a new albumin-targeted contrast agent (MS-325), sarcolemmal integrity of two animal models for muscular dystrophy was studied by MRI. Intravenously injected MS-325 does not enter skeletal muscle of normal mice. However, mdx and Sgca-null mutant mice, animal models for Duchenne and sarcoglycan-deficient limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, respectively, showed significant accumulation of MS-325 in skeletal muscle. The results suggest that contrast agent-enhanced MRI could serve as a common, noninvasive imaging procedure for evaluating the localization, extent, and mechanisms of skeletal muscle damage in muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, this method is expected to facilitate assessment of therapeutic approaches in these diseases. Magn Reson Med 44:655?659, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective Autoimmune disease is an emerging condition among persons exposed to the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center (WTC). Components of the dust cloud resulting from the collapse of the WTC have been associated with systemic autoimmune diseases (SAID), as has posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We sought to determine whether dust exposure and PTSD were associated with an increased risk of SAID in a 9/11-exposed cohort. Methods Among 43,133 WTC Health Registry enrollees, 2,786 self-reported a post-9/11 SAID. We obtained consent to review medical records to validate SAID diagnoses for 1,041. SAIDs were confirmed by classification criteria, rheumatologist diagnosis, or having been prescribed SAID medication. Controls were enrollees who denied an autoimmune disease diagnosis (n=37,017). We used multivariable log-binomial regression to examine the association between multiple 9/11 exposures and risk of post-9/11 SAID, stratifying by responders and community members. Results We identified 118 persons with SAID. Rheumatoid arthritis was most frequent (n=71), followed by Sj?gren?s syndrome (n=22), systemic lupus erythematosus (n=20), myositis (n=9), mixed connective tissue disease (n=7), and scleroderma (n=4). Among 9/11 responders, those with intense dust cloud exposure had almost twice the risk of SAID (adjusted risk ratio =1.86, 95% CI=1.02-3.40). Community members with PTSD had a nearly three-fold increased risk of SAID. Conclusion Intense dust cloud exposure among responders and PTSD among community members were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of new-onset SAID. Clinicians treating 9/11 survivors should be aware of the potential increased risk of SAID in this population.

AB  - Abstract Inflammation and immunity development are well recognized as responses to tumor treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT). To demonstrate that another major host response effector process, acute phase response, may be also induced by this cancer treatment modality, the expression of serum amyloid P component (SAP) acknowledged as a hallmark acute phase reactant in the mouse was investigated following PDT of murine FsaR fibrosarcomas. The results reveal almost 150-fold increase in the expression of SAP gene in the liver of mice bearing tumors treated by Photofrin-mediated PDT, while serum SAP levels increased around 50-fold at the peak interval about 24 hr post PDT. The same tumor treatment induced also the liver gene upregulation and serum levels elevation of another established acute phase reactant, mannose-binding lectin A (MBL-A). Both SAP and MBL-A were found to accumulate in PDT-treated tumors, but this includes local production because their genes in these tumor tissues were upregulated as well. Gene encoding C-reactive protein (CRP) was also upregulated almost 7-fold in the same tumor tissues, suggesting a rare example of CRP participation in host response of the mouse. Interleukin-6 and glucocorticoid hormones were identified as major mediators promoting tumor PDT-induced upregulation of liver SAP gene. Moreover, glucocorticoids were found to act as critical inducers of SAP gene upregulation in PDT-treated tumors. The study definitely proves the occurrence of a strong acute phase response following tumor PDT, and reveals that glucocorticoid hormones released during this development impact the expression of host response-relevant genes in PDT-treated tumors. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Nicotine use remains highly prevalent with tobacco and e-cigarette products consumed worldwide. However, increasing evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance suggests that nicotine use may alter behavior and neurobiology in subsequent generations. We tested the effects of chronic paternal nicotine exposure in C57BL6/J mice on fear conditioning in F1 and F2 offspring, as well as conditioned fear extinction and spontaneous recovery, nicotine self-administration, hippocampal cholinergic functioning, RNA expression, and DNA methylation in F1 offspring. Paternal nicotine exposure was associated with enhanced contextual and cued fear conditioning and spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear memories. Further, nicotine reinforcement was reduced in nicotine-sired mice, as assessed in a self-administration paradigm. These behavioral phenotypes were coupled with altered response to nicotine, upregulated hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding, reduced evoked hippocampal cholinergic currents, and altered methylation and expression of hippocampal genes related to neural development and plasticity. Gene expression analysis suggests multigenerational effects on broader gene networks potentially involved in neuroplasticity and mental disorders. The changes in fear conditioning similarly suggest phenotypes analogous to anxiety disorders similar to post-traumatic stress.

AB  - Abstract Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with chronic progressive liver disease. Its global epidemiology is still not well ascertained and its impact will be confronted with a higher burden in the next decade. Aim: The goal of this study was to develop a tool that can be used to predict the future prevalence of the disease in different countries and, more importantly, to understand the cause and effect relationship between the key assumptions and future trends. Methods: A system approach was used to build a simulation model where each population was modeled with the appropriate inflows and outflows. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify the key drivers of future prevalence. Results: The total HCV-infected population in the US was estimated to decline 24% from 3.15 million in 2005 to 2.47 million in 2021, while disease burden will increase as the remaining infected population ages. During the same period, the mortality rate was forecasted to increase from 2.1 to 3.1%. The diagnosed population was 50% of the total infections, while less than 2% of the total infections were treated. Conclusion: We have created a framework to evaluate the HCV-infected populations in countries around the world. This model may help assess the impact of policies to meet the challenges predicted by the evolution of HCV infection and disease. This prediction tool may help to target new public health strategies.

AB  - Abstract CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that RNAi knock down of CDK5 reduced the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and prevented neuronal loss in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice. Here, we report that CDK5 RNAi protected against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity using primary hippocampal neurons transduced with adeno-associated virus 2.5 viral vector eGFP-tagged scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR during 12 days. Protection was dependent on a concomitant increase in p35 and was reversed using p35 RNAi, which affected the down-stream Rho GTPase activity. Furthermore, p35 over-expression and constitutively active Rac1 mimicked CDK5 silencing-induced neuroprotection. In addition, 3xTg-Alzheimer's disease mice (24 months old) were injected in the hippocampus with scrambled or CDK5 shRNA-miR, and spatial learning and memory were performed 3 weeks post-injection using ?Morris? water maze test. Our data showed that CDK5 knock down induced an increase in p35 protein levels and Rac activity in triple transgenic Alzheimer's mice, which correlated with the recovery of cognitive function; these findings confirm that increased p35 and active Rac are involved in neuroprotection. In summary, our data suggest that p35 acts as a mediator of Rho GTPase activity and contributes to the neuroprotection induced by CDK5 RNAi. CDK5 plays an important role in neurotransmission in the normal function of the adult brain, and dysregulation can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that p35/Rac1 signaling is critical in the CDK5 shRNAmiR-induced neuroprotection against glutamate neurotoxicity and is also correlated with the recovery of cognitive function in 3xTg-AD mice. CDK5 shRNAmiR blocks calpain activation, and the cleavage of p35 to p25 produced by glutamate, which generates neuroprotection in a p35 up-regulation dependent mode and its down-stream control of Rho GTPases, such as Rac1 and RhoA.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurologic injury, and currently, the only recommended pharmacotherapy is high-dose methylprednisolone, which has limited efficacy. Estrogen is a multi-active steroid with anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Estrogen may modulate intracellular Ca2+ and prevent inflammation. For this study, male rats were divided into three groups. Sham-group animals received a laminectomy at T12. Injured rats received both laminectomy and 40 gram centimeter force SCI. Estrogen-group rats received 4 mg/kg 17?-estradiol (estrogen) at 15 min and 24 hr post-injury, and vehicle-group rats received equal volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide. Animals were sacrificed at 48 hr post-injury, and 1-cm segments of the lesion, rostral penumbra, and caudal penumbra were excised. The degradation of 68 kD neurofilament protein (NFP) and estrogen receptors (ER) was examined by Western blot analysis. Protein levels of calpain and the activities of calpain and caspase-3 were also examined. Levels of cytochrome c were determined in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Cell death with DNA fragmentation was examined using the TUNEL assay. At the lesion, samples from both vehicle and estrogen treated animals showed increased levels of 68 kD NFP degradation, calpain content, calpain activity, cytochrome c release, and degradation of ERα and ER?, as compared to sham. In the caudal penumbra, estrogen treatment significantly attenuated 68 kD NFP degradation, calpain content, calpain activity, levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, and ER? degradation. At the lesion, vehicle-treated animals displayed more TUNEL+ cells, and estrogen treatment significantly attenuated this cell death marker. We conclude that estrogen may inhibit cell death in SCI through calpain inhibition. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
