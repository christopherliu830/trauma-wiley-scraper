AB  - We gathered information on the cost-effectiveness of life-saving interventions in the United States from publicly available economic analyses. ?Life-saving interventions? were defined as any behavioral and/or technological strategy that reduces the probability of premature death among a specified target population. We defined cost-effectiveness as the net resource costs of an intervention per year of life saved. To improve the comparability of cost-effectiveness ratios arrived at with diverse methods, we established fixed definitional goals and revised published estimates, when necessary and feasible, to meet these goals. The 587 interventions identified ranged from those that save more resources than they cost, to those costing more than 10 billion dollars per year of life saved. Overall, the median intervention costs $42,000 per life-year saved. The median medical intervention costs $19,000/life-year; injury reduction $48,000/life-year; and toxin control $2,800,000/life-year. Cost/life-year ratios and bibliographic references for more than 500 life-saving interventions are provided.

AB  - Abstract This review focuses on the application of nanomaterials for neural interfacing. The junction between nanotechnology and neural tissues can be particularly worthy of scientific attention for several reasons: (i) Neural cells are electroactive, and the electronic properties of nanostructures can be tailored to match the charge transport requirements of electrical cellular interfacing. (ii) The unique mechanical and chemical properties of nanomaterials are critical for integration with neural tissue as long-term implants. (iii) Solutions to many critical problems in neural biology/medicine are limited by the availability of specialized materials. (iv) Neuronal stimulation is needed for a variety of common and severe health problems. This confluence of need, accumulated expertise, and potential impact on the well-being of people suggests the potential of nanomaterials to revolutionize the field of neural interfacing. In this review, we begin with foundational topics, such as the current status of neural electrode (NE) technology, the key challenges facing the practical utilization of NEs, and the potential advantages of nanostructures as components of chronic implants. After that the detailed account of toxicology and biocompatibility of nanomaterials in respect to neural tissues is given. Next, we cover a variety of specific applications of nanoengineered devices, including drug delivery, imaging, topographic patterning, electrode design, nanoscale transistors for high-resolution neural interfacing, and photoactivated interfaces. We also critically evaluate the specific properties of particular nanomaterials?including nanoparticles, nanowires, and carbon nanotubes?that can be taken advantage of in neuroprosthetic devices. The most promising future areas of research and practical device engineering are discussed as a conclusion to the review.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The consequence of excessive liver resection is the inexorable development of progressive liver failure characterised by the typical stigmata associated with this condition, including worsening coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinaemia and encephalopathy. The focus of this review will be to investigate factors contributing to hepatocyte loss and impaired regeneration. Methods A literature search was undertaken of Pubmed and related search engines, examining for articles relating to hepatic failure following major hepatectomy. Results In spite of improvements in adjuvant chemotherapy and increasing surgical confidence and expertise, the parameters determining how much liver can be resected have remained largely unchanged. A number of preoperative, intraoperative and post-operative factors all contribute to the likelihood of liver failure after surgery. Conclusions Given the magnitude of the surgery, mortality and morbidity rates are extremely good. Careful patient selection and preservation of an obligate volume of remnant liver is essential. Modifiable causes of hepatic failure include avoidance of sepsis, drainage of cholestasis with restoration of enteric bile salts and judicious use of portal triad inflow occlusion intra-operatively. Avoidance of post-operative sepsis is most likely to be achieved by patient selection, meticulous intra-operative technique and post-operative care. Modulation of portal vein pressures post-operatively may further help reduce the risk of liver failure.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurologic injury, and currently, the only recommended pharmacotherapy is high-dose methylprednisolone, which has limited efficacy. Estrogen is a multi-active steroid with anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Estrogen may modulate intracellular Ca2+ and prevent inflammation. For this study, male rats were divided into three groups. Sham-group animals received a laminectomy at T12. Injured rats received both laminectomy and 40 gram centimeter force SCI. Estrogen-group rats received 4 mg/kg 17?-estradiol (estrogen) at 15 min and 24 hr post-injury, and vehicle-group rats received equal volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide. Animals were sacrificed at 48 hr post-injury, and 1-cm segments of the lesion, rostral penumbra, and caudal penumbra were excised. The degradation of 68 kD neurofilament protein (NFP) and estrogen receptors (ER) was examined by Western blot analysis. Protein levels of calpain and the activities of calpain and caspase-3 were also examined. Levels of cytochrome c were determined in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Cell death with DNA fragmentation was examined using the TUNEL assay. At the lesion, samples from both vehicle and estrogen treated animals showed increased levels of 68 kD NFP degradation, calpain content, calpain activity, cytochrome c release, and degradation of ERα and ER?, as compared to sham. In the caudal penumbra, estrogen treatment significantly attenuated 68 kD NFP degradation, calpain content, calpain activity, levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, and ER? degradation. At the lesion, vehicle-treated animals displayed more TUNEL+ cells, and estrogen treatment significantly attenuated this cell death marker. We conclude that estrogen may inhibit cell death in SCI through calpain inhibition. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Basic phenotyping of inbred mouse strains and genetically modified mouse models usually includes the determination of blood-based parameters as a diagnostic screen for genotype effects on metabolism and organ function. A broad range of analytes, including hematological parameters, can be reliably determined in mouse blood, if appropriate samples are available. Here we describe recommended techniques for blood collection from mice and the considerations that have to be taken into account to get adequate samples for hematological investigations. Furthermore, we describe established methods used in the German Mouse Clinic (GMC) to determine hematological parameters in the mouse. Curr. Protoc.

AB  - Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) masks are commonly used for respiratory support where intubation or a surgical procedure can be avoided. However, prolonged use of NIV masks involves risk to facial tissues, which are subjected to sustained deformations caused by tightening of the mask and microclimate conditions. The risk of developing such medical device-related pressure ulcers can be reduced by providing additional cushioning at the mask-face interface. In this work, we determined differences in facial tissue stresses while using an NIV mask with versus without using dressing cuts (Mepilex Lite; Mölnlycke Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden). First, we developed a force measurement system that was used to experimentally determine local forces applied to skin at the bridge of the nose, cheeks, and chin in a healthy sample group while using a NIV mask. We further demonstrated facial temperature distributions after use of the mask using infrared thermography. Next, using the finite element method, we delivered the measured compressive forces per site of the face in the model and compared maximal effective stresses in facial tissues with versus without the dressing cuts. The dressings have shown substantial biomechanical effectiveness in alleviating facial tissues deformations and stresses by providing localised cushioning to the tissues at risk.

AB  - Summary The pericardium provides mechanical protection and assists with normal diastolic coupling of the ventricles. Pericarditis arises from various causes, including infectious and inflammatory diseases. Standard treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and occasionally steroids. Pericardiocentesis is indicated in children with bacterial pericarditis, tamponade physiology, and immunocompromise. Surgical therapy may be indicated in cases of chronic and recurrent effusions, patients with bacterial pericarditis, and patients with constriction. Echocardiography and cardiac catheterization together play a crucial role in the diagnosis and differentiation of constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy.
