AB  - Learning Objectives After completing this course, the reader will be able to: Evaluate patients with grade II and III meningiomas for possible implementation of adjuvant radiation therapy. Describe options of systemic treatment of refractory meningiomas with hydroxyurea, somatostatin analogues, or CAV multi-agent chemotherapy. This article is available for continuing medical education credit at CME.TheOncologist.com Although meningiomas are the most common tumor in the central nervous system, their incidence, epidemiology, and clinical outcomes have historically been poorly defined. This has been attributed to their benign course, difficulty obtaining histologic diagnosis, and lack of uniform database registration. Their clinical behavior can range from a silent incidentaloma to a lethal tumor. Projections of an aging population should raise medical awareness of an expectant rise in the incidence of meningiomas. This disease increases with advancing age, has a female predilection, and exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with a higher risk for disease development. There have been minimal advances in treatment, except in radiation therapy. Although no U.S. Food and Drug Administration?approved systemic therapy exists, there are treatment options that include hydroxyurea and sandostatin. Currently, no molecularly targeted therapy has provided clinical benefit, although recurring molecular alterations are present and novel therapies are being investigated.

AB  - ABSTRACT The majority of periprosthetic joint infections occur shortly after primary joint replacement (<3 months) and require the removal of all implant components for the treatment period (~4 months). A clinically relevant animal model of periprosthetic infection should, therefore, establish an infection with implant components in place. Here, we describe a joint replacement model in the rat with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium components inoculated at the time of surgery by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which is one of the main causative microorganisms of periprosthetic joint infections. We monitored the animals for 4 weeks by measuring gait, weight-bearing symmetry, von Frey testing, and micro-CT as our primary endpoint analyses. We also assessed the infection ex vivo using colony counts on the implant surfaces and histology of the surrounding tissues. The results confirmed the presence of a local infection for 4 weeks with osteolysis, loosening of the implants, and clinical infection indicators such as redness, swelling, and increased temperature. The utility of specific gait analysis parameters, especially temporal symmetry, hindlimb duty factor imbalance, and phase dispersion was identified in this model for assessing the longitudinal progression of the infection, and these metrics correlated with weight-bearing asymmetry. We propose to use this model to study the efficacy of using different local delivery regimens of antimicrobials on addressing periprosthetic joint infections. Statement of clinical significance: We have established a preclinical joint surgery model, in which postoperative recovery can be monitored over a multi-week course by assessing gait, weight-bearing, and allodynia. This model can be used to study the efficacy of different combinations of implant materials and medication regimens. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective Sepsis induces an inflammatory response that results in acute renal failure (ARF). The current study is to evaluate the role of S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in renoprotection from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Methods Rats were divided to three groups. First group received LPS (5 mg/kg body weight), second group was treated with LPS + GSNO (50 ?g/kg body weight), and third group was administered with vehicle (saline). They were sacrificed on day 1 and 3 post-LPS injection. Serum levels of nitric oxide (NO), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were analysed. Tissue morphology, T lymphocyte infiltrations, and the expression of inflammatory (TNF-α, iNOS) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) mediators as well as glutathione (GSH) levels were determined. Key finding Lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased body weight and increased cellular T lymphocyte infiltration, caspase-3 and iNOS and decreased PPAR-? in renal tissue. NO, creatinine and BUN were significantly elevated after LPS challenge, and they significantly decreased after GSNO treatment. TNF-α level was found significantly increased in LPS-treated serum and kidney. GSNO treatment of LPS-challenged rats decreased caspase-3, iNOS, TNF-α, T lymphocyte infiltration and remarkably increased levels of IL-10, PPAR-? and GSH. Conclusion GSNO can be used as a renoprotective agent for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.
