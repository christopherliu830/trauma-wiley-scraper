AB  - Abstract Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are endowed with the ability to generate multiple cell lineages and carry great therapeutic potentials in regenerative medicine. Future application of ESCs in human health and diseases will embark on the delineation of molecular mechanisms that define the biology of ESCs. Here, we discuss how the finite ESC components mediate the intriguing task of brain development and exhibit biomedical potentials to cure diverse neurological disorders.

AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.

AB  - Abstract Changes in the physical properties of polymer materials during implantation in the biological environment can directly affect the ultimate performance of the polymer and/or device. We implanted four types of extraocular bands (porous, solid, composite, and patched) made from 11 types of materials in rabbit eyes and examined the changes in the physical strength and polymer structure of the implanted bands in terms of tensile strength measurements, creep analysis, and attenuated total internal reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) at intervals up to 18 months after implantation. Most of the materials showed increases in tensile strength over the first 6 months in situ in the rabbit eye, followed by significant decreases between 6 and 18 months. Polymer bands that had been implanted for 18 months generally exhibited less creep behavior than unimplanted controls; for most of the bands, creep values ranged from 0% to 10% of the original length. ATR-FTIR of the solid bands and surface coatings showed protein deposition on all of the materials examined, with silicone materials and coatings least affected. Thirty-degree ATR-FTIR scans detected significant changes in the polymer structure for two of the band types: one solid (polyether urethane) and one porous (porous polyacrylate). In general, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was the most stable in terms of tensile strength and creep. The least stable bands (composite bands made with porous polyurethane) were those that had undergone hydrolytic and/or oxidative degradation and chain scission of the polymer or alteration of the bond between the two materials making up the composite. These changes in physical properties and polymer structure observed after 18 months of implantation support the idea that polymer implant materials should be followed closely over several years in vivo to determine their suitability prior to use in humans. ? 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Full-arch rehabilitations in young patients suffering from dental agenesis should compensate for the reduced vertical dimension of occlusion and restore both esthetics and function at minimal biological cost. This requires precise planning and maximum patient compliance during the preprosthetic phase. The pretreatment period with tooth-colored splints promotes a predictable outcome of the final restorations. Clinical considerations: Thanks to better restorative materials and adhesive techniques and increased knowledge of how to preserve sound tooth structures, prosthetic dentistry has increasingly turned toward minimally invasive procedures. The present clinical case documents a minimally/non-invasive maxillary full-arch rehabilitation of an agenesis patient with multiple dental aplasia, primary tooth persistence, and deficits in bone growth. The patient was pretreated with a tooth-colored CAD/CAM polycarbonate splint. Adequate esthetics and function were achieved by two zirconia-based single-wing adhesive fixed dental prostheses to replace the upper lateral incisors, lithium disilicate ceramic partial crowns for the posterior regions, and two feldspathic veneers for the upper central incisors. Conclusions Non-invasive pretreatment with a removable tooth-colored splint realizes the treatment goal simply and safely, reduces treatment time, increases predictability, and facilitates the transfer of the prototype to the final restorations. New restorative options permit the minimally invasive treatment of such patients. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE A pretreatment with a removable tooth-colored splint offers a simple and safe way to define the treatment goal, reduces treatment time, increases predictability, and facilitates the transfer of the results to the final restorations even in complex cases. New restorative options permit minimally invasive treatments of young patients with multiple dental agenesis.

AB  - Abstract Translocator protein (TSPO) expression is increased in activated glia, and has been used as a marker of neuroinflammation in PET imaging. However, the extent to which TSPO upregulation reflects a pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotype remains unclear. Our aim was to determine whether TSPO upregulation in astrocytes and microglia/macrophages is limited to a specific inflammatory phenotype. TSPO upregulation was assessed by flow cytometry in cultured astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or interleukin-4 (Il-4). Subsequently, mice were injected intracerebrally with either a TNF-inducing adenovirus (AdTNF) or IL-4. Glial expression of TSPO and pro-/anti-inflammatory markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry/fluorescence and flow cytometry. Finally, AdTNF or IL-4 injected mice underwent PET imaging with injection of the TSPO radioligand 18F-DPA-713, followed by ex vivo autoradiography. TSPO expression was significantly increased in pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages and astrocytes both in vitro, and in vivo after AdTNF injection (p?<?.001 vs. control hemisphere), determined both histologically and by FACS. Both PET imaging and autoradiography revealed a significant (p?<?.001) increase in 18F-DPA-713 binding in the ipsilateral hemisphere of AdTNF-injected mice. In contrast, no increase in either TSPO expression assessed histologically and by FACS, or ligand binding by PET/autoradiography was observed after IL-4 injection. Taken together, these results suggest that TSPO imaging specifically reveals the pro-inflammatory population of activated glial cells in the brain in response to inflammatory stimuli. Since the inflammatory phenotype of glial cells is critical to their role in neurological disease, these findings may enhance the utility and application of TSPO imaging.

AB  - ABSTRACT The synaptic signaling mechanisms mediating the behavioral effects of ethanol (EtOH) remain poorly understood. Post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95, SAP-90, Dlg4) is a key orchestrator of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and glutamatergic synapses, which are known to be major sites of EtOH's behavioral actions. However, the potential contribution of PSD-95 to EtOH-related behaviors has not been established. Here, we evaluated knockout (KO) mice lacking PSD-95 for multiple measures of sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of EtOH (ataxia, hypothermia, sedation/hypnosis), EtOH drinking under conditions of free access and following deprivation, acquisition and long-term retention of EtOH conditioned place preference (CPP) (and lithium chloride-induced conditioned taste aversion), and intoxication-potentiating responses to NMDAR antagonism. PSD-95 KO exhibited increased sensitivity to the sedative/hypnotic, but not ataxic or hypothermic, effects of acute EtOH relative to wild-type controls (WT). PSD-95 KO consumed less EtOH than WT, particularly at higher EtOH concentrations, although increases in KO drinking could be induced by concentration-fading and deprivation. PSD-95 KO showed normal EtOH CPP 1 day after conditioning, but showed significant aversion 2 weeks later. Lithium chloride-induced taste aversion was impaired in PSD-95 KO at both time points. Finally, the EtOH-potentiating effects of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 were intact in PSD-95 KO at the dose tested. These data reveal a major, novel role for PSD-95 in mediating EtOH behaviors, and add to growing evidence that PSD-95 is a key mediator of the effects of multiple abused drugs.
