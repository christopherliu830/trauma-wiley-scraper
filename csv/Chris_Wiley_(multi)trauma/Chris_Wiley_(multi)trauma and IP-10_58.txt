AB  - It has been defined that strong and multispecific cellular immune responses correlate with a better prognosis during the course of chronic diseases. A cross-enhancing effect on the resulting immune response obtained by the coadministration of recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface and core Ag was recently observed. With the objective of studying the effect of such Ag on the immune response to coinoculated heterologous Ag and vice versa, several formulations containing the recombinant HBV Ag and a multiepitopic protein (CR3) composed by CTL and Th epitopes from HIV-1 were evaluated by s.c. and mucosal administration. Combinations of two and three Ag were evaluated for cellular and humoral immune responses. The results showed that the best Ag combination for nasal immunization was the mixture comprising the CR3 recombinant HIV protein and both HBV Ag. Similarly, it was also the best formulation for s.c. immunization in aluminium phosphate adjuvant. In conclusion, it is possible to induce a Th1 stimulation of the cellular immune response specific for a HIV-based recombinant protein by formulating this Ag with the recombinant HBV Ag.

AB  - Summary Veterinary anesthetists and anesthesiologists are uniquely positioned to contribute meaningfully to matters pertaining to the humane taking of animal life. Determining the humaneness of euthanasia, slaughter, or depopulation methods can be difficult because humans can never fully know or understand the subjective experiences of animals during loss of consciousness. Euthanasia, humane slaughter, and depopulation methods initially produce unconsciousness through three basic mechanisms: direct depression of neurons necessary for life functions; hypoxia; and physical disruption of brain activity. Measurements of brain electrical function, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), bispectral analysis (BIS), and visual and auditory evoked potentials (VEP, AEP), have been used to quantify the unconscious state. Fetal sentience during euthanasia of pregnant animals and ovariohysterectomy of pregnant dogs and cats has been extensively reviewed. Foam depopulation uses medium- or high-expansion foam-generating equipment to create a blanket of water-based foam to cover the animals.

AB  - ABSTRACT HIV-infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-exposure are associated with bone loss. African data are limited despite the region's HIV burden. Of 247 ART-naïve, premenopausal, urban, black African women aged 33.9±6.6?years from Soweto, South Africa, measured at baseline, 110 underwent anthropometry, DXA and blood and urine collections at 12 and 24 months; 39 were HIV-negative (Nref), 28 were people with HIV (PWH) not ART-exposed for the duration of the study (ART-N) and 43 were PWH who were ART-exposed within the first 12 months (ART-Y). At baseline ART-Y had lower BMI and fat mass than Nref. Within 12 months of ART-initiation, aBMD had decreased at the lumbar spine and whole-body-less-head, despite increased weight, and hip aBMD had not increased in line with Nref. There was no evidence of further bone changes between 12 and 24 months. By 24 months, ART-Y had gained weight and fat mass, but remained lighter with less fat than Nref. ART-initiation normalized the low serum albumin of ART-Y at baseline but was associated with elevated bone turnover markers at 12 and 24 months. Vitamin D status and renal phosphate handling were normal. ART-N had similar aBMD and other characteristics to Nref throughout, except, unlike Nref, weight and fat mass did not increase and serum albumin decreased. This study in African women of childbearing age demonstrated that the bone loss that had occurred in these PWH after ART-initiation did not continue after 12 months and that bone loss did not occur in ART-unexposed PWH over 2?years. At 24 months, despite gains in weight and fat mass, ART-exposed women remained lighter, with lower aBMD, fat mass and higher bone turnover than women without HIV. More studies are required to establish if the bone loss and fat gain reverse, stabilize, or continue with further ART-exposure, particularly during and after menopause.

AB  - Abstract African immigrant children and youth have some of the poorest social and mental health outcomes in Canada. Although parenting challenges have been widely documented as a key driver of these outcomes, limited systematic research has investigated this phenomenon. In this paper, we report the results of a study examining parenting challenges among a sample of African immigrant parents in Alberta, Canada. We relied on the theoretical lens of transnationalism to collect and analyse data from a purposive sample of African community leaders (n = 14), African immigrant parents (n = 32), and a range of stakeholders (n = 30). Our thematic data analysis revealed several intricately intertwined parenting challenges, organized around six overarching themes, namely, cultural incompatibility, family tension, state interference, limited social supports, poor access to services, and low socioeconomic status. We present these themes and the policy and service implications of our findings.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.
