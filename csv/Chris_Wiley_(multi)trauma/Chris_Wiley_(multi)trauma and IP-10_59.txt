AB  - Summary Background Reliable interpretation of spirometry rests on appropriate reference values, but there are few published reference values for healthy children in China. Objective To develop the updated spirometric normative values for healthy children aged 5?15 years in Guangzhou, southern China, and to explore the differences by comparison with published reference values. Methods In this cross-sectional study, health questionnaire and physical examination conducted for screening healthy Han children. Spirometry was performed by well-trained technicians according to American Thoracic Society guidelines. Using Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) algorithm, predicted equations for the median and lower limits of normal were derived for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (FEF25?75%). Predicted values were compared with other published spirometric reference equations. Results Data were obtained from 422 healthy children (226 boys and 196 girls) aged 5?15 years. Spirometric parameters showed moderate-to-strong positive correlations with age, height, and weight in both genders, with height being the most crucial predictor. There were significant differences between spirometric values and other published reference values. Spirometric values were comparable with the data derived from the same area population in 2002, with exception of increased height and weight in the equivalent age groups. Conclusions The present spirometric reference equations are feasible for assessment of lung function among children in southern China. Further studies for establishment of reference values for Chinese children in other regions are needed. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50:1009?1016. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA is a neuronopathic lysosomal storage disease, characterised by heparan sulphate and other substrates accumulating in the brain. Patients develop behavioural disturbances and cognitive decline, a possible consequence of neuroinflammation and abnormal substrate accumulation. Interleukin (IL)-1? and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) expression were significantly increased in both murine models and human MPSIII patients. We identified pathogenic mechanisms of inflammasome activation, including that disease-specific 2-O-sulphated heparan sulphate was essential for priming an IL-1? response via the Toll-like receptor 4 complex. However, mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA primary and secondary storage substrates, such as amyloid beta, were both required to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate IL-1? secretion. IL-1 blockade in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice using IL-1 receptor type 1 knockout or haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy over-expressing IL-1Ra reduced gliosis and completely prevented behavioural phenotypes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-1 drives neuroinflammation, behavioural abnormality and cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA, highlighting haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy treatment with IL-1Ra as a potential neuronopathic lysosomal disease treatment.

AB  - Contact lenses have been a common means of vision correction for more than half a century. Recent developments raise the possibility that the next several years will see the range of applications in which they are used broaden considerably, with an associated expansion in both the number and type of individuals who consider them to be a valuable option. To describe this new landscape, a review of recent patent submissions covering the period 1 January 2014 to 1 February 2017 was undertaken. The results show that in the main, areas where contact lenses will be applied include drug delivery, visual augmentation and biosensing.

AB  - 1 The present study was designed to determine which glutamate (Glu) receptors are involved in excitatory neurotransmission at the first auditory synapse between the inner hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons. 2 The Glu receptors present at the membrane level were investigated on isolated spiral ganglion neuron somata from guinea-pigs by whole-cell voltage-clamp measurements. Glu and AMPA induced a fast onset inward current that was rapidly desensitized, while kainate induced only a non-desensitizing, steady-state current. NMDA induced no detectable current. 3 To further discriminate between the AMPA and kainate receptors present, we used the receptor-specific desensitization blockers, cyclothiazide and concanavalin A. While no effect was observed with concanavalin A, cyclothiazide greatly enhanced the Glu-, AMPA- and kainate-induced steady-state currents and potentiated Glu-induced membrane depolarization. 4 To extrapolate the results obtained from the somata to the events occurring in situ at the dendrites, the effects of these drugs were evaluated in vivo. Cyclothiazide reversibly increased spontaneous activity of single auditory nerve fibres, while concanavalin A had no effect, suggesting that the functional Glu receptors on the somata may be the same as those at the dendrites. 5 The combination of a moderate-level sound together with cyclothiazide increased and subsequently abolished the spontaneous and the sound-evoked activity of the auditory nerve fibres. Histological examination revealed destruction of the dendrites, suggesting that cyclothiazide potentiates sound-induced Glu excitotoxicity via AMPA receptors. 6 Our results reveal that fast synaptic transmission in the cochlea is mainly mediated by desensitizing AMPA receptors.

AB  - ABSTRACT Concepts regarding the mechanisms by which drugs activate receptors to produce physiological response have progressed beyond considering the re¬ceptor as a simple on-off switch. Current evidence suggests that the idea that agonists produce only vary¬ing degrees of receptor activation is obsolete and must be reconciled with data to show that agonist efficacy has texture as well as magnitude. Thus, agonists can block system constitutive response (inverse agonists), behave as positive and inverse agonists on the same receptor (protean agonists), and differ in the stimulus pattern they produce in physiological systems (ligand-selective agonists). The molecular mechanism for this seemingly diverse array of activities is the same, namely, the selective microaffinity of ligands for different conformational states of the receptor. This paper reviews evidence for the existence of the various types of agonism and the potential therapeutic utility of differ¬ent agonist types.?Kenakin, T.

AB  - Morphological units in the Araceae are discussed and defined. The fundamental unit is the segment (an internode and its leaf or leaves), of which there are two basic types, the monopodial segment and the branching segment. Segments are assembled into chains to form articles (also called axes), which terminate in inflorescences, and are the product of the activity of a single apical meristem. Successive articles are assembled into chains which are physiognomically unbranched shoots. Shoot organization in the Araceae is discriminated into types on the basis of five characteristics: whether the shoot is renewed after flowering, whether renewal axes are proleptic or sylleptic, whether renewal axes develop from an axillary position, whether renewal axes have a variable or a constant number of leaves, and the number of leaves on renewal axes with a constant leaf number. The types of growth are described, illustrated, and organized into a hierarchical scheme, and a terminology is provided. A list of species representing each of the types is given.

AB  - Summary A digital image can be printed on film or paper as a hard copy, or it can be displayed on a cathode ray tube video monitor or a liquid crystal display as a soft copy. The quality of a digital image is generally measured by three parameters: spatial resolution, density resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Medical Imaging was used by radiologists for diagnostic purposes. This chapter highlights the generic radiology workflow. Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS)-based multimedia imaging informatics is a system integration of multimedia imaging informatics with patient imaging, which requires workflow and diagnostic components and procedures. The chapter describes the principle of digital mammography, a critical component of total digital imaging operation in a hospital. It summarizes the hybrid direct slot-scanning method. The chapter also describes several current clinical and work-in-progress magnetic resonance (MR) image types that can be generated from MR signals, and some of them have been used in clinical environment.
