AB  - SUMMARY When IAT is used, the patient's shed blood is collected continuously from the wound site during surgery. The salvaged red cells are stored in a dedicated reservoir and subsequently processed by cell separation (continuous centrifugation), washed with saline, concentrated and retransfused to the patient. In the context of perioperative blood saving strategies, IAT has gained standard-of-care status in many surgical procedures as it is especially cost-effective when the anticipated intraoperative blood loss is likely to exceed 1000 mL (major orthopedic, cardiac, vascular and emergency trauma surgery). IAT is not primarily recommended for cancer surgery or whenever the operative field is contaminated. Intraoperative plasmapheresis (IP) is used in cardiac surgery to minimize coagulation deficiencies caused by the traumatizing effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on platelets. A substantial amount of the patient's circulating platelets is withdrawn prior to heparinization and initiation of CPB. The collected autologous platelet-rich plasma is then stored at room temperature, preserving platelet function and plasmatic coagulation factors, and retransfused to the patient after heparin reversal. There is controversy about the actual blood saving benefit of IP, but this method may be effective in complicated procedures precipitating high blood loss and long CPB times. In addition, IP may be used when other autologous whole blood harvesting techniques are not an option.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aims Fragment reattachment is a procedure that offers advantages, such as preservation of tooth structure and maintenance of color, shape, and translucency of the original tooth. The aim of this study was to analyze the reattachment techniques used to restore anterior teeth fractured by trauma. Materials and Methods The PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched in October 2016, and the search was updated in February 2017. A search of the gray literature was performed in Google Scholar and OpenGrey. Reference lists of eligible studies were evaluated to identify additional studies. Two authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted the data. In vitro studies that evaluated permanent human teeth fractured by trauma were included. Results Twenty-one studies remained after screening. The bond strength between the fragment and the crown was evaluated in 119 experimental groups. Ten different techniques were evaluated as follows: no preparation, chamfer, bevel, anchors, overcontour, internal groove, no preparation associated with chamfer after reattachment, fragment dentin removal associated with chamfer after reattachment, bevel associated with overcontour, and groove associated with shoulder. Five different materials were used to reattach the fragment: bonding system, luting composite resin, flowable composite, microhybrid composite, and nanocomposite. Conclusion Fragment reattachment using a technique with no preparation and an adhesive system associated with an intermediate composite with good mechanical properties can restore part of the resistance of the fractured tooth.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic injury to the brain is one of the leading causes of injury-related death or disability, but current therapies are limited. Previously it has been shown that the antioxidant proteins metallothioneins (MTs) are potent neuroprotective factors in animal models of brain injury. The exogenous administration of MTs causes effects consistent with the roles proposed from studies in knock-out mice. We herewith report the results comparing full mouse MT-1 with the independent α and ? domains, alone or together, in a cryoinjury model. The lesion of the cortex caused the mice to perform worse in the horizontal ladder beam and the rota-rod tests; all the proteins showed a modest effect in the former test, while only full MT-1 improved the performance of animals in the rota-rod, and the α domain showed a rather detrimental effect. Gene expression analysis by RNA protection assay demonstrated that all proteins may alter the expression of host-response genes such as GFAP, Mac1 and ICAM, in some cases being the ? domain more effective than the α domain or even the full MT-1. A MT-1-to-MT-3 mutation blunted some but not all the effects caused by the normal MT-1, and in some cases increased its potency. Thus, splitting the two MT-1 domains do not seem to eliminate all MT functions but certainly modifies them, and different motifs seem to be present in the protein underlying such functions. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces a rapid and excessive elevation in extracellular glutamate that induces excitotoxic brain cell death. The peptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is reported to suppress neurotransmitter release through selective activation of presynaptic group?II metabotropic glutamate receptors. Therefore, strategies to elevate levels of NAAG following brain injury could reduce excessive glutamate release associated with TBI. We hypothesized that the NAAG peptidase inhibitor, ZJ-43 would elevate extracellular NAAG levels and reduce extracellular levels of amino acid neurotransmitters following TBI by a group?II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated mechanism. Dialysate levels of NAAG, glutamate, aspartate and GABA from the dorsal hippocampus were elevated after TBI as measured by in vivo microdialysis. Dialysate levels of NAAG were higher and remained elevated in the ZJ-43 treated group (50?mg/kg, i.p.) compared with control. ZJ-43 treatment also reduced the rise of dialysate glutamate, aspartate, and GABA levels. Co-administration of the group?II mGluR antagonist, LY341495 (1?mg/kg, i.p.) partially blocked the effects of ZJ-43 on dialysate glutamate and GABA, suggesting that NAAG effects are mediated through mGluR activation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of NAAG peptidase may reduce excitotoxic events associated with TBI.
