AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical condition responsible for high mortality and the development of multiple organ dysfunctions, because of the lack of specific and effective therapies for ALI. Increasing evidence from pre-clinical studies supports preventive and therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, also called mesenchymal stromal cells) in ALI/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Therapeutic effects of MSCs were noticed in various delivery approaches (systemic, local, or other locations), multiple origins (bone marrow or other tissues), or different schedules of administrations (before or after the challenges). MSCs could reduce the over-production of inflammatory mediators, leucocyte infiltration, tissue injury and pulmonary failure, and produce a number of benefit factors through interaction with other cells in the process of lung tissue repair. Thus, it is necessary to establish guidelines, standard operating procedures and evaluation criteria for translating MSC-based therapies into clinical application for patients with ALI.

AB  - Abstract Deuterium and fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have been employed for quantification of regional blood flow in concert with nonradiative, exogenous, freely diffusible tracers such as D2O and freon gas. Typically, the tracer residue washout was monitored by NMR over time following tracer administration by bolus injection or inhalation. The theory, including compartmental analysis, required to quantitatively derive volumetric tissue blood flow and perfusion is reviewed herein. Applications of NMR tissue blood flow measurement techniques to tumor, muscle, liver, and brain are presented with discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of NMR methods. ? 1990 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The development of radioprotective agents has been the subject of intense research in view of their potential for use within a radiation environment, such as space exploration, radiotherapy and even nuclear war. However, no ideal, safe synthetic radioprotectors are available to date, so the search for alternative sources, including plants, has been on going for several decades. In Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine, several plants have been used to treat free radical-mediated ailments and, therefore, it is logical to expect that such plants may also render some protection against radiation damage. A systematic screening approach can provide leads to identifying potential new candidate drugs from plant sources, for mitigation of radiation injury. This article reviews some of the most promising plants, and their bioactive principles, that are widely used in traditional systems of medicine, and which have rendered significant radioprotection in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Plants and their constituents with pharmacological activities that may be relevant to amelioration of radiation-mediated damage, including antiemetic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, cell proliferative, wound healing and haemopoietic stimulatories are also discussed.

AB  - The morbidity and mortality resulting from alcohol-related diseases globally impose a substantive cost to society. To minimize the financial burden on society and improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from the ill effects of alcohol abuse, substantial research in the alcohol field is focused on understanding the mechanisms by which alcohol-related diseases develop and progress. Since ethical concerns and inherent difficulties limit the amount of alcohol abuse research that can be performed in humans, most studies are performed in laboratory animals. This article summarizes the various laboratory models of alcohol abuse that are currently available and are used to study the mechanisms by which alcohol abuse induces organ damage and immune defects. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the models are discussed. Integrated into the review are the presentations that were made in the symposium ?Methods of Ethanol Application in Alcohol Model?How Long is Long Enough? at the joint 2008 Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) and International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA) meeting, Washington, DC, emphasizing the importance not only of selecting the most appropriate laboratory alcohol model to address the specific goals of a project but also of ensuring that the findings can be extrapolated to alcohol-induced diseases in humans.

AB  - Abstract Hemopoiesis-stimulating activity of various recombinant human colony-stimulating factors (rhCSFs) has been studied in four different preclinical animal models. The CSFs used were erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage (GM) CSF, granulocyte (G) CSF, interleukin (IL) 3, IL-1?, and mast cell growth factor (MGF) or stem cell factor (SCF). Emphasis was placed on effects induced by combination treatment with varied pairs of the factors. Dogs and primates were chosen because of evidence of efficacy from earlier studies with the single recombinant human factors alone. The animal models chosen were: 1) isovolemic hemodilution to a hematocrit of 10% (or 20%) of dogs, splenectomized at least three months before start of the study. Additionally, the animals had been primed with Epo (or Epo plus IL-3) on three days daily or five days every other day before hemodilution. 2) Total body irradiation (TBI) of dogs (2.4 Gy) followed by daily treatment with IL-1? (d1-7) plus Epo administered daily over three weeks. 3) TBI of rhesus monkeys (4.5 Gy) and daily treatment with IL-3 and GM-CSF over three weeks. 4) Treatment of healthy normal cynomolgus monkeys with various factor combinations over about two or three weeks. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Priming with Epo before blood loss (withdrawal) allows a strikingly enhanced recovery of hematocrit and other hematological parameters. Further evaluation of the role of concomitantly applied CSFs (e.g., IL-3, GM-CSF or G-CSF) on the restoration of immune functions would be desirable. 2) Single CSFs and preferentially factor combinations are valuable agents to reduce irradiation injury and to enhance recovery from bone marrow hypoplasia. 3) Treatment of healthy animals with selected CSF combinations results in a stronger hemopoietic stimulation than with single factors alone. Some particular combinations even stimulate platelet production, e.g., IL-3/GM-CSF, GM-CSF/Epo or G-CSF/IL-3. The results obtained indicate that stimulatory responses of hemopoiesis in normal animals cannot always be compared with the effects seen in compromised animals. It is assumed that the preclinical data obtained in compromised animals may perhaps more realistically reflect what is eventually to be expected in future clinical studies.

AB  - Abstract The cutaneus trunci muscle reflex in guinea pigs was studied with a combination of video analysis, electromyography, lesioning, and light microscopy. The muscle forms a bilateral, subdermal sheet over much of the trunk. Local contractions of the dorsal part of the muscle are produced in response to brief tactile or electrical stimulation of the skin and consist of a twitch centered 1?2 cm rostral of the stimulus site. The reflex receptive field covers most of the thoracic and lumbar dorsal surface. The sensory information is carried via segmental dorsal cutaneous nerves. Receptive fields of adjacent nerves overlap and form rectangular areas perpendicular to the midline, at thoracic levels. Motor innervation projects through the lateral thoracic nerves of the brachial plexus. The motoneurons are located near the cervical thoracic junction ((C7-T1)). Lesions of the lower thoracic cord indicate that ascending sensory information is carried to the motor nuclei via the ventral half of the lateral funiculus. This pathway conveys information primarily from ipsilateral skin. There is a weaker input from contralateral skin, crossing at segmental levels. Electromyographic responses to brief electrical stimulation of lower thoracic skin occur usually as 10?12 msec bursts at latencies of 10?20 msec, and do not readily habituate or fatigue at stimulus frequencies below 10 Hz. The reflex persists under light pentobarbital anesthesia. This combination of characteristics makes the reflex useful for a variety of physiological and pathophysiological studies.

AB  - Abstract The peritoneal surface remains an important failure site for patients with colorectal cancer. Peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer are at present considered equal to distant metastatic disease. Consequently, peritoneal carcinomatosis is treated with systemic chemotherapy and surgery only to palliate complications such as obstruction. Despite the development of new chemotherapeutic agents and combinations, the results remain disappointing with a limited impact on survival. Colorectal carcinoma cells are relatively resistant to chemotherapy. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy seems to be an attractive approach in the treatment of high-risk colorectal cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal origin providing high local drug concentration with limited systemic side effects. Adjuvant early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy is worthwhile for consideration as treatment option after resection of high-risk colorectal cancer. In the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy leads to inadequate exposure of the peritoneal surface. Only an intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy performed with direct cytotoxic drugs such as MMC and cisplatin overcome this problem. The limited drug penetration in tissue implies the need for extensive cytoreductive surgery. The results of phase II studies suggest that an increased median survival can be achieved with this approach. The natural history of this disease and the heterogeneity of the patients are such that only a randomized trial design will adequately answer the question whether regional treatment of patients with peritoneal dissemination of colorectal cancer actually prolongs survival. The results of such a study are to be expected in approximately 2 years time. J. Surg. Oncol. 2002;79:46?61. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
