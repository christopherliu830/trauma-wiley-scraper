AB  - SUMMARY 1. In the present study, we investigated whether treatment with α-lipoic acid (LA), a powerful and universal anti-oxidant, has renal protective effects in rats with ischaemic acute renal failure (ARF). 2. Ischaemic ARF was induced by occlusion of the left renal artery and vein for 45 min followed by reperfusion, 2 weeks after contralateral nephrectomy. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma concentrations of creatinine (Pcr) and urinary osmolality (Uosm) were measured for the assessment of renal dysfunction. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) and fractional excretion of Na+ (FENa) were used as indicators of glomerular and tubular function, respectively. 3. Renal function in ARF rats decreased markedly 24 h after reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injection of LA at a dose of 10 mg/kg before the occlusion tended to attenuate the deterioration of renal function. A higher dose of LA (100 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated the ischaemia/reperfusion-induced increases in BUN (19.1 ± 0.7 vs 7.2 ± 0.7 mmol/L before and after treatment, respectively), Pcr (290 ± 36 vs 78.1 ± 4.2 ?mol/L before and after treatment, respectively) and FENa (1.39 ± 0.3 vs 0.33 ± 0.09% before and after treatment, respectively). Treatment with 100 mg/kg LA significantly (P < 0.01) increased Ccr (0.70 ± 0.13 vs 2.98 ± 0.27 mL/min per kg before and after treatment, respectively) and Uosm (474 ± 39 vs 1096 ± 80 mOsmol/kg before and after treatment, respectively). 4. Histopathological examination of the kidney of ARF rats revealed severe lesions. Tubular necrosis (P < 0.01), proteinaceous casts in tubuli (P < 0.01) and medullary congestion (P < 0.05) were significantly suppressed by the higher dose of LA. 5. A marked increase in endothelin (ET)-1 content in the kidney after ischaemia/reperfusion was evident in ARF rats (0.43 ± 0.02 ng/g tissue) compared with findings in sham- operated rats (0.20 ± 0.01 ng/g tissue). Significant attenuation (P < 0.01) of this increase occurred in ARF rats treated with the higher dose of LA (0.24 ± 0.03 ng/g tissue). 6. These results suggest that administration of LA to rats prior to development of ischaemic ARF prevents renal dysfunction and tissue injury, possibly through the suppression of overproduction of ET-1 in the postischaemic kidney.

AB  - Summary 1 . Significant inhibition of oedema formation caused by thermal injury was observed for calcium carbaspirin, phenylbutazone, hydrocortisone, cryogenine and indomethacin when given daily beginning 2 days prior to thermal exposure and afterwards. Several anti-inflammatory drugs, including cryogenine, failed to reduce thermal oedema significantly when given as single doses 1 h prior to the thermal injury. 2 . Kinetic experiments on the rat isolated uterus demonstrated that cryogenine, chlorpromazine, and flufenamic acid were, in part, competitive inhibitors of synthetic bradykinin, while indomethacin and tetrabenazine showed only non-competitive antagonism.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections are now known to be a common and important problem in the Unites States. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of MRSA infection in skin abrasion wounds using a mouse model. Study Design/Materials and Methods A mouse model of skin abrasion wound infected with MRSA was developed. Bioluminescent strain of MRSA, a derivative of ATCC 33591, was used to allow the real-time monitoring of the extent of infection in mouse wounds. PDT was performed with the combination of a polyethylenimine (PEI)?ce6 photosensitizer (PS) and non-coherent red light. In vivo fluorescence imaging was carried out to evaluate the effect of photobleaching of PS during PDT. Results In vivo fluorescence imaging of conjugate PEI?ce6 applied in mice indicated the photobleaching effect of the PS during PDT. PDT induced on average 2.7?log10 of inactivation of MRSA as judged by loss of bioluminescence in mouse skin abrasion wounds and accelerated the wound healing on average by 8.6 days in comparison to the untreated infected wounds. Photobleaching of PS in the wound was overcome by adding the PS solution in aliquots. Conclusion PDT may represent an alternative approach for the treatment of MRSA skin infections. Lasers Surg.
