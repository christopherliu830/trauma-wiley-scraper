International Endodontic Journal00, 000?000, 2012. Abstract Aim? To compare cells from normal and inflamed human dental pulps regarding the presence of stem cells, their proliferation and differentiation potential. Methodology? Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were isolated from normal (DPSC-N) and inflamed dental pulps (DPSC-I). They were compared in respect to proliferation (MTT assay), morphology and STRO-1 expression. STRO-1-positive cells were subject to proliferation (MTT and CFU counting) and morphological analyses and then submitted to odonto-osteogenic, adipogenic and condrogenic differentiation. Differentiated cells were evaluated concerning morphology and the expression, by qRT-PCR, of BSP, LPL and SOX-9 genes. The amount of mineralized matrix produced after odonto-osteogenic differentiation was compared with quantitative Alizarin Red staining. Results? No difference was observed in the morphology and in the proliferation rate of DPSC-N and DPSC-I either before or after separation of STRO-1-positive cells. These cells represented 0.46% (±0.14) and 0.43% (±0.19) of the cell population from normal and inflamed dental pulps, respectively. Both DPSC-N and DPSC-I were capable of differentiating under the three assayed conditions and presented similar patterns for BSP, LPL and SOX-9 expression. Mineralized matrix production was also compatible. In all the quantitative experiments, differences were found between cells from each patient, either from normal or from inflamed pulps. Nonetheless, there was no statistical difference between these two groups. Conclusion? The morphology, proliferation rate and differentiation potential of DPSC-I were similar to the observed in DPSC-N, thus demonstrating that the inflammatory process did not affect the stem cell properties that were assessed.

AB  - Background and Aim Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury is the main cause of liver failure following liver surgery, so an effective method is needed to prevent or reduce this hepatic injury. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential effect of ischemic preconditioning versus pharmacological preconditioning with lisinopril or verapamil for protection against hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury induced in rats. Methods Rats were divided into six groups. Group I served as control untreated. Rats of group II were subjected to laparotomy without induction of ischemia reperfusion. Ischemia reperfusion by ligation of the portal trait for 30?min, followed by reperfusion for 2?h, was performed in rats of groups III?VI. Ischemic preconditioning was performed for rats of group IV before induction of ischemia reperfusion. Lisinopril and verapamil was given daily for 3?days before induction of ischemia reperfusion in groups V and VI, respectively. Serum level of liver transaminases and liver malondialdehyde content were measured, and hepatic histopathological examination was assessed. Results Induction of ischemia reperfusion resulted in significant elevation of liver transaminases and liver malondialdehyde content associated with significant hepatic histopathological injury that were significantly improved by ischemic preconditioning, lisinopril, or verapamil treatment. Verapamil showed the most significant improvement compared with ischemic preconditioning or lisinopril treatment. Conclusion Ischemic preconditioning and pharmacological preconditioning by lisinopril or verapamil can protect against hepatic ischemia reperfusion probably through inhibition of oxidative stress and neutrophil infiltration. The most potent protection is demonstrated by verapamil treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY The best-known protein components of the plant cell wall have highly repetitive, proline-rich sequences. The use of recombinant DNA approaches has enabled complete sequences of these proteins to be determined and features of the expression of the corresponding genes to be examined. These results, coupled with the use of immunological techniques, have shown that proline-rich proteins are interesting probes to study developmental and defence processes in plants. In this review, the sequence and expression of different groups of proline-rich proteins in plants are presented. These groups include hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP) or extensins, proline-rich proteins (PRP) and glycine-rich proteins (GRP). The specific features of each group and the possible functions of these proteins are discussed, as well as the data available on the mechanisms controlling the expression of their corresponding genes.

AB  - ABSTRACT CRF1 antagonists DMP696 and DMP904 were designed as drug development candidates for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Both compounds display nanomolar affinity for human CRF1 receptors, and exhibit >1000-fold selectivity for CRF1 over CRF2 receptors and over a broad panel of other proteins. DMP696 and DMP904 block CRF-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cortical homogenates and cell-lines expressing CRF1 receptors. Both compounds inhibit CRF-stimulated ACTH release from rat pituitary corticotropes. Binding and functional studies indicate that DMP696 and DMP904 behave as noncompetitive full antagonists. DMP696 and DMP904 exhibit anxiolytic-like efficacy in several rat anxiety models. In the defensive withdrawal test, both compounds reduce exit latency with lowest effective doses of 3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. The anxiolytic-like effect is maintained over 14 days of repeated dosing. In the context of a novel environment used in this test, DMP696 and DMP904 reverse mild stress-induced increases in plasma CORT secretion but at doses 3-4-fold greater than those required for anxiolytic-like efficacy. DMP696 and DMP904 are ineffective in three depression models including the learned helplessness paradigm at doses up to 30 mg/kg. At lowest anxiolytic-like doses, DMP696 and DMP904 occupy >50% CRF1 receptors in the brain. The in vivo IC50 values (plasma concentrations required for occupying 50% CRF1 receptors) estimated based upon free, but not total, plasma concentrations are an excellent correlation with the in vitro IC50 values. Neither compound produces sedation, ataxia, chlordiazepoxide-like subjective effects or adverse effects on cognition at doses 10-fold higher than anxiolytic-like doses. Neither compound produces physiologically significant changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal or renal functions at anxiolytic-like doses. DMP696 and DMP904 have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles with good oral bioavailabilities. The overall pharmacological properties suggest that both compounds may be effective anxiolytics with low behavioral side effect liabilities.

AB  - Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces adrenalitis in BALB/c mice but does not compromise adrenal function, assessed by levels of circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the response to challenge with synthetic ACTH. Levels of corticosterone increased 2 days after infection in mice of this strain, consistent with previously established interactions between mediators of acute inflammation and activation of the hypothalmus?pituitary?adrenal axis. Moreover, an adrenocortical response was critical to survival of BALB/c (but not C57BL/6) mice 3 days after infection, as pharmacologically or surgically adrenalectomized BALB/c mice died when given doses of virus up to fivefold lower than they could normally tolerate. However, death could not be prevented by the administration of soluble cytokine receptors to inhibit the action of interleukin 1 (IL-1) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The corticosteroid response did not mediate MCMV-induced thymic atrophy. As the above traits were all less evident in C57BL/6 mice, a common genetic basis is discussed.

AB  - This study examined child inclusion issues and training marriage and family therapists (MFTs) to treat children. This modified Delphi study utilized a panel of experts, and gathered data through questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Panelists believe children should participate in family therapy sessions for both child and adult problems, except when parents are discussing sex or sensitive issues. Child-focused courses should emphasize developmental issues, engaging techniques, theoretical issues, play therapy theory, MFT treatment for child disorders, and specific child/family problems. Panelists suggest numerous child-focused references, but reached consensus for only one. Key therapist attributes and skills were identified. Deductive and inductive training methods and the role of supervision were highlighted. Although therapist playfulness and creativity were emphasized, few play techniques were included in the final profile.
