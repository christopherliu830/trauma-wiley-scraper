AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Aim To evaluate three emergency procedures for their ability to alleviate clinical symptoms associated with symptomatic teeth having signs of (at least) partial irreversible pulpitis. Methodology Sixty-six maxillary and mandibular molars were randomly assigned to a total pulpectomy group (TP; n = 22), partial pulpectomy group (PP; n = 22) or pulpotomy group (P; n = 22). Procedure durations were recorded. Patients answered a questionnaire on daily analgesic requirements and about clinical symptoms (pain intensity, chewing sensitivity and thermal sensitivity) after the anaesthetic effect had disappeared (Day 0) and on Days 1, 3 and 7 post-treatment. Results The total pulpectomy group was associated with the longest procedures (median, 24 min), followed by the partial pulpectomy and pulpotomy groups (P < 0.001 for all). In all three groups, pain intensity, thermal sensitivity and chewing sensitivity decreased significantly from the preoperative time-point to Day 7 (P < 0.001 for all). The total pulpectomy group reported greater reductions in pain intensity than the pulpotomy group between Days 0 and 7, Days 1 and 3, and Days 1 and 7 (P < 0.001 for all). No other intergroup differences were noted regarding reductions in pain intensity, and none were observed with respect to changes in prevalence of thermal sensitivity and chewing sensitivity. There were also no significant intergroup differences regarding the analgesic requirements throughout the 7 days. Conclusion As emergency treatments for teeth having signs of irreversible pulpitis, pulpotomy, partial pulpectomy and total pulpectomy were comparable with respect to relieving clinical symptoms. Pulpotomy may be preferred because it requires significantly less time and is a simple technique that relieves symptoms quickly and effectively.

AB  - Abstract The effectiveness of enteral and parenteral nutrition regimens in preventing or reversing protein?energy malnutrition (PEM) and in preventing treatment delays was evaluated in 32 children receiving treatment for newly diagnosed Stage III (3 patients) and IV (29 patients) neuroblastoma. Ten of 18 malnourished patients were randomized to central parenteral nutrition (CPN) and 8 to peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) plus enteral nutrition for 4 weeks and then received enteral nutrition (EN: intense nutrition counselling, oral foods and supplements) for weeks 5 through 10. Ten of 14 nourished patients received EN and 4 CPN for 4 weeks and EN thereafter. Dietary, anthropometric and biochemical measurements were determined for weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10 for 24 patients who completed the protocols. In malnourished patients, both CPN (seven patients) and PPN (seven patients) were effective in reversing PEM in the first 4 weeks; thereafter, EN effectively maintained nutritional gains in both groups. In nourished patients, EN (seven patients) was not as effective as CPN (three patients) in preventing PEM during the first 4 weeks; afterwards, EN maintained gains in the CPN group but did not promote needed increases in weight nor fat reserves in the EN group. Patients supported by parenteral nutrition (PN, weeks 1?4) had fewer treatment delays (2/17, 12%) than EN patients (4/7, 57%, P <0.05). These data indicate that PN reverses or prevents PEM and prevents treatment delays during the first 4 weeks of intense oncologic treatment and provides nutritional benefits which can be maintained with EN thereafter.

AB  - Summary Age is the single most important risk factor for progressive dementia in populations worldwide. In developed countries the prevalence of dementia is estimated to be 3?5% at age 65 years and expected to double every decade thereafter. Although there is ageing-related attrition of neural tissue accompanied by profound changes in brain glia, marked neuronal loss and severe cognitive impairment are associated with pathological changes. Accelerated somatic ageing of the vasculature comprising endothelial and smooth muscle cells and slowed glial replacement are also likely to pre-dispose to degenerative processes. Approximately 90% of patients with late-onset dementia have neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or vascular dementia (VaD), alone or in combination. Both AD and DLB reveal extensive amyloid ? deposition within senile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles evident as tau pathology are much reduced in DLB where symptoms may be more related to cholinergic transmitter abnormalities than structural pathology. Depletion of brain acetylcholine is also encountered in VaD, which like AD and DLB may respond to cholinergic therapy. Cerebrovascular pathology, ischaemic brain damage and neurovascular instability resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion appears fundamental in the pathogenesis of late-onset dementia. The apolipoprotein E ε4 allele, a major genetic susceptibility factor for AD also associated with cardiovascular pathology, may contribute to neurodegenerative changes through vascular mechanisms. The interrelationships of these multiple substrates of late-onset dementia have major implications for neuroprotective and disease slowing therapies. Measures that improve cardiovascular function and increase brain perfusion would be useful to attenuate cognitive decline.

Holmes, 2 Jermoe Engel, 3 Yehezkel Ben-Ari, 4 Robert Muller, and 5 John Huguenard ( 1 Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH ; 2 Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Inmed Institute, Marseille, France ; 4 SUNDY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY ; and 5 Department of Neurology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA ,) The purpose of this symposium is to provide clinicians, basic scientists, and professions in health care with an understanding of the importance of brain rhythms in normal and abnormal brain function. Different brain rhythms, consisting of both low and fast frequencies, are grouped within complex wave-sequences. These rhythms serve as powerful synchronizing forces and play important roles in all aspects of higher cortical function. During this symposium a review of the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits will be reviewed along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms. The relationship between intrinsic hippocampal rhythms and learning and memory will be discussed. Aberrant rhythms may contribute to pathological processes such as memory impairment. There is also increasing evidence that high frequency oscillations may precede epilepsy in both the immature and mature brain, having an important role in epileptogenesis. Dr. Jerome Engle will review the physiological basis of brain rhythms and the role of high frequency oscillations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Dr.Yehezkel Ben-Ari will discuss the role of high frequency stimulations in the mirror focus in immature animals. Dr. Robert Muller will provide information about the relationship between single cell firing patterns, hippocampal rhythms, and learning. Dr. John Huguenard will discuss oscillations in the thalamocortical system and the mechanisms of epileptic synchrony. This session will emphasize that epilepsy and its related morbidities are caused by neuronal network abnormalities. The brain's rhythms are critical in determining whether these networks perform normally or abnormally.

AB  - 1 Experiments were performed on anaesthetized cats to investigate the receptive properties of regenerated cutaneous tibial nerve nociceptors, and to obtain evidence for coupling between them and other afferent fibres as being possible peripheral mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain. These properties were studied 6-7 months after nerve section and repair. 2 Recordings were made from 25 regenerated nociceptors; 14 were A fibres and the remainder were C fibres. Their receptive field sizes and conduction velocities were similar to controls. There was no significant difference between their mechanical thresholds and those of a control population of nociceptors. 3 Regenerated nociceptors were significantly more responsive to suprathreshold mechanical stimuli than were uninjured control fibres. This increase in mechanical sensitivity occurred in both A and C fibres, although A fibres showed a greater increase in mechano-sensitivity than C fibres. Over half of the regenerated nociceptors (13/25) showed after-discharge to mechanical stimuli which was never seen in controls; the mean firing rate during this period of after-discharge was significantly related to both stimulus intensity and stimulus area. 4 There was no significant difference between the heat encoding properties of regenerated nociceptors and control nociceptors. Cold sensitivity was similarly unchanged. Thus, abnormal peripheral sprouting was unlikely to account for the increased mechanical sensitivity of the regenerated fibres. None of the regenerated nociceptors were found to be coupled to other fibres. 5 These results suggest that the clinical observation of mechanical hyperalgesia in patients after nerve injury may have a peripheral basis. Based on this model, other signs of neuropathic pain (i.e. tactile or thermal allodynia) are more likely to be due to altered central processing.
