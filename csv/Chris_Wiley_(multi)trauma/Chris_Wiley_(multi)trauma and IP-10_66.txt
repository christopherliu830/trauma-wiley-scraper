AB  - Abstract This research reviews and discusses the clinical and social science datasets used to identify victims of domestic violence (DV) in the archaeological record. Clinical sources are skewed by law enforcement and cost issues, dominated by Western female data and suggest that DV is a well-documented form of abuse. Social science sources and perspectives, having arisen from activist movements, are more spatiotemporally diverse in breadth and perspective, and challenge the notion that DV is universal and well-documented, but are biased because they rely upon self-survey reports. Palaeopathology and bioarchaeology have adopted a clinical approach to DV, relying on a pattern of injuries (focussed on the head, face and neck), without critically evaluating whether such datasets are appropriate to the spatiotemporal and socio-cultural diversity present in the archaeological record. A case study evaluating the injury patterns in 964 post-medieval adult females from London (England) demonstrates that the majority of injuries that conform to the clinical model have robust alternative explanations, and only a small minority of females have injuries that may have been produced by interpersonal violence, not necessarily DV. In conclusion, the review highlights that the perspectives of the elderly and male victims are currently neglected in research, and evidence for injury, especially that which may reflect abuse, necessitates interpretation within a ?web of violence? approach, as DV does not occur in isolation from other violence in a community. It challenges the ?check-list? approach to interpretation and suggests that a closer examination of fracture mechanism combined with injury patterning may be a more informative approach with which to identify DV victims of both sexes and identifies the need to integrate other health data into the interpretation of violence and abuse. Overall, it concurs with the minority of clinical and forensic literature that it might not be possible to differentiate DV and assault victims. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract This review will discuss several new drugs which were discovered and developed in recent years from traditional Chinese medicines by the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica. Huperzine A was isolated from Huperzia serrata, a plant used for the treatment of contusion, strain, haematuria, and swelling in Chinese folk medicine. Pharmacological studies have indicated that huperzine A has powerful and reversible anticholinesterase activity. Y-maze methods have shown that huperzine A improves learning and retrieval processes, and facilitates memory retention. Huperzine A is used to treat patients with myasthenia gravis and Alzheimer's disease in China. Sarmentosin, a cyanogenic glucoside was isolated from the whole plant of Sedum sarmentosium. This plant has long been used to treat hepatitis by folk medicine. Sarmentosin significantly lowers the SGPT level of patients suffering from chronic viral hepatitis, and shows a suppressive effect on cell-mediated immune responses in mice. The root of Aconitum is well known in traditional Chinese medicine. Many Aconitum alkaloids have been isolated. Most show potent bioactivities, but with severe toxicity. Recently, some alkaloids such as 3-acetylaconitine, lappaconitine, have shown significant anesthetic activity and exhibit a higher therapeutic index. Guan-fu base A was isolated from the tuber root of Aconitum coreanum. Guan-fu base A has antiarrhythmic action and is now in clinical trials. Drug Dev. Res. 39:147?157. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Indirect evidence suggests that endogenous ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor signaling can promote motor neuron (MN) survival in the adult. If so, proper targeting of this signaling may selectively counteract the effects of adult MN diseases. However, direct evidence for CNTF receptor involvement in adult MN survival is lacking, presumably because the unconditional blockade of the mouse CNTF receptor in vivo [through genetic disruption of the essential CNTF receptor α (CNTFRα) gene] leads to uniform perinatal death of the mice. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a method to selectively disrupt CNTF receptor function in a targeted subset of adult MNs that are not required for survival. A ?floxed CNTFRα? mouse line was generated and characterized. In addition, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector that drives Cre recombinase (Cre) expression was constructed and shown, with reporter mouse lines, to selectively excise floxed genes in facial MNs following its stereotaxic injection into the facial motor nucleus. Adult floxed CNTFRα mice were then injected with the AAV-Cre vector to excise the CNTFRα gene in the targeted MNs. The resulting data indicate that adult CNTF receptor signaling, likely by the MNs themselves, can play an essential role in MN survival. The data further indicate that this role is independent of any developmental contributions CNTF receptor signaling makes to MN survival or function.

AB  - Abstract The global market for dental materials is predicted to exceed 10 billion dollars by 2020. The main drivers for this growth are easing the workflow of dentists and increasing the comfort of patients. Therefore, remarkable research projects have been conducted and are currently underway to develop improved or new dental materials with enhanced properties or that can be processed using advanced technologies, such as CAD/CAM or 3D printing. Among these materials, zirconia, glass or polymer-infiltrated ceramics, and glass-ceramics (GCs) are of great importance. Dental glass-ceramics are highly attractive because they are easy to process and have outstanding esthetics, translucency, low thermal conductivity, high strength, chemical durability, biocompatibility, wear resistance, and hardness similar to that of natural teeth, and, in certain cases, these materials are bioactive. In this review article, we divide dental GCs into the following two groups: restorative and bioactive. Most restorative dental glass-ceramics (RDGCs) are inert and biocompatible and are used in the restoration and reconstruction of teeth. Bioactive dental glass-ceramics (BDGCs) display bone-bonding ability and stimulate positive biological reactions at the material/tissue interface. BDGCs are suggested for dentin hypersensitivity treatment, implant coating, bone regeneration and periodontal therapy. Throughout this paper, we elaborate on the history, processing, properties and applications of RDGCs and BDGCs. We also report on selected papers that address promising types of dental glass-ceramics. Finally, we include trends and guidance on relevant open issues and research possibilities. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 105A: 619?639, 2017.

AB  - Abstract Indigenous Peoples worldwide are confronted by the increasing threat of pollution. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature (N = 686 studies), we present the current state of knowledge on i) the exposure and vulnerability of Indigenous Peoples to pollution; ii) the environmental, health and cultural impacts of pollution upon Indigenous Peoples; and iii) Indigenous Peoples? contributions to prevent, control, limit, and abate pollution from local to global scales. Indigenous Peoples experience large burdens of environmental pollution linked to the expansion of commodity frontiers and industrial development, including agricultural, mining and extractive industries, as well as urban growth, waste dumping, and infrastructure and energy development. Nevertheless, Indigenous Peoples are contributing to limit pollution in different ways, including through environmental monitoring and global policy advocacy, as well as through local resistance towards polluting activities. This work adds to growing evidence of the breadth and depth of environmental injustices faced by Indigenous Peoples worldwide, and we conclude by highlighting the need to increase Indigenous Peoples? engagement in environmental decision-making regarding pollution control.
