AB  - ABSTRACT We evaluated the effects of ibuprofen on cytokine production and mortality in a mouse model of septic shock induced by Vibrio vulnificus, strain Chi Mei Vv05191. Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) or saline (control) was given to female BALB/cByJ mice for three consecutive days before exposure to the pathogen. For cytokine production, serum and peritoneal fluid were assayed for IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-2 by ELISA at 3, 6, and 9 hr after intraperitoneal infection of the organism. At 6 hr after infection, serum and peritoneal fluid levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-2 were significantly higher in the ibuprofen group. For mortality determination, 73 mice (37 ibuprofen, 36 control) were injected intramuscularly with V. vulnificus. Kaplan?Meier survival curves were analyzed. Survival was significantly decreased by ibuprofen only for the lowest inoculum (25 CFU) of V. vulnificus. Administration of ibuprofen before infection may augment the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus by stimulating cytokine production.

AB  - Hypoxia is a critical hallmark of glioma, and significantly compromises treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, techniques for monitoring glioma pO2 to facilitate translational research are lacking. Furthermore, poor prognosis of patients with malignant glioma, in particular glioblastoma multiforme, warrant effective strategies that can inhibit hypoxia and improve treatment outcome. EPR oximetry using implantable resonators was implemented for monitoring pO2 in normal cerebral tissue and U251 glioma in mice. Breathing carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2) was tested for hyperoxia in the normal brain and glioma xenografts. A new strategy to inhibit glioma growth by rationally combining gemcitabine and MK-8776, a cell cycle checkpoint inhibitor, was also investigated. The mean pO2 of left and right hemisphere were ?56?69 mmHg in the normal cerebral tissue of mice. The mean baseline pO2 of U251 glioma on the first and fifth day of measurement was 21.9 ± 3.7 and 14.1 ± 2.4 mmHg, respectively. The mean brain pO2 including glioma increased by at least 100% on carbogen inhalation, although the response varied between the animals over days. Treatment with gemcitabine + MK-8776 significantly increased pO2 and inhibited glioma growth assessed by MRI. In conclusion, EPR oximetry with implantable resonators can be used to monitor the efficacy of carbogen inhalation and chemotherapy on orthotopic glioma in mice. The increase in glioma pO2 of mice breathing carbogen can be used to improve treatment outcome. The treatment with gemcitabine + MK-8776 is a promising strategy that warrants further investigation.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This study was designed to investigate the role of apoptosis on liver IR injury and to determine the effects of roscovitine on this process. Materials and methods: Rat livers pretreated with roscovitine received 60?min right lobe ischemia followed by 4?h (n=8) and 24?h (n=8) reperfusion. Tissue injury was evaluated by serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, tissue malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase measurements and histological examination. Dead (apoptotic and necrotic) hepatocytes were determined by trypan blue dye and apoptosis was evaluated with M30 monoclonal antibody. Results: Administration of roscovitine significantly decreased both apoptotic and dead hepatocyte counts compared to controls (P<0.01). Liver transaminase levels were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-pretreated groups (P<0.05). In the groups evaluated 24?h after reperfusion, MPO levels (P<0.02) and leukocyte infiltration on histologic sections were decreased significantly in the roscovitine-administered group compared to its control. Conclusions: This study indicates that hepatocyte apoptosis may play a role in the development of IR injury of the liver. Administration of roscovitine may be beneficial in preventing this injury.

AB  - Recent studies in neurodegenerative conditions have increasingly highlighted that the same neuropathology can trigger different clinical phenotypes or, vice-versa, that similar phenotypes can be triggered by different neuropathologies. This evidence has called for the adoption of a pathology spectrum-based approach to study neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These conditions share brain deposition of abnormal protein aggregates, leading to aberrant biochemical, metabolic, functional, and structural changes. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-recognized and unique tool for the in vivo assessment of brain neuropathology, and novel PET techniques are emerging for the study of specific protein species. Today, key applications of PET range from early research and clinical diagnostic tools to their use in clinical trials for both participants screening and outcome evaluation. This position article critically reviews the role of distinct PET molecular tracers for different neurodegenerative proteinopathies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, with special emphasis on methodological challenges and future applications.

AB  - Abstract Osteochondral lesions resulting from osteochondritis dissecans are problematic to treat and present a significant challenge for clinicians. The aims of this study were to investigate the use of a scaffold-assisted microfracture approach, employing a novel, multilayered, collagen-based, osteochondral graft substitute in the treatment of severe osteochondritis dissecans of both lateral femoral trochlear ridges in an equine athlete, and to assess the potential of this novel scaffold to enhance repair of the osteochondral unit. A 15 month-old female filly presented with large osteochondritis dissecans lesions involving both femoral lateral trochlear ridges. After routine arthroscopic debridement and microfracture of the subchondral bone, multilayered osteochondral defect repair scaffolds were implanted into the fragmentation beds in both left and right femoropatellar joints via mini-arthrotomies. Exploratory arthroscopy 5 months postimplantation revealed smooth cartilaginous repair tissue, contiguous with the adjacent cartilage, covering the defect. At 22-month follow up, the filly had no signs of lameness and was exercising at her intended level. Radiographically, although still slightly flattened, the femoral trochlear ridges were smooth, with no evidence of osteoarthritis. Ultrasonographically, the defects were filled with bone and covered with an overlying cartilaginous layer, with the trochlear ridge contour almost entirely restored. This report demonstrates the effective clinical use of this novel, multilayered, osteochondral defect repair scaffold in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of an equine athlete. The successful repair achieved here using this novel scaffold in an equine patient with large bilateral lesions shows the potential for clinical translation in the treatment of human patients presenting with osteochondral defects.
