AB  - Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure prior to traumatic injury, such as a burn, elevates systemic and local inflammatory responses and increases morbidity and mortality. Adipose is a large tissue mass that is often inflamed during obesity or other stresses, which disturbs metabolic homeostasis. To date, there has been little investigation into the inflammatory response of adipose tissue after combined EtOH exposure and burn injury. Methods Two EtOH exposure regimens were utilized to examine the role of inflammation in adipose tissue after EtOH and burn injury. Mice were either given a single or episodic binge exposure to EtOH or saline followed by scald (burn) or sham injury 30 minutes later. Twenty-four hours post injury, serum and adipose tissue were collected for assessment of inflammatory mediators. Results Single binge EtOH alone induced no inflammation in adipose when compared with sham vehicle-treated mice. However, single binge EtOH followed by burn injury induced significant elevations in mRNA and protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 compared with either insult alone or sham vehicle group. Additionally, EtOH exposure and burn injury significantly blunted inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating a complex inflammatory response. Episodic binge EtOH exposure followed by burn injury exacerbated the postburn adipose inflammatory response. The magnitude of the episodic binge-induced inflammatory parameters postburn were 2- to 5-fold greater than the response detected after a single exposure of EtOH, indicating EtOH-induced potentiation of burn-induced inflammatory response. Finally, inflammatory loci and crown-like structures in adipose were significantly increased by episodic binge EtOH and burn injury. Conclusions This is the first report of binge and burn-induced crown-like structure formation. Evidence presented herein suggests an important role for alcohol and burn as an additional mediator of adipose inflammation in postburn injury, a common complication in burn patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of a vitamin D3 analogue (BXL628) in a model of chronic cystitis, as calcitriol analogues might be an interesting new therapeutic option for interstitial cystitis, for although the cause of the disease remains unclear, the increase in mast cells in the mucosa and detrusor muscle are significant. MATERIALS AND METHODS We devised a mouse model of allergen-induced allergic cystitis that is associated with the up-regulation of genes for interleukin-13, Fc?RIα and mast cells-derived proteases, a massive inflammatory reaction in the bladder tissue, and augmented levels of mast cell-derived protease 1 (MMCP1) detected in mouse sera. RESULTS Oral administration of BXL628 significantly reduced the expression of interleukin-13, Fc?RIα and MMCP1 in the bladder. Furthermore, histological analysis showed a decrease in oedema and leukocyte infiltration in the bladder wall. BXL628 treatment reduced serum MMCP1 levels, indicating an effect on mast cell degranulation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D3 analogues may successfully be used as anti-inflammatory agents in allergen-mediated inflammatory reactions. Moreover, the modulatory effect shown on mast cell activation by the BXL628 analogue strongly supports its potential therapeutic use in a possibly mast cell-dependent disease such as human interstitial cystitis.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Serosa-infiltrating gastric cancer poses a high risk for peritoneal recurrence. This study examined the feasibility and efficacy of preoperative intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy for such cancer. Methods Patients with serosa-infiltrating tumors, diagnosed by conventional examinations as well as by staging laparoscopy, were enrolled in this study. Those with unresectable T4 tumors, visible peritoneal metastasis or distant organ metastasis were excluded. Twenty-five eligible patients received preoperative i.p. chemotherapy, which consisted of i.p. injection of 20 mg of mitomycin C on day 1 and 10 mg of cisplatin for 5 days, followed by surgery. Results Of the 25 patients, 24 underwent gastrectomy with lymph node dissection and 1 underwent palliative gastrojejunostomy. The curability of the surgery was curability A in 6, B in 16, and C in 3. Preoperative T stages (T3 in 21 and T4 in 4) were downstaged postoperatively (T1 in 1, T2 in 10, T3 in 11, and T4 in 3). The 1- and 2-year overall survival was 83.3 and 51.3%, respectively. The median survival time was 24.4 months. The toxicity of the preoperative treatment was tolerable and no serious postoperative complication was seen. Conclusions Preoperative i.p. chemotherapy seems to be a safe and effective therapy for serosa-infiltrating gastric cancer. Randomized clinical trials comparing preoperative i.p. chemotherapy followed by surgery and surgery alone are needed. J. Surg. Oncol. 2004;88:39?43. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The complexity of providing adequate care after radiation exposure has drawn increasing attention. While most therapeutic development has focused on improving survival at lethal radiation doses, acute hematopoietic syndrome (AHS) occurs at substantially lower exposures. Thus, it is likely that a large proportion of such a radiation-exposed population will manifest AHS of variable degree and that the medical and socioeconomic costs of AHS will accrue. Here, we examined the potential of rBPI21 (opebacan), used without supportive care, to accelerate hematopoietic recovery after radiation where expected survival was substantial (42%-75%) at 30 days. rBPI21 administration was associated with accelerated recovery of hematopoietic precursors and normal marrow cellularity, with increases in megakaryocyte numbers particularly marked. This translated into attaining normal trilineage peripheral blood counts 2-3 weeks earlier than controls. Elevations of hematopoietic growth factors observed in plasma and the marrow microenvironment suggest the mechanism is likely multifactorial and not confined to known endotoxin-neutralizing and cytokine downmodulating activities of rBPI21. These observations deserve further exploration in radiation models and other settings where inadequate hematopoiesis is a prominent feature. These experiments also model the potential of therapeutics to limit the allocation of scarce resources after catastrophic exposures as an endpoint independent of lethality mitigation.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - 1 Ahmed T. Abdelmoity, and 1 Amit Verma ( 1 Peter Kellaway Section of Neurophysiology, Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Rationale: Benzodiazepines are rarely used as long term therapy for patients with epilepsy. However, once traditional antiepileptic drugs have failed an adjunct trial may be justified to help reduce seizure frequency. 1 ?Patient's Initials ?Seizure Type Seizure frequency ?before Seizure Frequency ?after ?Date started Clorazepate ?dose S.A.

Localization Related - Right Frontal 5?6 per week 1?2 per week 2/09/2005 11.25 at night Patient Demographics and Seizure Frequencies Prior to and After Starting Tranxene SD. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients from the Baylor Comprehensive Epilepsy Program Outpatient Clinic. Patients who had been started on Tranxene SD (a sustained release preparation of Clorazepate) were enrolled into the study. Five patients with refractory epilepsy, met criteria for enrollment. Of these patients, two patients had a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy, and three had a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy. Seizure frequencies were recorded prior to and after the initiation of Tranxene SD. Baseline seizure frequencies ranged from daily seizures to two seizures a week. Duration of follow-up ranged from 20 days to seven months. The total daily dose ranged from 5.625 mg up to 33.75 mg (either in once or twice a day dosing). Results: Tranxene SD was effective in 100% of patients, with 3 of 5 patients becoming seizure free. Please see table for detailed results in each patient. Irritability and increased daytime sleepiness were the most common side effects to Clorazepate. These side effects were tolerated well by the patients. Subjective sleepiness was initially reported by patients, which then returned to baseline. Conclusions: In our small series of patients with refractory generalized and localization related epilepsy, a significant reduction in seizure frequency was seen in all patients started on Tranxene SD. The small sample size may be resonsible for the realtively dramatic results seen in our patients. Adverse reactions including increased sleepiness were manageable. The duration of follow-up was relatively short to assess whether tachyphylaxis is a problem with continued treatment. It is possible that treatment with Tranxene SD (or other benzodiazepines) may be useful in short term durations to help decrease seizure frequencies.

Methods: Forty-six non-consecutive patients with refractory epilepsy submitted to CR were studied. Age ranged from 17 to 58 years (M = 37.6±8.7). Twenty-seven patients were males. All patients have been followed up at the Hospital Brigadeiro Epilepsy Surgery Program in S?o Paulo. The follow-up time range from 2 months to 11 years. Only one patient was unable to read and write. Twenty-four patients have been rendered seizure-free after surgery, 20 patients had partial complex seizures and 2 patients had partial with secondary generalization. Results: Twenty-six patients (56.5%) were professionally impaired by epilepsy. Twenty-seven of them (58.7%) were afraid that seizures could interfere in their professional life; twenty-six patients (56.5%) believed that epilepsy restricted their professional choices and thirty-two of them (69.5%) believed that epilepsy had already caused problems in their professional life. Six of them who were employed before surgery lost their jobs. Three patients that were not working before surgery are employed nowadays. Conclusions: Data concerning epilepsy and employment are scarce in the Brazilian population, especially after CR. Despite the fact that almost all patients could read and write, most of them had no professional skills. The high unemployment and sub-employment rate found in our patients, even in those who were cured by surgery, highlights the need for the development of rehabilitation programs directed to this selected population, as a way of improving quality of life and self-esteem.

Although fatigue is a frequent and disabling symptom in epileptic patients, there have been only a few investigations on the subject. We examined the frequency of fatigue and depression in semptomatic and idiopatic epilepsy patients and we aimed to assess the relationship between fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients by using P300. Methods: We measured fatigue and depression with the Fatigue Severity Scale(FSS) and Beck Depression Scale(BDS), respectivelly in 19 patients with idiopatic epilepsy, 54 patients with semptomatic epilepsy and 31 control subjects. The oddball paradigm was used in the measurement of P300 in all groups. Results: FSS and BDS scores were significantly high and latancies of P300 were significantly long in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients. There was a poor corelation between depression and fatigue in epileptic patients. Although latencies of P300 was significantly long in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients with fatigue, there was no correlation latencies of P300 and depression. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there is an important relationship between fatigue and cognitive dysfunctions in idiopatic and semptomatic epilepsy patients. 1 Sinan A. Barazi, 1 Richard P. Selway, 1 Gautam Tawari, and 1 Charles E. Polkey ( 1 Neurosurgery, Kings College Hospital, London, United Kingdom ) Rationale: VNS is being used increasingly as treatment for intractable epilepsy. There is to date no long term study investigating the satisfaction of patients with this emerging therapy, and few data on outcome at more than five years Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 62 patients with intractable epilepsy, who were treated at King's College Hospital between 1995 and 2000, by RPS and CEP. The patients' mean age at time of implantation of VNS was 28.7 years (range 6 to 59 years); the average duration of epilepsy at implantation was 20.4 years (4 to 56); the mean age at seizure onset was 8.8 years (0 to 50); mean follow-up was 76 months (51 to 114). 3 patients died of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We questioned patients on overall benefit of their VNS treatment, and differences in memory, achievements, mood, verbal skills, alertness, cluster seizures and post-ictal confusion. Results: The median pre- and post-implantation monthly seizure frequency in the 35 patients who continue to use the device are 24 (3 to 1800) and 4.5 (0 to 1000) respectively (mean improvement 59.1%, median follow-up 71 months). Retention rate is 59%. Corresponding median monthly seizure frequency in all patients was 22 (1 to 1800), and 9.5 (0 to 1000). 26 patients (44.1%) had no improvement, 5 (8.5%) had less than 50% improvement, 26 (44.1%) had greater than 50% improvement in seizure frequency (including 4 seizure-free), and 2 patients (3%) were worse. 24 patients who no longer use the device have undergone explantation (median 71 months follow-up; one infection, 23 non-efficacy). 27 patients (45.8%) were dissatisfied with VNS, 26 (44.1%) were satisfied, and 6 (10.1%) were undecided. Of 28 patients who had no improvement or a deterioration in their seizure frequency, 1 was satisfied with the VNS experience, 3 were undecided, and 24 were dissatisfied. Of the 31 patients who experienced an overall improvement in seizure frequency, 3 were dissatisfied, 3 were undecided, and 25 were satisfied. Mean quality of life measures showed an improvement in all domains. Conclusions: VNS shows a long term retention rate and efficacy which is highly favourable when compared to medical treatments for intractable epilepsy. 44.1% of our patient group was satisfied with VNS, and 45.8% of patients was dissatisfied. 1 Iblissen Ben Hamouda, 1 Claude Adam, 1 Michel Baulac, and 1 Vincent Navarro ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France ) Rationale: Pseudo-epileptic seizures (PES) with prolonged duration and resistance to short-acting antiepileptic drug may sometimes be taken for a status epilepticus. Ours goal were to examine (i) the frequency of pseudo-epilepticus status admitted on intensive care units (ICU) among patients with pseudo-epileptic seizures, (ii) the clinical and electrophysiological presentations of these patients and (iii) their comorbidity. Methods: We researched among the population of patients with PES, followed in our Epilepsy Unit on a period of 28 months, those who were admitted in an intensive care unit. We examined clinical and EEG presentation of their manifestations, and medical history. Results: (i) We identified 13 patients for which the diagnosis of pseudo-epilepticus status was secondarly done, among 64 patients with PES. Patients were aged from 16 to 58 years, 5 males and 8 females. Diagnosis of PES was done in intensive care unit in 1/13 cases. (ii) Motor activities were present during PES (n = 12). In intensive care unit, EEG was not performed (n = 6), showed artefacts during the motor activities (n = 2) (that were considered as epileptic for 1 patient), slow waves (n = 1), fast activities due to medication (n = 1) and was normal (n = 3). Eight patients received high doses of AED when admitted on intensive care unit, and three where under respiratory assistance. (iii) Eleven had chronic psychiatric manifestations and 9 had psychogenic precipitating factors. Three patients have a history of epilepsy. Four patients had previous hospitalisations for pseudo-epilepticus status. Conclusions: Pseudo-epileptic statuses admitted in intensive care units are frequent. Clinical presentation and EEG may be misleading. ICU physicians must be aware of this condition and avoid aggressive treatment. 1 Meriem K. Bensalem Owen, and 1 Toufic A. Fakhoury ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY ) Rationale: The objective of this study is to emphasize the importance of repeating video-EEG monitoring in patients with epilepsy when they have a change in seizure semiology and to pay special attention to concomitant ECG recordings. Methods: We describe two patients who developed a change in their semiology after initial video-EEG monitoring. The first patient is a 25 year old man with stereotypic events since childhood characterized by palpitations at times associated with a sensation of fear. His first EEG-CCTV study was unrevealing. Subsequent interviews with witnesses to his events revealed that brief periods of confusion and pressured out of context speech are at times associated with these events. The second patient is a 60 year old woman who was evaluated for a longstanding history of refractory epilepsy. EEG-CCTV monitoring showed partial seizures originating from the left temporal lobe. A few months later there was a change in the semiology of her seizures, which became more severe and associated with loss of consciousness leading to falls. Both patients had repeat EEG-CCTV studies. Results: During the first patient's repeat EEG-CTV study, stereotypical events were recorded and consisted of simple partial seizures with or without evolution to complex partial seizures. On one occasion, there was secondary generalization. The study localized the epileptogenic focus to the right temporal lobe. Concomitant ECG showed sinus tachycardia, with the heart rate increasing up to 200 beats per minute. In the second patient the repeat study again localized the epileptogenic focus to the left temporal lobe. However, with the more severe seizures associated with loss of consciousness, concomitant ECG showed bradycardia leading to asystole which lasted as long as 16 seconds. The patient subsequently had a demand pacemaker inserted. Conclusions: Repeating video-EEG monitoring is critical in the evaluation of patients with epilepsy who develop a change in seizure semiology. In addition, concomitant ECG recordings should be reviewed carefully in view of possible arrhythmogenic effects of seizures. 1 Dietrich Blumer, and 2 Bola Adamolekun ( 1 Psychiatry, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN ; and 2 Neurology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN ) Rationale: A majority of studies has shown a concurrence rate of epilepsy in patients with nonepileptic seizures (NES) of about 10% to 18%; most frequently epileptic seizures (ES) and NES occur sequentially rather than simultaneously, often beginning with the former (1). This group of patients has found little attention. We have explored the alternating relationship of the two types of paroxysmal disorders and report a novel treatment for patients with the history of both ES and NES - reduction of the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to the minimum required to achieve optimal freedom from seizures - that proved remarkably effective in our first two patients, one with initial ES and one with initial NES. The same treatment has since been applied in five more patients with both well documented ES and NES. Methods: Presence of ES and NES were documented by Video-EEG (VEEG) whenever possible. AEDs were very gradually decreased as frequent NES predominated. Results: The first patient had experienced nocturnal ES for 30 years. After 2 years of freedom from seizures, diurnal spells occurred and, over 15 years, became more frequent upon increasing antiepileptic treatments; she became anergic, fearful and headaches became constant. After EEG monitoring showed NES only, her antiepileptic treatment was gradually decreased until she regained, after 2 years, full health without seizures. The second patient was initially diagnosed by VEEG as having NES; he was disabled, anxious and depressed. After 6 years he experienced a flurry of ES, followed by remarkable improvement of his mental state. Upon treatment with AED his former NES condition resumed. He finally recovered once the AED was reduced. Over the last 6 months, the effectiveness of reducing AEDs has been clearly confirmed in five consecutive patients with both types of seizures. Of the seven patients, five had initially presented for treatment with ES and two with NES. Six had a personal history of early trauma, and five had a family history of epilepsy. Conclusions: A lowering of the AED to the minimum required for control of the ES appears to be required to achieve optimal freedom from either seizure. NESs have a psychobiologic basis and have been recognized as posttraumatic startle seizures (2). Excessive suppression of the epileptic paroxysmal activity favors the expression of the posttraumatic paroxysmal activity in patients with both types of paroxysmal disorders. Of etiological significance is the finding that the patients commonly have both a personal history of trauma and a family history of epilepsy.

The time course of these effects has not been fully determined. Methods: The hour before through the hour after seizures in 4 patients with TL epilepsy (11 to 42 years old; 3 female, 1 male; right- sided onset seizures in 2, left-sided onset in 2) were studied. RR intervals were interpolated with a cubic spline function and highpass filtered. Wavelet coefficients were determined from the continuous wavelet transform and converted to amplitudes with the Hilbert transform. Changes in sympathetic and vagal HR modulation were inferred from changes in high frequency (HF, 0.15?0.5 Hz) and low frequency (LF, 0.04?0.15 Hz) power from the following rules: a change in vagal activity is reflected by a change in HF and LF power in that direction, a change in sympathetic activity is reflected in HF activity in that direction, and changes in the LF/HF ratio resolve ambiguous patterns arising from simultaneous changes in sympathetic and vagal HR modulation. Results: Nine complex partial seizures were recorded: 4 secondarily generalized (left onset in 3, right in 1) and 5 did not (left onset in 2, right in 3). Pre-ictal HR modulations attributable to seizures were small in relation to background fluctuations. The number of seizures showing increased sympathetic and decreased vagal HR modulation increased as the seizure approached (Fig 1). 8/9 seizures demonstrated ictal tachycardia (mean pre-ictal HR + 3 SD). All were associated with a very low frequency peak (0.004?0.04 Hz), on average exceeding the pre-ictal baseline by 4.8 SD. This peak was coincident with LF and HF minima, and corresponds to sustained sympathetically mediated acceleration of the HR. In the post-ictal period, in 8/9 seizures vagal HR modulation was at least transiently lower in the post-ictal state than in any of the points in a reference state composed of a random sampling of 20% of the points on the HF and LF curves in the pre-ictal period. Secondarily generalized seizures were associated with longer periods of this degree of vagal depression than complex partial seizures (mean 26 vs. 11 min): limited data suggested that LF HRV and respiratory frequency were uncoupled in this period. Increased post-ictal sympathetic HR modulation was often evident, but was less extreme and of a shorter duration. Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that increased sympathetic and decreased vagal HR modulation often precede the electroclinical onset and ictus of TL seizures. The post-ictal period is characterized by decreased vagal HR modulation that persists for considerably longer after secondarily generalized seizures.

Bromfield ( 1 Neurology, Brigham  and 2 Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Despite the fact that refractory status epilepticus (RSE) represents an important cause of neurological morbidity and mortality, there have been few studies of its treatment, particularly comparisons among drugs used for coma-induction. Most studies are case series in which a specific antiepileptic drug (AED) was prescribed, and do not accurately reflect the variety of approaches used in clinical practice. Moreover, the impact on outcome of EEG suppression remains unclear. Methods: Among 127 episodes (107 patients) of status epilepticus (SE) collected from a retrospective database of two tertiary-referral hospitals in Boston, we identified cases that were refractory to first-line (benzodiazepines) and second-line (phenytoin valproate, phenobarbital, or other) AED, and needed intubation and induced coma for clinical management. Coma induction was assessed with regard to the AED used and the extent of EEG suppression achieved. Short-term mortality was analyzed in relationship to demographic and clinical variables, and the treatment strategy used. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results: We identified 49 episodes of RSE occurring in 47 patients. RSE tended to occur more frequently in incident SE than in recurrent SE episodes (p = 0.06). Mortality was 23% for RSE and 8% for non-RSE patients (p = 0.05); patients with RSE episodes were more likely to lack a history of epilepsy (p = 0.01) or of SE (p = 0.05) prior to the study period, and had a higher prevalence of nonconvulsive SE with coma (p = 0.07). One coma-inducing AED was prescribed in 45%, whereas two ore more were used in 55% of episodes; the most used agents were barbiturates (31 episodes), propofol (27) and midazolam (19); in 20/33 (61%) monitored episodes, the medication was titrated to EEG burst-suppression. Demographics, clinical variables and outcome did not differ significantly between the different coma-inducing strategies, or between episodes with and without EEG burst-suppression. Barbiturates showed a tendency to be used preferentially in episodes related to ominous etiologies. Conclusions: RSE has a higher prevalence in incident than in recurrent SE, and shows higher mortality than non-RSE. In our series, RSE episodes were managed with a combination of coma-inducing AED markedly more often than in series published previously. In this setting, which may more accurately reflect usual clinical practice, mortality appears to be independent of the specific AED used for coma induction and the extent of EEG suppression, suggesting, in agreement with previous studies, that the underlying etiology is the main determinant of outcome.

Methods: A 6-month, open-label, uncontrolled trial was undertaken in 28 patients. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 16 years and weight ≥ 30 kg with the maximum interval since epilepsy diagnosis was 3 years and had at least one partial-onset seizure during a 3-months retrospective baseline phase. The main outcome measures proportion of patients who showed 50% or greater reduction in frequency of seizures and withdraw from the study for any reason. Topiramate was initiated at 50 mg/day and titrated to a recommended dose of 200?400 mg/day Results: Topiramate treated patients demonstrated significant improvement in seizure severity based on 77.3% were seizure-free. The percentage of patients with a ≥50% seizure rate reduction from baseline was 13.6%, and 9.1% were not improved. There were no discontinuations from the study due to adverse events. The adverse events were mild intensity included paresthesia, dizziness, weight loss, anorexia, numbness, slow mentation, and hypoesthesia. Conclusions: The study suggests that topiramate in doses 50?200 mg/day was well tolerated and effective in the monotherapy treatment of patients with partial epilepsy.

The aim of this study was to determine the mortality rate due to SUDEP in patients who had epilepsy surgery at the Hospital Brigadeiro Epilepsy Unit (S?o Paulo, Brazil). Methods: Nine hundred and fifty patients who underwent epilepsy surgery between January 1996 and January 2005 were included in the study. All subjects had been followed up until January 2005. Results: During the study period, two SUDEP episodes occurred. Both patients died during the early stage after surgical procedures. No SUDEP occurred among the remaining 948 patients who had epilepsy surgery even after long term follow-up. Patient I: This 32 years-old man had simple and complex partial seizures since the age of 8 (seizure's frequency, 1?2/week). MRI disclosed right mesial temporal sclerosis. He was submitted to an uneventful right cortico-amygdalo-hippocampectomy. By Day 9 after surgery, he was packing together with his mother to leave the Hospital and presented SUDEP. Necropsy showed no pathological substrate for SUDEP. Patient II: This 18 years old boy had postural frontal lobe seizures since the age of 2. MRI was normal. Ictal and interictal video-EEG showed secondary bilateral synchrony. He was submitted to bifronto-mesial subdural electrodes implantation. On the second post-operative day, he was having breakfast, waiting to be transferred to the Video-EEG Unit and presented SUDEP. Necropsy showed no pathological substrate for SUDEP. Conclusions: The unexplained cause of SUDEP in patients with refractory epilepsy still remains a challenge. Our results suggest that SUDEP's incidence might be lower in our populatiom than that noted in other studies, especially in those reporting on chronically refractory epileptic patients.

The purpose of the study is to show our experience in relation to etiologies and clinical characteristics in elderly epilepsy. Methods: We made a prospective clinical study of epileptic patients older than 60 years, all cases were inpatients in the Epilepsy Unit of the biggest Peruvian hospital between January 2002 to December 2004. Results: Among 248 epileptic patients, 58 cases were older than 60 years and none of them had antecedents of seizures. It was possible to find a focal etiology in all patients. Stroke was the most frequent cause in 31 patients, followed by tumour in 13 causes. Most patients had generalized seizures and neurological focal findings. We don't report status epilepticus cases. Conclusions: As in developing countries, we found that stroke is the most frequent etiology in Peruvian epileptic elderly patients, and generalized seizures are the most common seizure type. 1 Antonio Donaire, 1 Mar Carreño, 1 Rolando Agudo, 1 Nuria Bargalló, and 1 Carmen Tur ( 1 Neurology, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain ) Rationale: Seizure semiology plays an important role in the epilepsy classification proccess. Long-term video EEG evaluation (LTVE) is considered the ?gold-standard? to study seizure semiology. However, LTVE is not always available and seizure semiology has to be inferred from the clinical history. The aim of this study was to compare the seizure semiology reported by the patient in an outpatient tertiary epilepsy clinic with the semiology observed during LTVE to determine the degree of reliability of the symptoms and signs referred by the patients. Methods: We analyzed the seizure semiology reported in the outpatient clinic to an experienced epileptologist by all patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical evaluation between 1990?2004 and compared it with the seizure semiology observed during LTVE. Concordance rate was defined as percentage of patients who described a certain seizure semiology which was later confirmed during LTVE. Seizures were classified according to the semiological seizure classification. Recorded seizures were reviewed by two independent observers. Results: We reviewed the medical reports as well as the LTVE evaluation of 330 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent presurgical evaluation (166 men; mean age 36). Epilepsy was classified as frontal in 49 patients (15%), temporal in 205(62%), parieto-occipital in 23(7%) and just focal epilepsy in 53(16%). More patients reported auras before (224) than during LTVE (126). On the contrary, lateralizing signs were seen during LTVE (120) more frequently than reported in the outpatient clinic (77). When lateralizing signs were reported in the outpatient clinic and then observed during LTVE, their concordance rate was 75%(28/36). In frontal lobe epilepsy the seizure semiology agreement before and after LTVE was 41%. The best concordance (100%) was seen in bilateral asymmetric seizures, followed by dialeptic seizures (80%). In TLE the concordance in seizure semiology was 69%, being higher in automotor seizures (79%) and lowest in dialeptic seizures (37%), because up to 60% of automotor seizures were described as dialeptic seizures in the outpatient clinic. In parieto-occipital lobe epilepsy the concordance was 45%, being higher in simple motor seizures (tonic/clonic) (80%) followed by automotor seizures (40%). Considering only seizure types, the highest degree of concordance was seen in automotor seizures (80%), followed by dialeptic seizures (44.6%) focal motor (tonic and clonic) seizures (39%). Conclusions: Concordance in seizure semiology reported by the patients and later observed during LTVE seems to be high in TLE, followed by parieto-occipital and frontal lobe epilepsy. The seizure types that show a higher degree of concordance are automotor, focal motor, and dialeptic seizures. Epileptic auras are more frequently reported before than actually during LTVE; lateralizing signs are seen more often during LTVE, although when patients report them, they usually do it accurately. 1 John O. Elliott, and 1 Mercedes P. Jacobson ( 1 Neurology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Elevated serum homocysteine (s-Hcy) is recognized as an independent risk factor in premature coronary disease and cognitive impairment. A recent study by van Meurs, et. al. found the risk of fracture was double in those with elevated s-Hcy. Epidemiological studies have found the incidence of fracture in epilepsy to be twice that of the normal population. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) have been shown to increase s-Hcy by lowering blood folate levels. The literature suggests a homocysteine-associated disturbance in collagen cross-linking is involved in bone loss. The goal of this study was to see if there is a relationship between metabolic bone loss in epilepsy and homocysteine. Methods: Standard practice in our clinic is to address bone health and nutrition with all patients. We screened 405 patient charts seen in our clinic over the past 2 years. Data on 120 patients included: age, gender, seizure type, years on AEDs, s-Hcy, serum folic acid (s-FA), supplementation patterns and DEXA screening results was compiled. Results: This was an adult epilepsy population: mean age: 44 years (SD = 14.1, range 17 to 81), there were 51 males and 69 females. Fifty were African American, 46 Caucasian, 20 Latino and 3 Asian/Other, average length of AED exposure: 26 years (SD = 14.8, range 2 to 64). DEXA results were found for 85 patients and homocysteine levels for 103 patients. Sixty-seven patients had complete records. Sixty-four subjects had abnormal DEXA results (osteopenia n = 35, osteoporosis n = 29). Normal DEXA results were found in 21 patients. There was a history of fracture in 22 subjects (18%). Mean homocysteine levels in micromol/L (SD) were 11.3 (7.6) for African Americans, 12.5 (8.3) Latinos, 9.4 (4.1) Caucasians and 6.8 (0.8) Asian/Other. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed. Bone loss status was not significantly correlated with s-Hcy (n = 67; Pearson's r = .11, p = .38). Surprisingly, length of years on AEDs was not correlated with an increased risk for bone loss (n = 85; Pearson's r = -.001, p = .99). As expected, body weight was inversely correlated with bone loss (n = 85; Pearson's r = -0.46, p = .000) and s-Hcy was inversely correlated with s-FA (n = 89; Pearson's r = -0.41, p = .000). Only four subjects had s-FA below the normal range of 5.4 ng/ml. Conclusions: This is the first study to look at s-Hcy and bone loss in epilepsy. Our data does not support a relationship, however; the use of a retrospective design may have prevented us from detecting an effect, since only 67 patients had completed both tests and half of the patients took multivitamins. In addition, this study included some older indivduals with diagnosis of epilepsy at mid-life. Our data supports previous studies, which found elevated s-Hcy in patients taking AEDs. Based on our data, elevated s-Hcy may also be related to ethnicity and/or related dietary habits. Six AEDs have known anti-folate mechanisms in pregnancy, cardiovascular protection and bone loss. Nutritional supplementation continues to be important in preventative epilepsy care. 1 Claudia Engbring, 1 Christoph Kellinghaus, 1 Stefan Evers, 1 Frank Bösebeck, 1 Gabriel Möddel, and 1 Ingo W. Husstedt ( 1 Neurology, University of Münster, Münster, Germany ) Rationale: Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is associated with infections of the central nervous system secondary to immunodeficiency as well as with neurological deficits due to direct effects of the neurotropic virus itself. Seizures and epilepsy are not rare among HIV-infected patients. However, systematic data about incidence and prevalence of seizures and epilepsy in HIV-positive patients are scarce. We intended to investigate the incidence and prevalence of acute seizures and epilepsy in neurological patients infected with HIV. Methods: The database of the Department of Neurology, University Hospitals Münster, was searched for patients with HIV-infection admitted to in-patient or out-patient treatment between 1992 and 2004. Their charts were reviewed regarding all available sociodemographic, clinical, neurophysiological, imaging and laboratory data. If possible, information about seizure therapy and outcome was gathered. Stage of infection according to the CDC-classification. Results: Of 831 HIV-infected patients admitted to our department, 51 (6,2%) had seizures and/or epilepsy. Eight of the 51 patients (16%) were diagnosed with epilepsy before the onset of the HIV-infection. Eleven patients (22%) only had single or few provoked seizures in the setting of acute cerebral disorders (8 patients), drug withdrawal or sleep withdrawal (2 patients), or of unknown cause (1 patient). Thirty-two patients (63%) developed epilepsy in the course of their HIV-infection. Of the 51 patients, 38 (75%) were already diagnosed with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrom (AIDS) at their first documented contact. Toxoplasmosis (7 patients), progressive multifocal leukodystrophy (7 patients) and other acute or subacute cerebral infections (5 patients) were the most frequent causes of seizures. EEG data of 38 patients were available. EEG showed generalized and diffuse slowing in 14 patients, regional slowing in 12 patients and epileptiform discharges in 1 patient. Only 9 of the patients had normal EEG. The majority of the patients (46 patients = 90%) were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Twenty-seven patients (53%) were on anticonvulsant therapy (gabapentin14 patients, carbamazepine 9 patients, valproat 2 patients, phenytoin 1 patient, lamotrigine 1 patient). Conclusions: Seizures are a relevant neurological symptom during the course of HIV-infection. Although in some patients seizures only occur in the setting of acute disease progress, the majority of patients with newly onset seizures eventually develop epilepsy and require anticonvulsant therapy. 1 David M. Ficker, 1,2 Bruce K. Schefft, 1 Jerzy P. Szaflarski, 1 Michael D. Privitera, 1 Jennifer Cavitt, and 1 Angela Morriss ( 1 Neurology, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: To compare the frequency of depression in refractory temporal, extratemporal and primary generalized epilepsies confirmed by video/EEG monitoring. There have been conflicting reports that seizure localization is associated with depression. Methods: Records from the epilepsy monitoring unit admissions from January 2003 through March 2005 were reviewed for seizure localization (temporal vs. extratemporal vs. primary generalized). Patients who had seizures recorded on video/EEG and a Beck Depression Inventory ? Second Edition (BDI-II) measured were included for analysis. Patients with poorly localized seizures were excluded. Seizure localization was determined by ictal EEG onset and neuroimaging. Patient data was reviewed at our epilepsy surgery conference to finalize seizure localization. Results: 119 patients met inclusion criteria (63 temporal, 35 extratemporal and 21 primary generalized). 79 of the 98 patients with partial onset seizures had unilateral seizure onset (37 right, 42 left). ANOVA showed no differences between the three groups. Mean BDI-II scores Temporal Extratemporal Primary Gen Mean BDI-II 11.89 14.03 16.86 Std dev ?1.14 ?1.56 ?2.97 Overall, 37% of patients had depression based on BDI-II scores (score greater than 15). No differences were found in the frequency of depression among the three groups (frequency of depression: temporal: 28.6%, extratemporal: 42.9%, primary generalized: 52.4%, p = NS, Chi square). However, between group analyses showed that patients with primary generalized epilepsy were more likely to be depressed than patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. When the extratemporal and temporal groups were combined into a ?partial epilepsy? group, there were no differences in mean BDI-II score and frequency of depression when compared to the primary generalized group. No significant differences were found between left and right seizure onset and mean BDI-II scores or the frequency of depression. Conclusions: Patients with refractory generalized epilepsy had a greater frequency of depression than patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. No differences in mean BDI-II score was seen between temporal, extratemporal and primary generalized epilepsy. The high frequency of depression in refractory primary generalized epilepsy may be clinically important and warrants further study. 1 Nathan B. Fountain, and 1 Miao Liu ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: Population based epilepsy studies provide accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence but provide limited data about precise seizure (SZ) type and epilepsy syndrome characteristics because a detailed SZ history and diagnostic tests cannot be systematically obtained and detailed SZ frequencies are not known. We prospectively collected data on a finite epilepsy population to determine the characteristics defining each SZ type and epilepsy syndrome and correlated it with SZ frequencies, especially with regard to refractoriness. Methods: Standardized data were prospectively collected by epileptologists from patients seen in the UVA Epilepsy Clinic from April 1998 to November 2004. Data was acquired directly from patients and medical records, then refined and cleaned by standardized methods and updated at each clinic visit. Analysis was limited to patients with definite epilepsy at least 5 years old. Frequency of each SZ type was collected at each visit. Patients were categorized into 14 classes by the combination of SZ types they possessed. Epilepsy syndromes containing less than 10 patients were not included in comparisons. SZ frequency of each SZ type was plotted over time from June 2000 to November 2004. ?SZ-free? was defined as a total frequency of 0 for all types combined at the last clinic visit. Duration of SZ freedom was defined by interval since last visit at which any SZ were reported (SZ frequency > 0). Current SZ frequency was categorized as 0, 0 to <1, ≥1, and ≥30 SZ/mo. Results: A total of 1638 patients were analyzed. Overall, current SZ frequency was 0 in 51%, 0?1 in 14%, ≥1 in 35%, and ≥30 in 8%. SZ frequency was more likely to be 0 for patients with Only Generalized SZ (60%) compared to Only Partial SZ (47%) or Mixed SZ (40%) while Mixed SZ was more likely to be ≥30 SZ/mo (21%). Among the categories of SZ combinations, GTC Only was most likely to be SZ free (73%) and CPS+SPS+Secondary Generalized was least likely (33%). SZ frequency ≥30 was most common for Mixed SPS+Primary Generalized (57%) but this group only contained 7 patients. Among epilepsy syndromes, SZ freedom was most likely for Juvenile Absence (80%), Benign Rolandic (79%), and Idiopathic Localization-Related Not Further Classifiable (73%). Lennox-Gastaut (29%) was most likely to have ≥30 and Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (16%) is also likley but mostly due to myoclonic SZs. SZ frequency ≥1 was most likely for LGS (65%), frontal lobe epilepsy (50%), and MTLE (42%). MTLE patients were generally unlikely to be SZ free (44%) and also unlikely to have essentially daily SZs (5%). Conclusions: The overall rate of SZ freedom is surprisingly high. Refractoriness varies by epilepsy syndrome and SZ type but associates best with epilepsy syndrome. Patients with mixed SZ types are more likely to be refractory and have essentially daily SZs. MTLE was among the most frequently refractory, which is important because it represents the most common identifiable epilepsy syndrome. 1 Kristen M. Fowler, 1 Donald L. Schomer, 2 Cynthia L.

Significant comparisons for both seizure frequency (A) and seizure occurrence (B) are indicated in the table using numbers to show the level of significance an shading to reflect the positivity (black boxes) or negativity (white boxes) of the comparison. Level of significance is indicated as follows: 1 = p < 10; 2 = p < 05; 3 = p < 01; 4 < 001; 5 = p < 0001. Axis numbers = days of cycle; day 1 = menstrual onset; day ?14 = day of evulation. ] Rationale: Seizures may vary during the menstrual cycle because hormones have neuroactive properties and hormone levels change during the course of the cycle. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how seizure frequency and occurrence varies across the menstrual cycle. Methods: The subjects were the first 100 women with clinical and EEG features of localization-related epilepsy, 13?45 years old, who participated in the baseline phase of a larger multicenter investigation of cyclic progesterone therapy for intractable seizures. Each subject participated in a 3-month baseline phase during which she recorded seizures and menses. Midluteal serum progesterone levels were measured with 5 ng/ml cutoff to indicate ovulation. The data consisted of 1) average seizure frequencies for each cycle day and 2) proportions of cycles with seizure occurrence on a given cycle day. Statistical comparisons of seizure frequency and occurrence were performed using generalized estimating equation one-way ANOVA and logistic regression followed by pairwise multiple comparisons of days based on the least square means. The results (pairwise p-values) were then plotted as tables for ease of visualization of resulting patterns. Results: Data were available for 292 cycles: 229 (78.4%) were ovulatory; 54 (18.4%) were anovulatory; no sample was collected for 9 cycles. The distribution of both seizure frequencies and occurrence on particular days was not uniform across the cycle (ANOVA p < .001). There was a 2-fold difference between highest (day 1) and lowest (day -8 and day 7) frequencies for both seizure frequency and occurrence. Pairwise daily comparisons are shown in Fig. 1. Two-way ANOVA did not show a significant interaction between ovulation status and seizure patterns. Comparison of seizure distributions in cycles with high vs low progesterone levels, however, showed significant differences for both seizure frequency (ANOVA p < .001) and occurrence (p < .05). Conclusions: The distribution of seizure frequencies and days with seizure occurrence varies significantly over the course of the menstrual cycle with the highest likelihood perimenstrually and the lowest during the midluteal and midfollicular phases.

D Giano ( 1 Epilepsy Program, Institute for Neurological Research - FLENI, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: Epilepsy currently affects 1?1.5% of elderly being the third most frequently encountered neurologic problem in this population. Additionally, the incidence of new onset epilepsy is higher among the elderly than in any other age group. As in the general population, EEG and MRI are the cornerstones of diagnostic assessment; however, the finding of nonspecific changes associated with aging that do not necessarily indicate an underlying predisposition for epilepsy makes results difficult to interpret. The purpose of the current study is to give an overview of epidemiologic data in the elderly, focusing on etiology and seizure semiology. Methods: Retrospective database and medical records analysis of adult patients with epilepsy admitted to our Epilepsy Program from January 2004 to May 2005. Results: 19 out of 292 (6.5%) patients, 11 women and 8 men, admitted to our program were older than 65 with a diagnosis of new-onset epilepsy. The mean age of seizure onset was 73 years old (range: 65?86). The seizure semiology included: generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in 7 (37%), with a 57% occurring only over sleep; complex partial seizures (CPS) in 3; simple partial seizures (SPS) in 2; SPS evolving to CPS in 2 and complex partial seizures with secondary generalization (CPS-GTC) in 4. Four patients with CPS were not corretly diagnosed until they had the first GTCS. EEG were performed in 16 of 19, only 5 (31%) showed epileptiform abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis. MRIs were obtained in 18 out of 19, five of them were diagnostic. The etiology of the epilepsy included: ischemic stroke in 2; lobar hemorrhage in 1; primary brain tumors in 2.; Alzheimer disease in 1; remaining unknown in 12 (63%). Conclusions: The most common seizure type seen in our series was GTCS without a clear-cut partial onset. Epilepsy was mainly cryptogenic followed by vascular or neoplastic etiology. Distinguishing epilepsy from paroxysmal nonepileptic events can be difficult as the ictal semiology may be misinterpreted as symptoms of other typical diseases in old people (syncope, transient global amnesia).Further studies in this area are still needed to establish optimal diagnostic strategies. 1 Mandeep Garewal, 1 Salvador Cruz, 1 Jayant N. Acharya, and 1 R. Edward Hogan ( 1 Department of Neurology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO ) Rationale: Epilepsy partialis continua (EPC) is rarely related to paraneoplastic syndromes. We present a case of EPC, refractory to multiple AEDs, which responded to treatment with methylprednisolone. Methods: We reviewed the findings of a 63 year old woman who presented with EPC. Results: A 63 year old woman presented with EPC of the left hemi-face and arm of 3 weeks duration. Extensive workup including CSF results, cytology, herpes PCR, encephalitis panel, Lyme antibodies (abs), HIV abs and ELISA testing, was negative. Paraneoplastic panel was positive for anti-striatal abs. AEDs (valproic acid, phenytoin, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, and chlorazepate) given in maximally-tolerated doses did not result in improvement of EPC. Propofol reduced the severity but did not abolish the EPC. Four weeks after onset of EPC, the patient was treated with methylprednisolone 250 mg IV q 6 hours. Neuroimaging was obtained 2 weeks before the onset of EPC and at weeks 3, 4, 5 after onset of EPC. The day following methylprednisolone treatment, the seizure frequency and duration had remarkably diminished. Three days later, EPC had subsided. Methyl-prednisolone was administered for a total of 5 days, followed by a course of oral prednisone. Phenytoin, chlorazepate and valproate were weaned off. The patient was discharged on carbamazepine, levetiracetam and oral prednisone. Prednisone was tapered over the following two months. One year after presentation, she had no recurrence of symptoms. Five weeks after onset of EPC, a biopsy of a lung nodule showed small cell carcinoma, which prompted treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. Neuroimaging findings: MR brain 2 weeks prior to EPC (obtained for clinical indication of encephalopathy) was normal. At 3 weeks after onset of EPC, FLAIR showed hyperintensity in the left frontal, temporal, and insular regions. At week 4 after EPC onset, an additional hyperintensity was noted in the right frontal region, which resolved on repeat MR obtained 5 weeks after EPC onset. There was no contrast enhancement at any time. The figure shows FLAIR images before and after steroid treatment of EPC. Conclusions: EPC is commonly refractory to conventional AEDs, but may respond to treatment with corticosteroids. Our case illustrates that corticosteroids can be efficacious in treating paraneoplastic-related EPC. Continued resolution of EPC after taper of corticosteroids was likely related to treatment of the underlying neoplasm. This case illustrates the importance of workup for associated neoplasm in patients with EPC. 1 Nicole C. Hank, 1 Steve S. Chung, and 1 David M. Treiman ( 1 Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ ) Rationale: In the past decade many new medications have become available for various neurological disorders including epilepsy. Clinical Trials, an essential component of drug development, helps to establish efficacy and safety. Thus, clinical research has grown significantly in parallel to new medication development in the health field. It is critically important for investigators to identify and recruit potential candidates for clinical trials in order to efficiently complete studies and to evaluate drug efficacy and safety in a timely fashion. In order to improve and understand effective recruitment strategy, we surveyed current clinical study participants at our epilepsy center. Methods: Thirty-three Epilepsy patients who all are currently participating in one out of 5 (phase II, III or IV clinical multi-centered) epilepsy studies at BNI were asked questions pertaining to reasons for participation and continuation of study as well as primary concerns for participation when they were asked to participate in the clinical study. Patients were asked to rate their answers on a 0?10 scale with 10 being the strongest influence and 0 the least influence. Questionnaires were administered to patients during their clinic visits or via email and were analyzed. Results: Twenty-nine out of 33 patients (88%) answered investigator rapport (physician and coordinator) to be the number one reason why they chose to participate in a study (X = 9.7). Three patients answered that the most important influential rationale was financial reasons (reimbursement or no insurance), and the remaining one patient stated no other medical options were available. When patients were asked what biggest concerns they had prior to consent, nearly all patients (94%) expressed the fear for unknown potential side effects. Even though seizure improvement was reported by 40% of the participants, only 1% (3 out of 33) stated efficacy was their number one reason for continuing in a study, while 91% (30 out of 33) chose to continue participation based on investigators' care. Conclusions: This study shows that establishing a good patient/doctor rapport is the most important factor to successfully recruit patients for clinical trials. Regardless of the type of clinical trials, good medical care from investigators was the most important determinant factor in those who complete trials. 1,2 Sheryl R. Haut, 3 Aaron LeValley, 3 Charles B. Hall, and 2,3 Richard B. Lipton ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center, Montefiore Med.Ctr/Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; 2 Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ; and 3 Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Stress is an often reported, but rarely studied trigger factor for seizures. Using diary data, we explored the population and within person effects of stress on the occurrence of seizures. Methods: Subjects 18 yrs or older with localization related epilepsy were recruited from the Epilepsy Management Center and the neurology clinics at Montefiore Medical Center. Eligible subjects had at least 1 seizure within the prior 12 months and the ability to self-maintain a daily diary. Diary data included dates and times of all seizures, and daily stress, measured on a 10 point ordinal scale (1 being least, 10 being highest stress). We modeled the association of stress on a given day as a predictor of seizures over the subsequent 24 hrs using mixed-effects logistic models for the entire population, and logistic regression models for individuals. Results: Sixty four subjects maintained seizure diaries with daily stress levels for >1 month and up to one year (median: 246 diary days) for a total 15,806 person days of diary data. Increases in recorded stress levels were associated with increased risk of seizures in the subsequent 24 hour epoch (p > 0.000); A three unit increase in stress was associated with a 32% increase in the relative odds of seizure (OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.22?1.40). These findings were independent of hours of sleep. Within-person significance for stress and seizure risk was demonstrated for 25% of subjects at 0.10 level, and 20% of subjects at 0.05 level. Conclusions: Elevations in daily stress measurements were significantly associated with increased risk of seizure in the subsequent 24 hours, independent of hours of sleep. This association was significant for at least 20% of individual subjects. This subgroup may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of stress. Further studies will explore the mechanisms of this stress effect, and examine potential behavioral interventions to uncouple stress from seizure risk. (Supported by K23NS02192 (P.I.

Therefore, we assessed self-perception of awareness of complex partial seizure (AOCPS) through a thorough interview. Methods: Patients with CPSs during sleep only, overt mental retardation, or the total number of CPSs ≤3 were excluded because we considered that they could not give reliable information for AOCPS. We included consecutive 134 patients at our epilepsy clinic, whose CPSs had been observed and given sufficient information for awareness of CPSs by patients and their family members, and investigated the proportion and characteristics of patients without AOCPS compared with those with AOCPS and the change of unawareness of their CPSs during the follow-up. Results: Thirty-one patients (23%) did not have AOCPS completely (n = 23) or incompletely (n = 8). Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were more frequently detected in patients without AOCPS (94%; complete, 96%) than those with AOCPS (55%), mainly in the temporal region. Bilateral independent IEDs were found in 48% of patients without AOCPS (complete: 52%) compared with 13% of those with AOCPS (p < 0.001). The lateralization of epileptic foci based on ictal semiology, IEDs and structural lesions on MRI was not different between patients without AOCPS and with AOCPS. Eighty-four percent of patients without AOCPS were classified as having temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) compared with 70% of those with AOCPS (p = 0.093). TLE patients without AOCPS were less likely to have structural lesions involving mesial temporal region and more likely to have normal finding on MRI compared with those with AOCPS. Six of 23 patients with complete unawareness of their seizures had experienced AOCPS even with de novo aura in three patients during the follow-up. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a significant number of epilepsy patients are not aware of their CPSs. Unawareness of CPSs may occur especially in TLE patients with bilateral independent IEDs and without structural lesions involving mesial temporal region. 1 Nikolas Hitiris, 1 Rajiv Mohanraj, and 1 Martin J. Brodie ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Division of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Clinical and biological differences between responders and non-responders to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may help to explain the basis for refractory epilepsy. Methods: A total of 890 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy attended the epilepsy clinic of the Western Infirmary, Glasgow between July 1982 and May 2001. Follow up data were available for 780 (88%). All were initially treated with monotherapy and treatment was altered depending on response and tolerability. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who went into remission following the first AED dose (immediate responders) with those who remained pharmacoresistant de novo (non-responders). The non-responders never gained control of their seizures for any 12-month period from onset. Results: We identified 245 (31%) immediate responders and 276 (35%) non-responders (see table). Non-responders were more likely to have clusters of seizures [OR 9.17 (95% CI 1.17?72.18), p = 0.035], a family history of epilepsy [OR 1.85 (95% CI 1.1?3.11), p = 0.02], traumatic head injury [OR 3.12 (95% CI 1.72?5.64), p < 0.001] and psychiatric co-morbidity [OR 2.02 (95% CI 1.24?3.28), p = 0.004]. Factors that did not achieve statistical significance between the groups were birth injury, febrile seizures, previous status epilepticus, neurological deficit and learning difficulties. Conclusions: In this longitudinal study, 31% of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy remained seizure-free following the first dose of their first AED whereas a further 35% appeared to be refractory de novo. Clinical factors that identify early refractory epilepsy could lead to improved pharmacotherapy or prompt surgery. Comparing responders with non-responders to AEDs may provide insights into the pathophysiology of refractory epilepsy.

Hussain, 1,2,3 Richard B. Lipton, 1 Sheryl R. Haut, 1,2,3 Carol A. Derby, and 1,4 Shlomo Shinnar ( 1 Neurology, Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; 2 Einstein Aging Study, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; 3 Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ; and 4 Pediatrics, Montefiore Med Ctr, Albert Einstein Coll of Med, Bronx, NY ) Rationale: Compared to young adulthood, the incidence of epilepsy is thought to increase substantially after age 60, and may be further elevated among males and African-Americans. The reason for this rise is uncertain. Although elevated risk may be due in part to stroke, dementia, and other risk factors common in older adults, it has been postulated that aging itself may be associated with increased risk of epilepsy. We therefore sought to determine the incidence of epilepsy in a relatively healthy, racially-diverse, elderly cohort. Methods: 1919 community-dwelling subjects (age 70+) followed in a prospective longitudinal aging study were screened for seizures. For all subjects who screened positive and a sample of subjects who screened negative (n = 100), we determined which subjects had epilepsy with onset after age 45 by means of standardized telephone interviews and review of aging study records. For screen-positive subjects, we sought hospital medical records to verify self-reported age of onset. Age-specific and cumulative incidence of epilepsy were estimated using reconstructed cohort methods and the Kaplan-Meier procedure. We assessed sex and race as risk factors using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: 45 subjects screened positive for seizures, and 1874 screened negative. Of the 45 screen-positive subjects, 21 had epilepsy with onset after age 45, 21 had likely seizures or epilepsy with onset before age 45, 2 experienced single provoked seizures, and 1 subject had possible epilepsy. None of the 100 screen-negative subjects interviewed had epilepsy. Age-specific incidence of epilepsy was generally low but increased with age. Incidence (per 100,000 person-years with 95%CI) was 10.6 [2.2, 30.9] between 45?59 years, 25.8 [10.4, 38.1] between 60?74 years, and 101.1 [41.4, 160.8] between 75?89 years. No difference was observed between males and females, but African-American race was associated with greater cumulative incidence of epilepsy (p = 0.048) and was a significant risk factor in the regression model (hazard ratio with 95%CI: 2.63 [1.07, 6.37]). Conclusions: The incidence of epilepsy was low in this relatively healthy elderly cohort. This study was unique in that we evaluated race as a covariate and observed elevated risk among African-Americans. Future analyses are planned to estimate the incidence among elderly individuals who do not have competing risk factors for epilepsy such as stroke and dementia, and to determine whether our race-specific findings are modified or confounded by cardiovascular risk factors.

Although very often used in motor control research, its clinical application is scarce. The goal of this study is to present two cases of paroxysmal events in which the BP has been diagnostic in standard video-EEG studies. Methods: Two patients presented with sudden jerking of the limbs. A 42-year-old woman had daily abnormal movements of the legs for more than 10 years. They appeared periodically at rest in wakefulness. The second patient is a 55-year-old man with daily sudden jerking of the arms, also in wakefulness, in the last year. The physical exam was normal in both cases. A digital 24-hours video-EEG recording was performed to find at least 100 limb movements. The movement-related potentials were calculated using back-averaging of the EEG activity in relation of jerk onset. Results: In the interictal recordings and during the episodes no epileptiform activity was noted. In the first patient, a BP was found when the patient imitated the movements, but not when studying the actual movements. In the second patient, a clear BP was found when studying the jerking movements. In the first case, the diagnosis of periodic limb movements was established. In the second patient, the voluntary nature of the movement was demonstrated. Conclusions: Back-averaging of movement-related activity is a feasible technique for the diagnosis of paroxysmal events. In the differential diagnosis between seizures, movement disorders and other non-epileptic events, the movement- related potentials can be used as a diagnostic tool if the events are frequent enough. 1 Gaby S. Pell, 1 Regula S. Briellmann, 1 Patrick C.H. Chan, 1 David F. Abbott, and 1 Graeme D. Jackson ( 1 Brain Research Institute, Austin Health, Heidelberg West, Victoria, Australia ) Rationale: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) on MR imaging is associated with reduced hippocampal volume and increased T2-relaxation time. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides additional information on tissue microstructure. We perform a voxel-based (VB) analysis of DTI in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with unilateral HS. The common framework will allow comparison with VB morphometry (VBM) and VB T2-relaxometry (VBR). Methods: We assessed 15 healthy controls and 12 left HS patients at a 3T GE scanner. DTI was performed with 28 directions (b = 1100 s/mm3). An eight-echo CPMG sequence was used for T2-relaxometry, and a 3D SPGR sequence for morphometry. Data were analysed using FSL and SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London). For DTI, we assessed fractional anisiotropy and diffusivity. For VBM, we used an optimised protocol (1) and assessed both the gray and white matter segment. VBR was performed as described in our earlier manuscript (2). Threshold for all analyses was p < 0.001. Voxels were counted in ipsilateral peri-hippocampal and temporal lobe regions. Results: DTI changes in left HS were more pronounced than VBM or VBR abnormalities. The table shows the number of activated voxels with each technique. Reduced anisotropy was found in the left uncinate fasciculus, anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and corpus callosum. Increased diffusivity was found in the ATL and parahippocampal white matter. Gray matter volume loss was detected in the hippocampus proper, white matter volume loss in the ATL. VBR showed a T2 increase in the lateral and ATL white matter. Conclusions: The most prominent abnormality in the hippocampus proper was a volume deficit. Additionally, there were extensive temporal lobe white matter abnormalities. The DTI changes close to the hippocampus may be secondary, and associated with memory deficits and seizure circuits. The DTI, VBM and VBR abnormalities in ATL may be primary, and associated with temporal lobe development (3). REFERENCES Good CD, et al. NeuroImage 2001;14: 21?36 Pell GS, et al.

Elliott ( 1 Neurology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Elevated serum homocysteine (s-Hcy) is recognized as an independent risk factor in premature coronary disease. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have found ischemic heart disease is increased by 20% and fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) is three times higher in patients with epilepsy. The incidence of cerebrovascular accident in epilepsy populations is estimated to be two to six times that of the normal population. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) have been shown to increase s-Hcy by lowering blood folate levels. The goal of this study was to examine homocysteine and other cardiovascular risk factors in epilepsy. Methods: We screened 405 clinic charts over the past 2 years to identify 120 subjects with CVD assessment including: age, gender, seizure type, years on AEDs, s-Hcy, serum folic acid (s-FA), lipids, glucose, blood pressure, weight, smoking and alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI) and vitamin use patterns. Results: This was an adult epilepsy population: mean age (SD) was 44 years (14), range 17 to 81, there were 51 males and 69 females. Fifty were African American, 46 Caucasian, 20 Latino and 3 Asian/Other, average length of AED exposure was 26 years (SD = 14.8, range 2 to 64). Average homocysteine levels in micromol/L (SD) were 11.3 (7.6) for African Americans, 12.5 (8.3) for Latinos, 9.4 (4.1) for Caucasians and 6.8 (0.8) for Asian/Other. Homocysteine was inversely correlated with s-FA (n = 89; Pearson's r = -0.41, p = .000). Fifteen percent of subjects had s-Hcy levels > 15 micromol/L a concentration that is associated with a three-fold increase in myocardial infarction and a two-fold increased risk in carotid stenosis. Mean body weight was 174 lbs. (SD = 43.21). All four ethnicities had average BMI considered overweight based on National Institutes of Health guidelines. BMI was positively correlated with total cholesterol (n = 79; Pearson's r = 0.347, p = .002) and with LDL cholesterol (n = 74; Pearson's r = 0.321, p = .005). Mean total cholesterol (SD) was 197 mg/dl (39) and mean HDL (SD) 61 mg/dl (21) were within optimal ATP III guidelines. Mean LDL cholesterol (SD) was 113 mg/dl (34) which is considered above optimal. Eleven patients took statins. Mean blood pressure (SD) was 129/79 mmHg (18/11) which is in the pre-hypertensive range according to the revised JNC 7 guidelines. Twenty five patients received medication for hypertension. Conclusions: Phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, valproic acid and lamotrigine are known folate antagonists. Homocysteine levels > 7 micromol/L increase the risk for CVD in a linear dose-response relationship with no specific threshold level. Elevated s-Hcy has responded favorably to vitamin supplementation in several epilepsy studies. However, s-Hcy remains elevated despite use of vitamins in half of the subjects. Other factors such as lipids, blood pressure and obesity require more intensive intervention. Preventative care in epilepsy clinic should consist of appropriate CVD screening with culturally sensitive health promotion. 1 Behrouz Jafari, 1 Daniel I. Rifkin, 1 Sandra A. Block, and 1 Mona Sazgar ( 1 Neurology, State University of New York at Buffalo/The Jacobs Neurological Institute, Buffalo, NY ) Rationale: Previous reports have documented coexistence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and epilepsy, as well as the effect of treating sleep apnea on seizure frequency and excessive daytime sleepiness. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of sleep related symptoms in a population with medically refractory epilepsy. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review study on an outpatient population who were seen at a tertiary epilepsy center within the Kaleida Health System at Buffalo, NY. From all the patients who were seen for seizure disorder, those with medically intractable epilepsy were selected. All of the patients had completed the same questionnaire about measures of sleep-related breathing problems, sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and hypertension. Other data including seizure frequency, seizure duration and type and number of anti-epileptic drugs were also extracted from the patient charts and entered into a database. Results: Of 84 adult patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy, 28 qualified for medically intractable epilepsy by the study criteria. Fifteen subjects (53%) reported symptoms of sleep disturbance including 14 (50%) with excessive daytime sleepiness, and 11 (40%) with snoring. Five patients (18%) had sleep disorders confirmed by polysomnography. Eight subjects (28%) had hypertension. Subjects with sleep disturbance were more likely to be younger and female. Although there was no statistical difference between the two groups with regards to the type and number of antiepileptic drugs and seizure localization (temporal versus extra-temporal), the subjects with sleep disturbance tended to have a higher seizure frequency per month, and were more likely to have their first seizures at a younger age (Student T-test p < 0.05). Conclusions: The high concordance between sleep disturbance and seizure intractability suggests that sleep disorders may play an important role in seizure exacerbation. The presence of features of sleep disturbance in patients with medically intractable epilepsy should alert the clinician to the possibility of an underlying sleep disorder contributing to the therapeutic resistance. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which sleep disturbance contributes to seizure intractability. 1 Venkata V. Jakkampudi, 1 William S. Corrie, and 1 Robert J. DeLorenzo ( 1 Department of Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: Authors debate about the duration of a seizure before acute treatment is appropriate. We wished to provide data on the duration of seizures observed in the epilepsy monitoring unit when the seizures subsided without acute therapy. This data will assist this debate. Methods: We logged the five longest epileptic seizures of each patient who was eighteen years or older and was in our epilepsy monitoring unit between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2004. Most patients were in acute anticonvulsant withdrawal, but not those with a history of status epilepticus. We excluded patients with invasive electrodes and patients who were studied to determine if seizures continued. Seizure onset and end were determined by a single epileptologist (W.S.C.) who is experienced in intensive seizure monitoring evaluations. He chose seizure start as the initial EEG change or clinical change. Usually, the end of the seizure was chosen on EEG criteria. Results: We observed seizures in 191 patients during this time. Most seizures (487) were of less than two minutes duration, 78 were 2?3 minutes, 21 were 3?4 minutes, 14 were 4?5 minutes, 9 were 5?6 minutes and 7 were more than 6 minutes long. Our longest seizure was 13 minutes in duration and was a partial simple seizure with only subjective symptoms. No primary generalized seizures were more than 3 minutes long. When seizures secondarily generalized, the generalized portion of the seizure was no more than 3 minutes long. However, the seizure could have a significant partial portion both before and after the generalized segment. None of our patients received medication to terminate a seizure, although several received medications shortly after a seizure when we judged that we had recorded enough events to answer the question posed for the admission. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that most seizures last less than two minutes. However, some seizures can be quite lengthy, yet still be both self-limited and associated with mild symptoms. We did not observe ?lengthy? primarily or secondarily generalized seizures in this cohort. This data supports the advice to physicians to observe a partial seizure before giving an acute anticonvulsant medication. 1 Lara E. Jeha, 1 Imad M. Najm, 2 Bill Bingaman, and 1 Hans O. Luders ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Seizures persist in 30?54% of patients after anterior temporal lobectomy performed for the treatment of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Predictors and mechanisms of early versus late postoperative seizure outcome remain unclear. Methods: We reviewed the records of 371 adult patients operated on between 1990 and 2001 at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The primary outcome variable was any seizure recurrence. Multiphase hazard model analysis was used to construct a time-to-event curve. Plots of the predicted probability of any seizure recurrence by significant risk factors were produced. Multivariate logistic regression was used in additional analyses to calculate adjusted odds ratios. Results: Mean duration of follow-up was 5.5 years. Seizures recurred in 140 patients (38%). The rate of seizure freedom was 78% (95% CI = 75?81%) at 1 year, and 53% (95%CI = 47?58%) at 10 years. Seizure freedom at two years was lowered by frequent preoperative seizures (67% versus 79%, [p-value = 0.015], generalized-tonic-clonic seizures (74% versus 86%, [p-value = 0.029]), bilateral MRI abnormalities (58% versus 78%, [p-value = 0.004]), the use of invasive EEG monitoring (66% versus 77%, [p-value = 0.005]), and epileptiform discharges on EEG 6 months postoperatively (54% versus 78%, [p-value = 0.001]). Late seizure freedom (at 8 years) was lower when surgical pathology was restricted to gliosis (44% versus 64%, [p-value = 0.009]), and higher when intraoperative electrocorticography was used [p-value = 0.021]. Epileptiform EEG at 6 postoperative months predicted breakthrough seizures upon discontinuation of anticonvulsants [O.R = 4.29(95%CI = 1.21?15.13)]. Conclusions: Factors identified by 6 postoperative months predict early and late seizure recurrence after temporal lobectomy. The presence of different predictors of early versus late recurrent seizures suggests different mechanisms of recurrent disease at various postoperative intervals. 1 Sigmund Jenssen ( 1 Neurology, Drexel Medical College, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: The elderly in United States are representing a greater percentage of the general population than before. This age group has increased risk of developing epilepsy as compared to those who are younger. Previous reports indicate that in this age group the clinical presentation of new onset epilepsy is frequently varied and obvious epileptic seizures are sometimes not reported. Epileptiform activity in the EEG (EA) is highly specific for epilepsy when acute symptomatic conditions and PLEDS are excluded. Methods: We reviewed chief complaint (CC) and EEG findings in patients mimimum 65 years old with EA referred to the neurophysiology laboratory at Hahnemann University Hospital between October 2004 and April 2005 for possible new onset seizures. Patients with known additional acute CNS event, PLEDS, recent medication change, severe metabolic derangement or prior history of epilepsy were excluded. Results: 20 patients were found to have EA. Mean age was 79.5 (range 69 to 92), 12 were women. Some patients had two CC. Most common CC was confusion (13), then came fall (4), witnessed seizure (3), syncope (2), focal weakness (1), aphasia (1) and hallucinations (1). Of risk factors there was dementia (5), stroke (4) and meningioma (1) while ten with no risk factors. EEG showed diffuse slowing (5), normal back ground (15), electrographic seizures (2). EA was localized in one temporal lobe (10), both temporal lobes (8), parietal (1), or frontal (1). Most common medical condition was arteral hypertension (10). Conclusions: Chief complaint in new onset epilepsy among the elderly is varied, confusion being the most common and witnessed seizures less common. Although stroke and dementia are risk factors, many have no risk factors. Electrographic seizures are seen occasionally, even without reported witnesses seizures. We attempt to confirm these findings in a larger number of patients. 1 Barbara C. Jobst, 1 David Coffey, and 1 Peter D. Williamson ( 1 Section of Neurology, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Propofol is increasingly more popular for the treatment of status epilepticus due to the short half-life and ease of use. In children a rare but serious complication with acidosis and rhabdomyolysis has been reported. Propofol infusion syndrome in children includes cardiac and renal failure, rhabdomyolysis and severe metabolic acidosis. In children prolonged use (>48 hours) and doses above 5 mg/kg/hr have been associated with propofol infusion syndrome. Methods: We report an adult case of status epilepticus treated with propofol. The patient died of propofol infusion syndrome as a consequence. Results: A 36 years old women with intractable, localization related epilepsy was admitted due to non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient was chronically treated with topiramate. Two weeks prior she had delivered a healthy girl after a complicated pregnancy. The patient required intubation after administration of benzodiazepines. Propofol was administered for intubation. While on propofol the patient continued to have motor activity and epileptiform EEG changes. Propofol was increased but the patient was never treated with higher doses than 5mg/kg/hr. With the addition of phenobarbital and valproic acid, status epilepticus was eventually controlled. The patient remained in a burst suppression pattern on EEG. Propofol was reduced to sedative doses, but 48 hours after admission the patient developed severe rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, lactic acidosis and cardiomyopathy. Despite several attempts of cardioversion the patient died of bradyarrhythmia on the fourth day after admission. Conclusions: Propofol infusion syndrome with rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, lactic acidosis and bradyarrhythmias does not only occur in children but also occurs in adults. It can be a deadly complication of the treatment of status epilepticus. Caution should be used if prolonged propofol infusion is required for status epilepticus. Patients should be monitored for signs of myolysis and acidosis. 1 Susan D. Kelley, 2 Selim R. Benbadis, and 3 Dalia Adams ( 1 Rehabilitation  2 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL ; and 3 Rehabilitation, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL ) Rationale: Little is known about types of mental health treatment that is most effective for pseudoseizure patients who have high rates of psychiatric illness, specifically PTSD, depression, and dissociation (Bowman, 2001). Numerous controlled studies and case reports have provided evidence for the efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in the treatment of PTSD, a variety of anxiety disorders, dissociative symptoms, and somatoform disorders. To date, however, there have been no reported studies on using Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing with trauma-based psychogenic seizures. Methods: This pilot study integrates Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing into the psychological treeatment of pseudoseizure patients referred after video EEG monitoring confirmed the presence of psychogenic seizures and diagnostic interviews found virtually ubiquitous trauma experiences. Data were analyzed for patients referred from a hospital based clinic serving Floridians and persons from the southeastern U.S. over a 2 year period. Results: The study protocol comprised 2 to 3 initial sessions for diagnosis and rapport building followed by weekly Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing treatment ranging from 3 to 15 sessions. In the majority of patients, psychogenic seizures were either extinguished completely or decreased significantly in severity and frequency. Followup data reveals no return to seizure status for those patients successfully treated with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. Conclusions: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing appears to be a viable intervention in the psychological treatment of psychogenic seizure patients. Further controlled studies will be needed. 1 Sejin Lee, 2 Daewon Seo, 3 Hyungkook Park, and 4 Sangdoe Yi ( 1 Neurology, Yeungnam Medical Center, Daugu, Korea ; 2 Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea ; 3 Neurology, Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Chunan, Korea ; and 4 Neurology, Keimyung University Hospital, Daegu, Korea ) Rationale: To describe the clinical and MR characteristics of patients with familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsy(MTLE). Methods: The MTLE was identified by clinical and EEG findings in 3 epilepsy clinics. Familial MTLE was defined when two or more family members presented with the diagnosis of MTLE. Results: Eight patients were diagnosis of familial MTLE in four unrelated families. Three of 8 individuals had typical aura of MTLE. Seizure types were complex partial with or without secondary GTCs in 6 of 8 patients. History of earlier febrile convulsion was positive in 2 patients. MRI showed hippocampal sclerosis in 3 of 7 patients(43%). Benign MTLE was seen in 6 of 8 patients(75%). Two patients with refractory MTLE had hippocampal sclerosis and received temporal lobectomy, and one patient became seizure free. Patients with hippocampal sclerosis have seizure onset early in life and have history of febrile convulsion, and seizures are often not well controlled. Conclusions: Familial MTLE is rather a clinically heterogeneous syndrome, in terms of MRI finding, seizure type and seizure outcomes in contrast to the original report of Berkovic. This may be partly due to absence of detailed diagnostic criteria of familial MTLE. So some of our patients may be just causal occurrence of MTLE in two family members. 1 Sang Kun Lee, 1 Jung Joo Lee, 1 Seo Young Lee, 2 Chun-Kee Chung, and 3 Dong Soo Lee ( 1 Neurology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Seoul, Korea ; 2 Neurosurgery, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Seoul, Korea ; and 3 Nuclear Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Seoul, Korea ) Rationale: In order to assess the role of various diagnostic modalities, to identify surgical prognostic factors and concordances with presurgical evaluations, and to characterize the clinical features of frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Methods: We studied 71 FLE patients who underwent epilepsy surgery and were followed up more than two years. Diagnoses were established by standard presurgical evaluation. Results: Thirty-eight of the 71 became seizure-free after surgery, and another 25 patients a favorable outcome. Clinical manifestations could be categorized into six types; initial focal motor (nine patients), initial versive seizure (15), frontal lobe complex partial seizure (14), complex partial seizure mimicking temporal lobe epilepsy (18), initial tonic elevation of arms (11), and sudden 2GTCS (4). The diagnostic accuracies of interictal EEG, ictal EEG, MRI, PET, and ictal SPECT were 28.9%, 60.5%, 47.4%, 36.4%, and 33.3% in the seizure free patients respectively. These were 21.2%, 57.6%, 24.2%, 28.6%, and 22.7% in non-seizure-free patients respectively. No significant relationship was found between the diagnostic accuracy of these modalities and surgical outcome except MRI (p = 0.038). The concordance of two or more modalities was significantly observed in seizure free patients (P = 0.027). Among other clinical characteristics (age at surgery, seizure frequency, sex, presence of 2GTCS, presence of possible causes, and side of surgery), only the side of surgery was a significant prognostic factors (The left side had poorer outcome.). No definite relationship was found between the location of intracranial ictal onset zone and clinical semiology. Conclusions: Though various diagnostic methods can be useful to diagnose FLE, only MRI can predict the surgical outcome. Concordance between presurgical evaluation modalities indicates a better surgical outcome. 1 Tonicarlo R. Velasco, 1 Roger Walz, 1 Americo C. Sakamoto, 1 Paulo Zanello, 1 Vinicius H.

Assirati Jr., 3 Carlos G. Carlotti Jr., and 1 Joao P. Leite ( 1 Neurology, CIREP, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; 2 Radiology, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 3 Surgery, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a major cause of seizures in many less developed countries. Although less common, NCC is becoming a significant health concern in developed countries as well, mostly due to migration of infected persons. The main causes of intractable epilepsy (IE) are mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), brain tumors (BT), and malformations of cortical development (MCD). Although studies in endemic regions have indicated that NCC is the leading cause of symptomatic epilepsy, there is no study investigating the relationship between calcified cysticercotic lesions (CCL) and intractable epilepsy (IE) in general. Here we carry out a cross-sectional study investigating the etiological profile of IE in our country, an endemic region for NCC, with attention to the presence of CCL. Methods: From 2002 to 2003, 512 consecutive patients (273 women) evaluated at Ribeir?o Preto School of Medicine Hospital, aged >18 years, were included in the survey. Intractability was defined as: 1) one or more seizures every 3 months during the last year of follow-up review or until successful seizure surgery, and 2) failure of two or more first-line AEDs at maximum tolerated doses. Neuroimaging included brain CT scans with contrasted and noncontrasted phases, high-resolution MRI with special protocols to epilepsy for all patients. Results: Five hundreds and twelve patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age at enrollment was 38.66 ± 10.6 years. The mean age at epilepsy onset was 11.9 ± 7.4 years (range 1?36 years). The epilepsy duration was 21 years ± 11.3 years (range 3?48 years). The mean seizure frequency was 4.3 ± seizures per month. The most frequent epileptogenic lesion was MTS (52,6%), followed by MCD (13.8%), and BT (10.5%). cNCL were found in 38% of cases, but, in most cases, associated with another epileptogenic lesion. Isolated CCL were found in only 1,8% of cases. In addition, we found a very higher prevalence of CCL in MTS cases (36,7%), in comparison with extratemporal epilepsy (16,8%) (p < 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: We found evidence that the etiological profile of medically IE is very similar to those from developed countries, and that neurocysticercosis, even in an endemic region as Brazil, is a rare cause of IE. We found that CCL were twice more frequent in patients with MTS than in those with extratemporal epilepsy, suggesting either a potential role of NCC in the development of MTS or that CCL and MTS covariate with another variable, such as socioeconomic status.

Yacubian ( 1 Neurology, UNIFESP/EPM, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: We aim to investigate the chemical integrity of the thalami in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) with different times of disease using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Methods: We performed multi-voxel 1H-MRS with TE of 30 ms (PRESS sequence) at 1.5 Tesla scanner over the thalami of 14 patients with 1?10 years of clinical history of JME and 16 patients with more than 10 years of disease (mean age = 21.3 vs. 31.5 and mean time of disease = 6.4 vs. 21.8, respectively). All patients had a typical history of JME, typical EEG findings and normal high-resolution magnetic resonance neuroimaging. We determined ratios for peak values of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, glutamine-glutamate and inositol over creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr). Results: Thalamic NAA/Cr ratios were decreased in JME patients with longer time of disease (right side = 1.4722 ± 0.2724; left side = 1.4817 ± 0.2206) compared to patients with less than 10 years of disease (right side = 1.8484 ± 0.2249; left side = 1.6903 ± 0.2539) with p values of 0.0004 and 0.0254, respectively. We did not find significantly differences of the other metabolites between both groups. Conclusions: These results are suggestive of progressive thalamic neuronal damage directly associated with time of disease in patients with JME. (Supported by CAPES/CNPq.) 1 Miao Liu, and 1 Nathan B. Fountain ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: Population based epilepsy studies provide accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence but provide limited data about precise seizure type and epilepsy syndrome characteristics because a detailed seizure history and prior antiepileptic drug (AED) use can't be obtained. We prospectively collected data on a finite epilepsy population to determine the characteristics defining each seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. Methods: Standardized data were prospectively collected by epileptologists from patients seen in the UVA Epilepsy Clinic from April 1998 to November 2004. Data was acquired directly from patients and medical records, then refined and cleaned by standardized methods and updated at each clinic visit. Analysis was limited to patients with definite epilepsy 5 years old or greater. Data collected included demographics, ILAE seizure (SZ) type, ILAE epilepsy syndrome, etiology, EEG, neuroimaging, family history, and current and prior antiepileptic drug use. Patients were categorized into 14 classes by the combination of SZ types they possessed. SZ frequency of each SZ type was plotted over time from June 2000 to November 2004. Results: A total of 1638 patients were analyzed. Overall, mean current age is 31.9, mean age at seizure onset was 14.4, and 49% are female. An etiology is known in 16% and 49% had a family history of epilepsy. Median current SZ frequency is 3/mo. The median for the highest monthly frequency ever reported by patients is 5/mo and for the minimum seizure frequency ever reported is 1/mo. Patients most frequently reported having only partial-onset SZ (60%) compared to only generalized SZ (37%) and mixed partial and generalized SZ (4%). Among the 14 categories of SZ combinations, CPS + Secondarily Generalized (25%) and Multiple Generalized (17%) are most common. The most common syndromes are Symptomatic Localization-Related Not Further Classifiable (17%), Cryptogenic Generalized Not Further Classifiable (16%), Idiopathic Generalized Not Further Classifiable (8%), and MTLE (7%). Other specific syndromes were less frequent. The mean number of AED ever used is 4. AEDs are not used at all by 9% while 19% use three or more AEDs. 47% patients previously failed three or more AEDs. Patients with only generalized SZ more commonly are off all AEDs (11%). Conclusions: It is well know that partial-onset seizures are more common and this clarifies that CPS + secondary generalization is the single most common combination of SZs. The etiology of epilepsy is rarely identifiable and most patients do not fit into a specific syndrome but MTLE is the single most common specific syndrome. A surprising minority of patients was not on AEDs but nearly half have failed 3 AEDs.

In the few reported cases, it has been suggested it involves the connections between the temporal lobe and the hypothalamus or the preoptic areas. We describe the first case of a patient who experienced pilomotor seizures for several weeks in relation to a transient MRI signal abnormality. Methods: A 35-year-old right-handed woman exhibited sudden epilepsy with a seizure frequency reaching 30 per day. They lasted less than 90 seconds each. They consisted of bilateral sensation of chill associated with nausea, thoracic sensation, and followed few seconds later by piloerection involving both arms and legs. EEG recording found slow waves on the left temporal region. MRI performed one week after the first seizure, showed a T2 and FLAIR signal increase in the left mesial temporal area without mass effect. She received antiepileptic drugs which decreased the severity and the frequency of seizures. Four months later, MRI showed a clear regression of the signal abnormality. At this time the number of seizures decreased from 30 to 10 per day. EEG-video performed at this time, recorded 6 seizures, each lasting less than 1 minute. These seizures consisted of sensation of chill ascending from the feet to all of the body associated with piloerection in the left arm. Results: Ictal EEG found a rythmic slow activity with a maximum amplitude on the left central and temporal area. Conclusions: Our observation showed that piloerection could be the main feature in the course of partial seizure of temporal lobe origin. The transient MRI T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality might be in relation with the high seizure frequency. Piloerection is probably more frequent than suggested in the course of temporal lobe seizures. 1,2 James W. McAuley, 1 Ian B. Hollis, and 1,3 Thomas Wolfe ( 1 College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; 2 Department of Neurology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ; and 3 Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Columbus, OH ) Rationale: Comprehensive treatment of epilepsy involves many facets including self-management behaviors. The most common self-management strategy is adherence to an antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen. Controlling other non-drug related factors, such as management of information, concern for personal safety, management of the seizures themselves, and lifestyle issues can also play a large role in the overall success of therapy. The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the relationship between self-management behaviors and clinical outcomes. Methods: Adult epilepsy patients whom were able to complete the surveys by themselves and had been taking AED therapy for at least 6 months were recruited from our outpatient epilepsy clinic for this cross-sectional, descriptive study. We used two previously-validated surveys to assess various self-management behaviors. Morisky's four-item self-reported adherence measure (not epilepsy-specific) and DiIorio's 38-item scale that assesses frequency of use of epilepsy self-management practices were administered to a random sample of patients. We also collected clinical (seizure activity, number of AEDs and presence/absence of toxicity) and demographic information. The response to the Morisky questions provides a score ranging from 1 to 4. A score of 1 categorizes the patient in the ?low? medication-taking behavior category, a score of 2 or 3 is ?medium? and 4 is ?high? medication-taking behavior. On the Epilepsy self-management scale (ESMS), each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = Never to 5 = Always. Higher sores indicate more frequent use of self-management strategies. In addition, this scale can be divided into 5 subscales that address patient management of medication, information, safety, seizure and lifestyle. Results: Data on eighteen patients (8 female, 10 male) has been collected to date. Their average age is 42.61 yrs (range 26?64). Patients were taking an average of 1.53 AEDs (range 1?2) as well as other prescription medications (median = 2.5, range 1 to 18). Their monthly seizure burden ranged from seizure-free (n = 7) to ?daily? seizures (mean ± STD = 4.1 ± 10.45). Despite 7 patients acknowledging they have ?forgotten to take their medications,? the average Morisky Score had most of them in the ?High? medication taking behavior category (3.39 ± 0.92). The average ESMS scores indicated frequent use of self-management strategies (3.62 ± 0.43). On our initial evaluation of this data, the medication-taking behavior did not predict the clinical outcomes. Conclusions: In our small sample of patients, we have found that it is not simply medication-taking behavior that influences seizure activity. Further exploration of the relationship between clinical outcomes and other non-drug self-management strategies is needed. 1 Flavia S. Miyashira, 2 Henrique Carrete Jr., 1 Elza M.T. Yacubian, 1 Eliana Garzon, and 1 Americo C. Sakamoto ( 1 Neurology and Neurosurgery, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Radiology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: To report findings on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) population at UNIPETE, from 2000 to 2005, including epidemiologic, imaging and natural history data. Methods: All diagnosed TLE due to MTS outpatients were included. Epidemiologic data was performed, as well as age and kind of initial precipitating insult (IPI) if present, age at first and second seizures, time spared until maximal tolerated dosage (MTD) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), presence of remission period, epileptogenic zone lateralization, age at MTD and age at surgery if applicable were evaluated. Results: We had 149 patients, aged 16 to 72 (40± 10years), 81 (54.36%) female, (85.23%) right-handed. According to lesion area, 80 (53.69%) were left-sided, 59 (39.59%) were right-sided and 10 (6.7%) were bilateral. 63 (42.28%) had IPI, mainly febrile seizures (52%). First spontaneous seizure (FSS) occurred from 0,08 to 55 years (11±10). Remission of seizures was seen in 31(21%). 89 (60%) reached MTD at 39±9, 28±11.5 years after FSS. 52 surgeries has been performed, age at surgery was 39±9, 29±12 years after diagnosis. Conclusions: TLE due to MTS in this service seem to present similar points to what previously described in literature; the time spared from first seizure to MTD is larger than that observed in developed countries, which might be related to socio-economic conditions, leading to surgeries later in life, with all its related consequences. (Supported by FAPESP.) 1 Rajiv Mohanraj, and 2 Martin J. Brodie ( 1 Department of Neurology, Royal Perston Hosptial, Preston, Lancashire, United Kingdom ; and 2 Epilepsy Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom ) Rationale: Idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes (IGES) constitute 20?40% of all epilepsies. Up to a third of cases are diagnosed after the second decade of life1. The prognosis of IGES in the non-pediatric setting may vary from that in infants and children because of differences in genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Methods: All patients diagnosed with IGES at the Epilepsy Unit, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland, between 1981 and 2001 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical data, including syndrome classifications and pharmacological outcomes, were collated by a review of casenotes. Response to treatment was defined as complete control of seizures for 12 months. Patients remaining seizure free to the end of follow up were considered to be in remission. Results: Of 780 patients diagnosed with epilepsy over the 20 year period, 105 (13%) met the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria for IGES. The median age at onset was 17 years (range 5?51). Syndromes included Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME, n = 55), Epilepsy with Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS) Only (n = 28), Epilepsy with GTCS on Awakening (n = 7), Juvenile Absence Epilepsy (n = 4), Epilepsy with GTCS during sleep (n = 3), Late Onset Myoclonic Epilepsy (n = 3), Childhood Absence Epilepsy (n = 2) and Epilepsy with Myoclonic Absences (n = 1). Overall, 76 (74%) patients responded to treatment. Sixty-six (64%) of these attained remission, which was achieved with antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy in 56 (54%) cases. The responder rate in the whole cohort with valproate (66%) was higher than with lamotrigine (45%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.076). In patients with JME, however, valproate was significantly more likely to produce remission (75%) than lamotrigine (39%; p = 0.014). The effect of age at onset, gender, family history of epilepsy, history of febrile seizures, psychiatric co-morbidity, epileptiform abnormalities on EEG and seizures types on treatment outcomes was analysed by logistic regression. History of febrile seizures was the only factor that was significantly associated with reduced probability of remission (Odds ratio 0.18; 95% CI 0.03?0.96) Conclusions: IGES constituted 13% of cases in a largely adult cohort of newly diagnosed epilepsy. Approximately 2/3 of these patients achieved remission with AED therapy, mostly with a single drug. Valproate appeared to be the most efficacious drug, especially in JME. Previous febrile seizures were associated with reduced likelihood of remission, which could imply a genetic component to pharmacoresistant IGES. REFERENCE 1.?Marini C, King MA, Archer JS, Newton MR, Berkovic SF. Idiopathic generalised epilepsy of adult onset: clinical syndromes and genetics. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2003;74: 192?196. 1 Majid Molaie, and 1 James Brust ( 1 Neurology  Dept. of Neurology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Dept. of Neurology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Dept. of Neurology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and Department of Radiology, U of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT ) Rationale: Most versions of the language and memory component of the intra-carotid amytal (ICA) test employ a cutoff score denoting the point at which test failure is judged to occur. There may be patients with low enough baseline cognitive functioning who might fail such tests under any circumstances. For such patients the ICA procedure for testing language and memory functioning would be invalid. This study attempted to identify such patients and the variables that would predict them. Methods: The study examined a group of adult candidates (n = 54) for epilepsy surgery. Three equivalent versions of the language and memory portion of the ICA test were developed. The version of the language and memory test used during the pre-injection, baseline phase was randomly selected. The study analyzed the relationship of clinical variables and neuropsychological test variables to performance on the practice version of the test. Results: Average scores on the practice version of the test were uniformly quite high (mean language score = 14.93, mean memory score = 9.81). No subjects scored below the cutoff for failure. No relationship was found between clinical variables and performance on the baseline test. A moderate correlation was found between the baseline memory test and one pre-surgical neuropsychological test of memory. Otherwise, scores on the baseline test were unrelated to any of the neuropsychological test scores. In some cases, scores on the pre-surgical neuropsychological tests were quite low (WAIS-III full scale IQ = 50). In none of these cases were there failures on the baseline test. No relationship was found between scores on the baseline test and the ability of patients to cooperate with the actual ICA procedure. Thirty-one subjects had surgery for seizure control. Seventy per cent of these had good surgical outcomes. Several had post-surgical subjective complaints of language or memory problems. None had amnestic disorder. No relationship was found between scores on the baseline test and surgical outcome or post-surgical subjective complaints. Conclusions: The validity of the ICA test depends on the use of test procedures that any patient can perform at baseline. The results of this study indicate that procedures can be designed whose validity is resistant to the effects of extremely low pre-surgical cognitive functioning. With ICA test procedures where this presumption may not automatically be present, the validity of test participation can be confirmed with an equivalent baseline version of the test prior to the actual clinical procedure. 1 Vincent Navarro, 1 Claude Adam, 2 Claire Petitmengin, and 1 Michel Baulac ( 1 Epilepsy Unit, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France ; and 2 INT-GET, Groupe des Ecoles de Télécommunication, Evry, France ) Rationale: Tooth-brushing epilepsy is a very unusual form of reflex epilepsy, provoked by the act of tooth brushing. We report a 57-year-old patient with intractable partial epilepsy in which seizures were induced not only by tooth brushing, but also by seeing or thinking to a toothbrush or toothpaste. Methods: Patient was referred to our Epilepsy Unit for long-term video-EEG recordings. Various types of cognitive tasks were performed to provoke seizure. Results: The first seizures started at the age of 50. The patient noted that several activities related to a toothbrush frequently provoked the seizures (approximately 40% of the seizures). Seizures could be provoked by (i) tooth-brushing, especially in the morning, or (ii) seeing a toothbrush or toothpaste (its own, or seen on TV, in supermarket), especially if these objects were seen in an inadequate location, or (iii) thinking to toothbrush or toothpaste. No other trigger factor was identified. The seizure started with the pleasant feeling to be somewhere else during few seconds, then the patient felt anxious and a loss of consciousness with oral automatisms may occur. Brain MRI was normal, except for few hypersignals in the white matter and moderate enlargement of the lateral ventricles. During the video-EEG monitoring, four seizures were recorded. Two were elicited by tooth brushing in the bathroom, while the patient was alone. Several tests failed to provoke a seizure: tooth-brushing in front of the video camera, presentation on a TV screen of various pictures related to the toothbrush, researching a toothbrush hidden in the patient's room. On the other hand, two seizures were elicited by the evocation of (i) the TV advertisement that recently had provoked a seizure (a man with a toothbrush), and (ii) a place related to seizures that the patient avoided. The EEG showed a left temporal lobe onset of the seizures, and interictal epileptic spikes in the same area. Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first report of reflex epilepsy in which seizures could be provoked by thinking to a toothbrush. This case differs from four previous patients reported with tooth-brushing epilepsy, for which hyperexcitability of the suprasylvian operculum was suggested. EEG and clinical data of our patient suggest a left temporal epileptogenic focus. We hypothesize that this epileptogenic zone may be closely related to the neurons responsible for the mental representation of the toothbrush in the temporal lobe. 1 Maromi Nei, 2 Reginald T. Ho, 1 Michelle A. Payne, 2 Tammi Wicks, and 1 Michael R. Sperling ( 1 Neurology, Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ; and 2 Cardiology, Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA ) Rationale: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is most commonly seen in patients with refractory epilepsy. The etiology is uncertain, although a cardiac arrhythmia may be responsible for death in some patients. Video-EEG/EKG monitoring reveals that many patients have EKG rhythm and repolarization abnormalities in association with their seizures. However, thus far only limited data are available re: cardiac rhythm in these patients over several months. Objective: Assess the types of and frequency of cardiac rhythm and repolarization abnormalities over a 14-month period in patients with refractory epilepsy. Methods: Patients with refractory epilepsy with ≥1 complex partial, generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, or atonic seizure/month underwent cardiac rhythm monitoring using a subcutaneously implanted recording monitor (Medtronic Reveal), to be implanted for a total of 14 months. Individuals ≥ 50 yrs of age or who had a history of cardiac disease or abnormal EKG were excluded. Patients were evaluated by a neurologist and cardiologist at 1 month after device implantation, then every 3 months thereafter for a maximum duration of 14 months for device interrogation. At each interrogation, data regarding heart rate and rhythm as well as repolarization abnormalities were noted. Patients or caretakers were asked to keep a seizure log and activate the device at the time of seizures. In addition, automated heart rate detection of rates < 30 and >180 BPM was programmed. Results: Thus far 13 patients (mean age 38.7 yrs, range 23?47 yrs; 8 men, 5 women) with refractory epilepsy (2 idiopathic generalized, 3 symptomatic generalized, and 8 partial) have been implanted and recorded over an average of 6.8 months (range 0.5 - 14 months). Patients had a history of epilepsy onset at a mean age of 7 years and epilepsy duration of 31.7 years. An average of 31 seizures/patient occurred during the study period. 3 patients had active vagal nerve stimulators. 2 patients (who did not have active vagal nerve stimulators) had sinus pauses of up to 4.8 seconds recorded unassociated with seizures. 2 patients had T wave inversions occurring only in association with seizures (1 patient with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 1 patient with tonic seizures). All other patients had only sinus rhythm or sinus tachycardia associated with their seizures. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests that patients with refractory epilepsy may be at increased risk for cardiac ischemia during seizures. Additionally, sinus pauses may occur in these individuals without evidence of a seizure. Further investigation in larger numbers of individuals is needed to determine the clinical significance of such abnormalities in this patient population. (Supported by Medtronic, Inc.) 1 Juan G. Ochoa ( 1 Neurology, University of Florida, Jacksonville, FL ) Rationale: Clinical practice differ significantly from the methodology used in postmarketing studies to assess the efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic medications. Retrospective review permits analysis of the practice parameters and outcome measures without influencing them. The lack of restrictions regarding label indications, titration parameters, dosage, etc may change the outcome compared to controlled prospective studies. Methods: To compare the experience of a typical epilepsy center and the postmarketing data regarding the outcome after treatment of epilepsy with levetiracetam, restropective review were performed at the Epilepsy Clinic at The UF Neuroscience Institute, Jacksonville, FL between July 1,2002 and June 30, 2004. 100 random charts containing patients treated with Levetiracetam were extracted from our epilepsy clinic database. Incomplete records were excluded. 68 patients with diagnosis of epilepsy treated with levetiracetam were included. Results: 68 patients included 53% women and 47% men, 19% had a generalized epileptic disorder and 81% had focal epilepsy with or without generalization. The average age was 45 years including three (4.4%) children. The average total dose was 1994 mg and 17.6% was monotherapy. The overall seizure reduction at least 50% of reported baseline was 57% including a seizure free of 36%. Among the patients on monotherapy 50% became seizure free and 75% had a seizure reduction at least of 50%. The side effects more commonly reported included somnolence 17.6% and behavioral 11.8%. Memory deficit and dizziness occurred only in 2.9 and 1.5% respectively. 17% discontinued treatment because of side effects and it was related to behavioral side effects (7.4%) and sedation (7.3%). Only 4.4% discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy. Comparing with the results of the Keeper trial efficacy was similar, at least 50% seizure reduction of 57% in both studies and a seizure free of 36% versus 20% in Keeper trial.The side effect profile was similar as well regarding somnolence 17% versus 16% and behavioral 11.8% versus 7.4%. However dizziness was rather infrequent 2.9% compared with 9.0% in the Keeper trial.. Conclusions: The results of this study are comparable with the Keeper trial, a multicenter open label community based study, including efficacy and side effect profile. This study included small group of patients on monotherapy who reported higher seizure freedom and efficacy, however the number is too small to draw conclusions.

Decreased glucose metabolism in epileptogenic focus was suggestive of irreversible damage with prognostic implication. Attention has not been much paid to the prognostic implication between the glucose metabolism in temporal lobe and HS.We tried to define the clinical characteristics in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) depending on the decrease of the glucose metabolism and also the impact of hippocampal sclerosis in the same situation. Methods: 68 epilepsy patients with temporal spike in EEG were recruited. 56 patients among them had unilateral hippocampal sclerosis in MRI. The patients with additional lesion except for HS in MRI were excluded and patient with history of central nervous infection also excluded even in case of the isolated unilateral HS in MRI. Analysis was done to define the clinical profiles and prognosis between 40 patients with HS and 11 patients without HS. All of those showied decreased glucose metabolism in temporal lobe in 18F-FDG PET image. Another trial was done between those 56 patients with decreased metabolism in temporal lobe and 12 patients with normal MRI but without decrease of glucose metabolism in PET. Results: In the first trial, preponderance of female prevalence was noted, even in group of normal MRI with decreased metabolism. The incidence of head trauma in addition to the febrile convulsion was statistically significant higher in the group with HS (P < 0.05). Automatism was in higher in HS group but nocturnal preponderance was noted in normal MRI group. Good prognosis (Angel? class I. and II.) was statistically significant in normal MRI group (17.5% vs. 43.8%; p < 0.05). In second trial, head trauma was also higher incidence in the group with normal glucose metabolism than those of the decreased glucose metabolism. Complex partial seizure without 2? GTC, clustering nature, and nocturnal dominancy were statistically significant higher in normal glucose group. The prognosis of the group with normal metabolism was statistically significant (p < 0.05) better than those of the group with decreased glucose metabolism and normal MRI. Conclusions: This study suggested that decreased glucose metabolism in temporal lobe made some effect on difference of clinical profiles of TLE, even though in the presence of HS. Decreased glucose metabolism in TLE seemed to be an independent prognostic factor irrespective of the presence of HS in MRI. 1 Arjune M. Patel, 1 Raj D. Sheth, 1 Bruce P. Hermann, 1 Christian Dow, and 1 Jana Jones ( 1 Neurology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI ) Rationale: Speed of propagation of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy to the contra lateral temporal lobe is predictive of seizure outcomes. In humans direct seizure propogation from ipsilateral hippocampus to contra lateral hippocampus is believed to occur through neocortical parenchymal spread. Fast propagating seizures are associated with worse outcomes following temporal lobectomy. The relationship between seizure propagation times in temporal lobe epilepsy and MRI volumetrics and neuropsychological function, however has not been examined. Methods: Propagation times from the ipsilateral to the contra lateral temporal lobe were measured using presurgical video telemetry. Propagation times were correlated with a comprehensive array of neuropsychological measures and quantitative MRI total brain grey and white matter volumes. Normalized Z-score measures were used for both neuropyschological testing and for MRI volumetrics. Analysis was performed on second seizure propagations by dividing groups into fast (<5 seconds) and slow (>5 seconds) propagators based on the median propagation times. Results: 20 patients had 2nd seizure propagation times that could be analyzed. 9 had fast propagation times (2.3 ± 1.8 seconds) and 11 had slow propagation time (10.3 ± 5.4 seconds). Slow propagators had significantly better immediate (105.45 ± 14.4 vs. 89.44 ± 22) and delayed auditory memory (103.18 ± 12.3 vs. 89.22 ± 19.3). Similarly memory scores were also better for slow propagators (100.09 ± 16.6 vs. 86.56 ± 16.4). Fast propagators had greater total cerebral volumes compared to slow propagators. Segmentation by grey and white matter volumes were also larger for fast propagators compared to slow propagators Conclusions: These findings suggest that faster propagation of seizures to the contra lateral hemisphere is associated with worse neurophysilogical function and larger grey, white and total brain volumes. 1 Scott Pearlman, 1 Diana Richardson, and 1 Mary R. Andriola ( 1 Neurology, Stony Brook Epilepsy Management Program, Stony Brook, NY ) Rationale: Topiramate (TPM) is a newer antiepileptic medication available in the United States for the treatment of epilepsy since 1996. It is indicated as adjunctive therapy for adults and pediatric patients ages 2?16 years with partial onset seizures, or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and in patients 2 years of age and older with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The purpose of this study was to review our clinical experience with TPM in an adult population. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 12 adults with a variety of epileptic syndromes who had been on prior therapy and had an EEG while on TPM from Jan 2003 to Dec 2004. Ages ranged from 22 to 56 years. Demographics, seizure types, previous antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), dosages, concomitant AEDs, adverse events and outcome were recorded. Results: Twelve patients were included; five men and seven women. Eight had partial onset epilepsy, and four primary generalized epilepsy. Associated disorders included mental retardation, renal failure, and history of meningitis. Patients were taking up to 3 AEDs when TPM was added. A >50% seizure reduction was found in 8 patients (67%) Adverse events (AEs) included nephrolithiasis, behavioral difficulties, and parasthesias. Two patients experienced beneficial weight loss. Three patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. One patient undergoing hemodialysis required an additional dose with dialysis for adequate seizure control. Conclusions: Topiramate is an effective and well tolerated medication in the adult population for both partial onset and primary generalized epilepsy. Monotherapy is possible in both partial and generalized epilepsy patients. In this population studied all had difficult to control epilepsy and we were able to achieve significant improvement in 67% of our patients. 1,2 Timothy E. Welty, 1 Andrea Pierce Ashley, and 2 Edward Faught ( 1 McWhorter School of Pharmacy, Samford University, Birmingham, AL ; and 2 Department of Neurology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL ) Rationale: Osteoporosis (OP) is a well-documented chronic adverse effect of AED therapy. DEXA scans are the standard testing procedure for OP. However, DEXA can be costly and exposes a patient to radiation. Heel ultrasound (HU) is less costly, can be performed during a routine office visit, and is less risky. HU is used in many screening programs for OP, but has not been evaluated as a tool to screen for OP due to AED therapy. Methods: Patients ages 19?70 yrs with epilesy and managed in our clinc are eligible for this study. Inclusion criteria are patients receiving PB, PHT, CBZ, or VPA for at least 6 months. Patients are excluded if they are pregnant, on chronic corticosteroid therapy, taking prescription medications for OP, have parathyroid disorders, are institutionalized, or have sores or abrasions on feet. A questionnaire is completed by the patient to asses OP risk factors and calcium intake. HU is performed in clinic using a Sahara Hologic Sonometer. Each patient is sent for a DEXA scan. WHO standards for diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis are used. The primary outcome is comparison of HU to DEXA results. Secondary outcomes are evaluation of various risk factors and calcium intake. Statistical analysis will be using a students t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient with α= 0.05. A power analysis to detect at least a half standard deviation between HU and DEXA showed at least 64 individuals should be enrolled. Results: A total of 65 participants will be enrolled. Preliminary evaluation of the first 7 patients enrolled in the study shows a mean age of 49.6 yrs, among 5 women and 2 men. Mean duration of older AED therapy was 12.4 yrs. 3 patients smoke an average of 1 ppd, 3 women had a hysterectomy, 2 patients have a fracture history, the mean caffeine intake is 2.4 cups of coffee/day, and 1 is taking hormonal replacement therapy. Four patients are osteopenic according to HU using WHO standards. Two patients have completed the study and the final diagnosis was consistent between HU and DEXA (1 osteopenic and 1 normal). A full comparison and evaluation of patients enrolled will be made. Conclusions: Very preliminary data show that HU may be a useful screening tool for OP in patients taking chronic AED. 1 Aleksandra Pikula, 1 Costas Michaelides, and 1 Georga D. Montouris ( 1 Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA; Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA; and Department of Neurology, Boston Univesrity School of Medicine, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is associated with a high mortality and high incidence of neurological sequelae. Long term follow up (up to one year) of three patients treated with prolonged iatrogenic coma for RSE is reported. Methods: Three female patients ages 17, 29 and 33 years were admitted to the ICU in status epilepticus refractory to standard treatment. Two were new onset seizures secondary to viral encephalitis and the third was an exacerbation of seizure activity secondary to a mitochondrial disorder. Prolonged iatrogenic coma was induced for up to 54, 59 and 81 days respectively. All three required high doses of antiepileptic medications, in polypharmacy to control seizure activity. VNS was implanted in one case to control seizures Upon hospital discharge, all of the patients were followed by an epileptologist. Medications were reviewed and adjusted when necessary, seizure count was recorded, evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL) was noted and neurological exam was performed. Results: All three patients have improved seizure control on polypharmacy. One patient experienced breakthrough seizures secondary to missed doses of AED. She is now seizure free on dual drug therapy. Neurologically, she demonstrates only a mild monoparesis of a lower extremity. The patient with a mitochondrial disorder has rare simple partial hemifacial seizures. She has demonstrated significant gain in ADL, ambulation, and speech,all of which show improvement over her pre RSE condition. The third patient with concomitant diagnosis of schizophrenia experienced breakthrough seizures when,at another facility, reduction of AEDs was undertaken. Currently, adjustments have been made with significant improvement in seizure control. Fluctuations in cognitive skills are seen, which may be related to her psychiatric condition. She does not however, demonstrate any focal neurological deficits. Conclusions: The management of RSE remains a challenge. Each of the patients required prolonged iatrogenic coma. Each responded to different agents and to polypharmacy. Long term outcome has been favorable in each case. Despite the perception that RSE carries a poor prognosis, close supervision and aggressive treatment can result in a favorable outcome 1 Gerard Pinol, 1 Jose Angel Mauri, 1 Carlos Tejero, 1 Iris De la Puerta, 1 Luis Fernando Pascual, and 1 Enrique Mostacero ( 1 Service of Neurology, Clinical Hospital, Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain ) Rationale: We had studied demographic characteristics, stroke risk factors, size of lesions, seizure type and EEG findings. We evaluated if the patients received antiepileptic drugs after the first seizure and also we evaluated the recurrence of seizures along 5 years. Methods: Included in this study were 1061 cerebrovascular disease patients (846 ischemic stroke, 186 hematoma and 29 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)) who were admitted to the Department of Neurology of Clinic Hospital to Zaragoza between January 1998 and December 2000. Of these patients, 39 had early seizures in acute stroke. Results: 3.7% of patients (2.2% with ischemic stroke, 8% hematoma and 13% SAH) experienced one first-ever seizure. Mean age of 70.15 years. Arterial hypertension was the main risk factor stroke, it was present in 44% of patients. Of 39 patients, 54% developed generalized seizures and 46% partial onset. The main territory of ischemic stroke affected was medium cerebral artery. Cardioembolism was the main cause of ischemic stroke with seizures. 58% and 42% of hematomas were lobars and lentriculars respectively. Death was in 18% of patients in the first week. 61% of patients received antiepileptic drugs and phenitoine was the most used. Conclusions: Male patients with hipertension and hematoma or SAH suffer early seizures in most frecuency. High mortality in the first week. Low recurrence of seizures in the future and so the antiepileptic treatment musn't be prolonged more than 3 month. 1 Wesley J. Poynor, and 1 William R. Garnett ( 1 School of Pharmacy, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA ) Rationale: Zonisamide (ZNS) is a broad spectrum antiepileptic drug that exhibits a significant interaction with phenytoin (PHT): the half-life of ZNS is decreased by 60% (from 69 hours to 28 hours) due to the induction of enzymatic metabolic activity by PHT. Our objective was to explore this interaction with particular attention to the reverse drug interaction, i.e., the withdrawal of PHT therapy and its clinical implications for ZNS dosing. Methods: We developed a pharmacokinetic multiple-dosing model based upon a previously published multiple-dose clinical study of ZNS in normal volunteers. Using this model, we simulated the addition of PHT to ZNS monotherapy. We also simulated the withdrawal of PHT from binary therapy. In these simulations we assumed that enzyme induction due to PHT occurred over a 7 day period (i.e., the half-life of ZNS decreased gradually over a 7 day period). We also assumed that the de-induction of enzyme metabolic activity occurred over a 7 day period and that this de-induction phase did not occur until PHT levels were substantially zero, which we assumed occurred 7 days after the discontinuance of PHT therapy. Results: The decline in ZNS plasma levels upon adding PHT was 60%; perhaps more significantly, the ZNS plasma levels seen on monotherapy were more than double those seen with PHT co-therapy. We note that in co-therapy with PHT, ZNS dosing levels could easily be pushed from 200 mg BID to as high as 400 mg BID and still have plasma levels in the therapeutic range of 15?30 mcg/ml. When withdrawing PHT from co-therapy, there is a 7 day period during which PHT levels are declining to zero and the enzymatic metabolic activity is still induced. De-induction occurs after PHT levels are virtually zero and we assume to occur over 7 days. In this case the ZNS dose must be decreased to a target level of 200 mg BID. Assuming that we raised the dose of ZNS to 400 mg BID when given with PHT, we recommend decreasing the ZNS dose beginning 7 days after discontinuing PHT therapy. Thereafter we recommend decreasing the ZNS dose to an intermediate level (300 mg BID in our example) for 3 days (6 doses) and then beginning the 200-mg-BID maintenance dose regimen. This strategy is based on solid pharmacokinetic evidence and maintains plasma levels of ZNS in the therapeutic range throughout the transition Conclusions: ZNS dosing when given with PHT can be rationally elevated from the monotherapy dose recommendation of 200 mg BID up to a 400 mg BID level. The adherence to a 200 mg BID dose in co-therapy with PHT may explain apparent failure to achieve additional antiepileptic activity when adding ZNS. The reverse drug interaction occurs when PHT is withdrawn from ZNS therapy. Because of the dramatic effect of PHT on ZNS half-life, dose adjustments are necessary when PHT is withdrawn.

One large prior study (n = 16'432) observed IFBA in only 0.024% of patients, most of them children with secondary epilepsies. More recently, ictal beta activity on scalp EEG and intracranial EEG was reported in patients with neocortical epilepsies undergoing presurgical evaluation. There is little data on this seizure pattern beyond such patients and studies describing it in human status epilepticus are lacking. Methods: Report of two patients, in whom IFBA became the only electroencephalographic seizure pattern in the late phase of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) (patient 1), and in non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) (patient 2). Results: Patient 1: 52 year old female patient with bitemporal non-lesional epilepsy since age 18. Non-adherence to AED treatment and methaqualone intoxication induced RSE lasting 54 days. Various treatments, pentobarbital anesthesia inclusively, failed. RSE eventually subsided under high-dose midazolam and carbamazepine. On day 42, serial episodes with complete loss of responsiveness and tonic upward-gaze were observed; EEG showed high-amplitude beta activity for 15?20 seconds, followed by attenuation. These seizures persisted until was RSE stopped. Patient 2: 49 year old male schizophrenic patient without history of seizures admitted because of confusional state and hyperglycemia. Medications were quietiapine, biperiden, and risperidone. Repetitive episodes (up to 20/h) of slight tonic right-sided head version and starring started on day 2. Concomitant EEG showed high-amplitude beta-activity for 45?60 seconds followed by slowing and subsequent attenuation. NCSE responded well to lorazepam and valproic acid. Conclusions: Our patients both showed IFBA as the exclusive electroencephalographic seizure pattern in NCSE. IFBA must be differentiated from lateralized asymmetric non-epileptic beta activity occuring in patients with infarcts and tumors who do not experience seizures. Differential diagnosis of IFBA in our first patient additionally includes high-dose benzodiazepine treatment, but the clinical and electroencephalographic evolution render this cause very unlikely. In the second patient, seizure semiology during early NCSE allowed immediate recognition of the ictal nature of the beta activity. However, in the first patient, the ictal nature of beta activity was unequivocally recognized only after she showed a clear clinical seizure correlate (starring and upward-gaze deviation) in the late phase of RSE. With minimal or absent clinical seizure manifestations, antiepileptic treatment in NCSE is predominantly guided by EEG. Therefore, the recognition of rare or atypical electroencephalographic seizure patterns, such as IFBA, is essential in these patients. 1 Susan Rahey, 1 Mark Sadler, and 2 Andrew Ross ( 1 Medicine (Neurology), Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada ; and 2 Diagnostic Radiology, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada ) Rationale: To report supernumerary phantom limb as an ictal phnomenon. Methods: A 66 year old right handed biologist presented with a 4 year history of stereotypic spells. His attacks are characterized by a nonspecific feeling of anxiety and unsteadiness followed by a profound perception that he has developed a third upper extremity. The supernumary limb cannot be seen but is perceived as ?right handed,? is positioned directly in front of him, and that the fingers can be moved. The experience has sufficient reality that the patient has attempted to use the limb during automatic movements (e.g. to use the turn signal while driving; unsucessfully bracing himself against falling). These events last 2?5 minutes, ocasionally 10, and occur up to 6 times daily. Impaired consciousness or motor phenomenon have never occurred. The mental status examination revealed minor defects of immediate memory and attention but the neurologic examination was otherwise normal, including evaluation of parietal lobe function. Results: The MRI scan disclosed periventricular and subcortical white matter ischemic change. The interictal EEG was normal. An ictal EEG (coincident with the perceived appearance of the third arm) disclosed a new 4?6 Hz polymorphic rhythm predominantly at CZ-C4. An ictal HMPAO-SPECT scan demonstrated a restricted zone of increased perfusion in the right central-parietal area. Carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and levitiracetam have been poorly tolerated and without benefit. Conclusions: A supernumerary phantom limb may occur as an ictal accompaniment of parietal lobe epilepsy. A literature search found only 3 previous reports of similar phenomena, with none since 1968. 1 Maria V. Recio, 1 Bassel W. Abou-Khalil, 1 Michael J. McLean, and 1 Martin Gallagher ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Cerebellar lesions are associated with epilepsy but it is not known what type of epilepsy is associated with them. There are reports of seizures originating in the cerebellum itself in patients with cerebellar lesions, but it is not known how often this is the case in patients with congenital or acquired cerebellar lesions. Here we characterized epilepsy associated with cerebellar malformations by reviewing the records of all patients in our database with cerebellar malformations. Methods: We identified patients with documented epilepsy from our database. Medical records were reviewed for age, gender, age at seizure onset, family history for epilepsy, risk factors for epilepsy including febrile seizures, seizure type, localization and frequency, response to treatment, epilepsy surgery if performed, and eventual outcome at follow-up. Symptoms and neurological examination signs cerebellar dysfunction were reviewed. Brain CT and MRI images were reviewed for cerebellar as well as extracerebellar abnormalities. We excluded patients with only cerebellar atrophy. Results: We identified 10 patients (8 women) with cerebellar lesions and epilepsy in our database of 2288 epilepsy patients. Their ages ranged from 26 to 52 years (mean 37.5); age at seizure onset ranged from 2 weeks to 30 years (mean 10.2). The cerebellar malformations included Dandy-walker cyst (3 patients), cerebellar tumors (3 patients), posterior fossa arachnoid cyst (2 patients- one with abnormal cerebellar segmentation and one with cerebellar hemisphere and vermis hypotrophy), agenesis of the left cerebellar hemisphere (1 patient), Chiari malformation and cerebellar hypotrophy (1 patient). Cerebellar exam abnormalities were present in four patients. The epilepsy was classified as partial in 9 patients (2 left mesial temporal, 3 right mesial temporal, 1 left frontal, 1 left occipital, 2 unclassified), and one symptomatic generalized. A presurgical evaluation was performed in 6 patients. The epileptogenic focus was temporal in 5 and in the supplementary motor area in one. The brain abnormality considered responsible for epilepsy was hippocampal sclerosis in 4 patients, hippocampal malformation in 1 patient, temporal tip cortical malformation in 1 patient. Five patients had epilepsy surgery (4 temporal, 1 mesialfrontal). All had a favorable initial response to surgery becoming seizure-free (Engel class I) or almost seizure-free (Engel class II), but seizures eventually recurred in 2 patients after one year with no seizures. Conclusions: Epilepsy with cerebellar structural abnormalities is most often of temporal lobe origin. There is usually associated temporal lobe pathology accounting for the seizure tendency, including hippocampal sclerosis and temporal developmental malformations. Cerebellar pathology should not preclude epilepsy surgery 1 J.J. Uranga Rodriguez, 1 F. Chaves Villalobos, 2 O. Serrano Prian, 2 I. Pozo Trujillo, 2 C. Sanchez Ruiz, 2 C. De la Torre Rueda, and 1 Jimenez Hernandez ( 1 Neurology, Hospitales Universitarios Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Seville, Spain ; and 2 Psychology University, Seville University, Seville, Seville, Spain ) Rationale: We present a 33-year-old woman presented with a subacute confusional state, headaches, myoclonus, seizures, unsteadiness and an amnesic syndrome as a presentation of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Methods: Complementary investigations showed euthyroidism,raised thyroid microsomal antibodies, pleocytosis in CSF, negative neuronal potassium channels, negative antineuronal antibodies, negative PCR for herpes simple virus in four determinations, continuous bitemporal spikes in EEG, normal PET study, chest CTscan and mamography. Results: The patient was 21 days in intensive care unit with invasive ventilation and general anesthesia with unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs. A T2-weighted MRI of the brain showed bilateral symmetric areas of increased signal in the mesial temporal lobes and hippocampus that had a low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging and gadolinium enhanced. The clinical and radiologic improvement after steroid and inmunoglobulin therapy. The patient was assessed neuropsychologically three months after discharge. Her scores on executive skills, visual, verbal, working and autobiographical memories were all pathological. Her scores on language, visuospatial, visuoconstructive functioning were all above average. Atentional process are slowed. Conclusions: The clinical and laboratory features in this case support a diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. We think than the immunoglobulin treatment is a important options in those patients. We conclusions that in cases with epilepticus status and bilateral mesial temporal involvement is necessary to reject Hashimoto's encephalopathy and use precocious inmunomodulador treatment for prevent consequences. The thyroid microsomal antibodies determinations is necessary in cases with bilateral mesial temporal involvement and cryptogenic epilepticus status. 1 Charles A. Sansur, 1 Jeff Elias, 1 David S. Geldmacher, and 1 Mark Quigg ( 1 Neurosurgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; Neurosurgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; and Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: Assessment of eloquent functions during brain mapping usually relies on testing reading, speech, and comprehension to uncover transient deficits during electrical stimulation. These tests stem from findings predicted by the Geschwind-Wernicke hypothesis of receptive and expressive cortices connected by white matter tracts. Later work, however, has emphasized cortical mechanisms of language function. We report two cases that demonstrate that conduction aphasia is cortically-mediated and can be inadequately assessed if not specifically evaluated during brain mapping. Methods: To determine the distribution of language on dominant cortex, we performed electrical cortical stimulation using implanted subdural electrodes during brain mapping before epilepsy surgery. We report our findings in two patients. There was an interelectrode distance of 1cm. We stimulated adjacent pairs of contacts using a 50 Hz square wave signal starting at a duration of 2 seconds and an intensity of 4.5 mA. We increased duration to 5 seconds and increased current by 1 mA increments until (1) a response occurred, (2) an afterdischarge or clinical seizure occurred, or (3) no response was achieved at a stimulus of 12.5 mA/5 seconds. Results: We elicited a transient, isolated deficit in repetition of language with stimulation of the posterior portion of the dominant superior temporal gyrus in one patient and of the supramarginal gyrus in the second patient. Conclusions: These cases demonstrate a localization of language repetition to the posterior perisylvian cortex. Brain mapping of this region should include assessment of verbal repetition to avoid potential deficits resembling conduction aphasia. This study provides further evidence that the white matter disconnection hypothesized by the Wernicke-Geschwind model is not an obligatory cause of conduction aphasia. 1 Kimberley K. Schaub, 1 Nancy Foldvary, and 1 Peggy Crawford ( 1 Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ) Rationale: Research in sleep and epilepsy has revealed a dynamic relationship between the disease and the sleep-wake cycle. Many people with epilepsy report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), commonly attributed to the effects of seizures and/or antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea are yet another cause of EDS. In some patients with epilepsy, sleep instability, possibly independent of these forementioned factors, may be present as many individuals with epilepsy have increased latency to sleep onset, increased number and duration of awakenings, decreased sleep efficiency, increased number of shifts between stages of sleep, and decreased or fragmented REM sleep on polysomnography (Besset, 1982; Touchon, Baldy-Moulinier, Billiard, et al., 1987, 1991). EDS can negatively affect quality of life. As a result, many attempt to compensate for sleepiness with the use of caffeinated beverages. Caffeine, a mild stimulant, is the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world and in high doses may cause nausea, trembling, nervousness, as well as increased seizure frequency (Zagnoni and Albano, 2002). The purpose of this study was to investigate caffeinated beverage consumption in individuals with epilepsy and to identify demographic and disease related variables associated with its use. Methods: Participants were one hundred and ten adults (42% male) aged 18?75 with medically intractable epilepsy, referred for surgery evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. All subjects participated in a health psychology evaluation that included questions regarding employment, education, psychiatric and sleep history as well as use of caffeinated beverages, alcohol and illicit drugs. Fourteen percent of participants were treated with monotherapy, 66% were taking two AEDs, 17% three, and 4% four or more AEDs (intermittent benzodiazepine use excluded). Forty-two percent were employed and 58% were not currently employed. Results: Caffeinated beverage consumption ranged from 0 to 128 oz. daily, with an average of 30 oz. Although no significant differences were observed in caffeinated beverage consumption between men and women, individuals who consumed larger quantities of caffeine also used nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substances regularly and were more likely to be employed. Disease related variables, particularly greater numbers of AEDs, correlated with greater caffeine consumption. Conclusions: These results suggest that use/overuse of caffeinated beverages is common among individuals with medically intractable epilepsy, particularly those on AED polytherapy, use other substances, or are employed.Given the impact that these issues have on quality of life, these findings highlight the importance of further research into the causes and treatment of sleep and wake disturbances associated with epilepsy. 1 Andreas Schulze-Bonhage, 2 Christhop Kurth, and 3 Thomas Mayer ( 1 Epilepsy Centre, University Hospital Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany ; 2 Epilepsy Centre, Kork, Kehl-Kork, Baden-Württemberg, Germany ; and 3 Epilepsy Centre, Diakonie Kleinwachau, Liegau-Augustusbad, Sachsen, Germany ) Rationale: Premonitory symptoms are usually defined as phenomena occurring more than 30 minutes before the onset of epileptic seizures. So far, their meaning is unclear, unlike auras, they are, however, generally not regarded as a correlate of ictal epileptic activity. So far few data are available on their prevalence and to their semiologic characteristics as compared to auras in the same patient. This study investigated the prevalence and type of premonitory symptoms in epilepsy patients at three german tertiary referral centers. Methods: Questionnaires were handed out to a total of 500 unselected patients at the epilepsy centers of Freiburg, Kork, and Kleinwachau agreeing to participate. 415 patients had epilepsies classified as focal, 82 had epilepsies classified as primarily generalized. Patients were asked to report the presence of signs or symptoms preceding seizure for at least 30 minutes. If premonitory symptoms were present, they were asked to describe their nature. These data were related to the epilepsy syndrome and to seizure semiology. Results: 35/500 patients (7.0%) reported symptoms occurring more than 30 minutes preceding the onset of seizures. 30 patients had focal epilepsy (prevalence 7.2%), 5 had generalized epilepsy (prevalence 6.1%). The median of estimated time of premonitory symptoms preceding the seizure was 90 min (range 30 minutes - 24 hours). Most common symptoms reported were restlessness, headache, feeling uncomfortable, nausea, disturbance of concentration, dizziness and tiredness. In 17/35 patients also auras were reported; in three of them, symptoms were similar suggesting that they also suffered from prolonged auras. In the majority of patients, however, symptoms differed considerably. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study in patients at tertiary referral centers resulted in a frequency of premonitory symptoms well below previous reports which may be due to the fact that other studies did not investigate auras separately. Differences in semiology between premonitory symptoms and auras in the vast majority of patients suggest a different underlying pathophysiology. 1 Tania M.G. Henriques, 1,2 Fulvio A.

Methods: Forty-three non-consecutive patients (26 males) submitted to both temporal and extratemporal cortical resection were studied. They were assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-36 is a generic instrument with the following domains: functional capability, mental health, social function, emotional aspects, physical function, general status of health, vitality, bodily pain; used to assess quality of life. The follow-up time after CR ranged from 2 month to 11 years. Fifty six per cent of patients had controlled seizures, 39.5% had complex partial seizures and 4.6% presented partial seizures with secondary generalization. Results: Mean age of our population was 37.4±10.1, ranging from 17 to 58 years old. The mean score for each domain for cured/non-cured patients were as follows: vitality, 81/62; general health status, 82/65; pain, 79/59; social function, 84/63; emotional aspects, 81/47; mental health, 77/53; physical function, 88/61 and functional ability, 94/82. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the type and frequency of seizures might be important factors in QOL measures. Assessing QOL and outcome after epilepsy surgery could lead to a better understanding of the various aspects related to the well being of chronically refractory epileptic patients.

Seredycz, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: Health services research in epilepsy is in its infancy in many parts of the world. This type of research is crucial in understanding provisional health services in epilepsy, treatment gaps, and determinants of variations encountered. Whether the right patients are receiving the right interventions at the right time requires research of this nature. Administrative databases are a rich resource that has been used in many areas but rarely in epilepsy. ICD9, and more recently ICD10 codes are utilized worldwide in administrative databases. There is little information on the validity of ICD9 codes for epilepsy and no information on ICD10 codes. We undertook a before and after comparison of ICD9 and ICD10 epilepsy coding in inpatients in a large health region. Methods: All discharge diagnoses in Canada are ICD coded and captured in a central repository. ICD9 codes were used in our region until 2000. Thereafter ICD10 codes were adopted. We obtained ICD codes epilepsy- related, in any sequence (whether most responsible diagnosis for admission or not) for 2000 (ICD9) and 2004 (ICD10), in five inpatient facilities within the entire Calgary Health Region (population 1.4 million). We grouped ICD codes into generalized, localization-related, status epilepticus and other. We examined the distribution of each group within the two coding systems, both as a most responsible diagnosis and as other diagnoses. Results: The following ICD 9 codes were used: generalized epilepsy (345.0, 345.1, 780.4, 333.2), localization-related epilepsy (345.4, 345.5), status epilepticus (345.3, 345.7), other epilepsy (345.8, 345.9). For ICD 10 the following codes were used: generalized epilepsy (G40.3, G40.4, G40.6, G40.7), localization-related (G40.0, G40.1, G40.2), status epilepticus (G41.0, G41.2, G41.8, G41.9, G40.5), other epilepsy (G40.8, G40.9). In the absence of overt changes in availability of inpatient services, ICD9 captured 968 patients and ICD10 captured 625 per year. Table 1 Conclusions: In the absence of expected changes in the patient population or rate of admissions, substantial discrepancies occurred between types of epilepsy and numbers of epilepsy captured by the two coding systems. ICD10 coding seems better at capturing localization-related epilepsy and status epilepticus as well as having fewer patients in the non-specific (other epilepsy) category. This difference was apparent both for most responsible diagnosis and for other diagnoses. Before ICD codes can be used extensively in health services research, further research should focus on their accuracy based on comparison with clinical diagnoses, in addition to exploring variables that explain differences between systems.

We further examined this question by (a) Attempting to replicate the original association and (b) Using a combination of tagging SNPs and direct sequence based methods to examine whether other variants in the gene are associated with drug resistant epilepsy in an Irish epilepsy cohort. Methods: 440 patients with an established diagnosis of epilepsy were enrolled. Phenotypic information was recorded in a secure linked anonymised database. We examined C3435T to replicate the original association. We also genotyped 5 additional tagging SNPs and 3 putatively functional variants. Results: Of 440 patients, 242 were drug responsive and 198 were drug resistant. Direct comparison of the genotypes of both groups revealed no significant association of any particular SNP with refractory epilepsy. Haplotype analysis failed to yield significant association of either group with a particular genotype. Discussion: An association of the CC genotype at C3435T has been reported in patients with drug resistant epilepsy(1). An exact replication study has failed to confirm that association.(2).However, the association was replicated by a similar but not identical definition of pharmacoresistance(3). It is possible that the C3435T polymorphism is not itself causal but associating through LD with the causal variant. Hence,analysis of SNPs in strong LD with C3435T has been suggested(4). We attempted an exact replication using map and sequence based methods but failed to find a significant association with drug resistant epilepsy. Conclusions: We examined C3435T as well as all other common variants in MDR1 and failed to identify a significant association with drug resistant epilepsy.This supports the view that the original association(1), maybe a false-positive finding. However, the ambiguous nature of the phenotype definition does not rule out a role variation in MDR1 with pharmacoresistance in a specific group of antiepileptic drugs.

Holzemer ( 1 Neurology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO ) Rationale: During initial clinical trials of ondansetron, only 10 patients (<1%) had seizures. All had tumors with numerous risk factors for seizures. There are only two additional reports of seizures following ondansetron administration in humans, one in a patient with septic shock after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, and another in a patient with metastatic breast cancer on chemotherapy. In animal studies, both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant effects of ondansetron have been described. Methods: Retrospective review of three patients evaluated during the period 2004?2005. Results: There were two females and one male. Ages ranged from 38?56 years. None had a previous or family history of seizures. Past medical history was significant only for diabetes, with one patient presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred in each patient 12, 15 and 22 minutes after injection of 4 mg of ondansetron intravenously for severe nausea and vomiting. Seizures were brief and patients returned to their baseline clinical state within a few minutes. Although no antiepileptic drugs were given, none had seizure recurrence subsequently. Brain MRI and EEG were normal in all patients. Conclusions: The temporal relationship between ondansetron administration and seizures, lack of EEG or MRI abnormalities and absence of seizure recurrence suggest that the seizures in our patients were causally related to ondansetron. Ondansetron associated seizures may be more common than previously recognized and can occur in patients with no obvious predisposing factors. Based on previous reports and our own experience, they typically present as a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure within 30 minutes of parenteral administration of ondansetron. The exact mechanism is unknown. 1 Tanvir U. Syed, 1 Ahsan M. Arozullah, 1 Anu K. Podichetty, and 1 Eduardo R. Locatelli ( 1 Neurology Department, Cleveland Clinic Florida, Weston, FL ) Rationale: To determine whether a diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures (NES) can be predicted by sociodemographic information and a simple questionnaire. Methods: Epileptic and NES patients were recruited from a multispecialty community-based clinic equipped with an epilepsy-monitoring unit. The diagnosis of NES was confirmed by video-EEG monitoring and clinical data. Patients completed a self-administered survey consisting of quality of life (QOLIE-31), depression, and anxiety scales. Subsequently, an interviewer-based questionnaire was used to assess sociodemographic information, attitudes toward self-care, social-support, trust in the healthcare system, self-efficacy, and health-literacy. Epilepsy-specific parameters included seizure frequency (per month), seizure control (seizure-freedom for the past 12 months), time since diagnosis, and AED compliance. The bivariate relationship between each potential predictor and the diagnosis of NES was tested using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the independent t-test for continuous variables. Predictors with p < 0.20 in the bivariate analysis were entered into a stepwise conditional multivariate logistic regression model with the diagnosis of NES as the dependent variable. Predictors with p > 0.05 in the regression model were sequentially deleted from the analysis until only statistically significant predictors remained. Results: To date, 98 epileptics (mean age 42 ± 17, 60.2% female, mean seizure frequency 2.6 ± 0.7) and 19 NES (mean age 41 ± 14, 94.7% female, mean seizure frequency 11.1 ± 3.7) have completed both surveys. Bivariate analysis identified female gender (p = 0.004), Non-Caucasian ethnicity (p = 0.087), unemployment (p = 0.102), low income (p = 0.016), increased seizure frequency (p < 0.001), greater time since diagnosis (p = 0.017), poor AED compliance (p = 0.196), low QOLIE-31 score (p = 0.001), depression (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.001), low social support (p = 0.067), and low self-efficacy (p = 0.068) as potential predictors of a diagnosis of NES. The medication effects subscale of the QOLIE-31 and the tangible subscale of the social support inventory were the only subscales not found to be significantly related to a diagnosis of NES. The final logistic regression model retained female gender (OR = 17.3 [1.6, 183.6]), low income (graded from 1 = lowest to 7 = highest, OR = 0.74 [0.56, 0.99]), low overall-quality-of-life subscale score of QOLIE-31 (scaled 0?100, OR = 0.94 [0.92, 0.98]), and higher seizure frequency (OR = 1.1 [1.03, 1.17]) as independent predictors of a diagnosis of NES. The C-statistic and GOF statistic for the model were 0.894 and 0.338, respectively. The positive predictive value for predicting a diagnosis of NES in our patients was 91.4%. Conclusions: 2 items from the QOLIE-31 questionnaire (overall-quality-of-life subscale) and sociodemographic information may be useful in differentiating NES patients from true epileptics. 1 Jose F. Tellez-Zenteno, and 1 Samuel Wiebe ( 1 Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada ) Rationale: A previous epidemiological study has shown that patients with epilepsy have substantial comorbidity of chronic conditions1. We hypothesized that the somatic multicomorbidity in epilepsy is not specific for epilepsy, but that other chronic conditions share similar comorbidity. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Population Health Survey (NPHS, 49,000 respondents) and the Community Health Survey (CHS, 130,882 respondents). Both surveys used probabilistic sampling of the entire Canadian population and explored the presence of 19 common chronic conditions, ascertained through trained personal interviewers. We obtained risk ratios for prevalence of chronic conditions in 4 target disorders that can affect similar age groups: epilepsy, asthma, migraine and diabetes Results: 19 chronic somatic conditions were explored. 13 chronic conditions occurred significantly more frequently in epilepsy patients than in the general population, 10 in asthma, 14 in diabetes and 10 in migraine (Risk ratio >1.0, 95% CI excluded the null value). Chronic conditions with very high prevalence (Risk ratio >2) in our target disorders were: Epilepsy: upper gastrointestinal problems, stroke, urinary incontinence, bowel disorders, chronic fatigue, migraine, pulmonary conditions and heart disease. Migraine: upper gastrointestinal problems, bowel disorders, and chronic fatigue. Diabetes: arthritis, high blood pressure, pulmonary conditions, heart disease, stroke, cataracts, thyroid conditions, cancer and glaucoma. Asthma: pulmonary conditions and chronic fatigue. Conclusions: Epilepsy has the highest somatic comorbidity. It is similar in frequency to Diabetes, a systemic, multiorgan condition. However, the profile is different, only 3 of 8 highly comorbid conditions were shared. Only fatigue and pulmonary conditions occurred in at least three of our target disorders. Comorbid conditions in migraine and asthma were infrequent, but similar in type to epilepsy. We conclude that somatic comorbidity in epilepsy is as high as in systemic, multiorgan disorders, and that it cannot be explained simply as a function of its chronicity. We discuss methodological issues and validity of findings REFERENCE 1.?Gaitatzis A, Carroll K, Majeed A, Sander W. The epidemiology of the comorbidity of epilepsy in the general population. Epilepsia 2004;45(12):1613?1622. 1 Maria E. Fontela, 1 Maria B. Viaggio, 1 Veronica De Simone, and 1 Alfredo Thomson ( 1 Epilesy Section, Department of Neurology, Hospital Frances, Buenos Aires, Argentina ) Rationale: There is a known increased mortality rate in patients with epilepsy. Sudden unexpected death is the most important epilepsy related cause of death. Experimental and clinical data support that early age at onset of seizures, mental retardation, frequent tonic-clonic seizures as well as intractability are significant risk factors for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The main autopsy finding, pulmonar oedema, is still not enough to understand the cause of death of the affected patients. Depending on the cohort studied, SUDEP is responsible for 2 to 18% of all deaths, although the incidence may be up to 40 times higher among young adults with epilepsy. However, (up to our knowledge) incidence of SUDEP in South America has not been reported. The aim of our study is to communicate the frequency of SUDEP in our population. Methods: Clinical records of patients evaluated in our Section from 1999 to December 2004 were reviewed. History of their disease, personal data, treatment given, circumstances of death and autopsy reports were analyzed. Patients with epilepsy who died suddenly and unexpectedly, fulfilling established SUDEP criteria were included. Results: Total of clinical records evaluated: 1000 (from 1999 to Dec. 2004). Educational program about SUDEP was started in 2003. Seven cases fulfill SUDEP criteria, 5 were females and 2 males. Six died between December 2002 and 2004 and one in 1999 (this particular death was read in newspaper and relatives were contacted). The average age at seizure onset was 10,71 ± 4,46 years (range: 3?16 years old). The mean age of death was 33,85 ± 6,7 (28 to 45 years old), resulting in mean duration of seizures of 23,14 ± 7,24 years. Two cases had primarily generalized epilepsies and five suffered from focal seizures with secondary generalization. Three patients were mentally retarded and one had a vascular sequelae in temporal lobe. Except for this patient, all the others had normal MRIs. Seizure frequency median was 4/month (range: 2?150/month). All patients were intractable but one. All of them were on politherapy. No patients had any other potential cause of death and were, aside from epilepsy, healthy at the moment of death. Five patients underwent necropsy, and were classified as definitive SUDEP. The autopsy reported: pulmonary oedema in 3 cases and no remarkable findings in the others. Conclusions: The clinical features described in our study group are similar to those previously reported in the literature. Although the number of SUDEP cases is small, 5 of them were reported after 2003 which might reflect the influence of the educational program implemented at our Department. We believe education is necessary in order to identify SUDEP cases. Patients and family members need to be aware that SUDEP is the most important cause of death related to epilepsy. Its recognition is essential and the first step to determine the incidence of SUDEP in South America. 1 Eugen Trinka, 1 Iris Unterberger, 1 Gerhard Bauer, 1 Jean-Pierre Ndaysaba, 1 Norbert Embacher, 1 Gerhard Luef, 1 Gerald Walser, 1 Klaus Seppi, 1 Judith Dobesberger, and 2 Wilhelm Oberaigner ( 1 Neurology, Universitätsklinik Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria ; and 2 Clinical Epidemiology, TILAK, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria ) Rationale: To evaluate the overall mortality and cause specific mortality in epilepsy patients in Tyrol, Austria as well as their risk factors. Methods: All pts with definite epilepsy (n = 3334) treated at the seizure clinic Universitätsklinik für Neurologie, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria between 1970 and 2000 were included. 1530 of them were incident cases. Diagnosis was based on ILAE classification. Living or dead status was obtained from the Institut für Klinische Epidemiologie, TILAK using a specialized probabilistic record linkage. Pts. were followed until death or end of 2003. A total of 48.595 person-years were analyzed. Standardized mortality rates (SMRs) were calculated by comparisons with those living in the same geographic area in Tyrol. Exact 95% confidene intervals were calcualted by assuming a poisson distribution, using stata? statistical package. Results: We observed 648 deaths compared to expexted 297.4 resulting in a overall SMR 2.2[2.0?2.4] after >30 Years of follow-up. The highest mortality was found in the younger age groups (26?45yrs, SMR 6.8[3.8?11.2]) and in symptomatic epilepsies (3.1[2.3?4.9]) as compared to those with idiopathic (2.7[0.7?7.0]) or cryptogenic etiology (2.2[1.6?3.1]). Elevated SMR after 2 years follow-up were not related to any specific seizure type but was strongly increased in those with persistent seizures as compared to seizure free pts. (SMR 3.3[2.6?4.4] vs. 1.4[0.8?2.3], p < 0.0001). Pts of the cohort 1995?2000 had significantly lower mortality rates than those between 1985?1989 (1.8[1.1?2.9] vs. 4.7[3.3?6.4]). The most common causes of death were cerebrovascular diseases (26%), neoplasms excl. brain tumors (23%) and cardiovascular diseases (15%). The highest cause specific SMR were found for epielpsy (91.6[66.3?123.4]), brain tumors (22,7[15,7?31,8]), and external causes (2,4[1,8?3,3]). Conclusions: The mortality of pts with epilepsy in Tyrol is substantially increased. There is a strong relation to persistent seizure activity and excess mortality possibly amenable to prevention. A reduction of the SMR in the past decade indicats an improved health service in the province. 1 Lori D. Uber-Zak, 1 Matthew T. Hoerth, 2 Takkin Lo, 3 Victor K. Lamin, and 1 Travis E. Losey ( 1 Department of Neurology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA ; 2 Department of Pulmonary/Critical Care, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA ; and 3 Department of Nephrology, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA ) Rationale: Valproic acid (VPA) can cause hyperammonemia alone or in combination with other agents. Hyperammonemia is associated with EEG abnormalities including triphasic waves, high amplitude delta and generalized spike and wave. Hyperammonemia can also lead to cerebral edema, coma and death. We hypothesized that refractory VPA induced hyperammonemia in the setting of status epilepticus (SE) could be treated with hemodialysis (HD) and would lead to improvements in the EEG. Methods: Two patients in SE treated with pharmacologic coma in addition to standard antiepileptic drugs developed refractory hyperammonemia secondary to VPA. HD was undertaken to lower ammonia (NH3) levels. NH3 levels were measured pre and post HD during continuous EEG monitoring. EEG patterns were analyzed. Other laboratory parameters were measured. Results: Marked improvements in NH3 levels were noted after each round of HD. Additionally, the generalized, periodic triphasic waves seen before HD were replaced by a pattern of diffuse slowing. Permanent resolution of the hyperammonemia and its associated EEG abnormalities came only after discontinuation of the VPA. Conclusions: HD can be an effective method for the treatment of VPA induced hyperammonemia in the setting of SE. Improvements in the EEG findings after HD may help to distinguish triphasic waves secondary to hyperammonemia from other more malignant patterns in SE. 1 Iris Unterberger, 1 Judith Dobesberger, 1 Norbert Embacher, 1 Gerald Walser, 1 Gerhard Luef, 1 Elfriede Karner, 1 Margarete Delazer, 1 Thomas Benke, 2 Martin Ortler, and 1 Eugen Trinka ( 1 Neurology, Medizinische Universität Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria ; and 2 Neurosurgery, Medizinische Universität Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria ) Rationale: Epilepsy often is a chronic disorder with great impact on patients' psychosocial functions. Prevalence of affective symptoms (anxiety and depression) is 20?55%. The aim of our study was to evaluate affective symptoms in patients with medically refractory epilepsy, which underwent the Innsbruck Epilepsysurgery programme. Methods: 102 konsecutive patients were studied. Postoperative seizure outcome was classified by the proposed classification of Wieser (2001). The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) was used to identify caseness (possible and probable) of anxiety disorders and depression. Patients were studied preoperatively, 3 mo and 1 yrs postoperatively. Patients were divided into two groups [HADS (0?7; normal), HADS (> = 8; possible/probable). Results: 102 patients (51 f, median age 42 yrs, range (17?71 yrs) were included. 54 and 73 patients showed modest anxiety and depression scores preop (HADS = 0?7) compared to 48 and 29, who exhibited elevated scores (HADS> = 8). There was no korrelation between duration of epilepsy, diagnosis and localisation of epilepsy, age or gender and HADS results. Patients with elevated scores preoperatively improved significantly over time postoperatively (p < 0.001; anxiety and depression), but showed elevated scores overall compared to patients revealing modest scores (p < 0.005). patients with normal scores preoperatively showed improved anxiety scores postop, depressin scores were stabile. There was no significant korrelation between seizure freedom (yes/no) and HADS scores, although seizure free patients showed a trend to perform better. Conclusions: Affective symptoms (anxiety and depression) were found in 30?50% of patients with medically refractory epilepsy. A significant postoperative improvement of anxiety and depression scores was shown. 1 Ralf W. Van Der Sluis, 1 Peter Boardman, and 1 Keijian Tang ( 1 Neurology, New Jersey VA Health Care System, East Orange, NJ ) Rationale: To assess increasing capability of residents by level of training to recognize and treat two distinct and important epilepsy syndromes. Methods: An observational, cross sectional study was performed among the residents of the neurology program of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey at Newark. Two vignettes of a typical case of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) and Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) respictively were presented to the residents. A questionnaire was provided to the residents with questions regarding diagnosis, EEG features, treatment and prognosis. The questionnaire was scored by means of a self designed scoring protocol. ANOVA of scores between groups of residents stratified by training year and combined in junior and senior groups was performed, and also versus 2 control groups of Board Certified/Board Eligible (BC/BE) neurologists with and without extra training in EEG/epilepsy. Results: Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness of JME was significantly different between groups. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better in senior (PGY3?4) residents compared to junior (PGY1?2) residents. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was not significantly better between residents of all separate training years and neurologists without extra training in epilepsy. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better in neurology attendings with training in epilepsy when compared to residents and neurologists without training in epilepsy. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness of MTLE was significantly different between groups. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better for PGY4 residents compared to PGY1 residents. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was not significantly better between residents and neurologists without extra training in epilepsy. Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness was significantly better in neurology attendings with training in epilepsy when compared to junior and senior residents and neurologists without training in epilepsy. Conclusions: Diagnostic and therapeutic awareness of JME and MTLE remains poor among residents and neurologists without training in epilepsy. Syndromic diagnosis of epilepsy continues to remain suboptimal, with negative repercussions for therapeutic management. Optimal management for patients with epilepsy is with neurologists with special expertise in epilepsy. 1 Lina Wang, 1 Gregory Mathews, and 1 Bassel Abou-Khalil ( 1 Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: Analysis of seizure semiology is an important element of the presurgical evaluation. Hypermotor pattern at seizure onset is traditionally considered characteristic of frontal lobe seizure origin, with only rare reports in temporal lobe epilepsy. After observing several patients with hypermotor seizures and temporal tip lesions, we analyzed seizure manifestations in consecutive patients who had epilepsy surgery and MRI evidence of temporal tip lesions, to evaluate the frequency of hypermotor manifestations in epilepsy with temporal tip lesions. Methods: We systematically reviewed seizure history, imaging findings, EEG-video monitoring data, operative reports, pathology findings, and postoperative outcome in consecutive patients with temporal tip lesions evaluated over the preceding 10 years. We also reviewed recorded seizures for analysis of seizure semiology. Results: Eight patients were found having temporal tip lesions. The age of seizure onset varied from 2 to 35 years (average 18). All patients had intractable complex seizures ranging in frequency from 1?2/day to 1?2/month. In all patients, brain MRI showed anterior temporal tip lesions. These included cavernoma in 2 patients, focal cortical dysplasia in 1 patient, cortical and subcortical white matter gliosis in 3 patients, ganglioglioma in 1 patient, and astrocystic proliferation in 1 patient. Four patients manifested hypermotor seizure semiology. The main features were rapid onset with moaning, barking or squealing vocal sound (2 patients) and vocal expletives (1 patient), followed by repetitive leg movement (bicycling, kicking, flexion-extension or sideway motion) in all 4 patients, repetitive body rocking motion (3 patients), pelvic thrusting (1 patient) and thrashing or flexion and extension of upper extremities (3 patients). The patients with hypermotor seizures also showed automatisms, head turning and unresponsiveness. The other 4 patients had typical manifestations of temporal complex partial seizures: gradual onset with staring, unresponsiveness, oralimentary or limb automatisms, hand posturing and head turning. In the four patients with hypermotor seizures, ictal EEG demonstrated 4?5 Hz theta activity in the anterior temporal region then spread to the inferomesial temporal region, while the other 4 patients had initial rhythmic theta in the inferomesial temporal region. All eight patients underwent epilepsy surgery. Six patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with hippocampectomy. One patient received lateral anterior temporal resection. One patient had a resection of cavernous angioma. Six patients remained seizure free since surgery (follow up range 12?36 months). Conclusions: Hypermotor seizures occur frequently in patients with temporal tip lesions. It is not clear if the hypermotor manifestations reflect temporal tip involvement or spread to the frontal lobe through the uncinate fasciculus. A search for temporal tip pathology is recommended for patients with hypermotor seizures and temporal epileptiform discharges. 1 Kevin J. Weatherwax, 1 Ron D. Chervin, 1 Linda Selwa, 1 Rosanna Wedal, and 2 Beth A. Malow ( 1 Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI ; and 2 Neurology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ) Rationale: OSA commonly coexists with epilepsy, and its treatment may improve seizure control and daytime sleepiness. The frequency of OSA in epilepsy may be as high as 33% (Malow et al., Neurology 1997), which is higher than that reported for the general population. The mechanisms whereby OSA exacerbates seizures are unclear. Processes that fragment sleep may facilitate nocturnal (sleep-related) seizures. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with sleep-related seizures are at higher risk for OSA. Methods: Adult patients with epilepsy completed a survey about their sleep and seizures. The survey included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Sleep Apnea Scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SA-SDQ), which has been validated as a screening instrument for OSA in epilepsy patients (Weatherwax et al., Sleep Medicine 2003). Surveys were completed during a visit to the adult neurology clinic or during long-term monitoring in the epilepsy laboratory at the University of Michigan. Patients were divided into two groups: those with sleep-related seizures (SRS) or awake seizures. Sleep-related seizures were defined by subject report that at least half of their seizures occur during sleep. T-tests were used to compare age, body mass index (BMI), ESS, seizure frequency and SA-SDQ scores between the two groups. Logistic regression was used to examine whether the occurrence of SRS was predicted by the frequency of OSA symptoms and by SA-SDQ scores. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: The survey was completed by 1256 patients, including 562 men (44.7%) and 694 (55.3%) women (Table 1). Thirty percent of the patients had SRS. Symptoms of OSA that predicted SRS included loud snoring (p = 0.019); witnessed apnea (p = 0.0001); awakening gasping for breath (p = 0.005) and overall SA-SDQ score (p = 0.03). ESS score was not associated with having SRS (p = 0.111). Conclusions: Epilepsy patients at high risk for OSA, as reflected by loud snoring, witnessed apnea and higher SA-SDQ scores are more likely than other patients to have seizures predominantly during sleep. As SRS tend to occur in lighter stages of sleep (Minecan et al., Sleep 2002), pathological events that facilitate arousals with shifting to a lighter sleep stage, such as obstructive apneas, potentially play an important role in exacerbating SRS in patients with epilepsy.

Only handful of studies examined the issue of first seizure, which presents unique challenges in terms of definitive diagnosis, prognostication and management. First seizure remains a controversial topic, with different studies reporting differing results because of variations in study inclusion criteria, case ascertainment and sample size. This study presents 6-year experience of a dedicated First Seizure Clinic run by epileptologists. Methods: First Seizure Clinic was established in 1999. Patient were referred from general practitioners in the community and emergency and other departments of our hospital. A prospective database of all attendees to the clinic incorporating demographic, clinical, EEG, and neuroimaging data has been maintained since 2000. The data was comprehensively analyzed to define characteristics and outcomes of attendees to the clinic. Results: Data was available for analysis in a total of 415 patients. People with existing diagnosis of epilepsy were excluded. Events were diagnosed as epileptic seizures in 325 (78%), as non-epileptic events in 58 (14%) and as uncertain in 31(8%). Seizures were thought to be provoked in 79 (24%) and unprovoked in 246 (76%). Follow up data was available on 295 patients (89%) with median follow up of 175 days (25th-75th percentile: 87?707 days) for all attendees to the clinic, and 244 (87?497) for those with epileptic seizure at presentation. Of patients with an unprovoked seizure, 64 (26%) had recurrent seizures. Median number of days to recurrent seizure was 227 (91?489). A lower recurrence rate was seen in patients with provoked seizure, 12 of 79 (15.1%, p = 0.049; Fisher exact test, one tailed). Conclusions: At least a quarter of patients will have further seizures following presentation with first epileptic seizure. Seizure recurrence is less following provoked seizure. The data should provide useful information to the clinicians in counseling such patients.

AB  - Abstract Microglia are the immune effector cells of the nervous system. The prevailing view is that microglia are derived from circulating precursors in the blood, which originate from the bone-marrow. Colonisation of the central nervous system (CNS) by microglia is an orchestrated response during human fetal development related to the maturation of the nervous system. It coincides with vascularisation, formation of radial glia, neuronal migration and myelination primarily in the 4th?5th months and beyond. Microglial influx generally conforms to a route following white matter tracts to gray areas. We have observed that colonisation of the spinal cord begins around 9 weeks, with the major influx and distribution of microglia commencing around 16 weeks. In the cerebrum, colonisation is in progress during the second trimester, and ramified microglial forms are widely distributed within the intermediate zone by the first half of intra-uterine life (20?22 weeks). A distinct pattern of migration occurs along radial glia, white matter tracts and vasculature. The distribution of these cells is likely to be co-ordinated by spatially and temporally regulated, anatomical expression of chemokines including RANTES and MCP-1 in the cortex; by ICAM-2 and PECAM on radiating cerebral vessels and on capillaries within the germinal layer, and apoptotic cell death overlying this region. The phenotype and functional characteristics of fetal microglia are also outlined in this review. The need for specific cellular interactions and targeting is greater within the central nervous system than in other tissues. In this respect, microglia may additionally contribute towards CNS histogenesis. Microsc. Res. Tech. 45:359?382, 1999. ? 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is common and poses a significant problem in high-risk populations. In most cases, ICD resolves despite continued exposure in a process known as ?hardening?, allowing individuals to continue with their work. Those who cannot clear ICD develop chronic ICD, which is a significant source of emotional, physical, and financial distress for affected individuals. While hardening is well known among labourers and clinicians, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much can be learned from the study of self-healing processes like the hardening phenomenon. This overview briefly documents the pathogenesis of ICD, focuses on the latest advances pertaining to the hardening phenomenon in ICD, and then highlights potential avenues of productive research. A better understanding of the ?hardening? process in the skin will hopefully lead to advances for the treatment of ICD.

AB  - Abstract Inhibition of angiogenesis by anti-tumor agents may play a role in tumor growth arrest. Tamoxifen and interferon-α/? (IFN-α/?) exhibit potentiated anti-proliferative activity against tumor cells. However, additional host-mediated effects such as modulation of angiogenesis may also inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The effect of tamoxifen and IFN-? on angiogenesis induced by 2 human tumors, MCF-7 breast carcinoma (estradiol dependent) and NIH-OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma (estradiol independent), was assessed. Treatment of nude mice bearing MCF-7 tumors with tamoxifen resulted in a 68% decrease in the number of vessels at the tumor periphery. Treatment with IFN-? yielded a 33% reduction. Treatment of nude mice bearing NIH-OVCAR-3 tumors with tamoxifen resulted in a 73% decrease in the number of vessels. Treatment with IFN-? yielded a 57% reduction. Combination treatment resulted in augmented anti-angiogenic effects. As single agents, both tamoxifen and IFN-? inhibited xenograft tumor growth. Ten weeks of tamoxifen treatment resulted in growth inhibition of MCF-7 and NIH-OVCAR-3 carcinomas by 85% and 66%, respectively. Ten weeks of IFN-? treatment resulted in inhibition of growth of MCF-7 and NIH-OVCAR-3 carcinomas by 67% and 88%, respectively. The combination of tamoxifen and IFN-? completely prevented growth of MCF-7 and NIH-OVCAR-3 carcinomas. The anti-angiogenic effects of tamoxifen and IFN-? were additive. Inhibition of angiogenesis was detectable before measurable effects on tumor volume in both MCF-7 and NIH-OVCAR-3 tumors. Potentiation of anti-angiogenic effects by tamoxifen and IFN-?, possibly resulting from enhanced IFN-induced gene expression, may contribute to anti-tumor activity in both estradiol-dependent and estradiol-independent tumors in vivo.

AB  - Abstract Glutamine (Gln) promotes intestinal growth and maintains gut structure and function, especially in situations of injury and during inflammation. Several mechanisms could contribute to Gln protective effects on gut. Proteomics enable us to characterize differentially expressed proteins in tissues in response to modifications of the biological or nutritional environment. Gln effects on the human intestinal epithelial HCT-8 cell line proteome were assessed under basal and proinflammatory conditions. The 2-DE gels were obtained and compared. Proteins were identified by MS and using databases. About 1200?spots were detected in both 2- and 10-mM Gln concentrations. Under basal conditions, 24?proteins were differentially expressed in response to Gln. Half of these proteins were implicated in protein biosynthesis or proteolysis and 20% in membrane trafficking. Under proinflammatory conditions, 27?proteins were up- or down-regulated by Gln 10?mM. From these proteins, 40%?were involved in protein biosynthesis or proteolysis, 16% in membrane trafficking, 8% in cell cycle and apoptosis mechanisms and 8% in nucleic acid metabolism. This study provides the first holistic picture of proteome modulation by Gln in a human enterocytic cell line under basal and proinflammatory conditions, and supports further evaluation of nutritional modulation of intestinal proteome in humans.

AB  - Summary.? Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection may exhibit neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive impairment. Post-mortem studies of hepatitis C virus HCV quasispecies and replicative intermediates indicate that the brain might act as a separate compartment for viral replication and microglia may be the locus for infection and subsequent neuroinflammatory activity. We sought to use two independent in vivo imaging techniques to determine evidence of neuroinflammation in patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C. Using positron emission tomography (PET) with a ligand for microglial/brain macrophage activation, 11C-(R)-PK11195 (PK11195) and cerebral proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we determined whether there was evidence of neuroinflammation in a pilot study of 11 patients with biopsy-proven mild chronic hepatitis C, compared to healthy volunteers. Patients were characterized by cognitive testing and the fatigue impact scale to assess for CNS impairment. PK11195 binding potential was significantly increased in the caudate nucleus of patients, compared to normal controls (P?=?0.03). The caudate and thalamic binding potential were more significantly increased in six patients with genotype 1 infection (P?=?0.007) and positively correlated with viraemia (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.005). Basal ganglia myo-inositol/creatine and choline/creatine ratios were also significantly elevated in patients with chronic hepatitis C compared to normal controls (P?=?0.0004 and P?=?0.01, respectively). Using PET, we demonstrated evidence of microglial activation, which positively correlated with HCV viraemia and altered cerebral metabolism in the brains of patients with mild hepatitis C. This provides further in vivo evidence for a neurotropic role for HCV.

AB  - Abstract This study tested the hypothesis that activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) contributes towards the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in the mouse. The effects of LPS on plasma glucose, biochemical markers of hepatic, renal and pancreatic exocrine function and lung content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were examined in homozygous PAR-2 knockout mice (PAR-2 -/-) and genetically equivalent, homozygous PAR-2 +/+ mice. The effect of LPS was also examined in normal mice receiving dexamethasone (10 mg kg?1, i.p.) or saline as a positive control. At six hours after intraperitoneal injection, LPS (40 mg kg?1) produced an increase in rectal temperature, hypoglycaemia and elevations in serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine and lipase, as well as an increase in lung MPO content. Dexamethasone treatment reduced LPS-induced hypoglycaemia and elevation of serum ALT concentrations but did not modify elevations in serum creatinine and lipase concentrations or the increase in lung MPO content. The changes in serum concentrations of glucose, ALT, creatinine and lipase produced by LPS in PAR-2 -/- mice were not different from those seen in wild-type or PAR-2 +/+ mice. These data suggest that activation of PAR-2 may not play a pivotal role in LPS-induced multi-organ dysfunction.

AB  - Fibrin clot formation during normal wound healing is essential to hemostasis. Fibrin clots also serve as a scaffold for cells, such as fibroblasts, invading the wound bed. The mechanical characteristics of this fibrin ? fibroblast tissue over a period of time, as the fibrin is replaced with collagen, is not well understood. In this paper, we attempt to measure specific mechanical characteristics in these systems over a period of 10 days by using fibrin ? fibroblasts constructs prepared in a culture dish. We have also examined the effect of fibrinogen and thrombin concentration in the final fibrin clot on these characteristics. A well-established indentation protocol was used to determine the nominal elastic modulus of the cell-fibrin constructs at specified time points. Human fibroblast cell line CRL-2522 was used. Fibrin clots with different fibrinogen and thrombin concentration were prepared as described in Cox et al. (Tissue Engineering, Vol. 10 (5/6): 942) with cell concentration of 50,000 fibroblasts per fibrin clot. Four constructs were prepared for each of the following days 1, 5, and 10. 1?mL of a serum ? containing medium was added to each well, and plates were transferred to a 5% CO2 incubator at 37?°C. On days 1, 5, and 10, the fibrin ? fibroblast constructs were subject to a compressive indentation protocol. This involved applying a circular, flat-ended silica indenter to the surface of the cell/fibrin constructs through controlled displacements until reaching a specified maximum displacement, u*. An Instron 3365 Universal Testing Machine equipped with a 2.5?N load cell with a load resolution of 0.1?mN was used. Displacement rates in the range of 5?10?mm/min were used with peak displacements, u*?=?0.1?5?mm. The force required to maintain these displacements was automatically recorded and analyzed for indentation stiffness over the fixed displacement range of 1.0?1.5?mm at 50?msec intervals. Our results indicate that for the unpopulated fibrin, there was a linear (R?=?0.983) relationship between the indentation stiffness and fibrinogen concentration. Also, there was a nonlinear relationship between indentation stiffness and concentration of collagen in the fibrin/collagen constructs. Finally, we found in one of the cell-populated formulations a steady decrease in the indentation stiffness with increasing incubation time (1?10 days), suggesting that the cells exerted a significant effect on the construct structure and hence mechanical function.

AB  - Background:? Essential parameters of wound healing are regulated by the wound environment., as reflected by the bathing wound fluid (WF). WF increases fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and also inhibits Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in wound-derived fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether WF influences NO metabolism in other wound cells, namely macrophages. Methods:? The mouse hybridoma macrophage cell line RAW 267.4 was employed. Cells were seeded at 2???105/well into 24 well plates or at 2???106 in Petri dishes. Cells were stimulated with 1??g/ml LPS and 10?U/ml IFN-gamma to induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS expression was investigated by Northern blotting after 6?h, enzyme secretion by western blotting after 20?h and NO production by nitrite synthesis in cell culture supernatants after 24?h. WF was harvested at different days postwounding from PVA sponges implanted into male Lewis rats. WF was added at 10%?v/v to the cell media. Cells were incubated in the presence of 60?mM L-valine, an arginase inhibitor, to rule out substrate (arginine) depletion by arginase as a mechanism. Results are expressed as mean?±?SD, n?=?5. Results:? Following inflammatory cytokine stimulation, RAW cells produced 57.36??mol nitrite/ml/24?h. Nitrite synthesis was significantly inhibited to 23.89?±?13.3 by day 7 and to 6.79?±?1.28 by day 10?WF, respectively. iNOS expression was almost completely blocked by addition of 10% WF from day 10 as assessed by Northern and western blotting. WF from the later days (day 10 and 14) had larger inhibitory effect than WF from early days (day 2, 5, and 7). Although omitting L-arginine from the media abolished iNOS expression, incubation of WF in the presence of 60?mM L-valine did not restore the inhibitory effect suggesting that arginase is not involved. Conclusion:? There is a factor in WF which strongly inhibits NO synthesis in RAW cells; the effect becomes more marked over time after wounding. The effect appears to be transcriptionally regulated since mRNA expression is impaired. Further characterization of this inhibitory factor is under way.
