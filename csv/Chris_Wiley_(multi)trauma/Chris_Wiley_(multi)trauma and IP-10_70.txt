AB  - Crocus sativus L. (C.?sativus), commonly known as saffron, is used as a food additive, preservative, and medicinal herb. Traditionally, it has been used as an alternative treatment for different diseases. C.?sativus' medicinal effects are related to its major constituents like crocins, crocetin, and safranal. According to the literature, C.?sativus and its constituents could be considered as an effective treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, coronary artery diseases, asthma, bronchitis, colds, fever, diabetes, and so on. Recently, numerous studies have reported such medicinal properties and found that the underlying mechanisms of action may be mediated by antioxidant, inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. C.?sativus enhances the antioxidant capacity and acts as a free radical scavenger. As an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, it modulates inflammatory mediators, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity responses. This review highlights in vitro and animal findings regarding antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of C.?sativus and its constituents. Present review found that the C.?sativus and its main constituents such as safranal, crocins, and crocetin could be effective against various diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulatory effects.

AB  - Abstract:? Owing to its implication in a range of pathological conditions, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer, the pleiotropic cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been the subject of intensive recent investigation. In the field of dermatology, MIF is believed to be a detrimental factor in diseases such as systemic sclerosis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema and UV radiation damage. However, its contribution to other aspects of cutaneous biology is currently unclear. Although its expression in intact skin is well characterized, little is known about MIF?s role in cutaneous homoeostasis. However, recent data do identify MIF as a key player in the immune privilege of hair follicles. Similarly, although MIF is rapidly released and its local expression significantly induced upon wounding, its primary role in the ensuing repair process remains a source of contention. MIF has been identified as being a key effector of the beneficial effects of estrogen on wound repair, yet studies employing Mif null mice, recombinant MIF, and neutralizing anti-MIF antibodies have failed to provide a consensus as to whether it benefits or inhibits healing. In fact MIF appears to be able to exert both positive and negative effects, with the cell-specific relevancy of MIF in wound healing still unclear. Thus, if MIF and/or its downstream targets are to be therapeutically useful in the context of cutaneous repair, more needs to be done to establish the nature and mechanism of action of MIF and its receptors in healing wounds.

AB  - Abstract Background An essential requirement for performing robotic-assisted surgery on a freely beating heart is a prediction algorithm that can estimate the future heart trajectory. Method Heart motion, respiratory volume (RV) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signal were measured from two dogs during thoracotomy surgery. A comprehensive multimodality prediction algorithm was developed based on the multivariate autoregressive model to incorporate the heart trajectory and cardiorespiratory data with multiple inherent measurement rates explicitly. Results Experimental results indicated strong relationships between the dominant frequencies of heart motion with RV and ECG. The prediction algorithm revealed a high steady state accuracy, with the root mean square (RMS) errors in the range of 82 to 162 ?m for a 300-second interval, less than half of that of the best competitor. Conclusion The proposed multimodality prediction algorithm is promising for practical use in robotic assisted beating heart surgery, considering its capability of providing highly accurate predictions in long horizons.

AB  - Abstract Studies showed that co-transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) offered greater therapeutic effects but little is known regarding the effects of human Wharton's jelly derived MSCs on HSC expansion and red blood cell (RBC) generation in vitro. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs on HSC expansion and differentiation. HSCs were co-cultured with MSCs or with 10% MSCs-derived conditioned medium, with HSCs cultured under standard medium served as a control. Cell expansion rates, number of mononuclear cell post-expansion and number of enucleated cells post-differentiation were evaluated. HSCs showed superior proliferation in the presence of MSC with mean expansion rate of 3.5???108?±?1.8???107 after day 7 compared to the conditioned medium and the control group (8.9???107?±?1.1???108 and 7.0???107?±?3.3???106 respectively, P?<?0.001). Although no significant differences in RBC differentiation were observed between groups at passage IV, the number of enucleated cell was greater compared to earlier passages, indicating successful RBC differentiation. Cord blood-derived CD34+ HSCs can be greatly expanded by co-culturing with MSCs without affecting the RBC differentiation capability, suggesting the importance of direct MSC-HSCs contact in HSC expansion and RBC differentiation.

AB  - Abstract Following complete optic nerve injury in a lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons regenerate but fail to restore retinotectal topography unless animals are trained on a visual task (Beazley et al. [ 1997] J Comp Neurol 370:105?120, [2003] J Neurotrauma 20:1263?1270). Here we show that incomplete injury, which leaves some RGC axons intact, restores normal topography. Strict RGC axon topography allowed us to preserve RGC axons on one side of the nerve (projecting to medial tectum) while lesioning those on the other side (projecting to lateral tectum). Topography and response properties for both RGC axon populations were assessed electrophysiologically. The majority of intact RGC axons retained appropriate topography in medial tectum and had normal, consistently brisk, reliable responses. Regenerate RGC axons fell into two classes: those that projected topographically to lateral tectum with responses that tended to habituate and those that lacked topography, responded weakly, and habituated rapidly. Axon tracing by localized retinal application of carbocyanine dyes supported the electrophysiological data. RGC soma counts were normal in both intact and axotomized RGC populations, contrasting with the 30% RGC loss after complete injury. Unlike incomplete optic nerve injury in mammals, where RGC axon regeneration fails and secondary cell death removes many intact RGC somata, lizards experience a ?win?win? situation: intact RGC axons favorably influence the functional outcome for regenerating ones and RGCs do not succumb to either primary or secondary cell death.

AB  - Abstract Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is thought to exert protective and regenerative effects on neurons following spinal cord injury (SCI), although the mechanism of these effects is not well understood. The use of FGF1 as a therapeutic agent is limited by its lack of physicochemical stability and its limited capacity to cross the blood-spinal cord barrier. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of FGF1 in spinal cord following SCI significantly reduced tissue loss, protected neurons in the ventricornu, ameliorated pathological morphology of the lesion, dramatically improved tissue recovery via neuroprotection, and promoted axonal regeneration and remyelination both in vivo and in vivo. In addition, the autophagy and the expression levels of PRDX1 (an antioxidant protein) were induced by AAV-FGF1 in PC12 cells after H2O2 treatment. Furthermore, the autophagy levels were not changed in PRDX1-suppressing cells that were treated by AAV-FGF1. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF1 improves functional recovery mainly through inducing PRDX1 expression to increase autophagy and anti-ROS activity after SCI.
