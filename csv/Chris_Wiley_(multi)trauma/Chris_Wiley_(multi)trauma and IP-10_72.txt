AB  - Abstract A variety of seven nonionic, one amphoteric and, one anionic surfactant that are applied or investigated as surfactants in drug formulation, were analyzed for their capacity to modulate carrier-mediated transport by efflux pumps. Two cell lines, murine monocytic leukemia cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably overexpresssing human multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), were used as test systems. The modulation of P-gp and of MRP2 function was studied by the reversal of rhodamine 123 and of methylfluorescein-glutathione conjugate transport, respectively. Mechanisms that were not transporter related and could lead to misinterpretations were identified, such as probe quenching, probe encapsulation by micelles, and membrane damage. P-gp-mediated rhodamine 123 transport was inhibited by five nonionic surfactants in a concentration-dependent manner and in the order TPGS?>?Pluronic PE8100?>?Cremophor EL?>?Pluronic PE6100?≈?Tween 80. In contrast, none of the surfactants showed a significant inhibition of MRP2-mediated efflux in Madin-Darby canine kidney/MRP2 cells. In conclusion, the results indicate that surfactants demonstrate a transporter-specific interaction, rather than unspecific membrane permeabilization. The present analysis offers insight in the possible mechanisms of surfactant interactions with biological membranes and could help to identify specific drug formulations. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 92:1250?1261, 2003

AB  - Background and Purpose Cerebral vasospasm and neuronal apoptosis after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in SAH patients. So far, single-target agents have not prevented its occurrence. Memantine, a non-competitive NMDA re3ceptor antagonist, is known to alleviate brain injury and vasospasm in experimental models of SAH. Impairment of NO availability also contributes to vasospasm. Recently, we designed and synthesized a memantine nitrate MN-08, which has potent dual functions: neuroprotection and vasodilation. Here, we have tested the therapeutic effects of MN-08 in animal models of SAH. Experimental Approach Binding to NMDA receptors (expressed in HEK293 cells), NO release and vasodilator effects of MN-08 were assessed in vitro. Therapeutic effects of MN-08 were investigated in vivo, using rat and rabbit SAH models. Key Results MN-08 bound to the NMDA receptor, slowly releasing NO in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, MN-08 relaxed the pre-contracted middle cerebral artery ex vivo and increased blood flow velocity in small vessels of the mouse cerebral cortex. It did not, however, lower systemic blood pressure. In an endovascular perforation rat model of SAH, MN-08 improved the neurological scores and ameliorated cerebral vasospasm. Moreover, MN-08 also alleviated cerebral vasospasm in a cisterna magna single-injection model in rabbits. MN-08 attenuated neural cell apoptosis in both rat and rabbit models of SAH. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of MN-08 was greater than that of memantine. Conclusion and Implications MN-08 has neuroprotective potential and can ameliorate vasospasm in experimental SAH models.

AB  - Abstract The ideal stem cell for use in functional tissue engineering needs to be abundantly available, harvested with minimal morbidity, differentiated reliably down various pathways and able to be transplanted safely and efficaciously. Adult human adipose tissue contains a population of mesenchymal stem cells, termed ?adipose-derived stem cells? (ASC), which seem to fulfil most, if not all, of these criteria. ASC can be harvested readily, safely, and in relative abundance by modern liposuction techniques. They are capable of differentiating into other mesenchymal tissue types, including adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes and osteoblasts. They also show angiogenic properties, with recent evidence of a potential role in healing radiotherapy-damaged tissue, possibly due to their secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. Similarly, they may have a role in healing chronic wounds, and as such are being investigated in phase 1 trials for their ability to aid healing of recurrent Crohn?s fistulae. Subsequently they have a wide range of potential clinical uses in all fields of surgery. This article reviews the current and potential clinical applications of ASC in relation to surgery, as well as methods for their isolation, differentiation and molecular characterization.

AB  - Summary Development of an anesthetic protocol for any ophthalmic patient involves not only appropriate anesthetic drug selection, but also a management plan to ensure an optimal postoperative outcome. This requires knowledge of the patient's physical status and the specific ophthalmic procedure to be performed. It also requires familiarity with ophthalmic physiology and the effects of current ophthalmic medications. Selection of an anesthetic protocol for ophthalmic surgery should include consideration of the effects on intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil size, globe position, tear production, and the potential for initiation of the oculocardiac reflex (OCR) during surgical manipulation of the globe. Pupil size as an indicator of anesthetic depth is not reliable. Topical ophthalmic preparations are concentrated medications that may cause systemic side-effects, especially when administered to very small patients. The electroretinogram (ERG) is a widely used electrodiagnostic test in veterinary ophthalmology, with the flash ERG (FERG) being most useful in detecting diffuse retinal disorders.

AB  - Aspects of peri-operative management, amputation level and rehabilitation of the lower limb amputee are reported in the context of a review of a rehabilitation service for amputees which includes an integrated prosthetic service. Two hundred admissions were reviewed and some complex cases described. It is concluded that: a very close liaison between the surgeon and the rehabilitation team (ideally with pre-operative consultation) is in the patient's best interests; any person previously walking (or a potential walker) should be considered for a trial of prosthetic walking; an integrated prosthetic service enhances the efficiency of the rehabilitation service; and that modification of the current Artificial Limb Scheme to allow manufacture of first definitive limbs in prosthetic rehabilitation units would further enhance service to patients.

AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To compare the anatomical outcomes of different extents of internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in idiopathic macular hole surgery. Methods Prospective, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. A total of 121 eyes of 121 patients with idiopathic macular hole underwent pars plana vitrectomy, and peeling of the ILM with a diameter of two disk diameters (DD) or 4DD based on randomization. The main outcome was the proportion of eyes with complete hole closure at 12 months. The second outcome was the hole closure grading stratified by macular hole closure index (MHCI) at each visit. Results At 12 months, there was no significant difference in anatomical outcomes with complete closure achieved in 52 (82.5%) of 63 eyes in the 2DD group and 53 (91.4%) of 58 eyes in the 4DD group (p = 0.15). For subjects with MHCI ≤0.5 (n = 24), complete closure rate was significantly lower in the 2DD group compared to the 4DD group (p = 0.012; 18.2% versus 75.9%, respectively). Average BCVA was lower in 2DD group than 4DD group (p = 0.014). By contrast, when MHCI was >0.5, the complete closure rate between the two groups showed no significant difference: 96.2% (50 patients) versus 95.6% (43 patients), respectively (p = 0.185). Conclusion In patients with idiopathic full-thickness macular hole and MHCI ≤0.5, a larger ILM peel of 4DD tends to achieve better anatomical outcomes than a more limited 2DD peel.

AB  - Objective.? To measure Intensive Care Unit Research coordinator job satisfaction and importance and to identify priorities for role development. Background.? Research coordinator numbers are growing internationally in response to increasing clinical research activity. In Australia, 1% of registered nurses work principally in research, many as Research coordinators. Internationally, the Association of Clinical Research Professionals currently has 6536 certified Research coordinators in 13 countries, with likely additional large numbers practicing without the voluntary certification. Research coordinators are almost always nurses, but little is know about this emerging specialty. Design.? Cross-sectional study using anonymous self-report questionnaire. Methods.? After ethics approval, the McCloskey?Mueller Satisfaction Scale and McCloskey?Mueller Importance Scale were administered via the Internet. The sample was 49 (response rate 71%) Research coordinators from the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Unit Research coordinators? Interest Group. Results.? Research coordinators were satisfied with structural aspects of the position working business hours; flexibility of working hours; high levels of responsibility and control over their work. Dissatisfaction was expressed regarding: remuneration and recognition; compensation for weekend work; salary package; career advancement opportunities; and childcare facilities. Conclusions.? High priorities for role development are those rated highly important but with much lower satisfaction. These are: compensation for weekend call-out work; salary and remuneration package; recognition by management and clinicians; career advancement opportunities; departmental research processes; encouragement and feedback; and number of working hours. Relevance to clinical practice.? Increasing numbers of nurses have been attracted to this clinically based research position. These data contribute to the understanding and development of the role.
