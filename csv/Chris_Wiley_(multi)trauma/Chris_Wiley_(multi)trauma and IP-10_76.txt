AB  - Ageing is associated with a slow, but progressive muscle weakness, which is largely attributable to muscle wasting. A diminished function of satellite cells at old age may hamper preservation and repair from (contraction)-induced injury and contribute to the age-related muscle wasting. Satellite cell function may be affected by circulating factors, as muscle regeneration in old mice sharing the circulation of young mice is not impaired. Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in old organisms may be that environmental factor. Indeed, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) negatively affects the muscle regenerating capacity. TNFα destabilizes MyoD, a muscle-specific transcription factor involved in satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, and induces apoptosis of satellite cells, particularly at old age. Here it is proposed that some of these effects are mediated by TNFα-induced expression of inhibitors of differentiation proteins. Yet, the increase in TNFα during the normal inflammatory response helps, rather than impairs, the repair process. This apparent contradiction may be resolved by the fact that the effects of TNFα are concentration and time dependent. Thus, the negative effect of systemic inflammation on muscle strength at old age may only become apparent when it exceeds a certain threshold and persists for a prolonged period.

AB  - Abstract Astrocytes are involved in non-cell-autonomous pathogenic cascades in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, their role is still debated. We show that astrocytic NF-?B activation drives microglial proliferation and leukocyte infiltration in the SOD1 (G93A) ALS model. This response prolongs the presymptomatic phase, delaying muscle denervation and decreasing disease burden, but turns detrimental in the symptomatic phase, accelerating disease progression. The transition corresponds to a shift in the microglial phenotype showing two effects that can be dissociated by temporally controlling NF-?B activation. While NF-?B activation in astrocytes induced a Wnt-dependent microglial proliferation in the presymptomatic phase with neuroprotective effects on motoneurons, in later stage, astrocyte NF-?B-dependent microglial activation caused an accelerated disease progression. Notably, suppression of the early microglial response by CB2R agonists had acute detrimental effects. These data identify astrocytes as important regulators of microglia expansion and immune response. Therefore, stage-dependent microglia modulation may be an effective therapeutic strategy in ALS.

AB  - Practitioners working in limited resourced field conditions are often confronted with patients suffering from a myriad of exceptionally challenging medical conditions in the face of limited medical supplies and staff, as well as no options for referral. This chapter presents practical treatment protocols for commonly observed medical conditions based on accumulated field experience from veterinarians working in the field.

AB  - Comparatively few cases of mycetoma (?Madura foot?) have been reported in Australia, and only one caused by Nocardia brasiliensis. We report two Aboriginal women from remote communities in central Australia who presented with longstanding mycetomas caused by this organism. Difficulties in diagnosis substantially delayed commencement of effective treatment, illustrating the need to consider this condition in chronic suppurative skin infection.

AB  - Background:? Treatment of postoperative peritonitis (POP) necessitates adequate control of the source of peritoneal contamination. For most patients, a surgical approach to this requires reoperation to restore intestinal continuity. The aim of this study was to audit our results for the surgical treatment of POP. Methods:? Medical records of patients treated for POP using a standardized surgical protocol in a dedicated intensive care unit at the Saint-Antoine Hospital between 1995 and 2003 were reviewed. The aim of the study was to consider the effectiveness of our surgical protocol in the eradication of all sources of peritoneal contamination in patients presenting with POP. Results:? There were 87 patients (34 women, mean age of 58.4?±?14.7) with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 17.2?±?4.7 (median 16.5, range 9?28). Eight patients died and there were complications in 60 patients. Nine patients of the 79 survivors either did not require or could not have an operation to restore intestinal continuity. Intestinal continuity was re-established through a parastomal incision for 26 patients, whereas 44 patients required a further laparotomy. Two patients of the latter group died and 11 patients had a complication. It was not possible to restore intestinal continuity at laparotomy for one patient. Conclusion:? An aggressive surgical approach, as reported in this series, including stoma formation whenever possible, diversion or intubation, provides effective control of the source of peritoneal contamination. Restoration of intestinal continuity is possible in most patients. The overall mortality rate for this treatment is 11.5%.

AB  - Abstract The linkage of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of L-glutamate receptor to the nitric oxide (NO)/3?,5?-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) intracellular signalling system was investigated in murine neocortical cultures by examining the effects of NMDA antagonists, NO synthase inhibitors, and drugs targeting second messenger systems on NMDA-stimulated synthesis of cGMP. NMDA-stimulated synthesis of cGMP was time- and concentration-dependent, and inhibited by competitive (LY 274614, 100 ?M) and non-competitive NMDA antagonists (MK-801 30 ?M, 7-chlorokynurenate 100 ?M, and ifenprodil 100 ?M). NO synthase inhibitors (NG -nitro-L-arginine, KN-62, diphenyleneiodonium) and LY 83583, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, all inhibited NMDA-stimulated cGMP synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner, demonstrating its dependence on the two enzymes. Phorbol 12-myristyl 13-acetate (0.1 ?M), arachidonic acid (1 ?M), and thapsigargin (10 ?M) produced approximately 50% inhibition of NMDA-induced cGMP synthesis. These observations demonstrate that all domains of the NMDA receptor-complex and of NO synthase are active in neocortical neuronal cultures, and that the essential NO/cGMP signalling system has complex interactions with other second messengers. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
