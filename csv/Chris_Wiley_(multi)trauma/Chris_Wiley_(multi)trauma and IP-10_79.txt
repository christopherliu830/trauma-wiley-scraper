AB  - A 51-year-old female presented with agminate flesh-colored, slightly hyperkeratotic papules, 3?5?mm in diameter, on her upper back and to a lesser extent on the upper chest, neck and forehead. The papules were centered around the hair follicles and several showed mild perifollicular erythema. Clinical impression was keratosis pilaris with an unusual distribution or follicular mucinosis. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), begun several months previously, along with potassium supplements. Histologic findings revealed mild interface dermatitis with rare individually necrotic keratinocytes and mild pigment incontinence, a superficial and mid perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with marked dermal mucin deposition and extravasated erythrocytes. No definitive basement membrane thickening was present. Laboratory investigation revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640; anti-double stranded DNA and anti-histone antibody titers were normal. Following discontinuance of HCTZ and addition of topical steroids, her eruption slowly resolved. Taken together, these findings are those of a new cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced lupus-like eruption. We have named it drug-induced follicular lupus-like eruption to reflect the drug-induced counterpart of the newly described follicular lupus erythematosus.

AB  - We have undertaken a review of the Massachusetts General Hospital experience of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD). Twelve cases were identified, and the dermatopathologic features of lesional skin biopsies were examined. We looked systematically at nine parameters and graded each on a scale of 0 (minimal or none) to 3 (highest or most): 1) extent of fibrocytic proliferation, 2) extent of collagen thickening, 3) extent of vascularity, 4) extent of pannicular involvement, 5) extent of elastolysis, 6) presence of mucin, 7) presence of calcification, 8) presence of giant cells, and 9) presence of inflammation. Results demonstrate that fibrocytic proliferation, collagen thickening, inflammation, and vascularity most commonly were classified as grade 1?2; mucin deposition and elastolysis varied from 0?2; pannicular involvement ranged from 1?3; nearly all had calcification grade of 0, and there were no giant cells detected in any of the twelve cases. Comparing our results to published reports suggests that there are some interesting observations. Our cases tended to be less fibrocellular, have less mucin, and have more vascularity than the initial 14 cases described by Cowper et?al (2001). The implications of the dermatopathologic findings for clinical course and prognosis are currently being evaluated.

AB  - A 61-year-old female presented with blurry vision. Questioning revealed ?Flu-like? symptoms preceding the blurry vision by two weeks. An ophthalmologist diagnosed anterior granulomatous dermatitis, which improved with prednisolone drops. One month later, an ?itchy rash? and constitutional symptoms including fever, night sweats, and weight loss were reported. Physical examination revealed a viral-type maculopapular eruption over the trunk and proximal extremities. A few weeks later, repeat examination showed progression to a diffuse, reddish-brown, slightly edematous, papular eruption. Lymphadenopathy was not present. Laboratory data revealed a normochromic normocytic anemia, a polyclonal gammopathy, and an elevated ESR. Punch biopsies on two occasions showed a proliferation of mononucleated and multinucleated histiocytic cells with abundant pink cytoplasm. Emperipolesis was easily demonstrated. A background of plasma cells and small lymphocytes were noted. Stains for organisms were negative, and polarizable material was not present. By immunohistochemistry, histiocytes marked with S-100 but were negative for CD1a. A diagnosis of cutaneous Rosai Dorfman was made. The cutaneous symptoms improved over six months without medical therapy. Cutaneous Rosai Dorfman disease with constitutional symptoms and laboratory evidence of systemic involvement but without lymphadenopathy has not been previously described. This unusual case suggests that a wider spectrum of disease presentation may exist.

AB  - An 11-year-old adopted male presented with deforming scalp and bilateral posterior auricular nodules, joint contractures, and gingival hypertrophy. Histopathologic examination of the skin nodules revealed a normal epidermis with areas of extracellular eosinophilic ground substance surrounding benign spindle-shaped (myo)fibroblasts in the dermis and subcutis, alternating with hyalinized, acellular zones. The spindle cells did not show cytologic atypia. A diagnosis of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) was given. The patient had been seen multiple times in the past for similar recurring, disfiguring dermal and subcutaneous nodules. The patient had a history of osteolytic lesions of the distal radius and ulna and hyaline deposition involving the sigmoid colon and rectum. JHF is a rare autosomal recessive hyalinosis with mutations of the Capillary Morphogenesis Gene-2 (CMG-2) at chromosome 4q21, a region that encodes a binding protein that concatenates capillary collagen IV to laminin. Other genetic abnormalities include mutations in dermal collagen (types I and III). Disease onset occurs early in life. Organ involvement is an ominous sign usually resulting in death during infancy or early childhood. Surgery is the only presently available treatment.

AB  - A 34-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia underwent induction chemotherapy with cytarabine (Ara-c) and idarubicin. Seven days later, while on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, she simultaneously developed fever coupled with painful, pruritic, and erythematous plaques on the face, neck, and chest along with marked edema and erythema of both palms and one sole. With negative blood cultures and a skin biopsy showing epithelial cell vacuolar degeneration and neutrophilic infiltrates surrounding eccrine gland coils, a diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) was rendered. Treatment with oral dapsone rapidly cleared the eruption. During her first consolidation with Ara-C and idarubicin four weeks later, a similar febrile cutaneous eruption occurred and again dapsone therapy led to resolution. For subsequent consolidation courses, pre-medication with dapsone was instituted and the patient remained eruption-free. NEH is a rare and often misdiagnosed disorder. Multiple chemotherapy medications have been implicated as etiologic agents including Ara-c, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, bleomycin, and mitoxantrone. Current oncologic induction-consolidation protocols carry the potential for recurrent NEH in predisposed patients. As this is only the second report of prophylactic dapsone therapy for NEH, further investigation into this topic is warranted.

AB  - Background: Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD), can be strikingly similar, if not indistinguishable, histologically from scleromyxedema. Both disorders consist of a dermal and subcutaneous proliferation of fibroblast-like cells with mucin production. NFD has been shown to contain an increased number of dual positive CD34 and procollagen cells, as well as an increased number of factor XIIIa positive cells. To our knowledge, there has been no direct comparison between the histologic and immunophenotypic properties of scleromyxedema and NFD. Design: Nine biopsies from eight cases of NFD and eight biopsies from eight cases of scleromyxedema were identified. Standard immunohistochemical techniques for antibodies toward CD34, procollagen I, CD31, SMA, and factor XIIIa were applied. A colloidal iron stain was used to evaluate for dermal mucin. Amount of antibody expression and mucin production were then evaluated using a grading scale of 0?3. Results: Both NFD and scleromyxedema were found to have similar immunophenotypic expression. Both demonstrated increased numbers of CD34 and procollagen-positive fibroblast-like cells, as well as increased numbers of factor XIIIa positive cells. Increased vessels and stromal mucin were identified in both diseases without significant differences. Conclusions: Although scleromyxedema and NFD are clinically distinct diseases, their? morphologic and immunophenotypic appearances are likely to be similar.

AB  - An 81 yo male presented with several asymptomatic firm 1?5?cm red purple plaques on the trunk and lower extremities associated with a mild pancytopenia. Histological examination revealed a diffuse, monotonous dermal infiltrate of atypical medium sized cells with fine chromatin and scanty cytoplasm. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated positivity for CD 45, CD43, CD4, Bcl-2, and TdT; but was negative for cytokeratin, melan-A, CD30 and hematopoietic lineage specific markers. A subsequent bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a dense population of cells that were morphologically consistent with blasts. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed lesional cells that expressed CD56, CD4, CD7, CD5, HLA-DR and TdT. However, lineage specific markers for B-cells (CD19, CD20, cCD79a, and CD10), T-cells (sCD3 and cCD3), and myeloid cells (CD13, CD33, CD117, cCD13, CD14, CD41, CD61, myeloperoxidase, and alpha napthyl butyrate esterase) were not expressed. Molecular studies by PCR exhibited no evidence of T-cell receptor or heavy chain gene rearrangements. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a primary cutaneous blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Blastic natural killer cell lymphomas are characterized by a high incidence of cutaneous involvement and an aggressive clinical course. Our patient responded dramatically to one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy with resolution of his cutaneous tumors.

AB  - Although subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma is considered an aggressive form of lymphoma, some patients manifest a long waxing and waning phase unaccompanied by constitutional symptoms. Magro et?al (2004) applied the term ?atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis (ALLP)? to this distinctive form of lymphocytic panniculitis. Eight ALLP patients (five females and three males, mean age: 34.0?±?12.5) were encountered from Jun 1999 to Nov 2003 at GyeongSang National University Hospital in Korea. Five patients (62.5%) had skin lesions only and oral prednisone therapies were done. Two of five had no relapse but three showed a waxing and waning course till now. In three patients (37.5%) presenting cytopenias and fevers, chemotherapies were done with prednisone, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicine, bleomycin and/or adriamycin. Two of three led to complete resolution till now and included only one patient with clonal T-cell receptor-gamma rearrangements. In seven patients, serum EBV antibody studies were performed. Six of them suggested EBV reactivation state and one was asymptomatic EBV carrier. In three patients, tissues EBV ISH were done and all were positive to EBER and lytic probe.

AB  - Cutaneous small blue cell tumors are relatively uncommon neoplasms whose differential includes primary adnexal, neuroendocrine and lymphoproliferative tumors, as well as metastatic lesions. Another entity to be considered in the differential is Ewing?s sarcoma (ES)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). We present a 19-year-old female who developed a solitary, subcutaneous mass on her back. Histology revealed a poorly differentiated, cellular, nodular neoplasm of small, blue cells containing round to ovoid, vesicular nuclei with indistinct nucleoli and scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumor cells were strongly immunoreactive for antibodies to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Cam 5.2 and CD99. Overall, the lesion resembled an malignant spiradenoma (spiradenocarcinoma). CD99 reactivity prompted analysis with dual-color interphase FISH for translocations involving (22q12), which was positive, a sensitive marker for ES/PNET. Our case demonstrates that a diagnosis of ES/PNET should be considered in the differential of primary cutaneous blue cell tumors. These lesions are difficult to distinguish from other cutaneous small blue cell tumors due to their rarity and because the diagnosis is often not considered at this site.

AB  - We present the case of a 27 year-old female with a linear array of brown keratotic papules with a raised nodule within, located in the right mid upper inner thigh. A biopsy of the nodule showed a superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequent excision of the entire lesion showed an epidermal nevus without residual carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas developing within an epidermal nevus constitute an unusual association, mostly occurring in long standing lesions of elderly patients. Other epithelial neoplasms described arising within epidermal nevi include basal cell carcinomas, malignant eccrine tumors and keratoacanthomas. Although our patient did not have an identifiable epidermal nevus syndrome, the presence of a squamous cell carcinoma within an epidermal nevus in a young person suggests increased susceptibility to tumor development. Moreover, chromosomal aberrations have been described in epidermal nevi, including chromosomal breakage and variegated translocation mosaicism. We suggest that the presence of an epidermal nevus should alert the clinician for the potential development of a malignant neoplasm within it, including squamous cell carcinoma, even in the absence of an identifiable hamartoma-neoplasm syndrome.

AB  - Although some classic differences exist histologically between malignant and benign CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin, the distinction can only be made by correlation with the patient?s clinical course. There has been limited investigation into the genetic abnormalities seen in this class of disorders. Cutaneous ALCL has been shown to exhibit increased expression of JunB, but differences in expression of JunB between c-ALCL and benign CD30-positive cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders have yet to be evaluated. A study to determine the prevalence of JunB coexpression in CD30-positive cells of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and benign CD30-positive disorders of the skin was undertaken. The two c-ALCL cases had an average of 98.3%(+/? 0.7%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB and the seven benign CD30-positive disorders exhibited an average of 88.9%(+/? 7.4%) of CD30-positive cells coexpressing JunB. There was a trend towards lower JunB and CD30 coexpression with benign CD30 lesions compared to cutaneous ALCL, but with our limited sample size, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Further investigation is needed to more fully evaluate the sensitivity of the expression of JunB and other proteins as markers for clinical behavior in CD-30 positive lymphoproliferative disorders.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was admitted to the hospital for change in mental status. She had a splenectomy five years prior to admission. The white blood cell count was 154,000 cells/microliter with 95% lymphocytes and 4% neutrophils. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis and Candida krusei. She developed a wrist lesion at the site of a previous arterial line. The lesion had a striking resemblance to a bulls-eye, with three distinct concentric zones. A bedside touch preparation rapidly processed with Periodic Acid Schiff staining demonstrated a single intact aseptate broad hypha. Punch biopsy specimens demonstrated broad, aseptate hyphae throughout the dermis and subcutis invading both blood vessels and interstitum. A skin biopsy specimen sent for fungal culture grew Rhizopus arrhizus. Cutaneous zygomycosis is a rare, devastating disease that can occur in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. This case illustrates a distinct morphology, which we have coined the ?bulls-eye infarct of cutaneous zygomycosis?. Recognition of this unique appearance allows a rapid bedside diagnosis of this life threatening infection. To our knowledge, this morphology has been reported only twice in the medical literature.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of anaplastic large cell lymphoma can be remarkably deceptive. A 41-year-old female presented with fever, productive cough, fatigue, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy. She had been camping in the Southwest, and had visited some bat caves. At the same time, her son developed a similar illness. The patient?s white cell count was 23,000, and radiology demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Extensive workup for bacterial and fungal organisms were noncontributory, however, a viral exposure could not be excluded. The patient subsequently developed an umbilicated vesicular rash on her torso. Initial skin biopsies showed a perivascular mixed infiltrate, with no evidence of microorganisms. After clinical progression, a subsequent skin biopsy demonstrated a perivascular infiltrate of large mononuclear cells, with vesicular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, immunophenotypically characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. With elucidation of the process, lymphomatous involvement of the blood, pleural fluid, CSF, and nodal tissue was identified. Despite chemotherapy, the patient passed away. Exposure to an infectious agent may have unmasked the patient?s lymphoma.

AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.

The intraepidermal extension involved not only the conjunctival epithelium but also the overlying skin with subsequent extension into the dermis. The discussion will include diagnostic, both clinical and microscopic, considerations along with comparison to mammary Paget?s disease. Just as mammary Paget?s disease, which originates from the glands in the dermis eventuating in the seeding of the overlying epidermis, so too does sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Accordingly, just as mammary Paget?s disease is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition, so too is sebaceous carcinoma.

A 54-year-old white female was treated for a BCC of the right thigh. Pathologic examination revealed an otherwise classical BCC that demonstrated granular positivity for chromogranin. Six years later the patient developed a right inguinal lymphadenopathy diagnosed as metastatic BCC with squamous changes. The metastatic BCC showed partial peripheral palisading and a trabecular pattern. Two years later the patient underwent a right nephrectomy due to obstruction of the right ureter by metastatic BCC. After another four years the patient came back with extensive involvement of the appendiceal wall and right ovary by a diffusely infiltrating metastatic basaloid and trabecular carcinoma. This time the tumor had many histologic features of MCC and showed strong positivity for chromogranin and also for CK20 and NSE. Electron microscopy revealed neurosecretory granules. This case is an example of a chromogranin positive basal cell carcinoma of the skin, which transformed during multiple recurrences into a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with features of Merkel cell tumor, demonstrating the potential for cross differentiation among skin tumors.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - A 77-year-old white female presented with a two to three year history of an asymptomatic skin-colored papule on the right upper arm. Examination revealed a 7?mm???7?mm soft papule, supplanted by a smaller soft papule. Clinical differential diagnosis included an adnexal tumor, neurofibroma, and dermal nevus. Histological examination revealed a sparse proliferation of spindle and stellate-shaped cells within the dermis, including many large cells with bizarre shaped nuclei. Focal multinucleated giant cells were present as well. The background stroma was both collagenous and myxoid, the later being highlighted by diffuse colloidal iron staining. The spindle and stellate-shaped cells demonstrated CD34 and vimentin positivity. Factor XIIIa was focally positive. Actin and S-100 staining were negative. These changes were thought to be consistent with a myxoid pleomorphic fibroma. This is a rare tumor, with only a few reported cases of myxoid variants in the literature to date. The staining pattern of this tumor, along with others in the reported literature, suggest a mesenchymal, fibroblastic origin.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.
