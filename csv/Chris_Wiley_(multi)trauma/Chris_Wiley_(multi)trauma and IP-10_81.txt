AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma patients without lymph node metastases (Stage II) have a variable five-year survival. The influence of falsely negative lymph nodes on this variability is unknown. DESIGN: The Poisson distribution describes the probability of finding no positive lymph nodes when a certain number are examined. Using this model, we analysed lymph node dissection results from 780 patients with melanoma and published survival results for Stage II patients. RESULTS: In the 294 patients without positive nodes, 18% had fewer than 7 nodes examined. The Poisson probability of finding no positive nodes when 1 to 6 were examined ranged from 0.4 to to 0.8 (mean 0.6). We partitioned survival for stage II into two categories: those with truly negative nodes with a five-year survival of 80% and those with a five-year survival matching Stage III (46%). The observed five-year survival of 77% in Stage II patients implied that the fraction with false negative nodes was also 18%, which corresponded with the subgroup with fewer than 7 nodes examined. CONCLUSION: The Poisson model suggests that the variable survival in Stage II patients may reflect the incorrect staging of patients with stage III melanoma who have limited numbers of lymph nodes examined.

AB  - Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. On occasion, KS may histologically mimic pyogenic granulomas (PG), a common benign vascular tumor of the skin. Using immunoperoxidase stains, we examined 28 PG and 4 PG-like KS for HHV-8 to determine the specificity of positive staining in this setting. All PG-like KS demonstrated nuclear staining for HHV-8. No staining was identified in any of the PG. Furthermore, histologic criteria often used to differentiate between these two entities were not helpful in difficult cases. The only distinguishing features were the presence/absence of HHV-8 staining and, in some cases, clinical history. The presence of HHV-8 nuclear staining appears to be a specific marker for KS when comparing PG and PG-like KS. Given the lack of distinguishing morphologic criteria, we suggest performing immunoperoxidase stains for HHV-8 on any PG occurring in a clinically atypical setting.

AB  - CD99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the MIC2 gene, which is located on the short arm of both chromosome X and Y. This transmembrane protein was originally utilized in immunohistochemistry as a unique marker for Ewing sarcoma, other primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and more recently in a wide variety of tumors. It?s expression in malignant melanoma (MM) has not been well documented. A recent study at our institution demonstrated membranous staining in approximately 61% of primary MM. As CD99 is expressed by hematopoeitic cells, it has been proposed as a mechanism for lymphocytes to gain access to the vasculature.1 This study is designed to determine if CD99 expression in melanoma cells has a similar role using cases of metastatic MM from our archives. Our evaluation shows that 13 of 28 cases (46.4%) demonstrated membranous CD99 staining. A case of this magnitude has not been previously reported.? Reference: 1.

AB  - Texts and atlases have limitations when used to teach dermatopathology to trainees: they can be tedious and time-consuming to use, image detail is limited, text and figure legends can be ambiguous, and only a minor degree of image annotation (letters, arrows, lines outlining important features) is possible. A video screen recording software program (Camtasia Studio) has been used to create high quality digital audio and video dermatopathology tutorials. The screen recording program is started with the image window being recorded. Audio narration (USB digital microphone) is recorded along with live drawings of annotating lines outlining important histologic features, creating the effect of a ?digital chalkboard? being used by the instructor. Separate clips of each ?chalkboard annotation? with accompanying narration can be combined to create a seamless movie detailing each of the important histopathologic features leading to a specific dermatopathologic diagnosis. Video dermatopathology tutorials are extremely effective because they closely mimic instruction at the microscope. However, they offer the significant advantage of allowing remote teaching at any time or place convenient for the learner. Tutorials can be compressed into a variety of multimedia formats and streamed for web delivery or can be provided on CD for distribution.

AB  - Political risk analysis has become a more prominent part of the decision-making process for transnational corporations (TNCs), particularly where capital investments in developing countries are concerned. An increased awareness of the views taken by TNCs on political risk abroad will enable political leaders of developing countries to bargain more effectively. TNCs use various methods to assess political risks. Direct field visits by senior personnel, advice from senior local managers, panels of experts, and quantitative methods are four currently popular techniques. These techniques are often applied without adequate analysis. TNCs can control their exposure to political risk by joining with local firms, and through loan guarantees insurance, or multi-country financing of equity investments. Policymakers in developing countries can respond successfully to the increased awareness by TNCs of political risk assessment methods by emphasizing the political opportunities of investing in their countries. La place qu'occupe l'analyse des risques politiques dans le processus de décisions des sociétés transnationales est devenue plus importante, en particulier en ce qui concerne les investissements en capitaux dans les pays en développement. Une connaissance plus approfondie des points de vue de ces sociétés sur les risques politiques à l'étranger permettrait aux dirigeants politiques des pays en développement de mener leurs négociations d'une manière plus efficace. Les sociétés transnationales emploient diverses méthodes pour évaluer les risques politiques. Des inspections directes sur le terrain par un personnel supérieur, l'avis de cadres supérieurs nationaux, des groupes d'experts et des méthodes quantitatives constituent quatre techniques couramment utilisées. Ces techniques sont souvent dépourvues d'analyse adéquate. Les sociétés transnationales peuvent contrôler les risques politiques auxquelles elles s'exposent en s'associant aux firmes locales et par l'assurance de garantie de prêts ou le financement multinational des prises de participations. Les responsables des pays en développement peuvent répondre avec succès à la connaissance croissante des sociétés transnationales des méthodes d'évaluation de risques politiques en mettant l'emphase sur les opportunités politiques d'investissements dans leurs pays. El análisis del reisgo politico se ha convertido en una parte importante del proceso de toma de decisiones por parte de las compañias transnacionales (CT), en especial cuando se refiere a inversiones de capital en los países en desarrollo. Un mayor conocimiento de los puntos de vista de las CT sobre los riesgos en estos países permitirá a los líderes de los países en desarrollo a negociar con más efectividad. Las CT usan varios métodos para estimar el riesgo político. Visitas a los paises por ejecutivos de alto nivel, recomendaciones de ejecutivos locales, paneles de expertos y métodos cuantitativos, son cuatro métodos de los más comunmente usados. Estos métodos son a menudo usados sin mucho análisis. Las CT minimizan el riesgo político asociándose con compañías locales, a través de seguros de garantía sobre préstamos, o mediante financiamiento multinacional. Los líderes de los países en desarrollo pueden responder con éxito a los métodos de evaluación de riesgo de las CT enfatizando las oportunidades politicas de investir en sus países.

AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.

AB  - We present a 69-year-old woman with a sebaceous carcinoma of the left upper eyelid, which originated from the Meibomian gland of the tarsal plate. The intraepidermal extension involved not only the conjunctival epithelium but also the overlying skin with subsequent extension into the dermis. The discussion will include diagnostic, both clinical and microscopic, considerations along with comparison to mammary Paget?s disease. Just as mammary Paget?s disease, which originates from the glands in the dermis eventuating in the seeding of the overlying epidermis, so too does sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Accordingly, just as mammary Paget?s disease is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition, so too is sebaceous carcinoma.

AB  - We present here a case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with neuroendocrine features that has transformed into a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with various morphologic features of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). A 54-year-old white female was treated for a BCC of the right thigh. Pathologic examination revealed an otherwise classical BCC that demonstrated granular positivity for chromogranin. Six years later the patient developed a right inguinal lymphadenopathy diagnosed as metastatic BCC with squamous changes. The metastatic BCC showed partial peripheral palisading and a trabecular pattern. Two years later the patient underwent a right nephrectomy due to obstruction of the right ureter by metastatic BCC. After another four years the patient came back with extensive involvement of the appendiceal wall and right ovary by a diffusely infiltrating metastatic basaloid and trabecular carcinoma. This time the tumor had many histologic features of MCC and showed strong positivity for chromogranin and also for CK20 and NSE. Electron microscopy revealed neurosecretory granules. This case is an example of a chromogranin positive basal cell carcinoma of the skin, which transformed during multiple recurrences into a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with features of Merkel cell tumor, demonstrating the potential for cross differentiation among skin tumors.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - A 77-year-old white female presented with a two to three year history of an asymptomatic skin-colored papule on the right upper arm. Examination revealed a 7?mm???7?mm soft papule, supplanted by a smaller soft papule. Clinical differential diagnosis included an adnexal tumor, neurofibroma, and dermal nevus. Histological examination revealed a sparse proliferation of spindle and stellate-shaped cells within the dermis, including many large cells with bizarre shaped nuclei. Focal multinucleated giant cells were present as well. The background stroma was both collagenous and myxoid, the later being highlighted by diffuse colloidal iron staining. The spindle and stellate-shaped cells demonstrated CD34 and vimentin positivity. Factor XIIIa was focally positive. Actin and S-100 staining were negative. These changes were thought to be consistent with a myxoid pleomorphic fibroma. This is a rare tumor, with only a few reported cases of myxoid variants in the literature to date. The staining pattern of this tumor, along with others in the reported literature, suggest a mesenchymal, fibroblastic origin.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.

AB  - Mycosis fungoides with central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a rare event. Most cases evolve from progressive tumor stage skin disease or CD30 large cell transformation. Cases with CD 30 transformation can show CNS involvement without advanced skin disease. We report a 63 year-old woman with 6 year history of mycosis fungoides with patch and plaque stage disease who developed a single 2.5?cm tumor on the left chest without lymphadenopathy. Histology revealed a dense infiltrate of small atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei. Immunohistochemistry showed CD 4+, CD 43+ and CD 30- staining. Within 2 weeks she developed ataxia and right-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontal and brainstem masses. Stereotactic biopsy showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with large convoluted nuclei. The immunohistochemistry showed a population of CD 4+, CD 43+, Alk-1- cells with CD 30+ transformation. Gene rearrangement studies for the gamma T cell receptor on the skin patch and tumor as well as brain tumor failed to reveal a monoclonal population in any of the specimens. No other areas of involvement were found on complete staging. This case is an example of tumor stage MF with CD 30 transformation and CNS involvement.

AB  - The recognized breadth of dysplastic nevi has quickly shrunk. We now present very small dysplastic nevi below any described breadth. A cluster of mostly punched-out nevi derived from a single clinician who recognizes as ?atypical? even very small lesions was also assigned histologic dysplasia on architectural and cytologic basis. From 536 junctional nevi with dysplasia ranging from mild to moderate, 136 (25.3%) were 1?mm. in vitro or less while 371 (69.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Among 155 compound nevi with the same range of dysplasia, 19 (12.2%) were 1?mm or less and 95 (61.2%) were 1.1?2?mm. Moderate or, less so, severe atypia was even seen in more than half of either 18 junctional and 18 compound nevi of dysplastic type between 2.1 and 3?mm. While the above threshold for dysplasia may not be similar to the one than many dermatopathologists could use, it is still evident that sliding down our higher-grade nevi to meet milder degrees of perceived atypia in a more conservative diagnostic scale, the breadth of these nevi still remains minuscule in general. In sum, we adhere to the idea that dysplastic nevi are not only common but can be extremely small: ?bonsai nevi.?

AB  - Pilomatricoma is a distinctive tumor characterized by a dual population of proliferating germinative cells and shadow cells and is beleived to derive from the hair matrix. Rarely, benign and malignant adnexal tumors can show pilomaticoma-like or hair matrix differentiation. We present a 69-year-old man with a ruptured cystic nodule of the left cheek. Histology revealed a dermal tumor composed of nests of basaloid cells which manifested peripheral palisading and abortive hair papilla formation with a modified stroma and pilomatricoma-like areas. This lesion shares features of a trichogenic adnexal neoplasm with those of a tumor having hair matrical differentiation, and has been rarely reported under the designation ?follicular? basal cell carcinoma (BCC). This case illustrates an example of this unusual occurrence of hair matrix differentiation in a benign basaloid adnexal neoplasm as characterized by the presence of basaloid and shadow cells; the absence of individual cell necrosis and mitotic activity prompts us to doubt that it represents a form of nodular BCC, but rather it more likely reflects a hamartoma of the follicular anlage.

AB  - A 47-year-old sculptor presented with an ulcer on her neck. She is non-diabetic and had been on potassium iodide for hyperthyroidism. She developed a pruritic rash (?drug eruption), and her neck had been scratched repeatedly with papier-mache (PM)-covered fingers while she worked on PM sculptures for 3 consecutive months. Debrided material from neck ulcer revealed innumerable pieces of refractile PM in various shapes in the background of necrotic tissue and fibrinoid exudate, on polaroscopic examination of H&E sections. Stains for micro-organisms (for fungi, acid-fast bacilli, and actinomycosis) were negative. In an attempt to remove residual embedded PM, wide excision of the site and full-thickness skin graft was done. After initial successful take and healing, the area redeveloped an ulcer. Additional debridement and biopsy from the graft site showed PM clustered around the blood vessels in the reticular dermis. PM is a product of paper pulp commonly used in arts and crafts. Rare cases of lead exposure in PM workers have been reported in the literature, however, no cutaneous problems caused by PM have been reported to date.

AB  - Infantile digital fibromatosis (IDF), also called Reye tumor or inclusion body fibromatosis, is a benign proliferation of myofibroblasts, with characteristic perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The inclusions stain pink with hematoxylin-eosin, red with Masson?s trichrome, and purple with phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin. This intradermal neoplasm is formed by interlacing bundles of collagen and spindle cells. Positive immunohistochemical staining with vimentin, cytokeratin, desmin, and actin indicate myofibroblastic cell origin. Clinically, patients present at birth or infancy with asymptomatic smooth, flesh colored nodules, typically on lateral or dorsal digits. IDF is a benign neoplasm that may spontaneously regress and treatment is observation. Lesions recur in 60% of excisions; surgery is only recommended in cases of functional impairment or aggressive growth. We report three cases of IDF. The patients, ranging 8 months to 8 years old, presented with pink to flesh colored nodules on the feet and fingers. A spectrum of histological features was observed. All cases revealed dermal proliferation of spindle cells with blunt nuclei and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions. Pattern of spindle cells ranged from loose haphazard arrangement to well-organized interlacing bundles. The quantity of eosinophilic inclusions varied. For diagnostic and treatment purposes, all three patients underwent excision, with subsequent recurrence in two cases.

AB  - We report a 48-year-old male who presented with ulcerated plaques and nodules of the lower extremities. Skin biopsies revealed a dense lymphocytic infiltrate involving the dermis and the subcutis in a lobular and septal pattern. No overt cytological atypia was present. Notably, several features resembling lupus erythematosus were present, including vacuolar interface change and abundant dermal mucin deposition. The patient developed pulmonary nodules, and a lung biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial lymphoid infiltrate without overt atypia. The cutaneous and pulmonary lymphoid infiltrates showed similar immunohistochemical profiles: CD3+CD4?CD8+/?CD56+. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor gamma gene with similar migration patterns were identified from both locations. The patient developed fatal hemophagocytic syndrome, involving liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This case is amongst rare reports of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma (SPTCL) with systemic involvement.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.
