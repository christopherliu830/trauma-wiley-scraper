AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common primary cutaneous carcinomas, but on rare occasion, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from a distant site or solid organ can present as a cutaneous lesion. Most metastases to the skin present as dermal nodules or involve the dermal lymphatics, but when they are intimately associated with the epidermis, distinguishing the lesion as primary or metastatic may be extremely difficult and usually requires a clinical history or high index of suspicion. A 71-year-old woman presented with a history of breast carcinoma, status post radiation therapy and subsequent mastectomy. She developed multiple eruptive nodules over her mastectomy site, flank and back two years later. Histologically the lesions appeared to be arising from the surface epidermis and consisted of atypical, predominantly spindle cells, some of which streamed off of the basal layer of the epidermis. Following review of the mastectomy specimen material and performing additional immunohistochemical studies, it became clear that the origin of the carcinomas was metastatic from an underlying metaplastic breast carcinoma.

AB  - A 13 year-old boy presented with a six-month history of severe lip swelling. His past medical history was significant for eczema, multiple episodes of urticaria, and two episodes of anaphylaxis. Physical exam revealed severe cheilitis and labial angioedema. The cranial nerves were intact, and there was no evidence of a fissured tongue. A lip biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas throughout the dermis, with extension into the underlying skeletal muscle. Other features included dilated lymphatic channels, some closely approximating the granulomas, and a mild perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The epidermis was acanthotic with parakeratosis and focal acantholysis. Methenamine silver and acid-fast stains were negative. A laboratory work-up revealed an increased total eosinophil count, an increased serum IgE level, and a low complement C1q level. All other complement levels were normal. The patient also had an unremarkable chest x-ray and a normal angiotensin converting enzyme level. This case represents the monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), also known as cheilitis granulomatosa Meischer. MRS is classically known as a triad of granulomatous cheilitis, facial nerve palsy, and fissured tongue. The onset of granulomatous cheilitis typically precedes the other symptoms, and when present alone, it is known as the monosymptomatic form of MRS.

AB  - Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal genodermatosis characterized by the triad of fibrofolliculomas, trichodyscomas and acrochordons. The gene for BHD was localised to chromosome 17p11.2 and a germline insertion/deletion was identified to cause premature truncation of the BHD protein, folliculin. Patients carry increased risk for developing lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal carcinoma. Prompt diagnosis is important for patient clinical management. We encountered a 41 year-old white male, otherwise healthy, with classic clinical presentation of BHD, i.e. numerous firm, smooth, whitish papules covering his face and neck, which were developed after adolescence. There is no related family history. Nine biopsies were taken during the past 5 years. The following changes are present: markedly dilated hair follicles, telangiectasia in fibrosing stroma, and melanocytic nevus cells. Diagnoses of epidermal inclusion cyst, fibrous papules, and dermal nevus were given. However, some subtle but diagnostic histopathological features for fibrofolliculoma, perifolliculafibroma, and trichodyscoma were overlooked. Correct diagnosis was reached upon review of all the biopsies. Patient is currently undergoing genetic testing and clinical workups. We present this case to update our knowledge on this rare disease, particularly the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic pitfalls, in order to avoid the delay of correct diagnosis.

AB  - Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN) is a rare hamartomatous malformation of the eccrine duct which typically presents at birth or early in life. Multiple punctate pits and verrucous papules and plaques with nonfollicular hyperkeratotic spines are seen over the palms and soles and may extend to the distal extremities. A linear distribution may be present. A wide range of involvement has been reported in the literature, including bilateral systematized involvement. No systemic involvement has been linked to PEODDN to date. Histologic findings are characteristic and include a dilated eccrine acrosyringium with an overlying parakeratotic column or cornoid lamella. There is slight dyskeratosis and loss of the granular layer under the cornoid lamella. Here, we present a case of bilateral systematized PEODDN in an otherwise healthy, 18 year-old Hispanic female. Physical examination is notable for marked hypoplasia of the left breast with overlying verrucous papules and plaques. Multiple punch biopsies were performed and showed findings diagnostic of PEODDN. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive involvement of PEODDN reported in the literature to date and the only case with associated hypoplasia of the breast.

AB  - Clear cell hidradenoma is a benign eccrine tumor with nodular-cystic architecture, ductal differentiation and poroid cytology. Squamous islands occurring in eccrine neoplasms are classified into three types, according to their location, histologic characteristics and degrees of cellular atypia. Type I squamous islands resemble normal epidermis and are present in the superficial to middle portion of eccrine poromas. Type II squamous islands are localised in the deeper portion of eccrine poromas and show lumen formation suggestive of acrosyringeal differentiation. Type III squamous islands show atypical features and are limited to malignant eccrine tumors. A 55-year-old man was biopsied for a dermal nodule on his left arm. The initial shave biopsy revealed the surface of an intradermal cystic nodule with numerous whorls and horn pearls of squamatization, reminiscent?of a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; however, no cytologic atypia, necrosis or mitotic activity were identified; focal clear cell and ductal differentiation were also present. Complete excision revealed clear cell hidradenoma with extensive mixed type I and type II squamous islands. The presence of whorls and pearls of squamoid cells is a rare finding in clear cell hidradenoma that, moreover, in the setting of a superficial biopsy, may be a diagnostic pitfall.

AB  - Recently reported cases of CD4+ CD56+ hematologic malignancies with a strong predilection for the skin correspond to the neoplastic counterpart of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This rare, aggressive malignancy lacks pan-myeloid and pan-lymphoid markers and often presents with cutaneous lesions, splenomegaly, and involvement of lymph nodes and bone marrow. It has a poor prognosis, and many patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia. The proposed cellular origin is a CD56+ precursor cell related to plasmacytoid monocytes, which strongly expresses CD123 (IL-3Ra). We describe a 70 year-old man who presented with gray-brown truncal nodules and plaques, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. His bone marrow demonstrated malignant CD4+ CD56+ mononuclear cells. Histologic sections of skin lesions showed an atypical infiltrate extending into the deep reticular dermis. Immunohistochemical staining of these cells for CD4 was diffusely positive. Moreover, the infiltrate strongly expressed CD56 and CD123 but showed only patchy or negative staining for other T and B cell markers. The combination of the patient?s clinical presentation and biopsy results best fits the diagnosis of this newly characterized, distinct clinicopathologic entity described in recent literature as agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm, plasmacytoid dendritic cell acute leukemia, and tumor-forming accumulations of plasmacytoid monocytes associated with myeloid disorders.

AB  - Background: Recurrent nevi may histologically resemble malignant melanoma Design: Recurrent nevi with clinical history, original melanocytic neoplasm and recurrence were included. Proliferation marker Ki-67 was used when residual and recurrent nevus was present on the same slide. Results: There were 356 biopsies from 328 patients (ages 6 to 93 years (mean?=?31), female: male?=?255:101, time to recurrence 1?63 months (mean?=?7.85)). Sites: back (170), abdomen (46), arm (46), leg (34), head and neck (26), chest (26), and buttock (8). Initial biopsies: 208 nevi, 142 dysplastic nevi, 1 blue, 1 pigmented spindle cell, 2 Spitz nevi, and 2 melanomas in situ. 3 patterns of recurrence were observed: 1) junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with epidermal effacement and scar, 2) compound melanocytic proliferation with epidermal effacement and scar, and 3) junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with retained retiform epidermis. Recurrent and residual nevi had similar proliferation rates. Conclusion: Recurrent nevi occurred more commonly in females and on the trunk. Cytologic atypia, asymmetry, and retention of retiform epidermis were worrisome histologic features. Clinical history, effacement of the epidermis and limitation of changes to the scar, distinguished recurrence from melanoma. Low proliferation rate may be a useful adjunct to distinguish recurrent nevi from melanoma.

AB  - Although cutaneous Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) may show divergent differentiation including tubular/glandular, squamous, eccrine, and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, a diffuse glandular pattern is exceedingly rare. Herein, we present a case of MCC with prominent tubulo-glandular differentiation, which precluded a definitive diagnosis in the initial punch biopsy. The patient was a 43 year-old male with 5?6 weeks history of a rapidly growing plaque at his back. A punch biopsy revealed an infiltrating lesion consisting of tubulo-glandular structures lined by hyperchromatic basaloid cells, along with some angulated, basaloid tumor nests embedded in a desmoplastic stroma. Immunostains revealed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for chromogranin and BerEP4, variably positive for CK7 and CK5/6, but negative for CK20, synaptophysin, S-100, EMA, GCDFP-15, ER/PR, TTF1 and CEA. The reexcision specimen showed multifocal epidermotropism and typical finely stippled nuclear chromatin. Although the lack of CK20 staining is unusual, the histologic characteristics along with the remaining immunohistochemical studies favor the diagnosis of a primary cutaneous neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (MCC) over the variants of microcystic adnexal carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Our case illustrates that prominent glandular differentiation may occur in MCC, and sometime create difficulty in definitive diagnosis in small biopsy specimen.

AB  - We report a case of inflammatory stage vulvar lichen sclerosus et atrophicans (LSA) with histopathologic features simulating both patch stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and extramammary Paget?s disease. The patient is a 79-year-old woman with an erythematous plaque on her vulva. A punch biopsy was performed that revealed mild psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epidermis with spongiosis, marked interface vacuolar alteration, scattered individual necrotic keratinocytes and Civatte bodies. A band-like mixed inflammatory infiltrate was present in the papillary/upper dermis with prominent intraepidermal lymphocytes. Some intraepidermal lymphocytes showed atypical nuclear contours simulating the cells seen in MF. The presence of numerous intraepidermal epithelioid cells with a pagetoid distribution raised the possibility of extramammary Paget?s disease. A panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains showed a reactive lichenoid mixed population of lymphocytes with numerous intraepidermal Langerhans cells. This confirmed the diagnosis of the inflammatory stage of lichen sclerosus. The presence of prominent epithelioid Langerhans cells with activated small lymphocytes represents an immune response in LSA and could cause diagnostic confusion with neoplastic conditions. IHC staining can confirm cell type and rule out MF and extramammary Paget?s disease.

AB  - Background:? Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) is a condition with known predisposing factors, but of unknown etiology. A variety of opinions exist as to the cause of this condition, without consensus. Design: We reviewed 111 cases of CNH from 103 patients at our laboratory. p53 immunohistochemical staining, which is over expressed in basilar epidermal cells of porokeratosis, was performed in a representative sample of CNH cases. Histologic changes characteristic of porokeratosis were qualified as a 1) parakeratotic column of keratinocytes 2) an attenuated to absent granular layer, and 3) adjacent or underlying dyskeratosis of keratinocytes, present in columns or aggregates. Results: Porokeratosis-like changes were identified in 77 of 111 cases. p53 staining was noncontributory. Conclusion: The presence of these porokeratosis-like changes in 69% of cases is intriguing. It is not clear whether or not this could possibly represent a causative mechanism or, perhaps, an otherwise coincident histologic change. The presence of porokeratosis-like changes in CNH provides a possible hypothesis in relationship to its etiology, at the very least, it could provide some histologic clue as to the presence of this deep dermal process in superficial biopsies.

AB  - A 33-year-old Caucasian female presented with a ten-year history of flushing and facial swelling partially responsive to anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial therapies. Progressive edema of the right upper eyelid was recently treated by blepharoplasty. The blepharoplasty specimen had a dense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and diffuse non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes. The granulomas appeared both peri-and intralymphatic with prominent molding. Special stains and polarization studies were negative. To confirm the intralymphatic location of these granulomas we performed immunohistochemical staining with Factor VIII and D2?40. D2?40 is a new monoclonal antibody that reacts with an O-linked sialoglycoprotein found on lymphatic endothelium, fetal testis, and on the surface of testicular germ cell tumors. In recent studies, clone D2?40 has shown staining in lymphatic channel endothelium but not in adjacent capillary. Factor VIII antibody highlighted both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium, while D2?40 stained only the lymphatic endothelium and confirmed the intra-lymphatic location of granulomas. The patient was diagnosed with granulomatous lymphangiitis of the Melkersson-Rosenthal type (orofacial granulomatosis). Granulomatous lymphangiitis is characteristic but not completely diagnostic of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. We present the complex differential diagnosis of intralymphatic granulomas and the use of a new monoclonal antibody helpful in verifying their location.

AB  - A seventy-year-old woman developed back pain associated with a sacral mass seven years prior to presentation. Biopsy of the sacral mass showed chordoma. The patient underwent two surgical resections because of recurrent disease. She presented after developing a firm, non-tender skin nodule on the left back. Biopsy of the lesion showed a dermal neoplasm composed of nests of cells in a mucinous stroma. There was moderate cytologic atypia of the cells, and occasional mitotic figures were seen. Physaliphorous cells were present. The immunostains S-100, cytokeratin, and EMA were all positive. A diagnosis of metastatic chordoma to the skin or chordoma cutis was made. The patient died 15 months later from complications of metastatic disease. Chordomas are rare, representing only 1?4% of malignant bone tumors, which most often occur in the sacral area. Metastasis to the skin is unusual. In one study, 207 cases of chordoma were evaluated, and only 19 had skin involvement. Chordoma cutis has been described as nodules which are firm, blue domed, cystic-appearing, erythematous, translucent, flesh-colored, and reddish brown. Cutaneous metastasis of chordoma has been reported to the nose, chest, back, thigh, shoulders, left arm, face, neck, and scalp.

AB  - Background: Dermatomyositis, a connective tissue disease syndrome where antibodies to the endothelium of the microvasculature of the skin, muscle and lung are implicated in lesional propagation, is characterized by photodistributed erythema, heliotrope rash, Gottron?s papules, muscle weakness and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Endotheliotropic viruses and underlying neoplasia are among the inciting triggers. Uncommonly drugs, namely the lipid lowering agents, have been implicated in dermatomyositis. Case Report: The patient, a 57-year-old male, developed a photodistributed rash and muscle weakness following treatment with the antifungal medication Lamisil. A skin biopsy was performed, showing an atrophying interface dermatitis with pandermal mucinosis and striking vasculopathic changes including endothelial cell necrosis with denudement and basement membrane zone reduplication. Direct immunofluorescent testing showed prominent staining of C5b-9 along the dermal- epidermal junction and within the vasculature. Conclusion: We have shown a temporal association between use of Lamisil and the development of dermatomyositis. Terbinafine, the active agent in Lamisil, promotes apoptosis of human endothelial cells in culture. Enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis results in the displacement of various cellular antigens creating a state of neo-antigenicity; its attendant sequelae has held to be one of antiendothelial cell antibody formation, a defining pathogenetic event in the evolution of dermatomyositis.

AB  - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an unusual peripheral lymphoma most typically presenting with a cytotoxic (CD8-positive, TIA-1-positive) immunophenotype. SPTCLs may have an indolent or highly aggressive clinical course. Histologically, SPTCL may be notoriously difficult to diagnosis. Cases of SPTCL with a deceptively benign appearance similar to that of subcutaneous lupus erythematosus have been described. SPTCL associated with a concomitant systemic leukemia/lymphoma has not been documented in the literature. We report a case of SPTCL arising in a 65-year-old female with a well-established history of B-cell lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL). She presented with two months of recurrent fever and painless erythematous nodules on bilateral lower extremities that were clinically felt to be erythema nodosum. Initial biopsies demonstrated a polymorphous lobular infiltrate with neutrophils, karyorrhexis and lipomembranous change. An excisional biopsy demonstrated an atypical lymphoid population that expressed CD8 and TIA1. PCR analysis confirmed T-cell receptor gene arrangement. The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy with resolution of her symptoms and complete remission. This is the first well documented case of SPTCL occurring in a patient with long standing B-CLL, and highlights the difficulty of establishing an unequivocal diagnosis of SPTCL.

AB  - A 64-year-old white male presented with a three-month history of multiple crusted erythematous nodules on the lower legs. The patient was immunosuppressed on prednisone and tacrolimus secondary to liver transplant. Biopsy revealed a fibrinopurulent crust overlying an interstitial, non-follicular oriented, neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis. PAS and GMS positive septate hyphae were present within the stratum corneum while yeast-like forms with pseudohyphal projections, suggestive of Blastomyces dermatitidis, were found within the dermis. There was no evidence of follicular rupture or granulomatous inflammation. Subsequent culture grew Trichophyton rubrum confirming the diagnosis of deep dermatophytosis. This case illustrates several histologic differences in deep dermatophyte infection in the immunocompromised host from invasive dermatophyte infection, Majocchi?s granuloma, occurring in the immunocompetent patient. In the immunocompromised patient there is typically the following: no evidence of fungal invasion via a ruptured hair follicle, suppurative inflammation as opposed to granulomatous inflammation, and atypical fungal forms consisting of swollen hyphae and round, yeast-like, arthroconidia, as opposed to the slender hyphae seen in Majocchi?s granuloma. In addition, because of the clinical appearance of the lesions, immunocompromised state of the patients, and atypical fungal forms seen on biopsy, an initial diagnosis of systemic mycosis is often incorrectly made.

AB  - The concept of paracolloid was raised by Dupre et?al. in 1979 to describe a rare lesion, in which large amounts of homogeneous, pale pink, non-amyloid material in sun-exposed skin. The deposits consisted of haphazardly arranged microfilaments of 3?4?nm in diameter. Here we report another case. A 54-year-old white male presented with a 2???2?cm boggy, erythematous plaque involving the bridge and tip of the nose for two years. The lesion enlarged slowly and intermittently drained pinkish fluid. A shave biopsy revealed extensive homogeneous, pale pink material with fissure and clefts in the dermis. The deposits wrapped up hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and superficially mixed with scattered solar elastic fibers and globules. There were scattered fibroblasts, focal mild perivascular and perifollicular lymphocyte and plasma cells. Adjacent skin showed prominent solar elastosis. A thin grenz zone was present abutting an atrophic epidermis with actinic keratosis. The deposits showed faint Congo red stain with focal weak apple-green birefringence, faint PAS stain, and negative Verhoeff-van Gieson stain. Masson?s trichrome stain and immunohistochemical stain for collagen IV were negative.

AB  - A comprehensive collection of high quality histologic slides is essential for education of pathology and dermatology trainees in dermatopathology. However, maintenance of the quality of the teaching slide collection is constantly challenged by slide loss, breakage, and stain fading. Recut replacement slides are not always easily attainable. When they are, the most important diagnostic features may not be as well represented in recuts. The ScanScope (Aperio Technologies) virtual microscopy instrument and software have been used to create a dermatopathology image database. Histologic sections on glass microscope slides are scanned at X20 to obtain a high-resolution digital image of the entire section (virtual slides). This magnification is optimal for demonstrating most cutaneous pathologic processes, where low or intermediate power pattern recognition is of primary diagnostic importance. Images can be viewed with the ImageScope virtual slide viewing software. The software is intuitive to use and closely mimics viewing of a slide at the microscope. Virtual slide image quality is equivalent to that seen at the microscope. Unique teaching slides can be reproduced in unlimited quantities and slides are never lost, broken, or misfiled. Internet, intranet, or DVD access permits continuous availability of a teaching slide collection to trainees.

AB  - Balloon cell melanoma (BCM) is a rare histological variant of amelanotic melanoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell lesion includes BCM, renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma as well as a number of histiocytic and infectious processes. We report a case of BCM in a 33 year-old Indonesian man who presented with a non-tender, freely movable, non-pigmented left thigh nodule, which had been present for a year. On microscopic examination tumor consisted of a nodular infiltrate present within the dermis with superficial invasion of subcutaneous fat. Tumor cells formed nested aggregates were relatively bland in appearance and had abundant, clear cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Rare mitotic figures were present within the deep portion of the neoplasm. No definitive nests were seen at the dermal epidermal junction or within the epidermis. Histochemical stains AFB, PAS/D, and GMS were negative. Immunoperoxidase studies were positive with antibodies to vimentin, S100, HMB45, CD68, and negative with cytokeratin, Factor XIIIA, and lysozyme. The diagnosis of BCMM was favored based on histological features, and immunoperoxidase staining pattern. We believe this case can provide additional information to help establish diagnostic criteria of this rare variant of melanoma.

AB  - A fourteen-year-old female presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Biopsies of the mesenteric lymph nodes revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, characterized by para-cortical fibrinous necrosis with karyorrhectic debris and histiocytic palisading, and paucity of the polymorphic neutrophils. She also developed concurrent skin lesions with scattered small non-itching vesicles and blisters over her back and lower legs. A punch biopsy revealed vacuolar interface changes, sub-epidermal blister formation, mild superficial perivascular infiltration, and follicle necrosis. Karyorrhectic debris and CD68-positive cells are noted around the follicle. A direct immunofluorescent study was negative for complement or immunoglobulin depositions. The patient was diagnosed as Kikuchi-Fujimoto?s disease, or necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis, a benign self-limited lymph node disorder most commonly occurred in young females. Patients with Kikuchi?s disease are typically presented with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying fever. Multiple lymph node involvement, splenomegaly and/or cutaneous lesions are rare occurrences. The present patient experienced a severe inflammatory response syndrome manifested by respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She recovered completely after two weeks of intensive medical treatment. She has had no respiratory symptoms, residual lymphadenopathies or documented skin lesions in her follow-up three months after discharge.

AB  - Fibrous papule (FP), synonymous with angiofibroma, is a common lesion that is often biopsied to exclude carcinoma. Clinically, FPs are small, dome-shaped, solitary, flesh colored papules arising on the nose and face of adults. Histologically, FPs are characterized by a dome-shape, fibrotic collagenized stroma, sparse inflammatory cell infiltrate, and variably increased and dilated vascular spaces. The vast majority of FPs are readily diagnosable based on these clinical and histologic criteria. Rare histopathologic variants have been reported. Recognition of these variants may avoid misdiagnosis of this common benign lesion. We illustrate four rare variants of FP that can cause diagnostic uncertainty including: hypercellular, clear cell, pigmented, and pleomorphic variants. Cellular FP has a dense infiltrate of round fibroblasts that have a nevoid appearance. Clear cell FP has a proliferation of round clear cells, some with slightly foamy cytoplasm, resembling histiocytes or clear epithelial cells. Pleomorphic FP demonstrates bizarre, stellate fibroblasts like those seen in pleomorphic fibroma. Pigmented FP has prominent melanocytic hyperplasia and dermal melanophages that can be confused with a melanocytic lesion. It is important to recognize these unusual variants of FP in order to accurately diagnose this common benign lesion and avoid over treatment or rebiopsy.
