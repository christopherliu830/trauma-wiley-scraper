AB  - Hyperpigmentation associated with prolonged minocycline use is well documented and affects diverse organ systems including skin, thyroid, heart valves, bone, sclerae and teeth. The histopathology of cutaneous minocycline pigment demonstrates brown-black granules lining elastin fibers in the upper dermis and occurring within macrophages along vessels and eccrine units in the dermis. The nature of the pigment can be confirmed by concurrent positive staining with both Fontana-Masson and Perls? stains. The subcutis may also be involved, however the specific subcutaneous findings in minocycline hyperpigmentation have not been described. We present the pathological findings in four cases of minocycline hyperpigmentation with subcutaneous involvement. Course black/brown granules were seen in macrophages particularly around vessels in the subcutis but also within septae and between lipocytes. An unusual feature noted in the subcutis and deep dermis was the presence of green-gray, flocculent, non-refractile, non-polarizable globules within macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. These measured between 0.005?0.1?mm in diameter and did not stain for melanin or iron. Two of four exhibited lipomembranous changes which were also involved by pigment. This is the first description of green-gray globules and pigmented lipomembranous changes in subcutaneous minocycline pigmentation, unique findings that provide additional clues to the diagnosis.

AB  - The rare coexistence of vasculitis and malignancy is intriguing, if not completely understood. Overall, malignancy is found in approximately 5% of patients who present with vasculitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is reported as a paraneoplastic event primarily in association with hematologic malignancies. Rarely, LCV has occurred concomitant with solid tumors, including sarcomas. We report a case of a 62-year-old African American woman who presented with LCV in association with an occult cardiac sarcoma. Past medical history includes left sided breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation. She presented with worsening of a persistent, non-pruritic rash involving her lower extremities, diagnosed as LCV on skin biopsy. Within four months she developed congestive heart failure, and a right ventricular mass was identified. Heart biopsies revealed a high grade cardiac sarcoma. Within 2?3 days, she experienced an exacerbation of her vasculitis, accompanied by hemorrhagic bullae. Vasculitis is considered to be a paraneoplastic syndrome if a temporal relationship can be established with a co-existing malignancy. Here, a clear cut temporal relationship between coexistence, and intervention related exacerbation, is well documented. Temporal exacerbation of the LCV after cardiac biopsies suggests activation of the immune system in response to antigenic determinants within the cardiac tumor.

AB  - We report six cases of a basaloid neoplasm arising on the head and neck showing immature sebaceous gland and focal immature hair follicle differentiation. Four cases arose in the periorbital area, one on the lower lip, and one on the neck. In all six cases extensive involvement of the surrounding soft tissues was observed. In five cases the tumor involved and was particularly aggressive in bone, requiring extensive resection. In two cases tumor extended to and involved the dura mater of the brain. Three cases required enucleation. Patients ranged in age from 30 to 81 years and consisted of four males and two females. No infection, syndrome, or other predisposing factor was known to be present. No patient was known to be a smoker or to engage in any other risk activity for cancer. No evidence of metastasis was noted in any patient. We conclude that the basaloid neoplasm showing immature pilo-sebaceous differentiation of the head and neck is a distinct entity with a much more aggressive course than basal cell carcinoma and a different progression from that of any other adnexal neoplasm, including sebaceous carcinoma.

AB  - Skin conditions in individuals with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) are poorly classified and characterised. We reviewed 892 consecutive cases of individuals who had a workup for UCTD. ATAbs were positive in 526(59%). The ATAb(+) and ATAb(?) groups had similar antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity (32% versus 28% respectively), average age (59 versus 58), and female-male ratio (8:1 versus 6:1). ATAb positivity was significantly associated with a dermatitis, manifested as erythematous macules/patches or papules on legs, shoulders or upper backs, in 9%(47/526) individuals versus 2%(7/366) in ATAb(?) individuals (Pearson?s chi-square?=?18.7, p?<?0.0001). Sixteen individuals with dermatitis had biopsies, 14 ATAb(+) and 2 ATAb(?). Routine hematoxylin-eosin and colloidal iron-stained sections were examined. Eleven biopsies (79%) from ATAb(+) individuals (5 ANA-negative, 5 with thyroid disease) and one from ATAb(?) ANA(?) individuals showed interface/lichenoid dermatitis with mild basal keratinocyte vaculopathy, variable dermal mucin deposition, and perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates in the upper dermis. The interface dermatitis was not significantly associated with ANA positivity or thyroid disease. In summary, we report an ATAb-associated interface dermatitis in UCTD patients which may represent a new subset of autoimmune disease, and suggest that ATAb tests may be a useful marker for UCTD.

AB  - There are many reports of patients with a severe hydroa vacciniforme (HV)-like eruption. The cutaneous lesions occur both in sun-exposed and nonexposed areas in these patients unlike a true HV. In most cases, a latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been detected in the skin lesions of these patients. We performed the photo-provocation test in five patients with an EBV associated HV-like eruption. The photoprovocation tests were caried out using the UVA delivered by a SUPUVASUN 3000 light source. A 5x 5 sqaure cm area on the buttock was irradiated three or four times at 24 hour intervals. A skin biopsy was obtained from the lesional skin and photo-provoked lesion in all five patients. H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed. In situ hybridization was also performed to detect mRNA for EBV in the skin biopsy specimens. Skin lesions were induced by repetitive UVA exposure in all five patients. The severity of the phtoprovoked lesion showed correlation with that of the clinical features. The immunohistologic findings of photo-provoked skin lesions were similar to those of original skin lesions. A latent EBV infection was also demonstrated in the photo-provoked lesion.

AB  - Psoriasis is a common and chronic inflammatory skin disease that afflicts 2?3% of the world population. There is no cure and the precise cause of psoriasis is unknown. Cytokines however, have been established as critical mediators in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. EGR-2 is an immediate early serum response gene that codes for Krox-20, a zinc finger transcription factors that is important in resisting TGF-? mediated apoptosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate Krox-20 expression in epidermal keratinocytes in psoriasis where aberrant response to TGF-? signaling has been shown to occur. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (N?=?38) including nine psoriatic plaques (PP), nine lichen planus (LP), ten lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), and ten normal skin (NS) were evaluated for expression of Krox-20 by immunohistochemistry. Frequency and relative intensity of nuclear labeling were evaluated. Strong and diffuse nuclear labeling of keratinocytes was observed in all PP and LSC. The frequency of labeling was significantly greater (p?<?0.05) in PP and LSC compared to NS. Lichen planus tended toward absent to weak nuclear labeling of keratinocytes. The increased frequency of Krox-20 expression in PP and LSC may lead to resistance of TGF-? mediated apoptosis and contribute to epidermal hyperplasia common to these disorders.

AB  - Sezary syndrome (SS) is a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving the blood, skin and lymph nodes associated with erythroderma. Other cutaneous manifestations of SS include palmoplantar keratoderma, ectropion, and alopecia. Two clinical patterns of SS can be defined: ?secondary? SS arising from systemic spread of long-standing mycosis fungoides (MF) and ?primary? SS with a much shorter prodromal phase characterized by pruritus, xerosis and scaling culminating in erythroderma. Most previous studies examining the histological features of SS have not distinguished between these two different clinical patterns, and have emphasized that the histological features of SS mostly resemble those of typical MF, including epidermotropism and/or band-like superficial dermal lymphoid infiltrates. In this study, we have concentrated on the histological findings of primary SS and correlated them with the clinical and hematologic parameters at the time of skin biopsy. We note that dermal perivascular lymphoid infiltrates predominate in a majority of primary SS cases, raising the differential diagnosis of benign dermatoses, rather than resembling the classical pattern of MF. This impression is further complicated by commonly observed epidermal changes such as spongiosis, acanthosis and parakeratosis that are likely secondary to tumor-associated pruritus and secondary lichenification.

AB  - Nuclear details are sufficient to differentiate tumors of many types as evidenced by the widespread and successful use of cytology. While cytology examinations are generally optimized to identify the nuclear and morphological characteristics of cell preparations and aspirates, tissue samples are optimized to emphasize the cellular details. Recent studies have validated fractal morphometry for nuclear analysis in cytology. We evaluated the use of nuclear detail analysis employing fractal morphometric analysis in cutaneous tumors to differentiate common and uncommon skin tumors.

AB  - Pinkus initially described eccrine poroma as a benign neoplasm of the acrosyringium. The tumor, often consisting of broad anastamosing bands, arises from the epidermis and extends downward into the dermis. However, it may be completely intraepidermal (?hidroacanthoma simplex?), and, at times, appear to be completely dermal (?dermal duct tumor?). The characteristic tumor cell is squamoid, but smaller than the epidermal squamous cell. The cell has a cuboidal appearance with a uniform basophilic nucleus, and intercellular bridges. One can usually observe a sharp line of demarcation between the adjacent epidermis and the tumor cells. The histological sections presented are offered as evidence of the eclectic nature of eccrine poroma. The examples to be discussed include: the intraepidermal variant, the intraepidermal variant with ?microcysts, the intraepidermal variant with ?macrocysts? the epidermal/classic variant, the dermal variant, the pigmented variant, the irritated variant, the chondroid variant, the syringomatous variant and the focally malignant variant. Each example has the classic features of eccrine poroma and an outstanding individual characteristic. But, all are eccrine poromas. These specimens are from the Medical College of Virginia/Francis H. McMullan collection, representing fifty years of practice, teaching and service.

AB  - Materials and Methods: 247 consecutive skin specimens covering a three-month period (1/04?3/04) were reviewed to identify incidental foci of Hailey-Hailey (HH) like acantholysis and focal acantholytic dyskeratosis (FAD). Cases in which these patterns comprised the primary process were excluded. All cases were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and hematoxylin-eosin stained. Results: Six cases were identified: three shave biopsies (chest, back, face), two excisions (back, face), and one punch biopsy (scalp). This represented 2.4% of total reviewed. Four specimens had a HH like pattern (1.6%); two had FAD (0.8%). The average patient age was 68 years (range 41?86). Four patients were male; two were female. Three cases were associated with epidermal neoplasia: basal cell carcinoma (HH), actinic keratosis (HH), and malignant melanoma in situ (HH). Two were associated with significant inflammation: seborrheic keratosis (HH) and bullous lichen planus (FAD). One biopsy was of lichen simplex chronicus (FAD). The average diameter of acantholysis was 0.3?mm. Four cases showed associated prominent solar elastosis. Discussion: Incidental acantholysis with FAD and HH like patterns is uncommon. This has previously been postulated to reflect possible pre-neoplastic epidermal damage. The discussed cases show an association with epidermal neoplasia, solar change, and inflammation.

AB  - The histologic diagnosis of desmoplastic melanoma is challenging, particularly when the overlying junctional component is absent and when the spindle cells lack melanin pigment. In these instances, the importance of immunohistochemistry cannot be overemphasized. S-100 protein, with a sensitivity approaching 90%, is the primary immunohistochemical stain used for this purpose. HMB-45, although a more specific marker for melanocytes, is often negative in these cases. A marker of schwannian differentiation, p-75 NGF-R has been shown to be a useful confirmatory marker for desmoplastic and neurotropic melanoma, with staining intensity comparable to or better than S-100 protein. We report two cases of desmoplastic melanoma which stained focally and weakly with S-100 protein in comparison with the stronger staining of p-75 NGF-R. In both cases, S-100 staining could have been missed or interpreted as non-confirmatory, thus misguiding the diagnosis. We therefore suggest that p-75 NGF-R be a complementary marker to S-100 protein in differentiating desmoplastic melanoma from other non-neural crest-derived spindle cell tumors.

AB  - The spectrum of melanocytic proliferations ranges from banal to overtly malignant. Borderline melanocytic lesions which bridge these two extremes pose a challenge, as their biological nature remains undefined. We set out to evaluate the utility of the sentinel lymph node biopsy in such lesions. Our compendium was defined by 11 cases of borderline melanocytic proliferations whereby sentinel node sampling was conducted. There were three severely atypical dermal-epidermal melanocytic proliferations manifesting borderline features with nevoid melanoma (calf, shoulder, knee), three arising in association with a deep penetrating nevus (chest, shoulder, and arm), three atypical Spitz?s tumors (helix, calf, arm, back), and two atypical pigment-synthesizing melanocytic tumors, resembling equine melanotic disease in one and cellular blue nevus in another (buttock, calf, arm). The patient population comprised seven males and five females ranging in age from age 9?36 (mean: 25 years). At least one positive sentinel lymph node was uncovered in seven of the cases with a positive sentinel lymph observed in all but one case of deep penetrating nevus and atypical Spitz?s tumor. The identification of sentinel lymph node positivity in seven of the twelve cases (58%) validates the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the setting of borderline melanocytic proliferations.

AB  - The histological findings in tinea corporis are variable, but include parakeratosis, often with neutrophils, spongiosis, and dermal inflammation. A recent study found some degree of papillary dermal edema in 17 to 23% of tinea cases. We report five cases of tinea corporis in which prominent papillary dermal edema (PDE) was the salient histological finding. Prominent PDE is often associated with diagnoses such as Sweet syndrome, polymorphous light eruption, allergic contact dermatitis and arthropod bite reactions. Interestingly, the submitted clinical diagnoses for our cases included Sweet syndrome (2), arthropod bite reaction (2), immunobullous disease (2), fixed drug eruption (1), eczema (1) and tinea (2). Our first case was a 25-year-old female with recurrent edematous plaques in fixed sites. Her lesions completely cleared with repeated courses of systemic steroids, but recurred after steroid taper. One fungal hypha was overlooked on her first biopsy and she was erroneously diagnosed with fixed drug eruption or a blistering disease (immunofluorescence negative). Six months later, repeat biopsy showed PDE, and numerous hyphae were seen on PAS stain. This prompted us to carefully examine PAS-stained sections on subsequent cases with prominent PDE. Prominent papillary dermal edema may be a clue to dermatophyte infection.

AB  - Epithelioid cell histiocytoma (ECH) is regarded as a variant of fibrous histiocytoma. It is not readily recognized as fibrous histiocytoma because of its unconventional histologic features and its resemblance to Spitz nevus. The ECH reported herein was from a 50-year-old man who presented with an asymptomatic, 1.5?cm, polypoid mass of unknown duration on his posterior shoulder. Histologic examination revealed epidermal collarette and dermal sheets of epithelioid cells with granular cytoplasm. Both fine and coarse granules were noted in the cytoplasm. They were PAS positive and diastase resistant. Many dilated vessels were also noted in the lesion. A panel of immunostains including S100, vimentin, CD68, and factor 13A was done. The lesional cells were reactive with vimentin, CD68, and factor 13A, and non-reactive with S100. These results favored exclusion of Spitz nevus and granular cell tumor, and supported the histologic impression of ECH. Both fine and coarse cytoplasmic granules were reactive with CD68. The latter finding supports that the cytoplasmic granules in this ECH represent lysosomes as in granular cell tumors.

AB  - A 27-year-old male soldier who was stationed in Iraq from 3/03 to 9/03 presented to a local dermatologist in 4/04 with several red slightly raised non-ulcerated nodules over the right wrist and ventral arm developed 2?3 months prior to the visit. The clinical impression was sporotrichosis. A punch biopsy was performed on a subcutaneous nodule and showed a granulomatous inflammatory process with scattered loosely organized clusters of epithelioid histiocytes palisading around dermal mucin, mainly involving the papillary and mid dermis. A diagnosis of granuloma annulare was suggested. Intralesional triamcinolone was used and the lesions initially improved but later recurred. However on deeper sections, there were scattered granulomas with a dominant necrotizing granuloma consisting of epithelioid histiocytes palisading around a central area of necrosis surrounded by lymphoplasmacytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. In 5/04, he presented to the Birmingham VA Medical Center with similar lesions. A repeat biopsy again showed a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In addition, numerous intracytoplasmic organisms with kinetoplasts were present within histiocytes. The findings were consistent with leishmaniasis due to L. major as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction at Walter Reed Hospital. As more US soldiers return from the Middle East, previously rare cutaneous leishmaniasis will be seen more commonly.

AB  - Since the emergence of the AIDS epidemic, various associated skin lesions have been recognized. One interesting phenomenon is chronic photosensitivity dermatitis. We report the case of a 44-year old homeless male with a 14-year history of HIV and a CD4 count of 350. He presented to us with a 5-month history of a pruritic photodistributed eruption. Physical examination revealed that he had erythematous, scaly, lichenified, and crusted plaques involving the face, neck, upper chest, and extensor extremities. Sparing of the areas under his watch and bracelet was found. A skin biopsy specimen showed psoriasiform dermatitis with an overlying thick, impetiginized, and hemorrhagic crust. There was prominent single cell necrosis throughout all epidermal layers. A lichenoid dermal infiltrate consisted mainly of lymphocytes and eosinophils. The patient?s presentation was consistent with a photosensitive psoriasiform interface dermatitis. The pathogenesis of this photodermatitis is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include the formation of a neoantigen due to UV exposure, depressed levels of endogenous scavengers leading to increased oxidative stress, and the onset of a pellagra-like dermatosis due to niacin-tryptophan deficiency. It is likely that several of these processes are acting in concert to cause this photoeruption.

AB  - A 40 year-old female with sero-negative arthritis presented with annular and cord-like configurations (rope sign) of asymptomatic papules and plaques along her flanks, suspected to be granuloma annulare. Medications at the time of presentation included methotrexate, prednisone, Vioxx (rofecoxib), Arava (leflunomide) and Remicade (infliximab). High-potency topical corticosteroids did not alleviate the eruption. Biopsy was performed demonstrating a deep dermal, interstitial and focally palisading granulomatous infiltrate with eosinophils. Dermal lymphangiectases were present, and the epidermis was unaffected. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) examination showed deep dermal, interstitial IgG, C3, and IgM deposits coating collagen bundles centered in the granulomatous infliltrate and IgG antinuclear keratinocyte reactivity. Serologic tested also revealed anti-nuclear antibodies. No other auto-antibodies were detected. Based on these findings, this patient was diagnosed with ?interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) with cords and arthritis?. Thirteen cases of IGD with cords were identified in a literature review of which 7/12 (58%) were sero-(rheumatoid factor)-negative, 3/5 (60%) were anti-nuclear antibody positive, and 12/13 (92%) had arthritis. One theory of pathogenesis is that immune-complex deposition in the dermis initiates a granulomatous reaction; DIF findings in this case support this proposed mechanism. IGD with cords is a singular clinicopathologic entity associated with sero-negative, non-erosive arthritis and antinuclear antibodies.

AB  - An 85-year-old woman developed a tumor on her left thigh, thought to be a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Microscopy revealed irregularly shaped, bulbous and deep aggregates of pale/clear cells emanating from the surface and reaching the lowermost dermis. This asymmetric mass of keratinocytes showed focal necrosis and dyskeratosis but no frank anaplasia, mitoses or infiltrative pattern. The interface with the dermis was blunt but irregularly undersurfaced. A more characteristic pale cell acanthoma (PCA) was colliding with it and consisted of a superficial, more regularly psoriasiform proliferation with thin suprapapillary plates and erosion but no necrosis. While it has been known that PCA can be unusual polypoid, large or atypical no author has proposed that some of the latter variants could represent a malignancy, more akin to verrucous carcinoma than to conventional SCC, due to the paucity of overt anaplastic features and the underestimation of pushing invasion and low cytologic atypia as defining traits of malignancy. One case of SCC in situ with PCA has been recently acknowledged but this is not what we are reporting: We propose that voluminous, misshapen, asymmetric or deep ?PCAs? may be low-grade carcinomas with pale cell differentiation and likely origin in a pre-existing PCA.
