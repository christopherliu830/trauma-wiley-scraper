AB  - It is a little known fact that the organisms causing Zygomycosis are often better visualized with routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) staining than Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Experienced dermatopathologists, when evaluating histologic samples suspected of harboring deep fungal infection often rely more heavily on PAS staining to detect fungi. The diagnosis of Zygomycosis may be delayed or missed entirely if sufficient attention is not devoted to the H and E stained specimen. A review of multiple dermatopathology textbooks shows there is no universal agreement on the usefulness of routine H and E staining versus use of special stains for the detection of Zygomycosis. Grocott?s Methanamine Silver (GMS) staining can give false negative results if background staining of reticulum fibers is enhanced. This can occur because of overexposure in silver solution, excessive heat during processing, or use of incorrectly titrated solutions. Three consecutive culture proven cases of cutaneous Zygomycosis infection were evaluated. In each case, organisms were clearly visualized on routine H and E sections while PAS staining was variable. Examples of false negative GMS staining are also shown. Recognition of these staining properties can help dermatopathologists better detect the agents of Zygomycosis.

AB  - 76-year-old man presented with a hen?s egg-sized elevated nodule in his left sole in 4/04. He had been hospitalized because of icterus since 3/04. Although cancer of the pancreatic head had been strongly suspected on the imaging, he had refused surgical operation. No metastasis of the cancer had been found on the imaging. A dermatologist who biopsied the nodule in his left plantar recognized the swelling of inguinal lymph nodes on the same side. Histologically medium sized oval cells formed solid nests in the dermis, rendering them lobulated appearance. Some of the nests showed myxoid change in the stroma where tumor cells often showed cord-like arrangement. The border with surrounding tissue was relatively clear. The cells had round, and often eccentrically located nuclei with one or two small nucleoli and moderate to scarce amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitosis was readily identifiable; >50/10HPF. Necrosis was not found. Immunohistochemically tumor cells were reactive for AE1/AE3, vimentin and S-100 protein and negative for ??SMA, CK14, EMA, HMB 45 and Melan A. MIB-1 labeling index was over 50%. The lesion was diagnosed as malignant myoepithelioma. The positivity for S-100 protein seen in this case necessitated us to differentiate it from melanoma.

AB  - We report unique histologic findings in scalp biopsies from two family members with Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome. Rapp-Hodgkin and the related AEC syndrome show a primary scarring alopecia and pili torti. The syndromes, which are related to ectodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate syndrome, have been credited to mutations in the TP63 gene. Most notable on biopsy is a primary scarring alopecia and abnormal hair shaft shape. Calcification in the outer root sheath epithelium, the basement membrane of the lower segment and within naked hair shafts is present. Neutrophils and bacterial rods and cocci are adjacent to the hair shaft in the superior segment, associated with dilated follicular ostia. Perifollicular fibrosis is associated with a variety of inflammatory cell types, mostly lymphocytic. One sample shows interfollicular irregular psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, compact orthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, and intraepidermal neutrophils. Follicular architecture is abnormal with abrupt and linear loss of nucleated matrical cells (B fringe of Adamson). The line of Ayber measures 0.30?mm on average. Hair shafts measure up to 0.16?mm, with variable abnormal cross sectional shape, usually square. Outer root sheath epithelium is disorganized with slight cellular pleomorphism, and the cuticle of the inner and outer root sheath is irregular in thickness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DiGeorge Syndrome is a congenital anomaly with a constellation of findings including thymic hypoplasia. Approximately 1 in 250 patients has complete DiGeorge syndrome with athymia. Many athymic patients develop severe eczema/erythroderma associated with oligoclonal circulating T cells. DESIGN: Nine biopsies from eight athymic patients with severe rash and circulating oligoclonal T cells were studied. Immunohistochemistry with CD3, CD4, CD8 and TIA-1 was performed. RESULTS: The stratum corneum showed parakeratosis (78%), most commonly confluent. Neutrophilic abscesses were commonly identified (44%). The epidermis exhibited exocytosis (100%), spongiosis (89%), dyskeratosis (89%), acanthosis (56%), and satellitosis (44%). Dermal changes included perivascular (56%), perifollicular (33%), and perieccrine (11%) lymphocytic infiltrates. Eosinophils were identified (78%); most commonly in both the dermis and epidermis. The majority of lymphocytes were CD3 positive with a slight CD4 over CD8 predominance in the dermis and epidermis. 67% of cases contained TIA-1 positive cells. CONCLUSION: Skin lesions from patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome who develop a rash that clinically resembles severe eczema/erythroderma display a constellation of histologic findings. The presence of dyskeratinocytes, satellitosis, and parakeratotic scale with neutrophils distinguishes these lesions from eczema and other spongiotic disorders. The pathophysiologic role of the inflammatory cells in this entity requires additional study.

AB  - Telomerase plays a role in the immortalization of cells and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results on whether human telomerase RNA (hTER) expression differs in nevi, atypical nevi and melanomas using PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) or in situ hybridization assays. The aim of this study was to evaluate human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) staining in melanocytic lesions on paraffin-embedded tissues. Paraffin-embedded sections from 6 acquired nevi, 4 dysplastic nevi, 5 Spitz nevi, 6 primary invasive melanomas, and 3 metastatic melanomas, were studied for staining intensity (0?3+) and % of labeled cells with anti-hTERT. HTERT staining was observed in most cells (>75%) in all lesions, and was of greater intensity in the nucleus, especially the nucleolus, compared to the cytoplasm. Spitz nevi tended to have weaker hTERT staining (mean?=?1.2) compared to acquired nevi (mean?=?2.0), dysplastic nevi (mean?=?2.5), primary melanoma (mean?=?2.17), or metastatic melanoma (mean?=?3). Although telomerase activity was weaker in Spitz nevi, there was overlap with other nevi and primary invasive melanomas in our small series. Thus, hTERT expression does not appear to be a reliable adjunct to the histological diagnosis of primary melanocytic lesions.

AB  - Political risk analysis has become a more prominent part of the decision-making process for transnational corporations (TNCs), particularly where capital investments in developing countries are concerned. An increased awareness of the views taken by TNCs on political risk abroad will enable political leaders of developing countries to bargain more effectively. TNCs use various methods to assess political risks. Direct field visits by senior personnel, advice from senior local managers, panels of experts, and quantitative methods are four currently popular techniques. These techniques are often applied without adequate analysis. TNCs can control their exposure to political risk by joining with local firms, and through loan guarantees insurance, or multi-country financing of equity investments. Policymakers in developing countries can respond successfully to the increased awareness by TNCs of political risk assessment methods by emphasizing the political opportunities of investing in their countries. La place qu'occupe l'analyse des risques politiques dans le processus de décisions des sociétés transnationales est devenue plus importante, en particulier en ce qui concerne les investissements en capitaux dans les pays en développement. Une connaissance plus approfondie des points de vue de ces sociétés sur les risques politiques à l'étranger permettrait aux dirigeants politiques des pays en développement de mener leurs négociations d'une manière plus efficace. Les sociétés transnationales emploient diverses méthodes pour évaluer les risques politiques. Des inspections directes sur le terrain par un personnel supérieur, l'avis de cadres supérieurs nationaux, des groupes d'experts et des méthodes quantitatives constituent quatre techniques couramment utilisées. Ces techniques sont souvent dépourvues d'analyse adéquate. Les sociétés transnationales peuvent contrôler les risques politiques auxquelles elles s'exposent en s'associant aux firmes locales et par l'assurance de garantie de prêts ou le financement multinational des prises de participations. Les responsables des pays en développement peuvent répondre avec succès à la connaissance croissante des sociétés transnationales des méthodes d'évaluation de risques politiques en mettant l'emphase sur les opportunités politiques d'investissements dans leurs pays. El análisis del reisgo politico se ha convertido en una parte importante del proceso de toma de decisiones por parte de las compañias transnacionales (CT), en especial cuando se refiere a inversiones de capital en los países en desarrollo. Un mayor conocimiento de los puntos de vista de las CT sobre los riesgos en estos países permitirá a los líderes de los países en desarrollo a negociar con más efectividad. Las CT usan varios métodos para estimar el riesgo político. Visitas a los paises por ejecutivos de alto nivel, recomendaciones de ejecutivos locales, paneles de expertos y métodos cuantitativos, son cuatro métodos de los más comunmente usados. Estos métodos son a menudo usados sin mucho análisis. Las CT minimizan el riesgo político asociándose con compañías locales, a través de seguros de garantía sobre préstamos, o mediante financiamiento multinacional. Los líderes de los países en desarrollo pueden responder con éxito a los métodos de evaluación de riesgo de las CT enfatizando las oportunidades politicas de investir en sus países.

AB  - Summary Aim To investigate the mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress?induced apoptosis as well as the protective action of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) both in vivo and in vitro. Methods and Results ER stress?induced apoptosis was involved in the injuries of spinal cord injury (SCI) model rat. bFGF administration improved the recovery and increased the survival of neurons in spinal cord lesions in model rat. The protective effect of bFGF is related to the inhibition of CHOP, GRP78 and caspase-12, which are ER stress?induced apoptosis response proteins. bFGF administration also increased the survival of neurons and the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), which is related to neural regeneration. The protective effect of bFGF is related to the activation of downstream signals, PI3K/Akt/GSK-3? and ERK1/2, especially in the ER stress cell model. Conclusions This is the first study to illustrate that the role of bFGF in SCI recovery is related to the inhibition of ER stress?induced cell death via the activation of downstream signals. Our work also suggested a new trend for bFGF drug development in central neural system injuries, which are involved in chronic ER stress?induced apoptosis.

AB  - Summary The practice of medicine and major segments of the biologic sciences have always relied on visualizations of the relationship of anatomic structure to biologic function. Traditionally, these visualizations either have been direct, via vivisection and postmortem examination, or have required extensive mental reconstruction, as in the microscopic examination of serial histologic sections. The revolutionary capabilities of new three-dimensional (3-D) and four-dimensional (4-D) imaging modalities and the new 3-D scanning microscope technologies underscore the vital importance of spatial visualization to these sciences. Computer reconstruction and rendering of multidimensional medical and histologic image data obviate the taxing need for mental reconstruction and provide a powerful new visualization tool for biologists and physicians. Voxel-based computer visualization has a number of important uses in basic research, clinical diagnosis, and treatment or surgery planning; but it is limited by relatively long rendering times and minimal possibilities for image object manipulation. The use of virtual reality (VR) technology opens new realms in the teaching and practice of medicine and biology by allowing the visualizations to be manipulated with intuitive immediacy similar to that of real objects; by allowing the viewer to enter the visualizations, taking any viewpoint; by allowing the objects to be dynamic, either in response to viewer actions or to illustrate normal or abnormal motion; and by engaging other senses, such as touch and hearing (or even smell) to enrich the visualization. Biologic applications extend across a range of scale from investigating the structure of individual cells through the organization of cells in a tissue to the representation of organs and organ systems, including functional attributes such as electrophysiologic signal distribution on the surface of an organ. They are of use as instructional aids as well as basic science research tools. Medical applications include basic anatomy instruction, surgical simulation for instruction, visualization for diagnosis, and surgical simulation for treatment planning and rehearsal. Infrastructure, methods and applications are discussed in this chapter. The most complex and challenging applications, those that show the greatest promise of significantly changing the practice of medical research or treatment, require an intimate and immediate union of image and model with real-world, real-time data.

AB  - Mammary-like glands are a poorly recognized structure of the normal vulvar skin. Adenocarcinomas occur rarely in these glands and represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity that must be distinguished from metastatic tumors. We present a case of a 51-year-old patient with a long-standing nodule on her right labium majus. Excision with subsequent Mohs micrographic surgery revealed an infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the mammary-like glands involving the dermis and subcutis. We review all cases thus far reported (including the case presented herein) and identify important clinical and morphologic features of this tumor. A significant histopathological and immunohistochemical overlap between this neoplasm, sweat gland carcinomas, and invasive extramammary Paget?s disease was recognized; suggesting the existence of a morphologic spectrum between these entities. Criteria for establishing the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of mammary-like glands are reviewed, including the importance of identifying transition zones between normal mammary-like glands and malignant glands. We believe that this tumor is best categorized as a locally aggressive neoplasm with a low metastatic potential and death from disease is uncommon. The successful treatment of this case by Mohs micrographic surgery suggests that an alternate management approach may be adopted for these tumors, particularly in elderly patients.
