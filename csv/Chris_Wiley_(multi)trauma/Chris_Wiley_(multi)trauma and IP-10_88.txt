AB  - Summary Aim To investigate the mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress?induced apoptosis as well as the protective action of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) both in vivo and in vitro. Methods and Results ER stress?induced apoptosis was involved in the injuries of spinal cord injury (SCI) model rat. bFGF administration improved the recovery and increased the survival of neurons in spinal cord lesions in model rat. The protective effect of bFGF is related to the inhibition of CHOP, GRP78 and caspase-12, which are ER stress?induced apoptosis response proteins. bFGF administration also increased the survival of neurons and the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), which is related to neural regeneration. The protective effect of bFGF is related to the activation of downstream signals, PI3K/Akt/GSK-3? and ERK1/2, especially in the ER stress cell model. Conclusions This is the first study to illustrate that the role of bFGF in SCI recovery is related to the inhibition of ER stress?induced cell death via the activation of downstream signals. Our work also suggested a new trend for bFGF drug development in central neural system injuries, which are involved in chronic ER stress?induced apoptosis.

AB  - Summary The practice of medicine and major segments of the biologic sciences have always relied on visualizations of the relationship of anatomic structure to biologic function. Traditionally, these visualizations either have been direct, via vivisection and postmortem examination, or have required extensive mental reconstruction, as in the microscopic examination of serial histologic sections. The revolutionary capabilities of new three-dimensional (3-D) and four-dimensional (4-D) imaging modalities and the new 3-D scanning microscope technologies underscore the vital importance of spatial visualization to these sciences. Computer reconstruction and rendering of multidimensional medical and histologic image data obviate the taxing need for mental reconstruction and provide a powerful new visualization tool for biologists and physicians. Voxel-based computer visualization has a number of important uses in basic research, clinical diagnosis, and treatment or surgery planning; but it is limited by relatively long rendering times and minimal possibilities for image object manipulation. The use of virtual reality (VR) technology opens new realms in the teaching and practice of medicine and biology by allowing the visualizations to be manipulated with intuitive immediacy similar to that of real objects; by allowing the viewer to enter the visualizations, taking any viewpoint; by allowing the objects to be dynamic, either in response to viewer actions or to illustrate normal or abnormal motion; and by engaging other senses, such as touch and hearing (or even smell) to enrich the visualization. Biologic applications extend across a range of scale from investigating the structure of individual cells through the organization of cells in a tissue to the representation of organs and organ systems, including functional attributes such as electrophysiologic signal distribution on the surface of an organ. They are of use as instructional aids as well as basic science research tools. Medical applications include basic anatomy instruction, surgical simulation for instruction, visualization for diagnosis, and surgical simulation for treatment planning and rehearsal. Infrastructure, methods and applications are discussed in this chapter. The most complex and challenging applications, those that show the greatest promise of significantly changing the practice of medical research or treatment, require an intimate and immediate union of image and model with real-world, real-time data.

AB  - Abstract (1) Angiogenesis (growth of new capillaries from an existing capillary bed) may result from a mismatch in microvascular supply and metabolic demand (metabolic error signal). Krogh examined the distribution and number of capillaries to explore the correlation between O2 delivery and O2 consumption. Subsequently, the heterogeneity in angiogenic response within a muscle has been shown to reflect either differences in fibre type composition or mechanical load. However, local control leads to targetted angiogenesis in the vicinity of glycolytic fibre types following muscle stimulation, or oxidative fibres following endurance training, while heterogeneity of capillary spacing is maintained during ontogenetic growth. (2) Despite limited microscopy resolution and lack of specific markers, Krogh?s interest in the structure of the capillary wall paved the way for understanding the mechanisms of capillary growth. Angiogenesis may be influenced by the response of perivascular or stromal cells (fibroblasts, macrophages and pericytes) to altered activity, likely acting as a source for chemical signals modulating capillary growth such as vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, haemodynamic factors such as shear stress and muscle stretch play a significant role in adaptive remodelling of the microcirculation. (3) Most indices of capillarity are highly dependent on fibre size, resulting in possible bias because of scaling. To examine the consequences of capillary distribution, it is therefore helpful to quantify the area of tissue supplied by individual capillaries. This allows the spatial limitations inherent in most models of tissue oxygenation to be overcome generating an alternative approach to Krogh?s tissue cylinder, the capillary domain, to improve descriptions of intracellular oxygen diffusion.

AB  - Aim Idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) is a prevalent, mystifying disorder with a questionable neurogenic background. We aimed to investigate the possible subtle neuropathic affection underlying its pathogenesis. Methods A cross-sectional cut off study was carried out on a series of 38 females with idiopathic OAB and 22 healthy matched female volunteers. The following was performed: symptom score questionnaire, determination of pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML), sacral reflexes? latencies, pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials, and needle electromyography of the external anal and urethral sphincters. Results A highly significant prolongation of PNTMLs and sacral reflexes latencies among the patients group was detected (P?≥?0.001). Pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials showed non- significance among the two studied groups (P?≥?0.05). External anal sphincter neuropathic affection was detected in 27 patients (71%) and external urethral sphincter neuropathic affection was detected in 30 patients (78.9%). The clitoral anal reflex showed the highest sensitivity and specificity among the neurophysiologic tests used in assessing the neuropathic affection (86.7 and 83%, respectively), followed by PNTML (83.3 and 80%, respectively). Conclusion Pudendal neuropathy is the dominating possible attributing factor in the pathogenesis underlying idiopathic OAB. An integrated clinical, urodynamic, and electro-physiological assessment is recommended for evaluation of any overactive bladder patients.

AB  - Abstract The wound healing process is directly related to the type of treatment. Existing methods of treatment are not responsive enough for severe wounds. The aim of this study was the potential capacity investigation of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibrous scaffolds coated by aloe vera gel for wound dressing applications. In this study, electrospinning method was used for preparing PLLA nanofibers, and after characterization by SEM and MTT, its influence on the wound healing process was investigated with and without aloe vera gel as a wound dressing in full-thickness skin defect in mice. Band-Aids were used as a positive control and vaseline gauze as a negative control. SEM and MTT assays confirmed the nanometer size and biocompatibility of fabricated nanofibers. Macroscopic and histopathological characteristics were evaluated at the end of days 7, 12, and 17 and their results showed that the gel-coated scaffold accelerated the wound-healing process compared with other groups. At the end of the experiment, it was shown that during the whole time of study, gel-coated scaffold had the highest overall repair score. Therefore, gel-coated PLLA scaffold would be an ideal construct for wound healing and skin regenerative medicine application.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the success of strategies ?including replacing petrol with aviation gasoline (avgas) in the fuel supply, and employment and skills-training programs targeting young people ?in reducing petrol sniffing at Maningrida, an isolated Aboriginal community in northern Australia. MethodsA follow-up study of 13 Aboriginals who were non-sniffers, 15 who were ex-sniffers and 27 who were petrol sniffers in 1992 was conducted by questionnaire in 1994, 20 months after intervention strategies were commenced; 11 non-sniffers, 11 ex-sniffers and 18 petrol sniffers, respectively, participated. Main outcome measuresPetrol-sniffing status, changes in employment status, blood lead levels of the participants, and community crime statistics. ResultsAfter intervention strategies in Maningrida, petrol sniffing ceased, with related crime falling markedly. Employment increased significantly among petrol sniffers, from 7% to 63% (x2= 11.53; df= 1; P< 0.001). Only two petrol sniffers were reported to have continued petrol sniffing elsewhere. Apart from one of these individuals, who had recently returned to Maningrida, blood lead levels fell significantly in those with a history of petrol sniffing, indicating they had not continued to sniff avgas, which contains lead additives (0.8 g/L). ConclusionsWhile avgas introduction was a key element in eliminating petrol sniffing, its apparent lack of success as a single intervention elsewhere indicates the importance of widespread community resolve against petrol sniffing and the development of coordinated employment strategies in successfully eliminating the practice and reducing associated social disruption.
