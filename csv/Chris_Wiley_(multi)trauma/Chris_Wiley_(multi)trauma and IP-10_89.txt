AB  - Abstract A significant comorbidity exists between alcohol and methamphetamine (Meth) abuse but the neurochemical consequences of this co-abuse are unknown. Alcohol and Meth independently and differentially affect glutamatergic transmission but the unique effects of their serial exposure on glutamate signaling in mediating damage to dopamine neurons are unknown. Sprague?Dawley rats had intermittent voluntary access to 10% ethanol (EtOH) every other day and water over 28 days and were then administered a binge injection regimen of Meth or saline. EtOH drinking decreased the glutamate aspartate transporter and increased basal extracellular concentrations of glutamate within the striatum when measured after the last day of drinking. Ceftriaxone is known to increase the expression and/or activity of glutamate transporters in the brain and prevented both the decreases in glutamate aspartate transporter and the increases in basal extracellular glutamate when administered during EtOH drinking. EtOH drinking also exacerbated the acute increases in extracellular glutamate observed upon Meth exposure, the subsequent increases in spectrin proteolysis, and the long-term decreases in dopamine content in the striatum, all of which were attenuated by ceftriaxone administration during EtOH drinking only. These results implicate EtOH-induced increases in extracellular glutamate and corresponding decreases in glutamate uptake as mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability produced by EtOH drinking and the unique neurotoxicity observed after serial exposure to Meth that is not observed with either drug alone.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the known prominent role of polyunsaturated (phospho)lipids as structural blocks of biomembranes, there is an emerging understanding of another important function of these molecules as a highly diversified signaling language utilized for intra- and extracellular communications. Technological developments in high-resolution mass spectrometry facilitated the development of a new branch of metabolomics, redox lipidomics. Analysis of lipid peroxidation reactions has already identified specific enzymatic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of several unique signals in response to inflammation and regulated cell death programs. Obtaining comprehensive information about millions of signals encoded by oxidized phospholipids, represented by thousands of interactive reactions and pleiotropic (patho)physiological effects, is a daunting task. However, there is still reasonable hope that significant discoveries, of at least some of the important contributors to the overall overwhelmingly complex network of interactions triggered by inflammation, will lead to the discovery of new small molecule regulators and therapeutic modalities. For example, suppression of the production of AA-derived pro-inflammatory mediators, HXA3 and LTB4, by an iPLA2? inhibitor, R-BEL, mitigated injury associated with the activation of pro-inflammatory processes in animals exposed to whole-body irradiation. Further, technological developments promise to make redox lipidomics a powerful approach in the arsenal of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments for personalized medicine of inflammatory diseases and conditions.

AB  - Abstract The study and exploitation of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) now extends into a third exciting decade. Pharmacokinetic modulators, including the more common sequences Tat, penetratin and transportan-10, markedly enhance the intracellular delivery of small drugs, peptides, oligonucleotides and proteins. We introduced the term bioportide to distinguish cell penetrant peptides with intrinsic bioactivities from more typically inert CPP vectors. Our first examples included rhegnylogically organised bioportides, monomeric peptides presenting pharmacophores for both cellular internalization and bioactivity discontinuously distributed within the primary sequence. However, it is conceptually expedient to employ the same terminology to encompass sychnologic bioportides that comprise an inert CPP vector conjugated to an otherwise impermeable bioactive peptide. In such cases the CPP provides an obvious address function whilst the bioactive cargo, often a protein mimetic sequence, is the message. Additional targeting sequences, usually added as chimeric extensions, can also be accommodated within the design of CPPs and bioportides to enable cell- and tissue-selective targeting. Thus, the identification and exploitation of bioportides provides further scope to employ CPPs as research tools, diagnostics and therapeutics spanning a range of pathologies.

AB  - Brain injury remains a significant and potentially devastating outcome of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) under circulatory arrest. These outcomes caused by a microvasculature embolization are associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays and increased use of intermediate or long term care facilities. The administration of heparin in heart surgery during deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass is the basic prophylactic strategy for reducing or even preventing, microvasculature embolization. Unfortunately, an incidence of neuropsychological impairments (NPI) is found in as many as 25 % of the survivors. As it is suspected that these impairments are correlated with morphological alterations, in our study we use the GP IIb-IIIa receptor blocker Eptifibatide for the inhibition of platelet aggregation, in order to look for a reduction of tissue damage compared to the standard treatment. Two groups of 11 piglets (mean body weight of 15±5 kg) underwent 10-minute normothermic bypass, 40-minute cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass, 60-minutes deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) at 15°C, and 40-minute rewarming to 37°C. Group 1 was treated only with unfractionated heparin (UFH), whereas Group 2 was medicated with Eptifibatide, in addition to the UFH-treatment group 1. After rewarming, all animals underwent bilateral carotid perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. Histological investigations of semi thin sections reveal a marked decrease of hippocampal alterations by using the GP IIb-IIIa receptor blocker in addition to standard UFH treatment. We detect a reduction of degenerative areas in perivascular (vessels with 10?30 ?m in diameter) tissue. These semi-quantitative data are confirmed by ultrastructural findings.

AB  - Abstract This clinical review will describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and management of the following work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) of the distal upper extremity: deQuervain's disease, extensor and flexor forearm tendinitis/tendinosis, lateral and medial epicondylitis, cubital tunnel syndrome, and hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). These conditions were selected for review either because they were among the most common WMSDs among patients attending the New York State Occupational Health Clinics (NYSOHC) network, or because there is strong evidence for work-relatedness in the clinical literature. Work-related carpal tunnel syndrome is discussed in an accompanying paper. In an attempt to provide evidence-based treatment recommendations, literature searches on the treatment of each condition were conducted via Medline for the years 1985?1999. There was a dearth of studies evaluating the efficacy of specific clinical treatments and ergonomic interventions for WMSDs. Therefore, many of the treatment recommendations presented here are based on a consensus of experienced public health-oriented occupational medicine physicians from the NYSOHC network after review of the pertinent literature. A summary table of the clinical features of the disorders is presented as a reference resource. Am. J. Ind. Med. 37:75?93, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
