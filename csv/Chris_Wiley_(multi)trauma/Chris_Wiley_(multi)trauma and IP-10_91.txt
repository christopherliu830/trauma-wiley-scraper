AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the nursing procedures carried out by emergency department nurses. This descriptive study was carried out between April and September 2015 in the emergency departments of two state hospitals and one university hospital in Turkey. The study population comprised 139 emergency nurses working for at least 1?year in the emergency department of one of the three hospitals. Data were gathered by using the Emergency Nursing Procedures Questionnaire, which is composed of three sections to reveal nursing procedures performed in emergency departments. The procedures most frequently performed by the participants were administration of pain medication and assessment of patient responses (3.97?±?.18). Assessment of the patient's nutritional status (1.79?±?1.16) was among the least frequently performed nursing procedures. Emergency nurses carried out nursing care procedures less frequently and took part most frequently in procedures related to medical diagnosis and treatment. According to results of this study, these procedures and competencies will highlight what knowledge and skills emergency nurses need. They will also guide in the creation of in-service training programs and illuminate competencies that need improvement.

AB  - Abstract Brain injury induces gliosis and scar formation; its principal cell types are mainly astrocytes and some oligodendrocytes. The origin of the astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the scar remains unclear together with the underlying mechanism of their fate choice. We examined the response of oligodendrocyte transcription factor (Olig)2+ glial progenitors to acute brain injury. Both focal cortical (mechanical or excitotoxic) and systemic (kainic acid-induced seizure or lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation) injury caused cytoplasmic translocation of Olig2 (Olig2TL) exclusively in affected brain regions as early as 2?h after injury in two-thirds of Olig2+ cells. Many of the proliferating Olig2+ cells reacting to injury co-expressed chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan neuron/glia antigen 2 (NG2). Using 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) tracing protocols, proliferating Olig2TLGFAP+BrdU+ cells were observed from 2?days post-lesion (dpl). Immature oligodendrocytes were also seen from 2?dpl and all of them retained Olig2 in the nucleus (Olig2Nuc). From 5?dpl Olig2TLNG2+GFAP+ cells were observed in the wound and some of them were proliferative. From 5?dpl NG2+RIP+ cells were also seen, all of which were Olig2Nuc and some of which were also BrdU+. Our results suggest that, in response to brain injury, NG2+ progenitors may generate a subpopulation of astrocytes in addition to oligodendrocytes and their fate choice was associated with Olig2TL or Olig2Nuc. However, the NG2+GFAP+ phenotype was only seen within a limited time window (5?8?dpl) when up to 20% of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) cells co-expressed NG2. We also observed Olig2TLGFAP+ cells that appeared after injury and before the NG2+GFAP+ phenotype. This suggests that not all astrocytes are derived from an NG2+ population.

AB  - Asthma has generally been thought to result from exposure to allergens in infancy leading to atopy, and eventually to airway hyperresponsiveness. There is now evidence that implicates absence of childhood infections as a factor in development of asthma. Childhood infections seem to be important in normal maturation of the immune system, with asthma a manifestation of a persistent ?immature? immune system.

AB  - The inflammatory reflex is a neurophysiological mechanism that regulates the immune system. The efferent branch of the reflex the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which inhibits inflammation by suppressing cytokine synthesis via release of acetylcholine in organs of the reticuloendothelial system, including the spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Acetylcholine binds to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed by macrophages and other cytokine-producing cells. Receptor-ligand engagement suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and prevents tissue damage. Herein is a review of some of the experimental studies that define the inflammatory reflex and its anatomic and physiologic components.
