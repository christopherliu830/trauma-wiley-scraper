AB  - Summary 1 By using indomethacin to inhibit their intramural synthesis, we have investigated the contribution of prostaglandins to the maintenance of (a) the intrinsic tone of isolated smooth muscle preparations and (b) contractions produced by drugs or high oxygen concentration. 2 When treated with indomethacin, the rat stomach strip and chick rectum preparation slowly relaxed, whether they were bathed in Krebs solution or blood. Although their sensitivity to added prostaglandin was somewhat enhanced, they became insensitive to changes in oxygen or glucose concentration. However, another smooth muscle preparation, the rat colon, was neither relaxed by indomethacin nor contracted by high oxygen concentration. 3 These results support the hypothesis that intramural generation of prostaglandin maintains the tone of some smooth muscle preparations. 4 Contractions of the guinea-pig isolated colon were induced by histamine. These contractions were normally well maintained but in Krebs solution lacking either oxygen or glucose, only the initial spike contraction remained. In the presence of indomethacin the histamine contraction was also poorly sustained, but maintenance was restored by a low concentration of prostaglandin E2. 5 Thus, the effects on smooth muscle of oxygen or glucose lack may also be mediated by reduction in the synthesis or effects of an intramural prostaglandin. Extension of this hypothesis to intestinal and vascular smooth muscle in vivo is discussed.

AB  - The recruitment of leukocytes to a tissue is a critical step in the inflammatory response. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important receptor involved in the initiation of inflammatory responses. Administration of the ligand for TLR4, lipopolysaccharide, is often used to model inflammation?local responses to stimuli within a specific tissue and systemic responses such as those observed during endotoxic or septic shock. Here, we review work, which demonstrates that in response to local activation of TLR4, highly coordinated and multistep processes are initiated, ultimately resulting in the leukocyte?s arrival at the inflamed tissue. In contrast, systemic activation of TLR4 results in nonspecific accumulation of leukocytes within the lung capillaries and liver sinusoids through mechanisms profoundly different than those involved in local tissue recruitment. Contrary to current dogma, leukocyte accumulation in the lung is dependent on endothelial rather than leukocyte activation. Finally, we discuss recent evidence suggesting that activation of leukocytes through TLR4, although still in the circulation, effectively paralyzes inflammatory cells, rendering them incapable of appropriate trafficking to inflamed tissues.

AB  - Abstract The mechanisms of injury-induced apoptosis of neurons within the spinal cord are poorly understood. In this study, we show that spinal cord injury (SCI) induces endoplasmic reticulum stress revealed by the activation of an unbalanced unfolded protein response (UPR). Using a weight-drop contusion model of SCI, the UPR activation was characterized by a quick transient phosphorylation of alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 soon restored by the up-regulation of its regulator Gadd34; an effective cleavage/activation of the ATF6α transcription factor leading to up-regulation of the canonical UPR target genes Chop, Xbp1 and Grp78; the presence of the processing of Xbp1 mRNA indicative of inositol requiring kinase 1 activation, and a gradual accumulation of C/EBP homologous transcription factor protein (CHOP) with concomitant caspase-12 activation. Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of CHOP was found in the nucleus of neurons and oligodendrocytes but in the cytoplasm of astrocytes. Considering the pro-apoptotic action attributed to this transcription factor, this phenomenon might account for the different susceptibility of cell types to dye after SCI.
