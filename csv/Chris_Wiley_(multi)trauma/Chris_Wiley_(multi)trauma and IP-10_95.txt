AB  - ABSTRACT Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can adversely affect fine motor control of the hand. Precision pinch between the thumb and index finger requires coordinated movements of these digits for reliable task performance. We examined the impairment upon precision pinch function affected by CTS during digit movement and digit contact. Eleven CTS subjects and 11 able-bodied (ABL) controls donned markers for motion capture of the thumb and index finger during precision pinch movement (PPM). Subjects were instructed to repetitively execute the PPM task, and performance was assessed by range of movement, variability of the movement trajectory, and precision of digit contact. The CTS group demonstrated shorter path-length of digit endpoints and greater variability in inter-pad distance and most joint angles across the PPM movement. Subjects with CTS also showed lack of precision in contact points on the digit-pads and relative orientation of the digits at contact. Carpal tunnel syndrome impairs the ability to perform precision pinch across the movement and at digit-contact. The findings may serve to identify deficits in manual dexterity for functional evaluation of CTS. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Key points Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) augments distinct inspiratory motor patterns, generated within the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), in a dose-dependent way. The frequency of sighs and gasping are stimulated at low concentrations, while the frequency of eupnoea increases only at high concentrations. We used in vivo microinjections into the preBötC and in vitro isolated brainstem slice preparations to investigate the dose-dependent effects of PGE2 on the preBötC activity. Synaptic measurements in whole cell voltage clamp recordings of inspiratory neurons revealed no changes in inhibitory or excitatory synaptic transmission in response to PGE2 exposure. In current clamp recordings obtained from inspiratory neurons of the preBötC, we found an increase in the frequency and amplitude of bursting activity in neurons with intrinsic bursting properties after exposure to PGE2. Riluzole, a blocker of the persistent sodium current, abolished the effect of PGE2 on sigh activity, while flufenamic acid, a blocker of the calcium-activated non-selective cation conductance, abolished the effect on eupnoeic activity caused by PGE2. Abstract Prostaglandins are important regulators of autonomic functions in the mammalian organism. Here we demonstrate in vivo that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can differentially increase the frequency of eupnoea (normal breathing) and sighs (augmented breaths) when injected into the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), a medullary area that is critical for breathing. Low concentrations of PGE2 (100?300 nm) increased the sigh frequency, while higher concentrations (1?2 ?m) were required to increase the eupnoeic frequency. The concentration-dependent effects were similarly observed in the isolated preBötC. This in vitro preparation also revealed that riluzole, a blocker of the persistent sodium current (INap), abolished the modulatory effect on sighs, while flufenamic acid, an antagonist for the calcium-activated non-selective cation conductance (ICAN) abolished the effect of PGE2 on fictive eupnoea at higher concentrations. At the cellular level PGE2 significantly increased the amplitude and frequency of intrinsic bursting in inspiratory neurons. By contrast PGE2 affected neither excitatory nor inhibitory synaptic transmission. We conclude that PGE2 differentially modulates sigh, gasping and eupnoeic activity by differentially increasing INap and ICAN currents in preBötC neurons.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising cellular vehicle for gene therapy of malignant gliomas due to their property of tumor tropism. However, MSCs may show bidirectional and divergent effects on tumor growth. Therefore, a robust surveillance system with a capacity for noninvasive monitoring of the homing, distribution and fate of stem cells in vivo is highly desired for developing stem cell-based gene therapies for tumors. In this study, we used ferritin gene-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track the tumor tropism of MSCs in a rat orthotopic xenograft model of malignant glioma. MSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Intra-arterial, intravenous and intertumoral injections of these FTH transgenic MSCs (FTH-MSCs) were performed in rats bearing intracranial orthotopic C6 gliomas. The FTH-MSCs were detected as hypointense signals on T2- and T2*-weighted images on a 3.0 T clinical MRI. After intra-arterial injection, 17% of FTH-MSCs migrated toward the tumor and gradually diffused throughout the orthotopic glioma. This dynamic process could be tracked in vivo by MRI up to 10 days of follow-up, as confirmed by histology. Moreover, the tumor tropism of MSCs showed no appreciable impact on the progression of the tumor. These results suggest that FTH reporter gene-based MRI can be used to reliably track the tropism and fate of MSCs after their systemic transplantation in orthotopic gliomas. This real-time in vivo tracking system will facilitate the future development of stem cell-based therapies for malignant gliomas.

AB  - 1 Continuous recording of cardiac contractions and coronary flow from isolated perfused hearts of rats permitted the study of coronary reactions to: (a) cardiostimulation induced by single doses or slow infusions of noradrenaline, CaCl2, glucagon or electrically induced tachycardia; (b) short interruptions of coronary inflow (hypoxia). 2 Except during tachycardia the heart rate was kept constant at 210 beats/min by electrical pacing. 3 Metabolic coronary vasodilatation (MCD) resulting from cardiac hyperactivity induced by noradrenaline, Ca2+, tachycardia or glucagon was inhibited by administration of prostaglandin E2. Reactive hyperaemia response to hypoxia was unaffected by prostaglandin administration. 4 Inhibition of MCD could also be obtained by prolonged infusion with arachidonic acid (1.6 ? 10?7m), presumably by its conversion into prostaglandin-like substance since arachidonic acid failed to block MCD in hearts from rats pretreated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone). 5 Reactive hyperaemia was unaffected either by arachidonic acid or by blockade of the synthesis of prostaglandin-like substances by anti-inflammatory drugs. 6 Since prostaglandin synthetase inhibition does not prevent but may enhance MCD, we do not advocate prostaglandin-like substances as agents directly responsible for the coronary vasodilatation that follows cardiac hyperactivity. 7 We postulate that cardiac overproduction of prostaglandins may lead to a failure in the adaptive coronary flow response to cardiac hyperactivity (coronary insufficiency?).
