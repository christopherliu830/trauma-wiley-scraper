AB  - Abstract Background:? Surviving multi-trauma is strongly associated with emergent resuscitation and treatment in modern medical facilities. Multi-trauma survival before the advent of modern medicine is likely to have been extremely uncommon, particularly in primitive societies. The aim of this study was to investigate the case of an ancient Australian Aboriginal who appeared to have survived multi-trauma. Methods:? We investigated the skeletal remains of an adult Australian Aboriginal with healed fractures of the right femur and humerus. The time of death was assessed by carbon dating. The sex and approximate age of the subject were assessed from the skeleton's morphometry. The fractured bones were assessed by visual inspection, plain radiographs and computer tomography (CT) scanning. Results:? The remains were of a male aged approximately 50 years at the time of his death, approximately 1000 years ago, preceding European settlement. Analysis of the malunions indicated that all fractures occurred in one traumatic event, normally a life-threatening injury combination, and that the subject survived for years after this incident, despite no or failed active treatment of his fractures. Conclusions:? The survival of a man living in a primitive society after multi-trauma reflects an impressive depth of nursing and social support in a community of hunter gatherers.

AB  - Abstract Objective Regionalised civilian trauma systems improve patient outcomes, but may deskill clinicians outside major trauma services (MTSs). We aimed to characterise experience and confidence in trauma management among emergency physicians working in MTS to those working elsewhere. Methods Emergency physicians working within the Victorian State Trauma System were surveyed about their pre- and post-fellowship training experience, their estimated hours per fortnight in different centres, the frequency of performance/supervision of critical emergency skills and their confidence in a range of trauma skills. Results The 138 respondents analysed represented 33% of active Victorian FACEMs. The cohort were mostly males (69.6%), younger than 50 (75.4%) and were generally (69.6%) six or more years post-fellowship. FACEMs working in a MTS were more likely to have been a trauma registrar prior to fellowship (13.3% vs 3.7%, P = 0.046). MTS clinicians performed more, supervised more and were more confident in trauma team leading, traumatic airway management and rapid infusion catheter and multi-access catheters. Confidence in trauma team leading was only associated with exposure to performance or supervision of trauma team leading. Performance of trauma team leading was more common in clinicians at a MTS (odds ratio 3.19, 95%?CI 1.00?10.20, P = 0.05). Conclusion Exposure to major trauma is associated with time spent working in a MTS and exposure is associated with confidence. A mature inclusive trauma system must ensure clinicians across the system gain the experience or training to provide trauma care that will result in similar outcomes for patients regardless of initial presenting hospital.

AB  - Abstract Objectives A multidisciplinary approach that emphasised improved triage, early pelvic binder application, early administration of blood and blood products, adherence to algorithmic pathways, screening with focused sonography (FAST), early computed tomography scanning with contrast angiography, angio-embolisation and early operative intervention by specialist pelvic surgeons was implemented in the last decade to improve outcomes after pelvic trauma. The manuscript evaluated the effect of this multi-faceted change over a 12-year period. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing patients presenting with serious pelvic injury in 2002 to those presenting in 2013. The primary exposure and comparator variables were the year of presentation and the primary outcome variable was mortality at hospital discharge. Potential confounders were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results There were 1213 patients with a serious pelvic injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale?≥3), increasing from 51 in 2002 to 156 in 2013. Demographics, injury severity and presenting clinical characteristics were similar between the two time periods. There was a statistically significant difference in mortality from 20% in 2002 to 7.7% in 2013 (P?=?0.02). The association between the primary exposure variable of being injured in 2013 and mortality remained statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio 0.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.02?0.60) when adjusted for potential clinically important confounders. Conclusions Multi-faceted interventions directed at the spectrum of trauma resuscitation from pre-hospital care to definitive surgical management were associated with significant reduction in mortality of patients with severe pelvic injury from 2002 to 2013. This demonstrates the effectiveness of an integrated, inclusive trauma system in achieving improved outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Time-out protocols have reportedly improved team dynamics and patients? safety in various clinical settings ? particularly in the operating room. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a Trauma Care checklist, which outlines steps to follow immediately after the primary and secondary surveys and prior to the team leaving the patient. The WHO Trauma Care checklist's main perceived benefit is the prompting of clinicians to complete trauma admissions as per evidence-based guidelines. The WHO Trauma Care checklist, while likely to be successful in reducing errors of omission related to hospital admission, may be limited in its ability to reduce errors that occur in the initial 30 min of trauma reception ? when most of the life-saving decisions are made. To address this limitation a Trauma Team Time-out protocol is proposed for initial trauma resuscitation, targeting the critical first 30 min of hospital reception.

(b) conduits and barriers to information transfer in trauma care and related settings; and (c) interventions that have an impact on information communication at handover and beyond. Background.? Information transfer is integral to effective trauma care, and communication breakdown results in important challenges to this. However, evidence of adequacy of structures and processes to ensure transfer of patient information through the acute phase of trauma care is limited. Data sources.? Papers were sourced from a search of 12 online databases and scanning references from relevant papers for 1990?2009. Review methods.? The review was conducted according to the University of York?s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines. Studies were included if they concerned issues that influenced information transfer for patients in healthcare settings. Results.? Forty-five research papers, four literature reviews and one policy statement were found to be relevant to parts of the topic, but not all of it. The main issues emerging concerned the impact of communication breakdown in some form, and included communication issues within trauma team processes, lack of structure and clarity during handovers including missing, irrelevant and inaccurate information, distractions and poorly documented care. Conclusion.? Many factors influence information transfer but are poorly identified in relation to trauma care. The measurement of information transfer, which is integral to patient handover, has not been the focus of research to date. Nonetheless, documented patient information is considered evidence of care and a resource that affects continuing care.

AB  - Abstract??? Maxillofacial injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and demand meticulously planned treatment. The aim of this present multi-center study was to evaluate the occurrence of dento-alveolar and maxillofacial injuries over a 5-year period. A retrospective cohort study of data from the Israel Trauma Registry was conducted for the years 2000?2004. The registry includes all trauma patients admitted and hospitalized due to an injury. Of the 111?010 hospitalized trauma patients, 5886 (5.3%) were diagnosed with maxillofacial or dental injuries. The main causes of injuries for hospitalized trauma patients were falls (48.1%) and motor vehicle accidents (25.2%), while the major causes of facial and dental injuries were vehicle accidents (39.6%, 56.8%, respectively) and falls (32.1%, 26.7%, respectively). High-risk age groups for dental and facial trauma were 10?18?years and 19?28?years, respectively, while for other trauma, ages for the greatest risk ranged from 0 to 9?years and over 59?years. Males were injured two to three times more frequently than females. A better understanding of the etiology of maxillofacial and dental injuries and identifying the high-risk groups should lead to appropriate prevention programs and treatment methods.

AB  - Abstract Background Functional recovery is an important outcome for those who survive critical illness. The present study aimed to assess nutrition provision and nutrition-related outcomes in a multi-trauma cohort following intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Methods The present study investigated a prospective cohort of patients discharged from an ICU, who had been admitted because of major trauma and required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h. Nutrition-related outcomes, including body weight, quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT), handgrip strength and subjective global assessment, were recorded on ICU discharge, days 5?7 post-ICU discharge and then weekly until hospital discharge. Nutrition intake was recorded for 5 days post-ICU discharge. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the mean (SD). Results Twenty-eight patients [75% males, 55 (22.5) years] were included. Intake met 64% (28%) of estimated energy and 72% (32%) of protein requirements over the 5 days post-ICU discharge, which was similar to over the ICU admission. From ICU admission to hospital discharge, the mean reduction in weight was 4.2 kg (95% confidence interval = 2.2?6.3, P < 0.001) and after ICU discharge, the mean reduction in weight and QMLT was 2.6 kg (95% confidence interval = 1.0?4.2, P = 0.004) and 0.23 cm (95% confidence interval = 0.06?0.4, P = 0.01), respectively. Conclusions Patients received less energy and protein than estimated requirements after ICU discharge. Weight loss and reduction in QMLT also occurred during this period.

Physical examination findings included tachycardia, tachypnea, and hind limb paresis in a laterally recumbent patient. Radiographs, laboratory evaluation, and abdominocentesis revealed the presence of hemoperitoneum, blunt hepatic trauma, pneumothorax, and a small abdominal hernia. The ferret was treated with resuscitative fluids, thoracocentesis, abdominal counterpressure, and blood transfusion. This is the first case report of multi-systemic trauma in a ferret. The ferret made a complete recovery and was discharged to the referring veterinarian three days after presentation. (Vet. Emerg. Crit. Care, 10:13?18, 2000)

AB  - Abstract Few studies have prospectively analysed the delivery of care in trauma patients. This study undertook a prospective analysis of performance and consistency of care at a Level 1 trauma centre. A 3-month prospective study was undertaken of all admitted trauma patients at Liverpool Hospital. Data were collected on patient demographics, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), length of hospital stay, patient outcome and cause of death. Delivery of care was evaluated using 30 performance indicators and assessment of errors. Two hundred and thirty-six consecutive major trauma patients were studied. 73.3% were male, mean age 39 years. The main mechanism of injury was road trauma in 46.2%. Mean ISS was 12 and 64 patients had an ISS ≥16. Error-free care was delivered in 145/236 (61.4%). There were 145 errors in 91 patients (38.6%). Errors in judgement and delays in diagnosis accounted for 56/145 (38.6%) and 48/145 (33.1%), respectively. Errors occurred most commonly in the Emergency Department (ED) (48.3%), and trainees from all specialties were responsible for 67.5% of errors. There were 25 near misses detected. Three patients developed major sequelae or complications from errors. One of 13 deaths was deemed potentially preventable. This study has shown that while 61.4% of admitted trauma patients receive optimal care, errors are frequent, resulting in a spectrum of outcomes from near misses to death. The majority of errors result from the activity of unsupervised trainees and relate to errors in judgement and delays in diagnosis. Clearly, there is room for improvement of the delivery of trauma care.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the potential linkage between social organization and trauma in a sample of cercopithecids from Cameroon. Skeletal trauma is described in a museum collection of eight sympatric monkey species. Macroscopic analysis was carried out on a total of 139 complete skeletons of mangabeys, colobines and guenons. Species in multi-male groups were found to have higher fracture frequencies than those in uni-male groups. These higher frequencies may be related to intra-specific male?male aggression; however, similarities in fracture patterning between males and females in multi-male groups suggest that other factors may be involved. Although fracture etiology may not be identified with certainty, this study suggests that predation may indirectly be a cause of traumatic injuries in those species of cercopithecid monkeys displaying multi-male social organizations. The data presented also highlight the utility of museum collections as an additional resource in analyses of primate behavior, demonstrating that behavioral information does not die when the animal does.

AB  - Aims To describe the costs of acute trauma admissions for children aged ≤15 years in trauma centres; to identify predictors of higher treatment costs and quantify differences in actual and state-wide average cost in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Method Admitted trauma patient data provided by 12 trauma centres was linked with financial data for 2008?2009. Demographic, injury details and injury severity scores (ISS) were obtained from trauma registries. Individual patient costs, Australian Refined Diagnostic Related Groups (AR-DRG) and state-wide average costs were obtained. Actual costs incurred by each hospital were compared with state-wide AR-DRG average costs. Multivariate multiple linear regression identified predictors of cost. Results There were 3493 patients with a total cost of AUD$20.2 million. Falls (AUD$6.7 million) and road trauma (AUD$4.4 million) had the highest total expenditure. The reduction in cost between ISS < 9 compared to ISS 9?12 and ISS > 12 was significant (P < 0.0001). The median cost of injury increased with every additional body region injured (P < 0.0001). For each additional day spent in hospital, there was an increased cost of AUD$1898 and patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) cost AUD$7358 more than patients not admitted to ICU. The total costs incurred by trauma centres were AUD$1.4 million above the NSW peer group average cost estimates. Conclusions The high financial cost of paediatric patient treatment highlights the need to ensure prevention remains a priority in Australia. Hospitals tasked with providing trauma care should be appropriately funded and future funding models should consider trauma severity.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) at this Major Trauma Centre; to determine independent predictors of multi-region injury; and to evaluate the accuracy of the decision to perform WBCT in detecting multi-region injury. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single Major Trauma Centre in New South Wales, Australia. All adult patients who triggered trauma team activation and required an initial CT scan were studied. Primary outcome was the presence of multi-region injury. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to derive a prediction model for the need for WBCT based on our primary outcome. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the accuracy of the derived model and the clinical decision to perform WBCT. Results Six hundred and sixty patients were studied. WBCT scanning rate was 9.3% of all trauma activations. Of the patients who underwent WBCT, 31/98 (32.0%) had multi-region injury compared with 31/562 (5.5%) who underwent selective CT scanning (P < 0.001). Predictors of multi-region injuries were GCS <9 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3?7.0, P = 0.01), full trauma activation (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5?5.3, P = 0.001), fall >5?m (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8?13.4, P = 0.003) and pedal cyclist (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2?7.5, P = 0.02). Area under ROC curve for the clinical decision to perform WBCT was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63?0.76) compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67?0.80) for the prediction model. Conclusion The decision to perform WBCT scans in trauma should be at the discretion of the treating clinician. Applying a prediction rule would increase the number of WBCT scans performed without improving overall accuracy.

AB  - Objectives To investigate whether implementing a geriatric resuscitation protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement is associated with lower mortality through the early recognition of occult hypoperfusion (OH). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level I trauma center. Participants All hemodynamically stable individuals with blunt trauma aged 65 and older admitted to the Level I trauma center from October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011 (n = 1,998). Measurements Mortality over time (according to quarter) was analyzed using an adjusted logarithmic regression model stratified according to the presence of OH. OH was defined as lactate of 2.5 mM or greater. Results Overall mortality was 3.9% (n = 78). Admission venous lactate was collected in 73.5% of participants, of whom 20.5% had OH (n = 301). In participants with OH, a significant decrease in mortality was observed over time (adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.66, P = .002). A smaller yet significant decrease in mortality rates in participants with normal perfusion status was also observed (adjusted R2 = 0.55, P = .01). Conclusion Early identification and treatment of OH in elderly adults with trauma using venous lactate-guided therapy coupled with early trauma surgeon involvement was associated with significantly lower mortality. A protocol that uses lactate-guided therapy with early trauma surgeon involvement should be followed to improve the care of elderly adults with trauma.

AB  - Trauma is an important health problem. With the anticipated decline in communicable diseases and nutritional problems in the next millennium, trauma might replace communicable diseases as a problem and rank second only to non-communicable diseases. Trauma is a surgical disease and a general surgeon?s leadership is imperative to the success of regional trauma systems. Designation of trauma centres would improve patient outcomes, increase surgeons? experience and reduce costs in health care. The success of the Advanced Trauma Life Support Programme has shown how the input of surgeons can change the concept of our care for trauma victims. The lack of local trauma data has limited our appraisal to intellectual guessing. To objectively appraise local demand, a territory-wide major trauma outcome study should be conducted in Hong Kong.

AB  - Background: Severe truncal multi trauma patients often develop coagulopathy, acidosis and hypothermia that makes major reparative trauma surgery dangerous. It was aimed to try to develop physiological indicators that would predict a poor outcome when conventional reparative surgery was applied. These indicators may help in the decision to switch from conventional reparative surgery to surgery limited to the control of major haemorrhage or organ disruption: so-called ?damage-control? surgery. Method: A retrospective review was conducted of 40 patients with severe multivisceral trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 35) who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Waikato Hospital and who underwent conventional reparative surgery. Results: Survival was strongly associated with base deficit (BD), core temperature and ISS. Using multiple logistic regression on these indices, outcome could be predicted with 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 92%, positive predictive value for death = 96%). Either severe hypothermia (< 33°C) or severe acidosis (BD > 12 mEq/L), or a combination of moderate core temperature < 35.5°C, and a BD of > 5 mEq/L were strong predictors of death if conventional reparative surgery was practised. Conclusions: At the abovementioned levels of physiological compromise, patient survival after conventional trauma surgery can be predicted to be very unlikely. Damage-control measures would be worth attempting.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report summative data from the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) registry. Design Multi-institutional veterinary trauma registry data report. Setting VetCOT identified veterinary trauma centers (VTCs). Animals Dogs and cats with evidence of trauma presented to VTCs with data entered in the VetCOT registry September 1, 2013?March 31, 2017. Interventions VetCOT created a standardized data collection methodology for dog and cat trauma. Data were input to a web-based data capture system (REDCap) by data entry personnel trained in data software use and operational definitions of data variables. Data on demographics, trauma type (blunt vs penetrating), preadmission care, hospitalization and intensive care requirement, trauma severity assessment at presentation (eg, modified Glasgow coma scale and animal trauma triage score), key laboratory parameters, necessity for surgical intervention, and case outcome were collected. Summary descriptive data for each species are reported. Measurements and Main Results Twenty-nine VTCs in North America, Europe, and Australia contributed information from 17,335 dog and 3,425 cat trauma cases during the 42-month reporting period. A large majority of cases presented directly to the VTC after injury (80.4% dogs and 78.1% cats). Blunt trauma was the most common source for injury in cats (56.7%); penetrating trauma was the most common source for injury in dogs (52.3%). Note that 43.8% of dogs and 36.2% of cats were reported to have surgery performed. The proportion surviving to discharge was 92.0% (dogs) and 82.5% (cats). Conclusions The VetCOT registry proved to be a powerful resource for collection of a large dataset on trauma in dogs and cats seen at VTCs. While overall survival to discharge was quite high, further evaluation of data on subsets of injury types, patient assessment parameters, interventions, and associated outcome are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To investigate differences between paediatric patients with moderate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatric ED, with respect to: demographics, patterns of presentation, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores (ISS), interventions and outcome. Method:? Retrospective cohort study. Moderate to severe trauma was defined as ISS >9. Paediatric patients admitted to hospital via Starship Children's Emergency or KidzFirst ED, with trauma from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, with ISS >9 were identified using multiple databases. The charts were reviewed and data collected included: demographics, hospital of first presentation, diagnoses, ISS, Paediatric trauma score (PTS), Glasgow coma score (GCS), ventilator hours, length of admission, survival and discharge destination. Descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals, Mann?Whitney U-test, ?2-test and Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. Results:? A total of 393 children with moderate to severe trauma were identified using initial search strategies. Of these, 82 children met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study; 42 children were admitted via KidzFirst ED and 40 via Starship Children's ED. There was no statistically significant difference in ISS (P= 0.86), PTS (P= 0.11), GCS (P= 0.62), hours on a ventilator (P= 0.28) and length of stay (P= 0.87) between children admitted from Starship or KidzFirst ED. Conclusion:? This study suggests that there are no differences in the numbers or severity of paediatric trauma patients admitted from the Starship and KidzFirst ED. This indicates triage is to the closest ED despite having a tertiary referral centre for paediatric trauma available in Auckland City.

AB  - All multi-trauma patients with suspected cervical spine injury should have their cervical spine protected while other life-threatening injuries are being managed. The application of a hard cervical collar is an acceptable method of temporarily immobilizing the cervical spine. Two cases of significant occipital pressure ulceration associated with the use of hard cervical collar are presented.

AB  - Background Young children are at particular risk for injury. Ten per cent to twenty-five per cent develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no empirically supported preventive interventions exist. Therefore, this study evaluated the efficacy of a standardised targeted preventive intervention for PTSD in young injured children. Methods Injured children (1?6 years) were enrolled in a multi-site parallel-group superiority prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Australia and Switzerland. Screening for PTSD risk occurred 6?8 days postaccident. Parents of children who screened ?high-risk? were randomised to a 2-session CBT-based intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Primary outcomes were PTSD symptom (PTSS) severity, and secondary outcomes were PTSD diagnosis, functional impairment and behavioural difficulties at 3 and 6 months postinjury using blinded assessments. Trials were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000325606) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02088814). Trial status is complete. Results One hundred and thirty-three children screened ?high-risk? were assigned to intervention (n = 62) or TAU (n = 71). Multilevel intention-to-treat analyses revealed a significant intervention effect on PTSS severity over time (b = 60.06, 95% CI: 21.30?98.56). At 3 months, intervention children (M = 11.02, SD = 10.42, range 0?47) showed an accelerated reduction in PTSS severity scores compared to control children (M = 17.30, SD = 13.94, range 0?52; mean difference ?6.97, 95% CI: ?14.02 to 0.08, p adj. = .055, d = 0.51). On secondary outcomes, multilevel analyses revealed significant treatment effects for PTSD diagnosis, functional impairment and behavioural difficulties. Conclusions This multi-site RCT provides promising preliminary evidence for the efficacy of a targeted preventive intervention for accelerating recovery from PTSS in young injured children. This has important clinical implications for the psychological support provided to young children and parents during the acute period following a single-event trauma.

AB  - Background Computed tomography (CT) is an essential diagnostic tool for severe multi-trauma patients. International guidelines recommend an optimal time of 1?h from arrival. The aim of this study was to determine the time interval from arrival at the emergency department to CT for all trauma patients and the effects on in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay. Methods Retrospective study of all patients who triggered a trauma call and underwent CT scanning at the Gold Coast University Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Exclusion criteria were scans performed at peripheral hospitals or performed more than 5?h after arrival to emergency department. Results One thousand six hundred and nineteen eligible trauma patients were admitted over the study period and underwent CT scanning. Median time to CT was found to be 43?min. CTs done within 1?h compared to those done after 1?h from emergency department arrival were found to have a higher mean injury severity score (11 ±?10 versus 9 ±?9, P =?0.003), a longer mean hospital length of stay (9 ±?21 versus 7 ±?13?days, P =?0.012) and no difference in mortality rates (2.2% versus 2.1%, P =?1.000). Age, injury severity score and intubation status were identified as independent predictors for longer hospital length of stay and higher mortality while time to CT did not. Injury severity score was shown to be an independent predictor of time to CT. Conclusion Our time to CT scanning is well within the timeframe recommended by international guidelines. Early CT scanning may also improve outcomes in severely injured trauma patients.
