AB  - Abstract Objectives Whole body computed tomography (WBCT) scanning for trauma has gained popularity but its role in low-risk patients is controversial. We aimed to determine the rate of serious axial/truncal injury and emergency intervention in conscious, stable patients undergoing WBCT for blunt trauma in two non-trauma centre EDs in the Victorian trauma system. Methods Retrospective cohort study by medical record and radiology report review. Patients were included if they were conscious, haemodynamically stable adults presenting by ambulance and having WBCT scan. Exclusion criteria were age <16?years, no history of trauma, Glasgow Coma Scale <14, systolic blood pressure <90?mmHg and intoxication with alcohol or drugs. Data collected included demographics, clinical findings, results of CT scans and emergency interventions (emergency truncal surgery, transfer to a trauma centre and/or transfusion within 24?h). The outcomes of interest were the rate of defined serious axial/truncal injury and emergency interventions. Results One hundred and four patients were studied. Median age was 45?years; 67% were men. Median injury severity score (ISS) was 1.5 (interquartile range 0?5); only one patient had an ISS ≥15. Ninety (87%, 78?92%) patients had no defined serious injury. Five (5%) patients had a defined emergency intervention ? four trauma centre transfers and one transfusion. Two of these were not trauma-related. Conclusion The rate of serious axial/truncal injury was low. The high rate of normal scans makes it likely that the risk:benefit ratio between injury identification and radiation related cancer risk is unacceptably high. This data supports a selective CT strategy in low-risk trauma patients.

AB  - Aim More than 90% of pediatric solid organ abdominal injuries are treated non-operatively. It remains difficult to decide who should graduate to surgical management, more so if adult physicians must make these decisions on pediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes of all pediatric abdominal trauma cases in a single center, focusing on the decision-making algorithm for operative or non-operative treatment by pediatric and adult physicians. Methods We undertook a retrospective review of a pediatric trauma database from April 2006 to March 2016. Groups were divided into operative and non-operative, single or multi-organ injury, and adult or pediatric physician. Operative treatments included laparotomy or interventional radiology procedures. Primary outcome was survival within 30 days. Results There were 53 abdominal trauma cases; among them, 48 (90.6%) survived and 5 (9.4%) died within 30 days. The probability of survival for mortalities was less than 11%. Forty-two cases were treated non-operatively and 11 operatively. Injury Severity Score was higher in operative group (17 [9, 41]/9 [4, 16.3]). Adult physicians saw 33 patients including seven operative, whereas pediatric physicians saw 20 including four operative cases. There was no statistical difference for the management decision between adult and pediatric physicians. Conclusion Our decisions for intervention were within acceptable rates. Adult physicians did not tend to operate more, but there were cases that did not fit the criteria of the algorithm. Further investigation is needed to look at which factors should be focused on to determine whether or not operative treatments are indicated.

This study audits the trauma call procedure at the hospital over a period of 12?months. Method Retrospective descriptive study of trauma calls from August 2015 to July 2016 at CWM Hospital. Data relating to patient demographics, time of presentation, time to team assembly and time to computed tomography (CT) scan were extracted from the ED trauma call database. Disposition from the ED and status at hospital discharge was extracted from the hospital patient information system. Results There were 38 trauma calls for 46 patients. Seventy-two per cent were male. Eighty-two per cent occurred when the CT radiographer was off site (16.00?08.00 h), including 47% that occurred between midnight and 08.00 h. Fifty-two per cent of patients were intubated, 43% went to ICU, 26% went directly to the operating theatre, and 37% died. Benchmarks for time to trauma team assembly and time to CT scan were met in 50% of cases. Conclusion This was a severely injured cohort of patients with a high mortality rate. The rate of missed calls was not assessed in this study. Time to CT scan could be improved with an onsite radiographer. Time to team assembly could be improved with trauma team training and early notification from pre-hospital providers. There is a need to continue to monitor and refine the trauma call process and to extend data capture to measure injury severity and outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Vic., Australia has noticeably increased over the 12?month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centres. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24?month period and analyses the management modalities used. Methods:? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of 20 March 2004 until 20 March 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed and findings at operation. Results:? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24?month period between 20 March 2004 and 20 March 2006. The second 12?month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion:? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12?months. Although management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy.

AB  - ABSTRACT A cat was presented in coma following severe trauma. The cat was alert and walking within 24 hours, after treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and mannitol. However, he subsequently began to show evidence of severe abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy revealed traumatic avulsion of the left limb of the pancreas. A sub-total pancreatectomy was performed and the cat recovered well. Two weeks post-operatively, the cat was re-presented with ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, and upper motor neuron weakness in all four limbs. Radiographs revealed a fracture/luxation of C1?C2 which could not be adequately stabilized solely via a dorsal approach. A combined ventral and dorsal approach produced stabilization of the cervical spine which was clinically successful. Two months post-operatively there was stability but malalignment of C1?C2, and the cat appeared normal.

AB  - Teodorescu, D.-S., Heir, T., Hauff, E., Wentzel-Larsen, T.  64% of the patients had both PTSD and major depression disorder (MDD) and 80% of those who had PTSD had three or more additional diagnoses. Multi-traumatized refugees in outpatient clinics have high prevalence of PTSD, DESNOS, comorbid depression and anxiety disorders. A more severe symptomatology was found in patients diagnosed with both PTSD and DESNOS, than in those diagnosed with only PTSD. Higher rates of unemployment, weak social network and weak social integration were also prevalent in these outpatients, and related to increased psychiatric comorbidity and severity of symptoms. Further research may clarify the existence of a cumulative relationship between pre-resettlement traumas and post-resettlement stressors in the mental health of refugees, which in turn may help to improve therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Abstract:? In the discrimination of falls versus blows, the hat brim line (HBL) rule is mentioned in several textbooks as the most useful single criterion. Recent studies, however, have found that the HBL rule is only moderately valid and that its use on its own is not recommended. The purpose of this 6-year retrospective study was to find additional individually useful criteria in the distinction of falls from blows. Overall, the following criteria were found to point toward blows: more than three lacerations, laceration length of 7?cm or more, comminuted or depressed calvarial fractures, lacerations or fractures located above the HBL, left-side lateralization of lacerations or fractures, more than four facial contusions or lacerations, presence of ear lacerations, presence of facial fractures, and presence of postcranial osseous and/or visceral trauma. Based on the most discriminating criteria, a decision tree was constructed to be potentially applicable to future cases.

AB  - Background:? We investigated (1) the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in treatment-seeking subjects with substance use dependence (SUD), (2) the association between comorbid PTSD and the severity and course of addiction and psychopathology, and (3) this association in patients with subsyndromal PTSD, and in trauma exposure without PTSD. Methods:? In this cross-sectional study, 459 subjects in 14 German addiction treatment centers participated with alcohol-dependence (A) in 39.7%, drug-dependence (D) in 33.6%, or both (AD) 26.8%. The diagnostic measures included the International Diagnostic Checklists (IDCL), Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Associations between independent characteristics and outcomes were analysed by univariate and multivariate statistics. Results:? 25.3% of the subjects had PTSD confirmed by both IDCL and PDS with higher rates in the AD (34.1%) and D (29.9%) groups compared with group A (15.4%, p?<?0.001). In 22.8%, PTSD was subsyndromal (either IDCL or PDS positive) without significant differences between SUD groups, and 18.3% met PTSD trauma criteria A without PTSD (exposure). After controlling for SUD and gender, trauma subgroups significantly differed regarding the onset of alcohol-related symptoms (p?<?0.02), numbers of previous admissions (p?<?0.03), severity of SUD (p?<?0.001), current craving (p?<?0.02), and psychopathology (p?<?0.001). We observed the worst outcome in PTSD, while trauma exposure had no effects. Conclusions:? The prevalence of PTSD is higher in drug than in alcohol dependence. The more strictly PTSD is diagnosed (by interviewer and questionnaire) the more clearly are associations with characteristics of SUD. PTSD seems to be an independent risk factor for an unfavorable outcome of SUD.

AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Aims To Describe injury profile and costs of older person trauma in New South Wales; quantify variations with peer group costs; and identify predictors of higher costs. Methods Nine level 1 New South Wales trauma centres provided data on major traumas (aged ≥55 years) during 2008?2009 financial year. Trauma register and financial data of each institution were linked. Treatment costs were compared with peer group Australian Refined Diagnostic Related Groups costs, on which hospital funding is based. Variables examined through multivariate analyses. Results Six thousand two hundred and eighty-nine patients were admitted for trauma. Most common injury mechanism was falls (74.8%) then road trauma (14.9%). Median patient cost was $7044 (Q1-3: $3405?13 930) and total treatment costs $76 694 252. Treatment costs were $5 813 975 above peer group average. Intensive care unit admission, age, injury severity score, length of stay and traumatic brain injury were independent predictors of increased costs. Conclusion Older person trauma attracts greater costs and length of stay. Cost increases with age and injury severity. Hospital financial information and trauma registry data provides accurate cost information that may inform future funding.

AB  - Summary Injury is a leading cause of death and disability, carrying with it a large economic burden to society. Young adults are over-represented in this patient group, with the highest economic impact due to years of productive life lost. Regional trauma system planning as well as specific, organised, in-hospital trauma team responses are required to ensure that experienced reception, investigation, decision-making and intervention are both timely and optimised. Trauma guidelines and protocols are the best means of ensuring a thorough and safe approach to injured patients overall, although none of these can function as an alternative to the on-site presence of a clinician with surgical experience. In total, all these approaches are essential for minimising avoidable in-hospital deaths and morbidity in severely injured patients.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Victoria's new trauma care system has been followed by reductions in preventable and potentially preventable deaths and in deficiencies contributing to death. This improvement has followed triaging more patients to expanded major trauma services where mortality was already lower rather than to improved results within the major trauma services, metropolitan or rural trauma services or ambulance services, Victoria. The objective of the present study was to identify continuing inadequacies within the individual trauma services and in association with representatives of these services to develop appropriate countermeasures. Methods:? Initially, presentations were made to each trauma service of their fatalities evaluated after introduction of the new trauma system. At separate working party meetings with each service consensus recommendations were finalized and these disseminated to stakeholders. Results:? Recommendations related to the need for Trauma Director/Coordinator appointments at all designated hospitals receiving major trauma, improved facilities and equipment, the trauma team, referral, communications, protocols, a prompting system, education, audit and feedback, infrastructure, staffing, documentation and inter-hospital patient transfer. Conclusion:? Interaction between the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities and Victorian trauma services identified continuing deficiencies in the new trauma care system and developed consensus recommendations to target these problems. These require implementation through the State Trauma Committee.

AB  - SUMMARY The use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in trauma patients is an exciting application because hemorrhage and coagulopathy play prominent roles both in the syndrome of severe hemorrhagic shock and in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anecdotal use of rFVIIa in non-hemophilic trauma patients extends back to 1999, and experience at individual institutions is now in the hundreds of cases. Efficacy in controlling traumatic coagulopathy approaches 80%, with long-term survival of about half of the patients treated. There have been few reports of inappropriate thrombotic events in trauma patients. A single prospective randomized study of rFVIIa in victims of hemorrhagic shock has been completed, with some favorable results. Further trials in hemorrhagic shock are underway in both European and American trauma centers, while a trial in TBI patients will begin within the coming year.

AB  - One of the major ways child sexual abuse can have an impact on individuals is in their later ability to have and maintain fulfilling couple relationships. Survivors may experience avoidance behaviours that become problematic in their adult intimate relationships. If couple therapists fail to focus on these traumatic imprints, the therapy may founder. This paper proposes that a multi-theoretical approach enables the couple therapist to deal with the complex problems such couples present including sexuality and intimacy concerns. Such an approach integrates trauma theory, attachment theory, feminist principles, body-oriented psychotherapy, and systemic couple therapy.

AB  - Abstract:? In this paper I explore the concept of forgiveness as a response to gross human rights violations. I present a conceptual examination of the effects of massive trauma in relation to what I refer to as the ?unfinished business? of trauma. Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of ?bearing witness? about trauma and examine how this process opens up the possibility of reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator. I then argue that, in this context of trauma testimony and witnessing, empathy is essential for the development of remorse on the part of perpetrators, and of forgiveness on the part of victims. Using a case study from South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) I clarify the relationship between empathy and forgiveness, and show how the restorative model of the TRC can open up an ethical space and create the possibility of transformation for victims, perpetrators and bystanders. In my conclusion I suggest that forgiveness in politics is the only action that holds promise for the repair of brokenness in post-conflict societies, particularly if, as in South Africa, victims have to live together with perpetrators and beneficiaries in the same country.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injuries to the musculoskeletal system are extremely common. These injuries are among the short list of medical disorders that may be completely resolved if recognized and appropriately treated. Radiologists have an important role in the diagnosis. In order to identify the abnormality and characterize it correctly, it is essential to be familiar with normal anatomy, protocols for imaging tests, patterns of injury, and implement an organized approach to image interpretation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) devised guidelines for selecting the appropriate imaging test in a patient who sustained musculoskeletal trauma. This chapter deals with different imaging tests, including radiographs, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound. The radiology report needs to be concise, yet include relevant information required for effective clinical management. It is important to be familiar with common fracture classification systems and understand how different grades of injury potentially affect treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an insight into the team approach and diverse roles that are apparent within orthopaedic and musculoskeletal trauma care. An overview of establishing a case for nurse-led services within the specialty is also presented. Care across the continuum is provided by a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals who are able to convey benefits such as continuity of care and formulate a comprehensive, holistic view of the patient's needs. In addition the multi-disciplinary team ensures the availability of a range of skills, support and education for the patient, patient's family/carer.
