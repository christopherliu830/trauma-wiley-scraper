AB  - Abstract Purpose The purposes of this study were to investigate the occurrence and patterns of dental trauma in patients with single mandibular fracture and to evaluate the relationships between dental injury and fracture site of mandible. Materials and Methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 869 patients with mandibular fractures were registered. Only the patients with single mandibular fracture were included. The information and data collected included age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of mandibular fracture, and type of dental injury. Results Single mandibular fractures were sustained in 294 (33.8%) patients. Of these, 43.5% (128 patients) presented with associated dental injuries (509 injured teeth). The patients' male/female ratio was 2.46:1 (91 males and 37 females). Patients in 30?39 year age group possessed the highest risk of suffering dental trauma (odds ratio = 2.004, P = 0.014). Road traffic accidents were the most common mechanism of injury (54, 42.2%). Lower-anterior teeth were more often injured in patients with symphysis fracture (P < 0.001), and patients with condylar fracture more frequently sustained upper-posterior teeth injury (P < 0.001). Lower-posterior teeth injury was mostly found in patients with mandibular body fracture (P < 0.001) or angle fracture (P < 0.001). Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (odds ratio = 3.283, P < 0.001), and the risk was only 0.193-fold in patients who sustained only mandible angle fractures (odds ratio = 0.193, P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence and type of dental injury were significantly related to the fracture site of mandible.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background There is some evidence that antisocial individuals, including young delinquents, are significantly more likely than people in the general population to incur a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Extant studies are hampered by methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of control for confounding effects, and use of single sites and may lack representativeness. Hypothesis The hypothesis for this study is that young offenders with a history of TBI will not only be at higher risk of impulsivity and negative emotionality than their non-injured peers but also that those with TBI will have had more previous victimisation experiences. Methods Data from two sites (Philadelphia, PA and Phoenix, AZ) in a substantial longitudinal, prospective study ? the Pathways to Desistance Study ? were used to compare young people (average age 16?years) who reported TBI with those who did not. Independent variables were behavioural, criminogenic and psychosocial measures. Results Male youths were about twice as likely as young females to report TBI. Such injury was associated with higher impulsivity and negative emotion ratings, even after allowing for potentially confounding factors, including sex. In addition, TBI was independently associated with self-reported experience of victimisation. Conclusions/implications This extends the generalisability of earlier suggestions of a relationship between TBI and offending, and various factors thought likely to mediate the relationship. The implications are, thus, that it is likely to be of practical value to screen young people who get into the criminal justice system for a history of TBI, and thus to allow for more specific tailoring of interventions to reduce the range of associated problems, including likely reoffending.

AB  - Summary Viscoelastic assays such as TEG? and ROTEM? are increasingly used to guide transfusion of blood products. The EXTEM assay maximum clot firmness (MCF) is a ROTEM measure available after 25?29 min used to guide early decisions. EXTEM A10, the clot firmness at 10 min, is an accepted early surrogate, but investigators differ on whether A5, the clot firmness at 5 min, is acceptable. We re-examined this in a retrospective observational analysis of 1146 trauma patients in one centre who had ROTEM data recorded. A5 and A10 both correlated well with maximum clot firmness, with Pearson coefficients of r = 0.92 and r = 0.96, respectively. The correlations of A5, A10 and maximum clot firmness with requirement for massive transfusion were all similarly high, with c-stats of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.90, respectively. The correlations with mortality were also similar but weaker, with c-stats of 0.67, 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. Using a previously validated cut-off of A5 < 35 mm to predict massive transfusion gave a sensitivity of 95%, specificity 83%, positive predictive value 9.3% and negative predictive value 100%. Using a value of A5 < 29 mm, for a pragmatic positive predictive value of 20%, gave a sensitivity of 67%, specificity 95% and negative predictive value 99%. Whether aiming for a high sensitivity or a strong predictive value, A5 was non-inferior to A10 and actually missed fewer cases needing massive transfusion. A5 has similar utility to both A10 and maximum clot firmness as an early measure of clot firmness, and a low A5 value is strongly predictive of the need for massive transfusion.

AB  - AbstractSevere extremity trauma often results in large zones of injury comprising multiple types of tissue and presents many clinical challenges for reconstruction. Considerable investigation is ongoing in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics to improve reconstruction outcomes; however, the vast majority of musculoskeletal trauma models employed for testing the therapeutics consist of single-tissue defects, offering limited utility for investigating strategies for multi-tissue repair. Here we present the first model of composite lower limb bone and nerve injury, characterized by comparison to well-established, single-tissue injury models, using biomaterials-based technologies previously demonstrated to show promise in those models. Quantitative functional outcome measures were incorporated to facilitate assessment of new technologies to promote structural and functional limb salvage following severe extremity trauma. Nerve injury induced significant changes in the morphology and mechanical properties of intact bones. However, BMP-mediated segmental bone regeneration was not significantly impaired by concomitant nerve injury, as evaluated via radiographs, microcomputed tomography (?CT) and biomechanical testing. Neither was nerve regeneration significantly impaired by bone injury when evaluated via histology and electrophysiology. Despite the similar tissue regeneration observed, the composite injury group experienced a marked functional deficit in the operated limb compared to either of the single-tissue injury groups, as determined by quantitative, automated CatWalk gait analysis. As a whole, this study presents a challenging, clinically relevant model of severe extremity trauma to bone and nerve tissue, and emphasizes the need to incorporate quantitative functional outcome measures to benchmark tissue engineering therapies.

AB  - Abstract Large oil spills are disasters associated with psychological effects for exposed communities. The amount of worry that individuals experience after a disaster may be influenced by many factors, such as the type and extent of exposure to disaster impacts, prior trauma, and sociodemographic characteristics. This study examined the nature and predictors of worry about ongoing impacts of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DH) oil spill reported by Gulf of Mexico coastal residents. A random sample of 2,520 adult residents of Gulf of Mexico coastal counties were administered a telephone survey in 2016, including items about persistent worry and exposure to DH impacts, prior trauma, residence at the time of the spill, and sociodemographic characteristics. Respondents varied in the amount of worry they reported about ongoing health, social, and economic impacts. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, higher exposure to the DH oil spill was related to higher levels of worry about ongoing impacts, with past traumatic events related specifically to worry about health impacts. Unexpectedly, those who moved into the region after the spill showed similar levels of worry to residents exposed to the spill, and higher levels than residents who did not recall being exposed to the DH oil spill. This study highlights the impact of the DH oil spill on coastal residents many years after the DH disaster. The findings underscore the need to examine multiple pathways by which individuals experience disasters and for risk researchers to close knowledge gaps about long-term impacts of oil spills within a multi-dimensional framework.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Limited guidelines exist regarding the optimal treatment of traumatic canine elbow luxation, and there is a lack of information on long-term functional outcome. Here we report reduction and stabilisation techniques for a series of traumatic elbow luxations and describe clinical outcome plus long-term questionnaire-based follow-up. METHODS Retrospective review of canine traumatic elbow luxations (2006 to 2013) treated at five referral centres. Data recorded included signalment, luxation aetiology, time to reduction, reduction technique, surgical procedure, post-reduction care and complications. Questionnaire follow-up was attempted for all cases with owners completing the Canine Brief Pain Inventory. RESULTS Thirty-seven dogs were included. The most frequent cause of luxation was road traffic accident (n=22). Twenty cases were treated surgically. Seven dogs suffered major postoperative complications: reluxation (n=6), infection requiring implant removal (n=1). Four of the six reluxations occurred in dogs that had other orthopaedic injuries. Twenty-two owners completed the Canine Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire: there were 13 excellent, 6 very good, 1 good and 2 fair outcomes. Outcome was not associated with the reduction technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Initial closed reduction, followed by surgical stabilisation if unsuccessful, results in good-to-excellent outcomes in the majority of traumatic canine elbow luxations. Reluxation was the most common major complication and there was a higher incidence of reluxation in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries.

AB  - Abstract Trauma to the facial area accounts for a significant number of admissions to the emergency department. Diagnostic imaging is almost always required, and is critical in determining patient management. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) appears consistently in the literature as the gold-standard imaging modality for facial bones, but results in a high radiation dose to the patient. This makes the application and advancement of dose reduction and dose optimisation methods vital. This narrative review presents a critical analysis of the literature concerning diagnostic imaging of facial bone trauma, with an emphasis on dose reduction methods for MDCT. Databases including Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Scopus were used to investigate this topic, with the key words: facial bone trauma, computed tomography (CT) imaging and dose reduction. Exclusion criteria included studies on nasal bone fracturing, dental imaging, elective surgeries and paediatric imaging. The literature shows overwhelming support for MDCT, given its accuracy, efficiency and ease of operation. Noise reducing reconstruction algorithms show promise as a successful method of dose reduction in facial bone imaging. Investigations of more innovative techniques also appear within the literature, including diagnostic cone-beam CT (CBCT), intraoperative CBCT and dual-source CT (DSCT), but further research is required to confirm their clinical value.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the correlation between dental injuries and the pattern of maxillofacial fractures. The correlation with age, gender, trauma mechanism and type of maxillofacial fracture was also investigated. Materials and methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 1131 patients with facial fractures were registered. Of these, 473 presented with associated dental trauma. The information and data collected and analyzed included: age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of facial fracture, type of dental injury, and the relationship between dental injury and facial fracture. Results Dental injury was sustained by 473 patients (41.8%), with a total of 2215 injured teeth. Of the 2215 injured teeth, 1191 (53.8%) were in the maxilla and 1024 (46.2%) in the mandible. Fall from a height had the highest risk of dental injuries (OR = 4.145, P = 0.002). The central incisor was the most injured tooth for both the maxilla (388, 36.2%) and mandible (284, 27.7%). The most common type of dental injury was avulsion (1070, 47.4%). More anterior teeth in the maxilla were of crown fracture, avulsion, and intrusion than that in the mandible, whereas more anterior teeth in the mandible were of subluxation and concussion than that in the maxilla. Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (OR = 2.817, P < 0.001), only 0.236-fold risk in patients who sustained only mandible angle fracture (P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence of dental trauma is significantly related to the pattern and position of the maxillofacial fractures.

AB  - Summary This chapter considers the various injuries that occur to the hard and soft intraoral tissues and the options that are available to treat those injuries on an immediate, midterm, and long-term basis. It discusses the equipment needed to develop a pitch-side emergency dental kit, for any dentist or associated professional who may be able to give immediate relief and treatment to an injured athlete. Trauma to the supporting structures of the teeth can be classified as: concussion, lateral luxation, subluxation, intrusion, extrusion, and avulsion. The chapter outlines the types of root fracture commonly seen, looks at the response of the tissues to root fractures, and discusses the treatment options following a root fracture. It deals with the splinting techniques that provide support for traumatized teeth during the initial healing phase. Prolonged use of a splint can result in ankylosis of the tooth, which may be transient unless the injury to the cementum is extensive.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injury of the esophagus is extremely uncommon. The aims of this study were to use the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS) database to identify clinical factors predictive of esophageal trauma, and to report the morbidity and mortality of this injury. A cross-sectional review of patients presenting to 20 Level I trauma centers in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2010 was performed. We compared clinical and demographic variables between patients with and without esophageal trauma both prior to and after arrival in the emergency room (ER). Primary mechanism of injury and clinical outcomes were analyzed. There were 231?694 patients and 327 (0.14%) had esophageal trauma. Patients with esophageal trauma were considerably younger than those without this injury. The risk of esophageal trauma was markedly increased in males (odds ratio [OR] = 2.62 [CI 1.98?3.47]). The risk was also increased in African Americans (OR = 4.61 [CI 3.65?5.82]). Most cases were from penetrating gunshot and stab wounds. Only 34 (10.4%) of esophageal trauma patients underwent an upper endoscopy; diagnosis was usually made by CT, surgery, or autopsy. Esophageal trauma patients were more likely to require surgery (35.8% vs. 12.5%; P < 0.001). Patients with esophageal trauma had a substantially higher mortality than those without the injury (20.5% vs. 1.4%; P < 0.005). In logistic regression modeling, traumatic injury of the esophagus (OR = 3.43 [2.50?4.71]) and male gender (OR = 1.52 [1.46?1.59]) were independently associated with mortality. For those patients with esophageal trauma, there was an association between trauma severity and mortality (OR = 1.10 [1.07?1.12]) but not for undergoing surgery within the first 24 hours of hospitalization (OR = 0.84; 0.39?1.83). Our study on traumatic injury of the esophagus is in concordance with previous studies demonstrating that this injury is rare but carries considerable morbidity (?46%) and mortality (?20%). The injury has a higher morbidity and mortality when the thoracic esophagus is involved compared to the cervical esophagus alone. The injury most commonly occurs in younger, Black males suffering gunshot wounds. Efforts to control gun violence in Pennsylvania are of paramount importance.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The objective was to determine if hospital admission of children with blunt abdominal trauma for observation of possible intraabdominal injury (IAI) is necessary after a normal abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in the emergency department (ED). Methods:? The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of children less than 18?years of age with blunt abdominal trauma who underwent an abdominal CT scan in the ED. Abdominal CT scans were obtained with intravenous contrast but no oral contrast. The decision to hospitalize the patient was made by the attending emergency physician (EP) with the trauma or pediatric surgery teams. An abnormal abdominal CT scan was defined by the presence of any visualized IAI or findings suggestive of possible IAI (e.g., intraperitoneal fluid without solid organ injury). Patients were followed to determine if IAI was later diagnosed and the need for acute therapeutic intervention if IAI was present. Results:? A total of 1,295 patients underwent abdominal CT, and 1,085 (84%) patients had normal abdominal CT scans in the ED and make up the study population. Seven-hundred thirty-seven (68%) were hospitalized, and 348 were discharged to home. None of the 348 patients discharged home and 2 of the 737 hospitalized patients were identified with an IAI after a normal initial abdominal CT. The IAIs in patients with normal initial CT scans included a 10-year-old with a mesenteric hematoma and serosal tear at laparotomy and a 10-year-old with a perinephric hematoma on repeat CT. Neither underwent specific therapy. The negative predictive value (NPV) of a normal abdominal CT scan for IAI was 99.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?99.3% to 100%). Conclusions:? Children with blunt abdominal trauma and a normal abdominal CT scan in the ED are at very low risk of having a subsequently diagnosed IAI and are very unlikely to require a therapeutic intervention. Hospitalization of children for evaluation of possible undiagnosed IAI after a normal abdominal CT scan has a low yield and is generally unnecessary.

AB  - Abstract The paper explores the impact of the dissociated feminine principle resulting from the trauma of cultural displacement in a young Chinese woman keen to embrace a modern Western identity. A case study illustrates the outcome of the client both consciously and unconsciously rejecting the traditional stereotypical Chinese feminine identity and instead embracing the distorted, yet seductive, image of the Western (Caucasian) woman as independent, intellectual and confident. Her defensive denial of the traditional feminine was dealt with by intellectualising both personal and professional relationships. Then, unconsciously, the dissociated traditional feminine was projected into a separate aspect of her identity that held the traumatised feelings. The intellectualisation was eventually understood as being a necessary defence to cope with the cultural as well as geographical dislocation trauma. And with this realisation a space was created to accept and integrate the denied feminine?in a literal as well as a symbolic manner.

AB  - Abstract Aims A mixed-methods study details a multidisciplinary team's efforts to assess and transform police response to sexual assault in a mid-size community. Method A police department-wide survey (n?=?331) determined baseline levels of officer exposure to trauma-informed training, rape myth acceptance, and awareness of community and nationwide sexual assault movements to understand officer attitudes towards factors influencing sexual assault investigations. These data, in conjunction with SAMHSA's (2012) trauma-informed assumptions, were leveraged to develop and adopt trauma-informed policies that would enhance the police department's response to sexual assault. Results At baseline, few officers reported receiving trauma-informed interviewing training (21.8%) or having knowledge of local SAK, #MeToo, or #TimesUp movements (10.0%, 7.2%, 3.9%, respectively). Chi-square analyses suggested officer knowledge of community SAK movement, personal investment in learning about sexual assault, and understanding of trauma were higher in officers with versus without training; of concern, officers with more sexual assaults on their caseload were more likely to endorse rape myths. Training understanding was related to lower rape myth acceptance. Conclusions Policy changes, including adding trauma-informed training to the Police Academy, were implemented by the MDT to promote a system-wide trauma-informed approach to sexual assault and ensure community safety.

AB  - Background: The kidney is the most frequently injured abdominal organ in children and controversy surrounds some aspects of management. This study looks at the experience of our institution and reviews the literature towards developing an optimal strategy for managing this common childhood injury. Methods: One hundred and forty-two cases of paediatric renal trauma are reported from a catchment population of approximately 240 000 children < 14 years of age over a 12 year period. Injuries were classified into four groups: groups 1 and 2 were regarded as minor injuries (85%) and group 3 and 4 injuries were those with extravasation of urine or pedicle injury (15%). Results: The male:female ratio was 2:I with an average age of 8.5 years. Major renal injuries frequently required large amounts of resuscitation fluid. Associated injuries were present in 41% of all cases with an average of two injuries each. With one exception in each case, the development of complications and the need for early surgery were confined to major injuries. There were no long-term complications. The renal loss rate was 2.1%. Conclusions: Renal injuries can be usefully classified into major or minor by determining whether extravasation of urine or pedicle injury is present. Minor injuries should be managed conservatively. Major injuries causing ongoing haemorrhage require urgent surgery. Other major injuries should be imaged regularly and patients with more severe urinomas benefit from early elective surgery at 2?5 days. In cases where extravasation of urine has not shown clear evidence of settling by 5 days' elective surgery probably results in less morbidity and fewer complications than protracted conservative treatment.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma is an irreversible pathology which after occurrence is characterized by life long debilitating effects. The objective of the study was to measure the prevalence of trauma in anterior permanent teeth among children and associations with independent variables. A total of 453 5th and 6th grade Arab Eastern Jerusalem schoolchildren participated. Trauma, incisal overjet and lip competence were measured by one examiner in the schools. Reasons and location of trauma were assessed by telephone interviews with the parents. The total prevalence of dental trauma was 33.8%. Severe trauma prevalence (involving dentine) was 12.6%. Severe trauma was more prevalent among boys (OR?=?2.03, P?=?0.026); children with lip incompetence (OR?=?2.71, P?=?0.001); and those with an overjet of 4mm or more (OR?=?3.73, P?<?0.001). The main reported causes for dental trauma were falling (29.1%), sports (16.4%), violence (20%) and playing (20%). According to the parents? reports, more fall-related injuries were reported at home, more sport injuries at school, more ?playing? injuries ?outside? (P?<?0.001). Combination of results with a previous study among Jewish schoolchildren demonstrated: severe dental trauma was related to overjet (OR?=?1.73, P?=?0.002), lip incompetence (OR?=?2.19, P?<?0.001), gender (OR for males?=?1.54, P?=?0.005), but not to ethnicity (Arab or Jewish). The reasons for trauma observed in this study were potentially preventable. A community effort should therefore be pursued, with the aim of educating sports teachers, teachers, health personnel and schoolchildren regarding awareness of dental trauma prevention, with emphasis on utilizing mouthguards and early orthodontic intervention, when financially possible.

AB  - The management of splenic trauma at the Royal Children's Hospital from January 1973 to January 1984 is reviewed. During the period studied there was a trend toward non-operative management in uncomplicated cases, and where laparotomy was required splenic repair rather than splenectomy was performed. Guidelines are given for the selection of patients who can be treated in safety without operation.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To investigate the admission characteristics and hospital outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients admitted to intensive units (ICUs) after major trauma. Design, setting Retrospective analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database data from 92 Australian ICUs for the 6-year period, 2010?2015. Participants Patients older than 17 years of age admitted to public hospital ICUs with a primary diagnosis of trauma. Main outcome measures ICU and overall hospital lengths of stay, hospital discharge destination, and ICU and overall hospital mortality rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Results 23 804 people were admitted to Australian public hospital ICUs after major trauma; 1754 (7.4%) were Indigenous Australians. The population-standardised incidence of admissions was consistently higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians (847 per million v 251 per million population; incidence ratio, 3.37; 95% CI, 3.19?3.57). Overall hospital mortality rates were similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82?1.31). Indigenous patients were more likely than non-Indigenous patients to be discharged to another hospital (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72?0.96) less likely to be discharged home (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04?1.31). Conclusion The population rate of trauma-related ICU admissions was substantially higher for Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients, but hospital mortality rates after ICU admission were similar. Indigenous patients were more likely to be discharged to a another hospital and less likely to be discharged home than non-Indigenous patients.

PY  - 2002
AB  - In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients suffering from the psychological effects of trauma. This paper outlines various theoretical models of psychological trauma, selected because they can specifically encompass both the external aetiology (i.e. the traumatic event) and also explain (to a greater or lesser extent) the enormous range of reactions to that event. These models are critically discussed in terms of their implications for counselling practice, and as guides to further research. Examples are given of ways in which the author has drawn on different theoretical frameworks to inform her own therapeutic practice in work with people experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Abstract The clinical evaluations of 77 adult psychiatric outpatients reporting memories of childhood trauma were reviewed. A majority of patients reported some degree of continuous recall. Roughly half (53%) said they had never forgotten the traumatic events. Two smaller groups described a mixture of continuous and delayed recall (17%) or a period of complete amnesia followed by delayed recall (16%). Patients with and without delayed recall did not differ significantly in the proportions reporting corroboration of their memories from other sources. Idiosyncratic, trauma-specific reminders and recent life crises were most commonly cited as precipitants to delayed recall. A previous psychotherapy was cited as a factor in a minority (28%) of cases. By contrast, intrusion of new memories after a period of amnesia was frequently cited as a factor leading to the decision to seek psychotherapy. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the role of psychotherapy in the process of recovering traumatic memories.
