AB  - Compared to research on displaced persons whose refugee status has been endorsed prior to arriving in Western countries, there is little systematic information available about levels of past trauma, postmigration living difficulties and psychiatric symptoms amongst asylum-seekers who claim refugee status only after arrival. Asylum-seekers, authorized refugees and immigrants of Tamil background were recruited by personal contact and mail-out in Sydney, Australia. A total of 62 subjects, constituting approximately 60% of the estimated pool of Tamil asylum-seekers, agreed to participate in the study. They returned statistically significantly higher scores than immigrants (n=104) on measures of past trauma, symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, and on all dimensions of postmigration difficulties. Asylum-seekers did not differ from refugees (n=30) on measures of past trauma or psychiatric symptoms, but they scored higher on selective components of postmigration stress relating to difficulties associated with their insecure residency status. Although limited by sampling and diagnostic constraints, the present study suggests that asylum-seekers may be a high-risk group in relation to ongoing stress in the postmigration period.

AB  - Abstract The clinical evaluations of 77 adult psychiatric outpatients reporting memories of childhood trauma were reviewed. A majority of patients reported some degree of continuous recall. Roughly half (53%) said they had never forgotten the traumatic events. Two smaller groups described a mixture of continuous and delayed recall (17%) or a period of complete amnesia followed by delayed recall (16%). Patients with and without delayed recall did not differ significantly in the proportions reporting corroboration of their memories from other sources. Idiosyncratic, trauma-specific reminders and recent life crises were most commonly cited as precipitants to delayed recall. A previous psychotherapy was cited as a factor in a minority (28%) of cases. By contrast, intrusion of new memories after a period of amnesia was frequently cited as a factor leading to the decision to seek psychotherapy. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the role of psychotherapy in the process of recovering traumatic memories.

AB  - Introduction Haemophilia is one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders in the Emergency Department (ED). The most dangerous site of bleeding is the central nervous system. Aims To describe the characteristics of haemophiliacs arrived to our ED following a head trauma and to analyse the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods Retrospective, analytical, observational study, conducted in a Paediatric ED. We included haemophilic patients aged from birth to 16 years who consulted after a head trauma over a 6-year period. Data collected included age, type of haemophilia and head trauma, symptoms, prophylaxis status, CT imaging, treatment and number of visits to the ED. Results About 46 males and 85 episodes were analysed. The median age was 2.38 years. Severe haemophilia A was the most frequent type of disease (50%). All head injuries were mild, and the most frequent mechanism was a collision with an object (38.8%). In 62 episodes (72.9%) the patients were asymptomatic. The rest 23 events had symptomatology, being the most common headache (26%), emesis (21.7%) and drowsiness (17.4%). Head CT was obtained in 31 episodes, founding altered results in 10 (6 of them corresponding to ICH). All the patients with ICH had symptomatology. About 37 episodes required admission. Conclusion Intracranial haemorrhage is one of the most dangerous events in haemophiliacs and it may occur after a head trauma. Our study suggests that, in case of head trauma, CT must be obtained in symptomatic patients and in those with additional risk factors. Asymptomatic patients must have prolonged observation.

AB  - Objective:? Little is known about the relationship of assaultive trauma to clinical and functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder. Method:? We assessed trauma histories in a cohort of 109 first-admission bipolar patients with psychosis using structured interviews and medical records. Assaultive trauma included rape, physical attacks, and physical threats. Outcome was assessed using standardized ratings. Results:? Forty percent reported a history of assaultive trauma, mostly in childhood (≤16?years). Exposed patients were more symptomatic at each follow-up than unexposed. Sixteen percent of exposed patients remitted after one episode compared with 38.5% of the non-exposed. Patients exposed as adults were the most symptomatic at 6?months, while patients exposed in childhood were the most symptomatic at 24?months. Conclusion:? Our findings supported the salient role of trauma history as a risk factor for poor course in severe bipolar disorder. Given the high prevalence of such exposure, clinical awareness in first-admission psychotic bipolar patients is critical.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - A timely determination of the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prerequisite for efficient service delivery and prevention. We provide a risk estimate tool allowing a calculation of individuals? PTSD likelihood from early predictors. Members of the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) shared individual participants? item-level data from ten longitudinal studies of civilian trauma survivors admitted to acute care centers in six countries. Eligible participants (N=2,473) completed an initial clinical assessment within 60 days of trauma exposure, and at least one follow-up assessment 4-15 months later. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) evaluated PTSD symptom severity and diagnostic status at each assessment. Participants? education, prior lifetime trauma exposure, marital status and socio-economic status were assessed and harmonized across studies. The study's main outcome was the likelihood of a follow-up PTSD given early predictors. The prevalence of follow-up PTSD was 11.8% (9.2% for male participants and 16.4% for females). A logistic model using early PTSD symptom severity (initial CAPS total score) as a predictor produced remarkably accurate estimates of follow-up PTSD (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.976). Adding respondents? female gender, lower education, and exposure to prior interpersonal trauma to the model yielded higher PTSD likelihood estimates, with similar model accuracy (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.941). The current model could be adjusted for other traumatic circumstances and accommodate risk factors not captured by the ICPP (e.g., biological, social). In line with their use in general medicine, risk estimate models can inform clinical choices in psychiatry. It is hoped that quantifying individuals? PTSD risk will be a first step towards systematic prevention of the disorder.

AB  - Abstract??? The aim of this cross-sectional epidemiological survey was to assess the prevalence of dental trauma in athletes representing 42 countries competing at the most recent Pan American Games (XV Pan Am) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in July of 2007, and to determine prior use and type of mouthguard among this group of athletes. The examiners participated in standardization and calibration training sessions before the field phase began. Invitations were sent to >5500 participating athletes competing in 41 sports and to the Medical Committee of the Pan American Sports Organization before and during the XV PAN. A convenience sample of 409 athletes was recruited. After signing an informed consent, all athletes answered a questionnaire. Data were collected at the clinical examination and recorded on a specific trauma form. The mean age of the athletes was 24.4?±?5.3?years. Males comprised 55% of the sample; females 45%. The prevalence of dental trauma among the athletes was 49.6% (n?=?203) with no gender-based differences. Most of these injuries (63.6%) were related to activities during training or competition. Sports with the highest injury prevalence were wrestling (83.3%), boxing (73.7%), basketball (70.6%) and karate (60%). The most common injury was enamel fracture (39.8%); root fracture was the least common (0.4%). The teeth most affected were the maxillary permanent central incisors (n?=?113), followed by the mandibular central incisors (n?=?19). Based on the results of this study, nearly one-half of the subjects had experienced previous dental trauma; the majority related to sports activities. Furthermore, only 17% of the athletes reported prior mouthguard use; the most frequent mouthguards reported were boil-and-bite. These results suggest the importance of enhanced educational efforts and the use of properly fitted mouthguards to reduce dental trauma among athletes in international sports competition, especially in sports where mouthguards are not mandatory.

AB  - ABSTRACT Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of affective disorders in children. To investigate the mechanisms by which prenatal trauma and/or maternal PTSD affect brain development and behavior we established a mouse model of prenatal traumatic (PT) experience based on the application of an electric foot shock to C57Bl/6N female mice on the gestational day 12 during their pregnancy. The model is based on a previously validated animal model of PTSD. We found high anxiety levels and poor maternal care along with reduced serum prolactin and increased corticosterone levels in dams following maternal trauma (MT). PT-pups were born smaller and stayed smaller throughout their life. We show increased time and frequency of ultrasonic calls in PT-pups when separated from the mothers on the postnatal day (PND) 9. Cross-fostering experiments reveal lower anxiety levels in PT pups raised by healthy mothers as compared to trauma-naive pups raised by MT-dams. Importantly, the combination of prenatal trauma and being raised by a traumatized mother leads to: (1) the highest corticosterone levels in pups, (2) longest USV-call time and (3) highest anxiety levels in comparison to other experimental groups. Our data indicates a distinct change in maternal care following MT which is possibly associated with trauma-induced decrease in prolactin levels. Furthermore, we show that maternal behavior is crucial for the development of the offspring anxiety and specific aspects in maternal care overwrite to a significant extend the effects of in utero and postnatal environment. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Greater emphasis is being placed on multidisciplinary team (MDT) working for complex clinical presentations in the NHS. Whilst such integrated working has the potential for considerable benefits for clients, it also raises the issue of constructive and destructive decision-making within teams that bring together different individuals and professional groupings. This paper outlines a model which attempts to address how individuals in a MDT can hold onto their own personal and professional identity whilst simultaneously adopting a team identity. Thus how the ?me? and the ?we? operate to assist the client. The model, termed the ?Narcissistic-We?, was developed out of multidisciplinary team working with traumatised individuals in Belfast and has particular relevance for decision-making in MDTs. The model argues that MDTs operate along two continua, the first running from ?me? to ?team? and the second running from ?me? to ?client?. When overlaid these continua create four quadrants. It is suggested that no clinical decisions should be made in the ?Me-Me? quadrant and most decisions should come from the ?Client-Team? quadrant. However, there are times when decisions are required from the ?Me-Client? and ?Me-Team? quadrants. The development, practical implications and research possibilities of this model are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adversity early in life can disrupt the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes and increase risk for negative health outcomes. The interplay between these axes and the environment is complex, and understanding needs to be advanced by the investigation of the multiple hormonal relationships underlying these processes. The current study examined basal hormonal associations between morning levels of cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone in a cohort of adolescents (mean age 15.56 years). The moderating influence of childhood adversity was also examined, as indexed by self-reported trauma (at mean age 14.91), and observed maternal aggressive parenting (at mean age 12.41). Between-person regressions revealed significant associations between hormones that were moderated by both measures of adversity. In females, all hormones positively covaried, but also interacted with adversity, such that positive covariation was typically only present when levels of trauma and/or aggressive parenting were low. In males, hormonal associations and interactions were less evident; however, interactions were detected for cortisol-testosterone ? positively covarying at high levels of aggressive parenting but negatively covarying at low levels ? and DHEA-cortisol ? similarly positively covarying at high levels of parental aggression. These results demonstrate associations between adrenal and gonadal hormones and the moderating role of adversity, which is likely driven by feedback mechanisms, or cross-talk, between the axes. These findings suggest that hormonal changes may be the pathway through which early life adversity alters physiology and increases health risks, but does so differentially in the sexes; however further study is necessary to establish causation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives The current study examined shame in a clinical sample recovering from a first episode of psychosis by focusing on the contribution of different types of shame to post-psychotic trauma while controlling for current affective symptoms. Design The study used a cross-sectional correlational design. Method Fifty individuals who met the criteria for a psychotic disorder whose acute psychotic symptoms were in remission completed measures of internal and external shame associated with psychosis, general shame, post-psychotic trauma, and depression. Results Post-psychotic trauma symptoms were correlated with internal and external shame associated with psychosis and general shame. However, the relation between post-psychotic trauma and external shame associated with psychosis remained after controlling for general shame and current affective symptoms. In addition, internal shame had a stronger association with depression. Thus, internal and external shame due to psychosis had different associations with different types of post-psychotic emotional dysfunction. Conclusions The results support the importance of assessing shame as a multi-faceted construct and suggest that assessing shame directly associated with mental illness is a worthwhile endeavour. Practitioner Points Assessing different types of shame following psychosis can inform assessments, formulations, and interventions with post-psychotic trauma. Our results support the application of Compassionate Mind Therapy to psychosis. However, we did not assess self-criticism or self-reassurance. We also did not investigate the relation between specific psychotic symptoms and different types of shame.

AB  - Abstract? Background: Rupture of the innominate artery is the second most common intrathoracic arterial injury from blunt trauma. It is frequently accompanied by major trauma to other organs. The traditional management is expeditious surgical repair. Methods: Three patients presented to the Emergency Department after motor vehicle collisions with traumatic rupture of the innominate artery from 2001 to 2003. One patient presented with an isolated innominate artery injury. The other two patients presented with multi-system trauma. All patients underwent surgical repair; however, repair was individualized in each case. Results: Diagnosis was obtained via arteriography in all patients after the admission chest radiographs suggested mediastinal injury. In the patient with isolated traumatic innominate artery rupture, urgent repair was performed. In the remaining two, the repair was intentionally delayed (hospital day 4 and 19) until they stabilized or recovered from other injuries or complications. In one of these patients, repair was delayed after an endovascular repair failed. In both patients who underwent delayed repair, mean arterial pressure was maintained at <70 mmHg with beta-blockade. All patients underwent repair without cardiopulmonary bypass and were monitored for adequate cerebral perfusion pressures by measuring the right carotid artery stump pressure. Successful repair was achieved in all the three patients without postoperative complications or mortality. Conclusions: Rupture of the innominate artery from blunt trauma is an infrequent but life-threatening injury that mandates repair. In patients with isolated injuries, prompt intervention is warranted. However, intentional delayed repair may be a practical alternative for those patients with multi-system trauma.

AB  - The first in this series of five papers concerns the evaluation and management of renal injuries. The authors of this paper come from four continents and seven countries, and they reviewed all papers on renal injury published between 1966 and April 2002. The results of the authors? deliberations are present here as a consensus document. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal evaluation and management of renal injuries by review of the world's English-language literature on the subject. METHODS A consensus conference convened by the World Health Organization and the Societé Internationale d?Urologie met to critically review reports of the diagnosis and treatment of renal trauma. The English-language literature about renal trauma was identified using Medline, and additional cited works not detected in the initial search obtained. Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of renal trauma were made with reference to a five-point scale. RESULTS There were many Level 3 and 4 citations, few Level 2, and one Level 1 which supported clinical practice patterns. Findings of nearly 200 reviewed citations are summarized. CONCLUSIONS Published reports on renal trauma still rely heavily on expert opinion and single-institution retrospective case series. Prospective trials of the most significant issues, when possible, might improve the quality of evidence that dictates the behaviour of practitioners.

AB  - Abstract Objective Women veterans have a higher prevalence of chronic pain relative to men. One hypothesis is that differential combat and traumatic sexual experiences and attenuated levels of social support between men and women may differentially contribute to the development and perpetuation of pain. This investigation examined [1] gender differences in trauma, social support, and family conflict among veterans with chronic pain, and [2] whether trauma, social support, and family conflict were differentially associated with pain severity, pain interference, and depressive symptom severity as a function of gender. Methods Participants included 460 veterans (56% female) who served in support of recent conflicts, and who endorsed pain lasting 3 months or longer. Participants completed a baseline survey during participation in a longitudinal investigation. Self-report measures included pain severity, pain interference, depressive symptom severity, exposure to traumatic life events, emotional and tangible support, and family conflict. Results Relative to men, women veterans reporting chronic pain evidenced higher rates of childhood interpersonal trauma (51% vs 34%; P?<?0.001) and military sexual trauma (54% vs 3%; P?<?0.001), along with lower levels of combat exposure (10.00 vs 16.85, P?<?0.001). Gender was found to be a moderator of the association of marital status, combat exposure, childhood interpersonal trauma, and family conflict with pain interference. It also moderated family conflict in the prediction of depressive symptoms. Conclusions Results underscore the potential importance of developing and testing gender specific models of chronic pain that consider the relative roles of trauma, social support, and family conflict.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Patient outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly variable. The underlying pathophysiology of this is poorly understood, but inflammation is potentially an important factor. Microglia orchestrate many aspects of this response. Their activation can be studied in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C](R)PK11195 (PK). In this study, we investigate whether an inflammatory response to TBI persists, and whether this response relates to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive function. Methods: Ten patients, studied at least 11 months after moderate to severe TBI, underwent PK PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging (including diffusion tensor imaging). PK binding potentials were calculated in and around the site of focal brain damage, and in selected distant and subcortical brain regions. Standardized neuropsychological tests were administered. Results: PK binding was significantly raised in the thalami, putamen, occipital cortices, and posterior limb of the internal capsules after TBI. There was no increase in PK binding at the original site of focal brain injury. High PK binding in the thalamus was associated with more severe cognitive impairment, although binding was not correlated with either the time since the injury or the extent of structural brain damage. Interpretation: We demonstrate that increased microglial activation can be present up to 17 years after TBI. This suggests that TBI triggers a chronic inflammatory response particularly in subcortical regions. This highlights the importance of considering the response to TBI as evolving over time and suggests interventions may be beneficial for longer intervals after trauma than previously assumed.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

AB  - Abstract??? Background/Aims:? The stability of immobilization devices varies from flexible to rigid, depending on the trauma. We evaluated the rigidity of various commonly used splints in vitro Material and Methods:? An acrylic resin model was used. The central incisors simulated injured teeth, with increased vertical and horizontal mobility. The lateral incisors and canines stimulated uninjured teeth. Tooth mobility was measured with the Periotest? device. Vertical and horizontal measurements were made before and after splinting, and the difference between values was defined as the splint effect. We evaluated 4 composite splints, 3 wire-composite splints, a titanium trauma splint, a titanium ring splint, a bracket splint, and 2 Schuchardt splints Results:? For all injured teeth and all splints, there was a significant splint effect for the vertical and horizontal dimensions (P?<?0.05). For injured teeth, the composite splints produced the largest changes in vertical tooth mobility; wire-composite splints 1 and 2, using orthodontic wires, produced the smallest vertical splint effects. For uninjured teeth, the Schuchardt 1 splint and the bracket splint produced the largest splint effects; wire-composite splints 1 and 2 produced only a slight change in tooth mobility. Composite splints 2 and 3 produced the largest horizontal splint effects for injured teeth, and the 4 composite splints produced the largest horizontal splint effects for uninjured teeth. The most horizontally flexible splints were the titanium trauma splint and wire-composite splints 1 and 2. Conclusions:? According to the current guidelines and within the limits of an in vitro study, it can be stated that flexible or semirigid splints such as the titanium trauma splint and wire-composite splints 1 and 2 are appropriate for splinting teeth with dislocation injuries and root fractures, whereas rigid splints such as wire-composite splint 3 and the titanium ring splint can be used to treat alveolar process fractures.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between psychosocial reaction, coping behavior and trauma among natural disaster survivors in West Java, Indonesia. One hundred and one subjects were studied. The roles of coping behavior as a moderating factor were also tested. Psychosocial reaction during disaster and coping behavior were significantly correlated with trauma. Hierarchical regression analysis found that coping behavior was a significant potential moderating variable in terms of correlation between psychosocial reaction and trauma after a natural disaster.

AB  - Abstract The meaning of trauma within psychology has for a long time been viewed mostly from a ?pathologising? standpoint. Viewed as pathology, people's trauma may become understood using a singular lens thereby leaving out broader contextual (social, environmental, political, historical, economical etc.) aspects that have been shown to play a role in the subjective experience of various forms of suffering. Psychology has for a long time been quick to diagnose victims of traumatic experiences from an individualistic perspective, almost always positioning the ?problem? within the person. As a result of the Vietnam War, World Wars I and II and the Holocaust, the rise in the diagnosing of PTSD gave way to the labelling of trauma. Within psychology, post-traumatic stress disorder has become the way to operationalise suffering, and I would like to argue that this occludes how suffering lives in a family, a community and in gendered bodies. The gendering of trauma continues to be a silenced space. There is a need to highlight and acknowledge the gendered nature of suffering which begs for trauma to be understood in context and not as an isolated act or occurrence affecting the individual. Women have remained, and in many ways continue to remain, silenced with minimal opportunities to name the world for themselves. This paper seeks to provide a critical analysis of the notion of trauma (and its intersection with gender) that arises from conflict and post-conflict situations.

Cohen G, Campbell PM, Rossouw PE, Buschang PH Purpose??? To experimentally determine the effects of increased surgical trauma on the rates of tooth movement and apical root resorption. Two surgical techniques for rapid protraction of multi-rooted teeth in foxhound dogs immediately following premolar extraction were compared. Methods??? Split-mouth design to randomly assign two surgical techniques [periodontal ligament distraction (RAP side) and a modified form of dentoalveolar distraction (RAP+ side)] to the maxillary quadrants. First premolars were extracted, and second premolars were protracted 0.5?mm per day for 15?days using a custom made jack-screw distractor. Serial caliper and radiographic measurements were performed to quantify tooth movements and apical root resorption. Results??? Both techniques demonstrated significant movement of the crown and apex. The second premolar crowns were protracted significantly more on the RAP+ side (2.9?mm) than on the RAP (1.8?mm) side. The premolars on both sides demonstrated significant tipping (4.3 and 3.9 degrees for the RAP+ and RAP sides, respectively). The distal root apex showed almost twice as much apical root resorption than the mesial root apex, but resorption was limited (<0.16?mm) and not statistically different between sides. Conclusions??? Increased surgical trauma increased the rate and, ultimately, the amount of tooth movement. The heavy forces used to protract the teeth produced statistically, but not clinically, significant apical root resorption on the mesial and distal roots of the maxillary second premolars.
