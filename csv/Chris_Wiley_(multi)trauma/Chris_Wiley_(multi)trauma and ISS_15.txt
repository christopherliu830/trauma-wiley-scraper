AB  - Abstract Aims Functional asymmetry of pelvic floor innervation has been shown to exist in healthy subjects, and has been proposed to be a predictor of increased risk for fecal incontinence in case of trauma. However, this remains to be shown for different clinical conditions such as traumatic childbirth. Methods A conventional surface EMG system was used to assess the innervation of the external anal sphincter. A symmetry index was used to define the relative EMG amplitude asymmetry of the external anal sphincter between 0 (symmetric) and 1 (asymmetric). Three cohorts were studied: 40 nulliparous women in the third trimester (Study 1), 15 primiparous women within 6 months following vaginal delivery without clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (Study 2), and 50 women after childbirth-related third or fourth degree perineal tear 6?12 months postpartum (Study 3). Furthermore, all women underwent conventional anorectal manometry. Results Sixteen or forty nulliparous women reported signs of fecal incontinence; however, relative asymmetry was not correlated to symptom severity (P?=?0.345), and not to manometric measures (Study 1). In Study 2, Women who had suffered clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (P?=?0.07) tended to have a stronger association between incontinence and asymmetry. In Study 3, 19/50 women reported moderate to severe incontinence. Asymmetry and symptom severity were significantly correlated (P?<?0.001). Patients with incontinence had a significantly higher asymmetry score than their continent counterparts. Conclusion Functional asymmetry of anal sphincter innervation is significantly associated with incontinence symptoms, but only after childbirth-related sphincter injuries and therefore, should be regarded as an additional risk factor.

AB  - Background Prehospital management of the traumatically injured patient has evolved significantly since the organization of emergency medical services across the United States in the 1970s. Initially focusing on the utilization of crystalloid solutions to restore shed blood volume, robust military and civilian trauma experiences led to a modern day shift towards balanced blood component and ultimately whole blood use for immediate volume replacement. In addition, prehospital transfusion or remote damage control resuscitation (RDRC) has been widely adopted. This has led to point of injury resuscitation using blood products both in the United States and abroad. Objectives This article will review the evolution of civilian and military prehospital resuscitation as well as the current practice of prehospital whole blood transfusion in the civilian trauma population in the United States. Additionally, we will provide an overview of our regional trauma system's use of whole blood with focus on the programme infrastructure, donor programme, product rotation schedule and logistical challenges. Finally, we provide three case report examples of the effective use of whole blood in our civilian emergency medical services (EMS) programs.

In one case, the tics were accompanied by marked obsessive-compulsive behavior. All patients were involved in motor vehicle accidents resulting in closed craniocerebral trauma. The latency of onset between head trauma and the movement disorder varied between 1 day and a few months. Magnetic resonance imaging, which was performed in all three patients, did not detect any structural lesions of the basal ganglia or the brainstem. Extensive bifrontal leukoencephalopathy was found in one patient who suffered severe head trauma.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the relation between acculturation and socioecological contexts of migrants with a personal trauma history living in the community. This study represents an extension of our previous work and aimed to unpack the perceived neighborhood ethnic density (ED) effect and examine the moderating role of ED on the acculturation?adjustment relation in a community sample of migrants with trauma (N?=?99) from developing countries residing in Montreal, Canada. ED was protective against general psychological distress but did not predict posttraumatic symptoms. The ED effect was mediated via degree of acculturation to the French?Canadian mainstream cultural context, rather than heritage acculturation, social support, or discrimination. Moreover, protective effects of French?Canadian mainstream acculturation for depressive symptoms and life satisfaction were found under high but not low ED conditions. Similarities and differences with our previous research as well as theoretical and prevention implications are discussed from a person?environment interaction perspective.

AB  - Abstract Background Supported self-management (SSM) is a recognized approach for people with long-term conditions but, despite the prevalence of unmet needs, little is known about its role for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Objectives To codesign an SSM intervention with people with TBI and evaluate feasibility of implementation through multidisciplinary staff across a trauma pathway. Setting and participants People who had previously been admitted to a Major Trauma Centre following TBI and family members participated in a series of codesign activities. Staff attended SSM workshops and used the intervention with patients in acute and rehabilitation settings. Methods We used Normalization Process Theory constructs to guide and interpret implementation. Knowledge, beliefs and confidence of staff in SSM were assessed through pre- and post-training questionnaires, and staff, patients' and families' experiences were explored through semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, and clinical measures were mapped against a matched sample. Results Codesigned resources were created and used within an SSM approach for which 110 staff participated in training. Evaluation demonstrated significant differences in staff SSM confidence and skills, following training. Qualitative evaluation revealed adoption by staff, and patients' and families' experiences of using the resources. Challenges included reaching staff across complex pathways to achieve collective implementation. Conclusion This is the first project to demonstrate feasibility of SSM for people after TBI starting in an acute trauma setting. Through an open approach to codesign with a marginalized group, the SSM resources were valued by them and held meaning and relevance for staff.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Sonographers of a large, metropolitan health service were trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma in preparation for a potential mass casualty incident. Given the prior ultrasound experience of this cohort, the suitability of an abbreviated credentialing pathway based upon that required for emergency physicians was evaluated. Method A training and credentialing process to teach extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma was planned for sonographers. The model was based upon existing credentialing requirements for emergency physicians. The project was undertaken in two stages, using a ?train the trainer? approach. The initial stage trained and credentialed a group of senior sonographer trainers. This group then supported the training and credentialing of the wider sonographer cohort. Results Twenty-eight qualified sonographers were successfully trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma scanning. Practical competency assessment demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Image interpretation assessment results also demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Conclusion An abbreviated model is suitable for the training and credentialing of sonographers in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma, given their pre-existing ultrasound skills and knowledge.

AB  - Abstract Aims Streetworkers are front-line workers employed to engage at-risk youth and prevent, intervene, and respond to incidents of community youth violence. Streetworkers are often exposed to violence and its aftermath, though little is known about the specific types of trauma to which streetworkers are exposed. Methods This study seeks to explore this question via in-depth, semistructured interviews with 37 streetworkers from a large city in the United States. Results The qualitative results revealed that the streetworkers in this sample experienced a range of types of trauma. Streetworkers were less likely to be directly exposed to traumatic events in the context of their jobs, yet were more likely to witness, learn about, or experience repeated exposure to aversive details of traumatic events. Conclusions Despite their exposure to trauma, very few participants described seeking psychological treatment, self-care, or new vocation. We discuss our findings and make recommendations to bolster support for streetworkers.

AB  - Summary Adhesion molecules appear to play a pivotal role in tissue damage secondary to the inflammatory process. Besides neutrophiland endothelial-bound adhesion molecules, soluble forms have been detected in the circulating blood. They seem to be good markers of endothelial damage, but they may also have other biological functions. Plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules (sELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and granule membrane protein 140 (sGMP-140) were serially measured over 5 days by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 45 consecutive trauma patients. These received, by random allocation, only either hydroxyethylstarch solution 10% (mean molecular weight 200 000 daltons) (n = 15) or human albumin 20% (n = 15) for volume therapy. Another 15 patients without defined volume therapy received pentoxifylline continuously (1.2mg.kg-1.h-1). Measurements were carried out on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (baseline) and during the next 5 days. At baseline, plasma concentrations of all adhesion molecules were similar in all groups. In the hydroxyethyl starch group, sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) reaching normal values during the study period whereas the mean (SD) values increased in the pentoxifylline group (sELAM-1: 71.1 (16.7) to 91.6 (17.8) ng.ml-1) and the albumin group (sICAM-1: 400 (81) to 749 (101) ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sVCAM-1 increased outside the normal range only in the human albumin group (to 760 ± 69 ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sGMP-140 plasma concentration increased only in those receiving albumin (432 (85) to 550 (93) ng.ml-1) and this was significantly different to the other groups (p < 0.05). None of the other haemodynamic or laboratory factors could be correlated with plasma concentrations of the adhesion molecules. We conclude that colume therapy with hydroxyethyl starch resulted in a decrease in circulating adhesion molecules in our trauma patients. In contrast, volume therapy with albumin did not exert this effect. Continuous infusion of pentoxifylline did not have a beneficial modulating action on circulating adhesion molecules.

AB  - Abstract? Chylothorax is rare following blunt thoracic trauma; its diagnosis is usually delayed until the puncture or drainage of posttraumatic pleural effusion and its cause is not clear. Mostly, it is attributed to injury or overstretching of major thoracic duct by fractures or other injury of neighboring thoracic spine. We describe of two cases, one unilateral and one bilateral, of chylothorax, both after blunt thoracic trauma. In the first case, there were associated fractures of lower thoracic vertebrae, whereas in the other there was no obvious cause, except striking osteophytic degeneration alongside the thoracic spine. Both cases were successfully treated after 16 and 23 days, respectively, with drainage, starvation, reexpansion of the lung(-s), and total parenteral nutrition. We believe that with the ?triad of RST? (?reexpansion, starvation diet, TPN?), conservative treatment will be successful in the majority of cases.

AB  - Objectives Adverse life events are associated with increased likelihood of depression and poorer prognosis. Trauma-focused treatments (TFT) appear to be effective in decreasing comorbid depressive symptoms. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a TFT on the memories of aversive events for individuals with a primary diagnosis of depression. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 49 participants recruited from a 10-day outpatient group programme. All participants showed symptoms of depression with a subgroup (80%) meeting the DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode. Participants received treatment as usual (TAU); three additional individual trauma-focused sessions; or three additional individual assertiveness training sessions. Participants were assessed with regards to depression diagnosis and related symptoms. Results For participants with a major depressive episode, the addition of trauma-focused sessions significantly increased the likelihood of remission when compared to TAU, or additional assertiveness training. While no significant treatment difference was noted in depressive symptom change post-treatment, six weeks after treatment those who received an adjunct treatment were more likely to maintain treatment gains than those who received TAU. Furthermore, at 12-week follow-up, participants who received a TFT reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those who received assertiveness training. Conclusions While differences in outcomes were minimal immediately post-treatment, differences among treatment groups increased over time. Thus, as few as three additional TFT sessions may impact positively on symptom change for people completing a group programme for the treatment of depression. Practitioner points Depression is the greatest cause of disability worldwide. Adverse experiences are linked with an increased likelihood of depression, more severe symptoms and poor treatment outcomes following evidence-based interventions. As few as three trauma-focused sessions can improve treatment outcomes in terms of depression diagnosis and related symptoms for individuals receiving group cognitive behavioural therapy.

The majority of judges (63%) reported one or more symptoms that they identified as work-related vicarious trauma experiences. Female judges reported more symptoms, as did judges with seven or more years of experience. In addition, female judges were more likely to report internalizing difficulties, while judges with more experience reported higher levels of externalizing/hostility symptoms. Coping and prevention strategies were multi-domain (i.e., personal, professional, and societal) and underscored the need for greater awareness and support for judges.

In this study, 50 chronic schizophrenic patients who had attempted suicide were compared with 50 chronic schizophrenic patients who had never attempted suicide for their scores on the 34-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). It was found that schizophrenics who had attempted suicide reported significantly higher CTQ scores for emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect than schizophrenics who had never attempted suicide. Therefore, childhood trauma may be a risk factor predisposing schizophrenic patients to attempt suicide.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The clinical spectrum of electrical injury ranges from the absence of any external physical signs to severe multiple trauma. Reported neuropsychiatric sequelae can vary from vague complaints, which may seem unrelated to the injury in their occurrence over time or by their apparent severity, to sequelae consistent with brain injury accompanying an electrical trauma. In this report, a case study and discussion are presented on the management and coordination of postacute care of an electrical trauma survivor. Expertise and a multi-disciplinary team are essential to cohesive patient care. Patient monitoring for progressive changes and prompt intervention are needed to address the potential difficulties experienced by trauma survivors as they rehabilitate to return to their work and their activities of daily living.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the strengths and weaknesses of the radiological investigations used to investigate suspected abusive head trauma in children. Advice is offered regarding investigations that might reasonably be used in different clinical scenarios. Common misunderstandings, controversies and pitfalls that may arise if radiological findings are misinterpreted are discussed. The forensic significance of these findings is examined, with particular reference to estimates of time of injury and the range of possible explanations for these findings (e.g., the presence of extra-axial fluid around the brain). Forensic practitioners and radiologists are cautioned to avoid over-confidence regarding estimates of time of injury on the basis of fluid densities. Consideration must be given to minimizing confirmatory bias. The authors recommend that radiologists specifically mention in their reports the range of possible explanations for forensically important findings.

AB  - SUMMARY One hundred and ninety-five magnetic resonance (MR) images (1.5 Tesla) of 167 patients with neurological impairment following spinal trauma were reviewed. Acute cord injury produces central haemorrhagic necrosis that extends transversely and longitudinally with time and increased injury severity. Oedoma is more homogeneous, extensive and dominant in minimal lesions. Magnetic resonance appearances correlate with neurological status and outcome. Patients with MR evidence of cord blood had severe clinical lesions and failed to show useful clinical improvement. Patients with homogeneous ?oedema?improved to useful function. Lesion signal inhomogeneity relates to a worse prognosis. The clinical level correlates closely with cord blood or signal in homogeneity but imprecisely with homogeneous oedema. Disc herniations require differentiation from epidural blood and venous engorgement, which are prominent with bone displacement. Magnetic resonance is recommended in incomplete cord syndromes and in cord injuries with no apparent fracture, particularly if clinically deteriorating. Chronic injury consists of cavitation, extensive gliosis, cord atrophy and leptomeningeal fibrosis. Progressive myelopathy may result from cystic or non-cystic intramedullary lesions. Cord cysts are common and cyst fluid signal should closely follow cerebrospinal fluid. Turbulent cyst fluid motion is commoner in larger cysts and may predict those cysts more prone to propagate. Progressive syrinxes show typical appearances, usually with transverse septa. Atrophy and propagating syrinxes usually take years to develop. Leptomeningeal cysts and spinal stenosis caused by bone displacement and accelerated adjacent disc disease may cause late deterioration. In progressive myelopathy following injury, surgically drainable cysts are clearly differentiable from cord gliosis and atrophy.

AB  - Abstract In biomedical engineering, it is a common practice to replace injured cartilage by implants, which are seeded with human cartilage cells. Before implanting, the implants are cultivated and usually stimulated electrically or mechanically in a bioreactor to initiate cell multiplication and oriented cell growth. A new experimental set-up is developed leading to the possibility of stimulating such implants in a multi-dimensional, physiologically consistent way. In cooperation with the University Medical Centre Aachen, a human knee simulator is developed. Cell-seeded implants are placed in a recreated human environment and stimulated with several load cycles of reproduced walking. After the cultivation period, the implanted material is removed and biologically and mechanically evaluated. The quality of the implanted material as well as the influence of the body-conformable load on the material is studied. To understand the correlation between tissue remodelling and mechanical load history, the load and movement scenario is also numerically investigated. For this reason, the experiment is transferred to a geometrically realistic FE model of a human knee. As a first approach, an elastic material model is used. The aim is to have a predictive FE model with an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency using an appropriate material formulation. The results will be compared to experimental data.

AB  - Objectives To describe the CT findings in a population of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma that involved the spleen and liver. Materials and Methods Clinical records between January 2008 and June 2015 were reviewed. Thoracic and abdominal CT examinations of patients diagnosed with multi-centric lymphoma were evaluated by a board-certified radiologist. A diagnosis of multi-centric lymphoma with splenic and hepatic involvement was based upon cytological identification and immunophenotyping of neoplastic lymphocytes in cellular samples harvested from a peripheral lymph node, the spleen and the liver. Results Twelve dogs were included in this study, of which 11 had B-cell lymphoma; immunophenotyping was inconclusive in one dog. The spleen appeared normal in seven dogs and nodules were identified in five dogs. Splenic nodules were hypoattenuating in four of five dogs and isoattenuating in one of five. After contrast administration, three of five appeared hypoattenuating and two of five isoattenuating. The liver appeared normal in 10 dogs and hepatic nodules were identified in two dogs. All hepatic nodules were isoattenuating before contrast and hypoattenuating following contrast administration. Clinical Significance The CT appearance of the spleen and liver was normal in the majority of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration of the spleen and liver is recommended when using CT to stage dogs with multi-centric lymphoma.

AB  - The mechanism of secondary damage spread after brain trauma remains unsolved. In this work, we redirected the attention to astrocytic communication pathways. Using an in vitro trauma model that consists of a scratch injury applied to an astrocyte monolayer, we found a significant and transient induction of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel activity in regions distal from the injury, which was maximal ?1 h after scratch. Two connexin hemichannel blockers, La3+ and the peptide Gap26, abolished the increased activity, which was also absent in Cx43 KO astrocytes. In addition, the scratch-induced increase of hemichannel activity was prevented by inhibition of P2 purinergic receptors. Changes in hemichannel activity took place with a particular spatial distribution, with cells located at ?17 mm away from the scratch presenting the highest activity (dye uptake). In contrast, the functional state of gap junction channels (dye coupling) was not significantly affected. Cx43 hemichannel activity was also enhanced by the acute extracellular application of 60 mM K+. The increase in hemichannel activity was associated with an increment in apoptotic cells at 24 h after scratch that was totally prevented by Gap26 peptide. These findings suggest that Cx43 hemichannels could be a new approach to prevent or reduce the secondary cell damage of brain trauma. GLIA 2015;63:1185?1199

AB  - The role of the nurse within the multi-professional rehabilitation team Aim of the study/paper.?To identify the contribution of the nurse within the multi-professional rehabilitation team. Background.?The requirement for nurses to work effectively within the multi-professional rehabilitation team is increasingly important with the higher incidence of chronic disease, growing numbers of older people and enhanced survival from major trauma. Methods.?A 2-year qualitative investigation was undertaken centred on three contrasting condition case studies (fractured neck of femur, rheumatoid arthritis and stroke). Clients were theoretically sampled, with their ?rehabilitation pathway? through different services providing the window through which the nurse?s contribution was explored. Multiple methods and points of data collection were used, including observation, face to face interviews (clients, carers and staff) and record review. To enhance generalisability, a series of national expert workshops were undertaken with four groups: users, carers and carers? organizations; nurses; members of the multi-professional team; and educationalists. Findings.?Six interlinked roles for the nurse were identified: assessment, co-ordination and communication, technical and physical care, therapy integration and therapy carry-on, emotional support, and involving the family. Of particular significance is the creation of a supportive environment for rehabilitation to occur. Some nurses undertook aspects of all of these roles at any one time while others were only involved in one or two areas. While nurses expressed a desire to integrate therapy into their care delivery, the actual achievement of this goal was variable. Conclusions.?Key elements of the nurse?s contribution within rehabilitation should aim to maximize client choice to enhance independent living in the client?s future environment. At a nursing educational policy level the nurse needs to have a full understanding of the principles and models of rehabilitation. At a practice level, the nurse?s role must be valued and recognized, by nurses themselves and other team members.

AB  - Objective. To understand the experiences that people with early psychosis are adjusting to and their perceived barriers to recovery. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants. Grounded Theory was applied to the design and analysis. Sampling and coding ceased when saturation of the data was reached. Respondent validation was sought from participants. Results. A theoretical model was developed using Strauss and Corbin's (1998) framework. A core category of distress was elicited, which was evident in all participants? accounts of their recovery. Overall six main categories were identified and it was proposed that individuals were adjusting to the distress of past experiences, uncertainty, a challenged identity, being in a psychiatric system, the reaction of others and social disadvantage. Conclusions. Recovery from the distress and trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single experience or set of symptoms. The results are discussed in relation to trauma, developmental, and social inequality frameworks. Specific implications for clinical practice include incorporating the findings within formulations, developing interventions that focus on trauma, identity, and uncertainty as well as addressing the social and systemic issues identified. Practitioner Points ?? Recovery from early psychosis is multi-faceted. Psychological formulations should seek to consider individual, social, and systemic factors influencing an individual's distress to more fully conceptualize what an individual's adjustment to early psychosis may involve. ?? Services and wider systems should consider iatrogenic processes, which may contribute to and maintain the distress experienced by those with early psychosis. ?? Education programmes that look to contextualize psychosis within a meaningful framework may help to develop understanding within wider society where a lack of knowledge and understanding serves to reinforce an individual's sense of exclusion and difference.
