AB  - Objective. To understand the experiences that people with early psychosis are adjusting to and their perceived barriers to recovery. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants. Grounded Theory was applied to the design and analysis. Sampling and coding ceased when saturation of the data was reached. Respondent validation was sought from participants. Results. A theoretical model was developed using Strauss and Corbin's (1998) framework. A core category of distress was elicited, which was evident in all participants? accounts of their recovery. Overall six main categories were identified and it was proposed that individuals were adjusting to the distress of past experiences, uncertainty, a challenged identity, being in a psychiatric system, the reaction of others and social disadvantage. Conclusions. Recovery from the distress and trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single experience or set of symptoms. The results are discussed in relation to trauma, developmental, and social inequality frameworks. Specific implications for clinical practice include incorporating the findings within formulations, developing interventions that focus on trauma, identity, and uncertainty as well as addressing the social and systemic issues identified. Practitioner Points ?? Recovery from early psychosis is multi-faceted. Psychological formulations should seek to consider individual, social, and systemic factors influencing an individual's distress to more fully conceptualize what an individual's adjustment to early psychosis may involve. ?? Services and wider systems should consider iatrogenic processes, which may contribute to and maintain the distress experienced by those with early psychosis. ?? Education programmes that look to contextualize psychosis within a meaningful framework may help to develop understanding within wider society where a lack of knowledge and understanding serves to reinforce an individual's sense of exclusion and difference.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND A combination of increased suicide in the past decade, documented high rates of anxiety and depression, and the preponderance of other behavioral and emotional regulation challenges place black youth at risk for school suspension and involvement in the juvenile justice system. Pointing to deficits in black youth and their families negates how forces of racism, whether unconscious or conscious, can disrupt well-being. METHODS A framework for race-related trauma in the public education system illustrates the interplay between macro-level forces, such as institutional and symbolic racism, and micro level forces of racism such as racial discrimination and violence. Identifying causal links between these forces and adverse academic and health outcomes for black youth can inform interventions and strategies to reduce race-related trauma. RESULTS The framework for race-related trauma is a multi-level analysis of racism and recognizes school districts facing economic restraints and school personnel turnover may face significant challenges in designing intervening strategies. CONCLUSION The framework guides change effort towards improving school climate and culture through preparing school professionals to meet the diverse needs of youth, strengthening family and community collaboration, and tackling those policies and behaviors that exclude and disconnect black youth.

AB  - Abstract??? Background/Aim:? There is little epidemiological research regarding dental trauma in Australia. Previous research has largely focused on specific sub-populations with data not necessarily applicable to a general rural Australian population. Studies from other countries have presented variable data and the relevance of their findings to the Australian setting is questionable. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, causes and presentation of dental trauma in a large rural centre in Australia. Materials and methods:? A retrospective analysis was performed of the dental records of 323 consecutive patients who had attended a private general dental practice in Bunbury, Western Australia following an injury to their teeth and/or mouths during the period from May 2000 to December 2005 (inclusive). Injuries were classified using the Andreasen system (1994). Data analysis was carried out using spss software and Chi-Square tests were performed with the level of significance set at 5%. Results:? There were 528 teeth injured and eight patients had only soft tissue injuries. Males (68.1%) significantly outnumbered females (31.9%) and the ages ranged from 10?months to 78?years. The highest number of injuries occurred in children and adolescents, specifically the 0- to 4-year age group followed by the 5- to 9-year age and 10- to 14-year age groups. Trauma was most frequently the result of falls, accidents while playing and participating in sports activities. Conclusions:? The maxillary central incisors were the most commonly injured teeth in both the primary and permanent dentitions. Uncomplicated crown fractures were the most common injury followed by luxations and subluxations. No significant differences in frequency were reported for the different days of the week, the different months or seasons of the year. Only one-third of the patients presented for dental treatment within 24?h of the injury while the remainder delayed seeking treatment for varying times up to 1?year.

AB  - Summary In the current study, we investigated whether suppression can produce an amplified memory for a traumatic experience. Participants viewed a distressing film depicting a multi-fatality car accident. We broke the film down into several short clips, some of which were removed. After viewing the film, we instructed participants to (i) suppress and monitor film-related thoughts, (ii) think freely and monitor film-related thoughts or (iii) just think freely. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a recognition test. Memory distortion was comparable across conditions; however, suppression and monitoring of trauma-related thoughts removed the typical bias to falsely remember the most critical and traumatic clips of the film over the least critical clips. Our data suggest that suppression may be effective in reducing trauma-related cognitions and, therefore, does not predict a more ?amplified? memory for trauma. Instead, suppression and thought monitoring encourage an unbiased, although inaccurate, memory for trauma.Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background: Empyema post chest trauma is a morbid condition requiring operative intervention (thoracotomy and decortication). It is hypothesized that patients who have a complicated initial pleural drainage procedure are at increased risk of developing an empyema. Methods: All patients who underwent operative decortication for post-traumatic empyema over a 24?month period (July 2003 to June 2005) were included in the study. Data were collected on demographics, intercostal catheter (ICC) insertion, prehospital chest decompression and associated injuries. A matched group of patients who had ICC inserted for chest trauma and did not develop an empyema were used as controls. Results: Fourteen patients had decortications for post-traumatic empyema. Two of three pneumocaths and one ICC were placed within the lung. Five other patients had multiple ?attempts? at ICC insertion. Only two patients had a single uncomplicated ICC inserted. The empyema and control group were well matched in terms of age (mean age 40?years in each group, P?=?0.83), injury severity score (36.4 vs 35.3, P?=?0.85) and presence of chest, abdominal and multi-system injury. The empyema group had significantly longer median hospital stay (12.8 vs 28.7?days, P?=?0.05). The control group had less initial ICC inserted (median of 1.0 vs 2.0, P?=?0.02). Only one patient had a complicated ICC insertion, and two uncomplicated pneumocaths were placed. Conclusion: Patients with complex chest injuries in whom difficulties in initial pleural drainage are encountered are at increased risk of developing a post-traumatic empyema and have a prolonged hospital stay.

AB  - Abstract Sensorineural hearing loss is often accompanied by difficulties with understanding speech in fluctuating backgrounds, suggesting that neural coding of complex sound features, such as the sound envelope, is impaired. Here, we studied how temporal and rate coding of the envelope is affected in the inferior colliculus immediately after acoustic trauma. Neural activity in response to amplitude-modulated noise was recorded from the inferior colliculus of the guinea pig, before and immediately after a 1-hr 11-kHz acoustic trauma. Units with a characteristic frequency (CF) below the trauma frequency (<11 kHz) showed increased response gains, a measure for temporal coding of the sound envelope, especially at low modulation frequencies (≤128 Hz). Units with a CF > 11 kHz, which had large acoustic trauma-induced threshold shifts, had decreased response gains to amplitude-modulated noise. Shapes of temporal modulation transfer functions shifted toward a higher proportion of low-pass shapes in low-CF units, and to less band-pass shapes in high-CF units. Furthermore, driven firing rates decreased, especially at high modulation frequencies for high-CF units. The observed changes occurred immediately following trauma and were thus a result of the immediate trauma-induced damage to the auditory system. If also present in human subjects, reduced response gains in high-frequency units could disrupt coding of consonants and consequently impair speech understanding in noisy environments. Moreover, the enhanced temporal coding by low-CF units of the low modulation frequencies could overly amplify responses to low-frequency noise, further deteriorating listening in noise.

AB  - Abstract Objective Although trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been applied worldwide, the nature of how these Western-based interventions are applied in diverse settings has varied. This paper systematically reviewed the literature on how trauma-focused CBTs have been applied and adapted cross-culturally. Method A systematic review of studies that discuss the process of cultural adaptation of trauma-focused CBTs. Results Seventeen papers were included and varied in the comprehensiveness of the adaptation process. Two studies stated that a theoretical framework was followed. Almost one-third of the studies did not report whether local stakeholders were involved in the process of application. Fifteen studies examined the efficacy of the adaptations and the results were positive, but the methodology and quality varied. Conclusion There are inconsistencies in how trauma-focused CBTs are culturally adapted. A systematic approach to the transportation of such therapies would enable greater investigation into the necessity and efficacy of such adaptations.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Dental trauma in school populations has a high frequency and school teachers are often close to the place where such injuries occur. However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia. Materials and Methods A multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management. Results The response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers? education level. Conclusions The knowledge of school teachers in Colombia about emergency dental trauma management is inadequate. The findings strongly suggest a need for an education strategy with the involvement of the government, dentistry schools and private organizations.

AB  - Surprisingly often in the psychoanalyses of chronically depressed patients, depression represents an unconscious attempt to psychically cope with unbearable psychic pain following severe traumatisation: dissociative states, a chronified psychic state of shock, a disappearance of emotions, an emptying of the self and the object relationships, as well as a disappearance of the psyche in the body are among the possible consequences. The treatment of these difficult groups of analysands can also frequently bring analysts to the limits of the endurable. Often related to this is the repeated danger of denying the trauma, and a re-traumatisation of the analysand in the analytic situation. The lecture discusses the fact that in comparison with other therapeutic approaches, psychoanalysis has a highly differentiated conceptualisation of the psychic determinants and the treatment of chronic depression at his disposal. However, in order to retain its creativity and innovation as a scientific discipline and to be thus perceived in the non-psychoanalytic world, it must constantly further develop its conceptualization by way of systematic and extra-clinical research ? as is witnessed in the insufficient conceptual account of severe traumatisation during the genesis of chronic depression. In this connection, several exemplary examples from extra-clinical studies in the sphere of psychotherapeutic research, neurobiology, epigenetics and embodied cognitive science will be accounted for. As will be treated in the final part of this paper, of no less importance are the conceptualizations in clinical research on psychoanalysis, which are based on meticulous, careful analyses of trauma reactivation in the transference, and understanding and working through them in the analytic relationship.

AB  - Purpose? Decision making in the management of combined major skeletal and soft tissue trauma to the lower limb is a complex process made more difficult by the uncertainty surrounding outcomes. The aim of this study is to review and present our experience with flap reconstruction of traumatic lower limb defects, with particular reference to in-hospital complications and outcomes related to timing, choice of flap and pre-existing complications. Methodology? Retrospective review of all lower limb flap reconstructions performed by the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit at the Alfred Hospital (largest trauma centre in Australasia) from 1 July 2001 to 20 October 2005 (51 month period). Results? Sixty-four patients had 83 flap reconstructions (35 free, 48 local) of 70 separate lower limb injuries. Twenty-seven flaps (32.5%) developed soft tissue infections and 16 fixation devices (25.8%) were complicated by deep metal infection. There were 6 (12.5%) local flap partial necrosis and 4 (11.4%) free flap failures. Three patients underwent secondary amputation during their initial admission. Thorough wound debridement and internal skeletal fixation were followed by earlier soft tissue coverage and lower deep metal infection rates. Limbs in which flaps were performed after Day 5 were more likely to develop deep metal infection (p?=?0.04) and suffer free flap failure or local flap partial necrosis (p?=?0.02). Conclusion? The current study presented our experience with flap reconstructions of complex lower limb injuries at a major trauma centre. Thorough wound debridement, internal fixation and early soft tissue coverage (within 5 days of injury) is associated with lower infection rates and optimal outcomes.

AB  - Summary Renal injuries are mostly managed conservatively. Operative intervention with view of kidney salvage is possible. However, nephrectomy may be the only option to control life-threatening haemorrhage. During the conservative period, it is extremely important to keep patients under close monitoring because this will allow early identification of patients who will require surgical intervention. Ureteral injuries are relatively rare and mostly iatrogenic. Management of the ureteral injuries depends level of injury, severity, and on time (early or late) of recognition of the injury. Careful assessment (cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram) and appropriate imaging computed tomography urogram or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) are essential to select most suitable method of repair of ureteral injury.

AB  - Summary The effect of patient-controlled analgesia during the emergency phase of care on the prevalence of persistent pain is unkown. We studied individuals with traumatic injuries or abdominal pain 6 months after hospital admission via the emergency department using an opportunistic observational study design. This was conducted using postal questionnaires that were sent to participants recruited to the multi-centre pain solutions in the emergency setting study. Patients with prior chronic pain states or opioid use were not studied. Questionnaires included the EQ5D, the Brief Pain Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Overall, 141 out of 286 (49% 95%CI 44?56%) patients were included in this follow-up study. Participants presenting with trauma were more likely to develop persistent pain than those presenting with abdominal pain, 45 out of 64 (70%) vs. 24 out of 77 (31%); 95%CI 24?54%, p < 0.001. There were no statistically significant associations between persistent pain and analgesic modality during hospital admission, age or sex. Across both abdominal pain and traumatic injury groups, participants with persistent pain had lower EQ5D mobility scores, worse overall health and higher anxiety and depression scores (p < 0.05). In the abdominal pain group, 13 out of 50 (26%) patients using patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 11 out of 27 (41%) of those with usual treatment; 95%CI for difference (control ? patient-controlled analgesia) ?8 to 39%, p = 0.183. Acute pain scores at the time of hospital admission were higher in participants who developed persistent pain; 95%CI 0.7?23.6, p = 0.039. For traumatic pain, 25 out of 35 (71%) patients given patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 20 out of 29 (69%) patients with usual treatment; 95%CI ?30 to 24%, p = 0.830. Persistent pain is common 6 months after hospital admission, particularly following trauma. The study findings suggest that it may be possible to reduce persistent pain (at least in patients with abdominal pain) by delivering better acute pain management. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract Tidal energy converters (turbines) are being developed in many countries as part of attempts to reduce reliance on hydrocarbon fuels. However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose?response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. Results showed that severe trauma was restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. Pathological indicators of mortality were only predicted to occur in collision speeds in excess of 5.1 m/s (95% C.I. 3.2?6.6) and was affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives To describe the ?Resuscitation with Pre-HospItaL bLood products? trial (RePHILL) ? a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of pre-hospital blood product (PHBP) administration vs standard care for traumatic haemorrhage. Background PHBP are increasingly used for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation despite a lack of robust evidence demonstrating superiority over crystalloids. Provision of PHBP carries additional logistical and regulatory implications, and requires a sustainable supply of universal blood components. Methods RePHILL is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial currently underway in the UK. Patients attended by a pre-hospital emergency medical team, with traumatic injury and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<90?mmHg or absent radial pulse) believed to be due to traumatic haemorrhage are eligible. Exclusion criteria include age?<16?years, blood product receipt on scene prior to randomisation, Advanced Medical Directive forbidding blood product administration, pregnancy, isolated head injury and prisoners. A total of 490 patients will be recruited in a 1?: 1 ratio to receive either the intervention (up to two units of red blood cells and two units of lyophilised plasma) or the control (up to four boluses of 250?mL 0.9% saline). The primary outcome measure is a composite of failure to achieve lactate clearance of ≥20%/h over the first 2?hours after randomisation and all-cause mortality between recruitment and discharge from the primary receiving facility to non-acute care. Secondary outcomes include pre-hospital time, coagulation indices, in-hospital transfusion requirements and morbidity. Results Pilot study recruitment began in December 2016. Approval to proceed to the main trial was received in June 2017. Recruitment is expected to continue until 2020. Conclusions RePHILL will provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of PHBP resuscitation for trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatized refugees with comorbid pain report more severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respond less well to PTSD-focused treatments and exhibit greater disability. A mutually maintaining relationship may exist between pain and PTSD, that may be partly accounted for by depression, but no prior studies have tested this assumption in traumatized refugees. Method Self-report measures of pain, PTSD, depression, disability, pain catastrophizing (PC) and trauma-related beliefs (TRBs) were administered to 197 refugees referred to the Danish Institute Against Torture (DIGNITY) prior to treatment. The contribution of pain, depression, PC, and TRBs to the overall variance in PTSD severity was examined. We also examined whether the relationship between pain and PTSD was mediated by PC and TRBs, after controlling for depression. Results Depression, pain severity, PC and TRBs together accounted for 66% of the overall variance in PTSD, with depression being the primary contributor (57%). In univariate tests, both PC and TRBs significantly mediated the relationship between pain interference/severity and PTSD. However, after controlling for depression only PC mediated this relationship. Conclusions Negative beliefs about pain and the trauma made small, but additive contributions to the relationship between pain and PTSD severity, after controlling for depression. Longitudinal studies with refugees, involving tests of more complex mutual maintenance models, are warranted. Significance After controlling for symptoms of depression, pain catastrophizing and negative trauma-related beliefs partly mediated the relationship between pain and PTSD in tortured refugees. The results suggest that all three variables are important in a mutual mediation model of pain and PTSD, and as targets for treatment, in traumatized refugees.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To determine if clinically defined multi-impulsive bulimia (MIB) can be validated using an empirical classification approach. Method: One hundred and twenty-five women who met DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa were interviewed and completed a two-week EMA protocol. Participants who reported at least three highly impulsive behaviors were compared to participants who did not report such impulsive behavior. Also, Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted to determine if the MIB classification could be replicated empirically. Results: LCA produced a two-class solution consistent with the traditional clinical approach to MIB classification. In both approaches, MIB was associated with higher levels of anxiety disorders, child abuse, and daily self-damaging behaviors than the non-MIB class. Conclusion: Clinical classification of MIB was empirically supported through LCA. Although the classes failed to differ in bulimic behavior, MIB appears to represent a group of bulimic individuals with significant trauma histories and associated psychopathology. ? 2006 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In this paper we map out what we are calling a ?geopolitics of trauma? by examining the role of trauma in transnational refugee regimes and the individualisation of geopolitical relations through mental health diagnosis and service provision. Focusing on one site of entry into the international regime of refugee administration, we present findings from fieldwork that we conducted in August, 2015 in Turkey with NGOs and IGOs involved in the protection, mental health and psychosocial service provision, and resettlement of refugees. The findings that we present demonstrate the challenges of refugee care and management on the front lines in Turkey and the significance of mental health diagnosis, treatment and documentation in the early stages of refugee administration. We suggest that practices of refugee screening and resettlement are imbued with traumatic stressors and trace how trauma intersects with the administration of refugees in different sites and at different times. We argue that the protracted situation of refugees in Turkey (many of whom will wait eight years for their Refugee Status Determination interview) and the multiple interviews and demands for documentation through which a displaced person applies for refugee status and third-country resettlement become sites of ongoing traumatisation for the refugee subject. Further, in the practices of screening and documentation, we can trace the medicalisation of the refugee subject as not only a question of care but also a practice of legibility on which the state and international organisations base their decisions about inclusion and exclusion. The geopolitics of trauma thus emerges not only in cartographies of war, displacement and resettlement, but also in the minute details and performative demands of the refugee determination and resettlement process.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, disabling psychiatric disorder prevalent among civilian and military personnel in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). Current trauma-focused psychotherapies may place high emotional demands and lengthy treatment commitment that may hinder successful treatment completion for some patients. Accelerated resolution therapy (ART) is an emerging trauma-focused psychotherapy that is briefer than most current treatments. Materials and Methods This review describes the ART clinical protocol and theoretical underpinnings, its relationship to current treatments and formal established treatment guidelines and empirical research data. Also presented are new subgroup data for the use of ART among clients with PTSD and concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), and among US Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel with extensive combat-related trauma exposure. Treatment response was defined as ≥10-point reduction on the 17-item PCL-M (PTSD Checklist). Results In subgroup analyses, mean treatment with ART consisted of approximately four sessions. Among 202 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates (assuming no response for non-completers) by TBI status were as follows: no TBI (58.1%, n = 105), mild TBI (60.4%, n = 48), moderate/severe TBI (46.9%, n = 49). Among 141 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates by SOF status were as follows: non-SOF (54.3%, n = 116), SOF (60.0%, n = 25). Conclusion The ART protocol aligns closely with established first-line trauma-focused psychotherapies and clinical guidelines. It appears to provide frequent clinical relief of symptoms of PTSD in an average of four sessions among military personnel with challenging clinical presentations, including concomitant TBI and extensive operational combat-related trauma.
