AB  - The members of many professional and occupational groups (e.g., emergency services, social services, psychology, and financial sector) can become affected by traumatic events occurring in the workplace. Currently, a range of methodologies and assessment instruments are used in the study of this area, making comparison between studies difficult, and raising issues relating to the validity and reliability of the instruments. Existing research in this area is also hampered by it being predominantly cross-sectional in nature. This paper discusses the issues that need to be dealt with in order to put the study of work-related psychological trauma on a firm theoretical foundation. The issues canvassed include establishing assessment instruments using sound psychometric principles: the need for normative data: the methodological implications of longitudinal, multi-wave research design; and evaluating change.

AB  - Objectives Research indicates that constructs relevant to social rank predict a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including mental defeat, alienation, and shame. However, no studies have yet explored a social rank view explicitly. Design This was a community-based study carried out online. Analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal over 6 months. Methods Participants were recruited online for a cross-sectional study (Study 1, n = 194) and a 6-month longitudinal study (Study 2, n = 81). Measures included self-report measures of PTSD symptoms (the Post-Traumatic Diagnostic Scale) and social rank (including measures of unfavourable social comparison, social defeat, and internal/external entrapment). Results Cross-sectional analysis showed that social defeat, but not other aspects of social rank, was independently predictive of a diagnosis of PTSD. Longitudinal analysis showed that greater social defeat at baseline predicted less improvement in PTSD symptoms, whereas greater reduction in social defeat over the 6-month follow-up predicted greater improvement in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions In addition to the implications for understanding the role of social (rather than individual mental) defeat in the aetiology of PTSD, interventions could usefully incorporate methods that either increase social status or else minimize the impact of low status (e.g., through the use of compassion-focused approaches). Practitioner points Clinical implications Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) status is related to social defeat independently of demographic characteristics and features of the trauma. Reduction in PTSD symptoms over 6 months is predicted by reduction in social defeat. The evidence supports the use of interventions that increase self-perceived status or minimize the impact of low status (such as compassion-focused approaches). Cautions or limitations Participants were recruited online and may not be representative of clinical samples. Measures, including diagnostic tools, were self-report rather than interview- or observation based. With only two time points in the longitudinal study, direction of causality cannot be determined.

AB  - Abstract Severe hepatic trauma is a rare indication for liver transplantation (LT). We report our single-center experience of LT for hepatic trauma. Four new cases are discussed in light of a literature review in order to depict the pathways leading from hepatic trauma to LT and to assess the outcomes of this practice. LT is generally indicated in case of uncontrollable hemorrhage, acute liver failure, or post-traumatic late sequelae. Hepatic vessels thrombosis, sepsis, major hepatic resections, and a late referral are factors associated with the progression toward irreversible liver failure. Considering all reported cases, early patient and graft survival reached 68% and 62%, respectively, but in the last decade both have improved to 84%. LT after severe hepatic trauma is a sustainable practice considering the current good outcomes and the ineluctable death of these patients without LT.

AB  - Abstract Objective To explore Australian psychologists' perspectives on the psychological treatment of complex posttraumatic stress disorder in young women aged 18?25?years with a history of childhood maltreatment. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 psychologists from Melbourne, Australia experienced in the provision of psychological services to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment. Data were analysed thematically. Results Two overarching themes revealed the significance of (a) the need for psychologists to establish trust with young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in the therapy context and (b) the development of trust within young women's intra and interpersonal relationships as a baseline for further growth and recovery, which is facilitated by the trust which develops within the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion Qualitative studies of this kind provide valuable insight into the experiences and opinions of psychologists who provide treatment to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in their daily psychological practices. This study revealed that according to psychologist?participants, the development and facilitation of trust and the ability to trust others is a central goal of psychological treatment for young women with complex trauma.

AB  - Abstract An acute trauma to the CNS rapidly results in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that include interleukin-1 (IL-1). We report here that the levels of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are also elevated following a corticectomy trauma injury to the mouse CNS. The delayed upregulation of MMPs compared to that for IL-1 suggests the possibility that inflammatory cytokines regulate MMP production in CNS trauma. To resolve this, we developed a method to isolate and maintain highly enriched human fetal neurons or astrocytes in culture and examined the regulation by cytokines of the activity of a subgroup of MMPs, the gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9). While both neuronal and astrocytic cultures displayed comparable MMP-2 activity, as evidenced by gelatin zymography, levels of MMP-9 were proportionately higher in neurons compared to astrocytes. Of a variety of cytokines and growth factors tested in vitro, only IL-1? was effective in increasing the neuronal expression of MMP-9. Finally, an IL-1 receptor antagonist attenuated the increase of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and abolished the injury-induced increase of MMP-9 in the mouse brain. These results implicate IL-1? as a key regulator of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and of the elevation of MMP-9 that occurs following mouse CNS trauma. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate a model-independent, multi-directional anisotropy (MDA) metric that is analytically and experimentally equivalent to fractional anisotropy (FA) in single-direction diffusivity, but potentially superior to FA in its sensitivity to the underlying anisotropy of multi-directional diffusivity. Materials and Methods An expression for MDA was defined from the orientation distribution function (ODF) and its analytical relation to FA was derived. Simulations of single and crossed double-fibers were performed using a compressed-sensing-accelerated diffusion-spectrum-imaging (CS-DSI) scheme. In vivo brain imaging using CS-DSI was performed on eight healthy subjects. MDA was compared with FA and with another ODF-based metric known as generalized FA (GFA). Results In simulated single-direction fibers, MDA was shown to be equivalent to FA (from FA?=?0.2 to 0.8). In crossed fibers, MDA provided superior differentiation of the underlying anisotropy as compared to FA and GFA. In vivo analysis shows that the MDA was superior to both FA (P?=?0.015) and GFA (P?=?0.021) in terms of its relative accuracy in crossed fiber regions. Conclusion MDA provides a potentially superior measure of fiber anisotropy relative to conventional FA or GFA, and may be used to improve the assessment of disease in regions with multi-directional brain fibers.

AB  - ABSTRACT TRAUMA IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH for people younger than age 45 in the United States. To help prevent death or disability, critically in jured trauma patients must reach definitive care within the ?golden hour.? OFTEN, THE PERIOPERATIVE TEAM has no more than 10 minutes to prepare the room before a patient who has suffered multiple, critical, traumatic injuries is rushed into the OR. FOR THE TRAUMA PATIENT'S SAFETY, the perioperative team must be diligent and use creative measures to efficiently ensure that all surgical counts are completed. Foregoing surgical counts places the trauma patient at an increased risk for unintentionally retained foreign objects.

AB  - ABSTRACT Current designs of leg-lengthening implants have faced serious failures due to inadequacies in the mechanical design. The failure typically is the result of fatigue induced by a combined loading condition with axial and shear components acting in the tubular body of the implant. One of the reasons leading to the failure is improper verification testing for the design of the fatigue limit. The current test standards for pre-clinical design phases of nail implants are relatively straightforward and widely accepted yet cannot produce the three-dimensional stress state representative of the anticipated operation in a patient during the consolidation phase. This work introduces a major improvement toward a method for verifying fatigue life of tubular as well as solid implants under combined torque, axial load, and bending. The report describes a new loading fixture, a calibration method, and compares the qualification results of finite element simulation analyses and experimental measurements during cyclic loading tests. The findings state that the fixture produces controlled multi-axial loadings to study varied osteotomy locations, quasi-static strength and fatigue of intramedullary implants at an intermediate, 2?Hz, cycle rate. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

Using 97 university students, correlational analyses revealed that temperament characteristics were related to trait but not ability EI. Components of family environment and childhood trauma were not significantly related to ability or trait EI. Multiple regression analyses confirmed the importance of temperament in predicting trait EI, but provided little support for the role of environmental factors or their interactions with temperament in predicting either type of EI.

AB  - Abstract Multi-type maltreatment refers to the experience of more than one form of child maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect and witnessing family violence). Researchers have largely ignored the presence of other types of child abuse and neglect when examining the adjustment problems associated with a particular form of maltreatment. The association between ?multi-type maltreatment? and adjustment was explored in the current study. Retrospective data were obtained on (a) the degree to which maltreatment types co-occurred, (b) childhood family characteristics and (c) adjustment problems in adulthood in an Australian self-selected community sample (N=175). As hypothesized, a large degree of overlap was reported in the experience of the five types of maltreatment. Family characteristics?particularly family cohesion and adaptability?discriminated between respondents reporting single-type and multi-type maltreatment. Greater adjustment problems were associated with reports of a larger number of different maltreatment types. Multi-type maltreatment should be recognized as a crucial aspect of the nature and impact of child maltreatment and considered in the development of programmes for the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect.

PY  - 1992
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but well recognized clinical entity which most often occurs on the trunk, perineum or legs following surgery or trauma. The condition is much less common in the head and neck and it is particularly uncommon in the midface/periorbital region. In almost all the cases occurring in the neck the condition follows obvious dental or oropharyngeal sepsis and in all the cases of the scalp there is a history of previous surgery or trauma. However, necrotizing fasciitis of the midface/periorbital region may lack any obvious traumatic aetiology or may follow relatively minor trauma. The diagnosis in these cases may not be suspected and treatment may be delayed with fatal consequences. Treatment by wide excision of all affected skin can lead to disastrous cosmetic consequences in facial disease and it is suggested that disease control can be achieved by raising wide based skin flaps with excision of the underlying necrotic tissue. The flaps are then returned onto normal muscle with much improved cosmetic results. This paper discusses the diagnosis and treatment of patients with necrotizing fasciitis of the face which has arisen without significant trauma.

AB  - Abstract Our contribution to this special issue focuses on the phenomenon of intrusive trauma memory. While intrusive trauma memories can undoubtedly cause impairment, we argue that they may exist for a potentially adaptive reason. Theory and experimental research on intrusion development are reviewed and possible functions of intrusive trauma memory are explored. These functions include aiding emotional processing, preventing future harm and protecting the coherence of the self. The issue of intrusive images in other disorders than posttraumatic stress disorder is briefly addressed. This review suggests that the study of function is important for a nuanced view on the modulation of intrusive trauma memory in both experimental psychopathology and clinical treatment.

AB  - Background:? Road traffic accidents are the main cause of trauma in Malaysia. It has been shown that there was an increase in admissions for trauma patients older than 60?years in the last decade. The purpose of this study was to determine the pattern of maxillofacial injuries in the geriatric patients referred to Seremban Hospital, Malaysia. Methods:? Records of patients aged 60?years or older who sustained oral and maxillofacial injuries between 1998 and 2002 were reviewed. Data related to age, sex, race, etiology, types of injuries and treatment modalities were obtained. Results:? A total of 134 geriatric patients with maxillofacial and dental injuries were seen in Seremban Hospital between January 1998 and December 2002. There were 101 (75.4%) men and 33 (24.6%) women. The age ranged 60?92?years with the mean age of 68.3?years (standard deviation, 7.48). Chinese made up the majority of the patients (51.8%), followed by Malays (37.2%), Indian (20.4%) and other ethnic groups (1.5%). The most common cause of injury was due to road traffic accidents (64.2%) However, falls were more common in those aged 76?years and above. The most common bone fracture documented was the mandible (35.7%) followed by fracture of the zygomatic complex (34.0%). The majority of treatment was conservative or closed reduction. Conclusion:? All the elderly patients with facial trauma were managed conservatively or as closed reduction in this hospital. This was largely because of their comorbid state and financial constraints.

AB  - Abstract Childhood trauma is associated with poor health outcomes in adulthood. Mechanisms for these associations are not well understood because past studies have focused predominantly on populations that have already developed physical and mental health problems. The present study examined the association between childhood trauma and stress-related vulnerability factors in a healthy adult sample (n = 79; 68% female, mean age = 27.5, SD = 6.5). Emotion regulation difficulties were examined as a potential mediator. Participants completed baseline laboratory assessments of reported childhood trauma, emotion regulation difficulties, prior month sleep quality, baseline impedance cardiography, and behavioral tests of executive functioning (EF) and a three-day experience sampling assessment protocol that included sleep diary, reported and objective pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood abuse was significantly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation, self-report and objective pre-sleep arousal, diary-assessed sleep quality, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood neglect was associated with greater pre-sleep arousal and poorer EF-behavioral control. Emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relationship between childhood abuse and reported pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. In conclusion, history of childhood trauma is associated with a variety of stress-related vulnerability factors in healthy adults that may be viable early intervention targets.

AB  - Abstract Many US veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq have multiple physical and psychiatric problems. A major focus of research has been on determining the effects of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), but mTBI is rarely diagnosed in the absence of co-occurring conditions such as blast exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, etc. These potentially interactive psychological and physical conditions produce complex patterns of cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms that impede civilian reintegration and complicate efficient and effective treatment planning. The Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) has developed a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment of deployment trauma and its consequences in veterans of these wars. The prospective TRACTS longitudinal cohort study conducts state-of-the-art assessments in the domains of biomedical function, lifetime head trauma, psychological function encompassing deployment experience and lifetime exposure to traumatic events, neuropsychological function, and structural and functional neuroimaging. The TRACTS longitudinal cohort study is the first of its kind to comprehensively evaluate lifetime incidence of TBI and PTSD in these veterans, in addition to those incurred during military deployment. The protocol has begun to reveal information that will help improve understanding of the complex pathophysiology associated with co-occurring mTBI and related stress disorders.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pancreaticoduodenal trauma (PDT) is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. In this study, contemporary trends were analysed using national data. Methods The Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 1998?2009 was queried for patients with PDT. Interventions including any operation (Any-Op) and pancreas-specific surgery (PSURG) were identified. Trends in treatment and outcomes were determined [complications, length of stay (LoS), mortality] for the Any-Op, PSURG and non-operative (Non-Op) groups. Analyses included chi-squared tests, Cochran?Armitage trend tests and logistic regression. Results A total of 27?216 patients (nationally weighted) with PDT were identified. Over time, the frequency of PDT increased by 8.3%, whereas the proportion of patients submitted to PSURG declined (from 21.7% to 19.8%; P = 0.0004) and the percentage of patients submitted to non-operative management increased (from 56.7% to 59.1%; P = 0.01). In the Non-Op group, mortality decreased from 9.7% to 8.6% (P < 0.001); morbidity and LoS remained unchanged at ?40% and ?12 days, respectively. In the PSURG group, mortality remained stable at ?15%, complications increased from 50.2% to 71.8% (P < 0.0001) and LoS remained stable at ?21 days. For all PDT patients, significant independent predictors of mortality included: the presence of combined pancreatic and duodenal injuries; penetrating trauma, and age >50 years. Having any operation (Any-Op) was associated with mortality, but PSURG was not a predictor of death. Conclusions The utilization of operations for PDT has declined without affecting mortality, but operative morbidity increased significantly over the 12 years to 2009. The development of an evidence-based approach to invasive manoeuvres and an early multidisciplinary approach involving pancreatic surgeons may improve outcomes in patients with these morbid injuries.
