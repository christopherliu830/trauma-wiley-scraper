AB  - Abstract Many US veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq have multiple physical and psychiatric problems. A major focus of research has been on determining the effects of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), but mTBI is rarely diagnosed in the absence of co-occurring conditions such as blast exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, etc. These potentially interactive psychological and physical conditions produce complex patterns of cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms that impede civilian reintegration and complicate efficient and effective treatment planning. The Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) has developed a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment of deployment trauma and its consequences in veterans of these wars. The prospective TRACTS longitudinal cohort study conducts state-of-the-art assessments in the domains of biomedical function, lifetime head trauma, psychological function encompassing deployment experience and lifetime exposure to traumatic events, neuropsychological function, and structural and functional neuroimaging. The TRACTS longitudinal cohort study is the first of its kind to comprehensively evaluate lifetime incidence of TBI and PTSD in these veterans, in addition to those incurred during military deployment. The protocol has begun to reveal information that will help improve understanding of the complex pathophysiology associated with co-occurring mTBI and related stress disorders.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pancreaticoduodenal trauma (PDT) is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. In this study, contemporary trends were analysed using national data. Methods The Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 1998?2009 was queried for patients with PDT. Interventions including any operation (Any-Op) and pancreas-specific surgery (PSURG) were identified. Trends in treatment and outcomes were determined [complications, length of stay (LoS), mortality] for the Any-Op, PSURG and non-operative (Non-Op) groups. Analyses included chi-squared tests, Cochran?Armitage trend tests and logistic regression. Results A total of 27?216 patients (nationally weighted) with PDT were identified. Over time, the frequency of PDT increased by 8.3%, whereas the proportion of patients submitted to PSURG declined (from 21.7% to 19.8%; P = 0.0004) and the percentage of patients submitted to non-operative management increased (from 56.7% to 59.1%; P = 0.01). In the Non-Op group, mortality decreased from 9.7% to 8.6% (P < 0.001); morbidity and LoS remained unchanged at ?40% and ?12 days, respectively. In the PSURG group, mortality remained stable at ?15%, complications increased from 50.2% to 71.8% (P < 0.0001) and LoS remained stable at ?21 days. For all PDT patients, significant independent predictors of mortality included: the presence of combined pancreatic and duodenal injuries; penetrating trauma, and age >50 years. Having any operation (Any-Op) was associated with mortality, but PSURG was not a predictor of death. Conclusions The utilization of operations for PDT has declined without affecting mortality, but operative morbidity increased significantly over the 12 years to 2009. The development of an evidence-based approach to invasive manoeuvres and an early multidisciplinary approach involving pancreatic surgeons may improve outcomes in patients with these morbid injuries.

AB  - Abstract: The methods adopted in the appraisal of the trauma of three communities after different disasters in the South Pacific are described and discussed. The outcome affirms the need for non-indigenous clinicians to be ready to adjust their concepts and methods to suit the cultural frameworks they encounter when they are invited abroad, and for local health professionals to be ready to share their knowledge and skills with their collegues from abroad. The outcome, it is argued, should improve the quality of service provided at all stages of disaster recovery, and still enable questions to be raised about matters of fundamental concern ? such as the power of religious belief and of social justice in the process of healing. These questions were found to be of particular importance in the context of the South Pacific cultures.

AB  - Objective? To compare the diagnostic yield of conventional radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images of the skulls of dogs and cats with maxillofacial trauma (MFT). Study Design? Prospective study. Animals? Dogs (n=9) and 15 cats with MFT. Methods? CT-scans and skull radiographs (4 standard projections) for each animal were evaluated using a semi-quantitative scoring system for the ability to identify 26 predefined, clinically relevant anatomic features (Part 1), and 27 predetermined potential traumatic injuries (Part 2). For Part 1, mean scores for each anatomic feature were recorded for every view and imaging modality. For Part 2, studies were evaluated for the frequency of cases where each predetermined traumatic injury was identified. Results? Part 1: On radiographs it was easy to identify 17 of 26 anatomic features whereas 6 features were very difficult or impossible to identify on any view. All structures were considered easy or very easy to identify on CT. Scores for CT were lower than radiographs for evaluating dental occlusion and the integrity of the mandibular body. Part 2: CT scans demonstrated 1.6 times more maxillofacial injuries for dogs and 2.0 times more for cats than conventional radiographs. The average number of MFT injuries per animal by radiographs and CT-scan was 4.8 and 7.6 in dogs, and 3.8 and 7.7 in cats, respectively. Conclusion? CT is superior to conventional skull radiography for identification of anatomic structures and traumatic injuries in dogs and cats. Skull radiography is useful for visualizing the mandibular body and dental occlusion. Clinical Relevance? CT allows for accurate assessment, diagnosis and treatment planning of MFT in dogs and cats.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: We present a protocol for the non-invasive angiographic assessment of the arterial and venous cerebrovascular (CV) system by multi-slice CT. Material and Methods: Data acquisition was performed in a multi-slice CT scanner with a scan range from the carotid bifurcation to the vertex and manual scan start following i.v. administration of 120 ml iodinated contrast medium with a flow rate of 4 ml/s. This protocol was applied in 12 patients with symptoms of acute CV insuffiency. Results: In all patients, comprehensive imaging of the arteriovenous CV system was achieved including the common carotid bifurcation, the third segment of the major cerebral arteries, the dural sinus and the internal cerebral veins. Various CV pathologies, such as a territorial artery occlusion, a thrombotic obstruction of the internal carotid artery, an intracranial arteriovenous malformation and a sinus vein thrombosis, were successfully evaluated. Conclusion: Comprehensive assessment of the arteriovenous CV system is possible by the use of a single-bolus, monophasic multi-slice scan technique.

AB  - Abstract The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among U.S. veterans deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan necessitates the need for comprehensive assessment and treatment strategies. This study investigated the utility of a combat-related PTSD symptom provocation paradigm to elicit unique neurological responses across three groups: combat veterans with PTSD, combat veterans without PTSD, and nonmilitary participants without PTSD. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) the results indicated that combat veterans with PTSD demonstrated significant activation to a trauma-related sound compared with nonmilitary personnel, channel 14: d = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.28, 1.76]; channel 15: d = 1.30, 95% CI [0.53, 2.06]; and combat veterans without PTSD, channel 14: d = 0.87, 95% CI [0.14, 1.59]. Specifically, this increased neural activation was approximately located in the right medial superior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9/10), an area associated with experiencing negative or threatening stimuli and emotional detachment. There were no differences across the groups for nontrauma-related sounds. Results were less clear with respect to a combat-related odor. These results suggest a specific neurophysiological response to trauma-related cues and, if replicated, may offer a biomarker for combat-related PTSD. Such a response could provide incremental validity over diagnostic assessments alone and assist in planning and monitoring of treatment outcome.

AB  - Summary The volumes and pH of gastric aspirates obtained from 110 children (aged 1?14 years) who underwent surgery for trauma were related to the duration of pre-operative starvation and to the interval between food and injury. Aspirates were larger in children fasted for 4?6 hours than in those fasted for up to 10 hours, and were larger in children injured within 2 hours of eating than in those in whom this interval was longer (p < 0.05). However, 19 of 39 children (49%) starved for over 8 hours had an aspirate of more than 0.4 ml/kg. as did five of 16 children (31%) injured 3 or more hours after eating. Thus, a ?safe? interval between oral intake and induction cannot be predicted. We conclude that securing the airway by prompt tracheal intubation is the safest way to manage any child who presents for emergency anaesthesia after trauma.

AB  - Trauma research has identified a link between parental adjustment and children?s functioning and the sometimes ensuing intergenerational impact of traumatic events. The effects of traumatic events on children have been demonstrated to be mediated through their impact on children?s parents. However, until now, little consideration has been given to the separate and more proximal mechanism of parenting practices as potential mediators between children?s adjustment and traumatic events. To shed some light in this arena, we review literature on trauma, adversity, and resilience, and discuss how parenting practices may mediate trauma and adverse environmental contexts. Using a social interaction learning perspective (Forgatch  Patterson, 2005), we propose a prevention research framework to examine the role that parenting practices may play in influencing children?s adjustment in the wake of trauma exposure. The article concludes by providing a specific model and role for evidence-based parenting interventions for children exposed to mass trauma.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how photovoice action research (PVAR) aimed at addressing gender-based violence (GBV) also responds to trauma resulting from GBV. I conducted a content analysis of 17 publications that use PVAR to address GBV to assess for how the PVAR projects also treat trauma symptoms. Briere and Scott's (2015) philosophical approach to trauma therapy is the conceptual framework for data analysis. I developed a priori codes aligned with the philosophical approach and deductively applied them to the data: (a) intrinsic processing; (b) respect, positive regard, and compassion; (c) hope; and (d) the pain paradox. The results reveal how data from the 17 PVAR studies correspond with the 4 philosophical concepts. Practical and research recommendations include using and evaluating PVAR as a tool to treat trauma and contribute to trauma treatment research with underrepresented communities.

Two measures were created to understand the levels of aggression teachers report occurs in their classrooms and to understand how teachers interact with media related to school shootings. Both ISSM and ATT were associated with higher levels of STSS. Lockdown drills did not appear to interact with these relationships to either strengthen or weaken them. Considering the importance of teachers? well-being and how it influences their ability to be effective teachers, continued investigation is warranted.

AB  - Abstract: Liver transplantation (LTx) in children currently offers long-term survival rates of more than 80%. Many causes for Tx failure have been identified. However, the incidence and impact of multi-organ system failure (MOSF) are, to date, unknown. Therefore, in this study the role of MOSF after LTx in children was investigated with regard to outcome. The data of 114 children (53 girls, 61 boys; median age 4.3?yr) after first LTx were evaluated retrospectively. The definition of MOSF, as used by Wilkinson et al. [Crit Care Med 1986: 14: 271?274], was modified with regard to age-adjusted values. The influence of MOSF on patient survival was investigated by Kaplan?Meier analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Thirty-one of 114 children with orthotopic LTx developed MOSF (involving two or more organs). In total, 18 children died (15.8%) during the hospitalization; 16 of these had MOSF. Mortality related to two-organ failure was 29.4% (n?=?5), to three-organ failure 78% (n?=?7), and to four-organ failure 80% (n?=?4). The highest mortality rates were observed in children with central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular failure, leading to a decreased probability of survival of 0.40 (p <?0.0001). Multi-variate analysis showed that CNS and cardiovascular failure were the most important risk factors for survival (p <?0.0001 and 0.056, respectively). Respiratory and renal failure, in univariate analysis, were significant contributors to poor survival, but had no statistically significant influence on outcome in multivariate analysis. Bone marrow insufficiency was found to have no influence on survival in either analysis. In multivariate analysis, the risk of development of MOSF was significantly increased by high numbers of transfused units of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), the absence of rejection episodes, or a high bilirubin level prior to Tx. Hence, MOSF is a major factor contributing to the death of children early after LTx. CNS and cardiovascular failure carried the highest risk for a poor outcome. Other risk factors associated with the development of MOSF were: numbers of transfused units of FFP, absence of rejection episodes, and a high pre-Tx bilirubin level.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are life-threatening complications in trauma patients. Despite the implantation of a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv ECMO), sufficient oxygenation (arterial SaO2?>?90%) is not always achieved. The additive use of high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) and ECMO in the critical phase after trauma could prevent the occurrence of life-threatening hypoxaemia and multi-organ failure. We report on a 26-year-old female (Injury Severity Score 29) who had multiple injuries as follows: an unstable pelvic fracture, a blunt abdominal trauma, a blunt trauma of the left thigh, and a thoracic injury. Three days after admission, the patient developed fulminant ARDS (Murray lung injury score of 11 and Horovitz- Index <80?mmHg), and vv ECMO therapy was initiated. The Horovitz- Index was <80?mm Hg, and the lung compliance was minimal. With HFOV, almost complete recruitment of the lung was achieved, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was significantly reduced. The pelvic fracture was treated non-operatively. The HFOV was terminated after 3 days, and the ECMO was stopped after 19 days.

AB  - Summary? In this selective study, 59% of the patients had a renal injury (laceration, rupture or pedicle injury). A normal IVU excluded significant renal injury after blunt trauma. Renal angiography was more accurate than ultrasonography or computed tomography in determining the extent of the injury. A retroperitoneal haematoma found during laparotomy should be explored if significant renal trauma cannot be excluded. Renal salvage after rupture or pedicle injury should be attempted in stable patients.

AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.
