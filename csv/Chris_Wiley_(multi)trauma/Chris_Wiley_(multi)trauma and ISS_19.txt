AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.

AB  - Summary Multi-systemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease (MEED) is a relatively uncommon disease characterised by eosinophilic infiltration of more than one organ system, with the skin and gastrointestinal tract most commonly affected. This case report describes a gelding that presented for weight loss, increased respiratory rate and effort and chronic intermittent epistaxis. During post mortem examination diffuse eosinophilic granulomatous lesions were identified in the lung and liver, leading to a diagnosis of MEED. Veno-occlusive pulmonary remodelling was also discovered, believed to be the cause of the chronic epistaxis and a result of the pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic granulomas.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To identify and review evidence relating to the measurement properties of published multi-item outcome measures for the conservative management of lateral ligament injuries of the ankle. Methods? Systematic literature searches were used to identify measures, which were then assessed against pre-defined criteria relating to development, item content, reliability, validity and responsiveness. Results? Seven disease-specific measures of ankle status [Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool, Clinical Trauma Severity Score, Composite Inversion Injury Scale, Kaikkonen Functional Scale (KFS), Karlsson Ankle Function Score (KAFS), Olerud and Molander Ankle Score (OMAS), and the Point System] and two generic measures of health (McGill Pain Questionnaire, Sickness Impact Profile) met the review inclusion criteria. While all measures had been used in acute injuries, only two had also been applied during later stages of recovery (>6?months). The studies covered a comprehensive range of graded ligament injuries. Expert opinion dominated item generation for all measures. All measures lack evidence of test-retest or internal consistency reliability in patients with ankle sprain. Several measures were assessed for validity through comparison with other measures, but there was limited evidence of construct validity and no formal assessment of responsiveness for any measure. Conclusion? The disappointing lack of evidence for measurement properties suggests that any measure should be used with caution until appropriate evidence is provided. On the basis of limited evidence, the KFS offers the most promising approach to a combined clinician- and patient-assessment of ankle function, and the KAFS or OMAS if a patient-assessed evaluation of function is required.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

AB  - A nine-year-old girl with spastic quadripiegia, mental retardation, poor vision, a gastrostomy, and intractable epilepsy was referred by her pediatrician for a dental assessment with a view to extracting her anterior teeth as a means of preventing repeated damage to the skin over the proximal phalanx of her left thumb, which she sucked at night. This was the time of day when the frequency of her epileptic seizures was highest. A simple solution to the problem was developed by a dentist and an occupational therapist In which nylon-coated 3-mm neoprene sheeting (wet-suit material) was formed into a ?thumb-sock? with a simple Velcro fastening around the wrist. No trauma to the thumb from epileptic seizures has occurred since the ?thumb-sock? was fitted 24 months ago.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among children in Maryland and to examine factors that influence hospital admission. Methods: Statewide mortality, hospital discharge, and ambulatory care data were used to identify all TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occurred in 1998 to children aged 0-19 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's standard case definition and protocol. Inpatient admission was modeled as a function of patient, injury, and hospital characteristics. Results: The overall incidence of pediatric TBI (i.e., ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths) in 1998 was 670/100,000. After controlling for injury severity and other factors, uninsured children were 40% less likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 0.43 to 0.82) and children with Medicaid were 90% more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 1.42 to 2.54) than were those with private insurance. The presence of a major associated injury significantly influenced the likelihood of hospitalization, especially among children with a minor (OR = 8.8) to moderate (OR = 11.6) TBI. Children who presented to a trauma center hospital were significantly more likely to be hospitalized than children treated at a non-trauma center hospital, although this varied depending on income (OR = 1.8 for high versus low) and hospital volume (OR = 2.6 for a small hospital and OR = 29.0 for a large hospital). Conclusions: After adjusting for TBI severity and the presence of associated injuries, significant differences in hospitalization rates may exist among different patient subgroups and hospitals for children who sustain TBIs.

All patients who admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in 3 months (during July?October 2010) were surveyed with Braden scale. Patients who gained higher score of Braden scale were at lower risk for pressure ulcer development compared with the other patients. Braden scale is a useful tool for predicting pressure ulcer development in trauma ICU patients. Also, factors such as age and level of consciousness may influence pressure ulcer development.

Setting Obstetric units in the Netherlands. Population Women with a singleton pregnancy beyond 24 weeks of gestation. Methods Random allocation of obstetric units to a 1-day, multi-professional, simulation-based team training focusing on crew resource management (CRM) in a simulation centre or to no such team training. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed at the cluster level, including a measurement 1 year prior to the intervention. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was a composite outcome of obstetric complications during the first year post-intervention, including low Apgar score, severe postpartum haemorrhage, trauma due to shoulder dystocia, eclampsia and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Maternal and perinatal mortality were also registered. Results Each study group included 12 units with a median unit size of 1224 women, combining for a total of 28 657 women. In total, 471 medical professionals received the training course. The composite outcome of obstetric complications did not differ between study groups [odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80?1.3]. Team training reduced trauma due to shoulder dystocia (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25?0.99) and increased invasive treatment for severe postpartum haemorrhage (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2?3.9) compared with no intervention. Other outcomes did not differ between study groups. Conclusion A 1-day, off-site, simulation-based team training, focusing on teamwork skills, did not reduce a composite of obstetric complications. Tweetable abstract 1-day, off-site, simulation-based team training did not reduce a composite of obstetric complications.

AB  - Abstract A severe microarterial trauma (arteriotomy/intimectomy) was introduced to the central arteries of rabbit ears. Twenty-one patent vessels, 3 at each interval of 2 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after reperfusion were taken for light and scanning electron microscopy studies. These vessels remained patent at all time intervals. A physiological ?in vivo? perfusion technique with fixation fluid of normal temperature (37°C), pressure (120 mm Hg) and osmolarity (300 mOsm) was used to ensure fixed relaxed vessels. The endothelial, internal elastic, and part of the medial layers of vessel walls were removed following intimectomy. The inner surface of the intimectomy region was irregular and partly covered with thrombotic materials between 2 hours and 3 days postreperfusion. Endothelialization of the traumatized region was first observed at 3 days and was completed between 7 and 14 days. Intimal hyperplasia developed during this period and had not diminished in thickness by 30 or 90 days. The trauma and healing process of the arteriotomy/intimectomy are similar to the healing of vascular anastomoses and virtually identical to the clinical trauma of vessel avulsion, but neointima formation is more pronounced and engages vessel walls far outside the intimectomy site. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Aim? Whole-body multislice CT-Scanning (MSCT) has become the primary imaging device in many European and North American trauma centres. We aim to present a new standardised protocol that has lead to a markedly improved diagnostic managment in an Australian metropolitan trauma centre. Methods? Based on growing evidence in the literature the MSCT is used as the primary imaging tool in severely injured patients and is routinely performed after completion of primary and secondary survey. The routine protocol consists of a non-contrast head and cervical spine CT, followed by a contrast chest, abdomen and pelvic CT. Apart from an initial chest X-Ray, routine X-ray trauma series are not performed anymore. The criteria for this whole-body MSCT are strictly limited to patients that required trauma team activation and can be sufficiently stabilised in the emergency room. Results? This adapted diagnostic algorithm has shown to be very fast and efficient. The average duration of initial management can be reduced significantly, in addition the number of initially missed injuries is markedly reduced. Conclusions? Primary whole-body MSCT has become a valuable diagnostic tool in the emergency management of severe trauma. A strictly followed protocol has been shown to be crucial to avoid overuse, in terms of radiation as well as exposing the unstable patient to an unnecessary high risk.

AB  - Studies on HIV acquisition and transmission in women exposed to sexual trauma throughout their life cycle are lacking, but some findings suggest that rates of HIV acquisition through coercive sex are significantly higher than that seen in consensual sex. Sexual trauma can also occur as a result of female genital mutilation, which makes sex extremely painful and can cause increased abrasions, lacerations, and inflammation, which enhances the risk of HIV acquisition. This review presents an overview of the immune system in the human female reproductive tract (FRT) from adolescence, through puberty to pregnancy and menopause. What is clear is that the foundation of information on immune protection in the FRT throughout the life cycle of women is extremely limited and at some stages such as adolescence and menopause are grossly lacking. Against this backdrop, forced or coercive sexual intercourse as well as genital mutilation further complicates our understanding of the biological risk factors that can result in transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

AB  - Abstract??? Studies have shown that some children and adolescents are affected only once with dental trauma, while others seem to be accident-prone and suffer from multiple dental trauma episodes. Less is known about treatment consequences related to repeated traumatic dental injuries to the same tooth and treatment guidelines are not well established. Complicated crown fractures and crown-root fractures pose difficulties for dentists to establish adequate treatment plans because these fractures require multidisciplinary knowledge and approach for a correct case planning and prognosis. The objective of this paper was to present and discuss a case of a child who sustained a second trauma to the same tooth following treatment of an earlier sustained crown fracture. The research-based background for establishment of the treatment plan is discussed. Reattachment of tooth fragment is a minimal invasive and esthetic method. Essential advantage of the reattached teeth is the fact that all the alternative methods as direct adhesive resin reconstruction, veneers and crowns can be performed in case of failure or a refracture. As a consequence of initial trauma, the tooth suffered a complicated crown fracture which was resolved by endodontic therapy and fragment reattachment. During follow-up, the child suffered a second trauma resulting in dislodgement and fracture of the reattached fragment and a crown-root fracture extending subgingivally with involvement of the biologic width. A conservative restorative option is described. After 1?year of follow-up, the clinical and radiographic findings demonstrated that the adopted clinical protocol was successful and yielded healthy periodontal tissues with no signs of periradicular pathosis. The occurrence of repeated traumatic dental injuries to teeth involving conservative management of both crown-root fracture and complicated crown fracture on the same tooth is extremely rare and a challenge for dental professionals to treat.

AB  - Abstract Use of ceiling-mounted radiographic equipment in an emergency room for management of the multiply injured patient is described. The protocol of the Advanced Trauma and Life Support manual is followed and three plain radiographs (lateral cervical spine, anteroposterior views of the chest and pelvis) are obtained by the radiographers, who are members of the trauma team. Abnormalities were diagnosed on 7 per cent of the cervical radiographs, 31 per cent of the chest and 28 per cent of the pelvis in 108 patients during the first year of use. With full integration of the radiographers into the trauma team these three initial films are obtained within 10 min. Subsequent films can be taken of skeletal injuries found clinically or incidentally on the first three plain radiographs. It is recommended that all emergency rooms should have a ceiling-mounted radiographic unit with an automatic daylight processor to provide the best service for patients with major trauma.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma-related guilt are risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) in veterans. Components of trauma-related guilt were examined as serial mediators of the relationship between PTSD and SI. In a sample of 53 OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans, PTSD had an indirect effect on SI through a serial mediation chain of guilt cognitions, distress, and global guilt, suggesting that trauma-related guilt via cognitions, distress, and global guilt is a pathway from PTSD to SI. Attention should be given to assessing and addressing trauma-related guilt in veterans experiencing PTSD to prevent SI.

AB  - Abstract This Case report illustrates the importance of coordinating various dental specialties in the successful treatment of the traumatized patient. The patient sustained multiple traumatic injuries to the anterior maxilla in the primary and permanent dentition stages of development. Orthodontic considerations involved in this case included an unerupted maxillary right central incisor with dilaceration of its root, severe malocclusion, and compromised esthetics. Endodontic concerns were directed toward the traumatized primary and permanent maxillary incisors with subsequent devitalization of the maxillary right permanent central incisor and calcification of the maxillary left permanent incisor. Oral surgery, oral pathology and general dentistry were also involved throughout the course of treatment.

AB  - Summary Ever since the introduction of dissociative identity disorder (DID) into the DSM-III in 1980, controversy has swirled around the nature and the validity of this diagnosis. Some prominent authors who are skeptical about the validity of the DID diagnosis have proposed a sociocognitive model through which DID is thought to be caused by clinicians who believe strongly in the diagnosis and who covertly mold patients to enact the symptoms of DID. However, there are clearly DID presentations that are credible, and treatment outcome research has demonstrated that DID is responsive to treatment?quite the opposite from what one would expect if the DID was essentially a shared delusion between patients and their therapists. Although there is little evidence that DID can be created through a sociocognitive model where no underlying dissociation exists, it seems likely that the precise symptoms of dissociation can be molded through cultural expectations. Given that the expression of some dissociative symptomatology may be somewhat malleable, it behooves clinicians to not superimpose any particular model of symptoms on patients. Cases of severe dissociative disorders are not all uniform in their symptomatic expression, and not all cases of DID are static and unchanging in their level of dissociation over time. Although there is no clear evidence that authentic DID can be iatrogenically created, patients with lesser degrees of dissociation can be pushed into DID-like presentation by naïve or overzealous therapists. Pseudo-dissociation can also arise from patients who erroneously come to believe that they have DID. Some of these patients do have some dissociative symptoms and some have trauma in their backgrounds. Others seem to suffer primarily from severe personality disorders with intense identity diffusion and internal emptiness. DID can also be factitious or malingered, especially by patients who are somewhat knowledgeable about the disorder. However, careful attention to the patient's presentation and history can often distinguish between authentic and feigned presentations. Current and future research will do much to clarify the various presentations of dissociation. There will also be an increased level of sophistication regarding the assessment of patients, including an understanding of prognosis, and the application of treatment models and treatment modalities. There are also understudied areas in trauma psychiatry that deserve closer scrutiny, such as the effects of trauma on sexuality and understanding the perpetrators of child sexual abuse. In more traditional areas of study, more information is needed to assist clinicians to understand what processes in treatment actually help patients. Experienced and accomplished psychotherapists need to both study and write about what they do, in order to pass down their wisdom and expertise to others who struggle with uncertainty and isolation in their clinical practice, and to future generations of clinicians. Finally, the clinical and academic communities involved with trauma treatment have a responsibility to continue to educate the public and our governmental institutions about the effects of psychological trauma. Experts in the trauma field have an important role in educating others and ensuring that proper attention and resources are allocated to the victims of trauma and victimization.

AB  - Summary Emergency cricothyrotomy is a common feature in all difficult airway algorithms. It is the final step following a ?can't intubate, can't oxygenate? scenario. It is rarely performed and has a significant failure rate. There is variation in the reported size of the cricothyroid membrane, especially across population groups. Procedural failure may result from attempting to pass a device with too large an external diameter through the cricothyroid membrane. We aimed to determine the maximum height of the cricothyroid membrane in a UK trauma population. Electronic callipers were used to measure the maximum height of the cricothyroid membrane on 482 reformatted trauma computed tomography scans, 377 (78.2%) of which were in male patients. The mean (SD) height of the cricothyroid membrane, as independently measured by two radiologists, was 7.89 (2.21) mm and 7.88 (2.22) mm in male patients, and 6.00 (1.76) mm and 5.92 (1.71) mm in female patients. The presence of concurrent tracheal intubation or cervical spine immobilisation was found not to have a significant effect on cricothyroid membrane height. The cricothyroid membrane height in the study population was much smaller than that previously reported. Practitioners encountering patients who may require an emergency surgical airway should be aware of these data. Rescue airway equipment with variety of external diameters should be immediately available.
