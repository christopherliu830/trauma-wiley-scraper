AB  - Background Limited data Exists ? on the Australian epidemiology of renal trauma, with very few studies published in the literature. The authors aim to detail the trends of renal trauma in the coastal city of the Gold Coast. Methods Retrospective data collection yielded 81 patients who sustained renal trauma from our 3-year period. Data included information on demographics, mechanism, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade, presence of haematuria, associated injuries, management, and complications. Results Male patients accounted for 83% (n = 67) of cases, and the average age of all injuries was 36 years. Low-grade AAST Grade I?III injuries comprised of 76% (n = 62) of injuries, AAST Grade IV contributed to 20% (n = 16) and 4% (n = 3) of injuries were AAST Grade V. The most common mechanism of injury was road accidents accounting for 35% (n = 28) followed by fall-related injuries (26%, n = 21). Other mechanisms included sport-related (13.5%, n = 11), non-motorized bicycle injuries (8.5%, n = 7), alleged assault (8.5%, n = 7), pedestrian injuries (5%, n = 4) and horse-related injuries (2%, n = 2). Ninety-six percent (n = 78) of kidney injuries were managed conservatively. Of the patients requiring intervention, all were AAST Grade V kidney injuries. Conclusion Males accounted for the majority of renal trauma cases, similar to the 3:1 ratio of male-to-female injuries found in other studies. In line with other studies, renal trauma reviewed on the Gold Coast also revealed road trauma as the leading cause, closely followed by falls. The majority of high-grade renal trauma was managed conservatively.

AB  - Background:? The aims of this cohort study were to assess the survival of trauma patients treated in a general intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, injury severity score (ISS), age, sex and severe head injury as predictors of 30-day mortality. Methods:? Three hundred and twenty-five adult patients admitted during 1998?2003 were evaluated retrospectively with update of survival data in January 2005. Kaplan?Meier statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to study survival and to assess predictors of mortality, respectively. Results:? The 30-day mortality was 16.9%, ICU mortality 13.8% and hospital mortality 17.8%. Long-term survival (observation time, 1?7 years) was 77.8%. After 3.5 years, mortality was the same as for the background population. Severe head injury was the main cause of death and increased the risk of 30-day mortality 2.4-fold. In addition, SAPS II and an age above 50 years proved to be significant predictors of mortality in a multivariate analysis. Sex was not associated with mortality, and ISS and the maximum SOFA score were significant predictors in univariate analyses only. Conclusion:? Reduced long-term survival was observed up to 3.5 years after acute injury. The 30-day mortality was strongly related to severe head injury, SAPS II and an age above 50 years. These variables may be useful as predictors of mortality, and may contribute to risk adjustment of this subset of trauma patients when treatment results from different centres are compared.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Most potentially preventable haemorrhagic deaths occur within 6?h of injury. Conventionally, blood component therapy delivery is measured by 24-h cumulative totals and ratios. The study aim was to examine the effect of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) on early (6?h) balanced component therapy. Methods:? An 88-month retrospective clinical study at a level 1 trauma centre was undertaken, examining consecutive trauma patients receiving ≥10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) within 24?h, before (pre-MTP) and after implementation of MTP. Demographic data, injury severity score (ISS), abbreviated injury scale (AIS), shock parameters, coagulation profile, the need for surgical intervention (<24?h), mortality and intensive care unit length of stay were collected. The ratios of blood products given by 6?h, by 24?h and the time between administrations of components was collected and analysed. Results:? Pre-MTP and MTP patients had similar demographics, shock severity and initial laboratory findings. Despite MTP patients having had a higher ISS (42 ± 12 versus 36 ± 12, P < 0.05) and AIS head score (2.6 ± 1.8 versus 1.6 ± 2.0, P < 0.05), there was no difference in mortality. Area under the curve (AUC) of the MTP period showed earlier delivery of higher median ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)/PRBC (P= 0.004). Similar findings were found for cryoprecipitate/PRBC and platelet/PRBC ratios. By 24?h, the AUC for FFP/PRBC ratios were no different. Discussion:? Implementation of MTP resulted in earlier balanced transfusion. The difference between the FFP/PRBC ratios of the two types of resuscitations levelled by 24?h. The efficacy of component therapy delivery should be measured earlier than 24?h.

AB  - Abstract Research findings have documented a relationship between the number of types of traumatic events to which refugees were exposed and psychological disorders. It is unclear, however, if gender moderates the impact of trauma on refugee mental health. The participants in this study were 60 male and 31 female refugees and asylum-seekers resettled in Australia. Participants had a mean age of 34.54 years (SD = 9.70), and were from a variety of countries including Iraq, Iran, and Sri Lanka. We conducted a multigroup path analysis to test if the relationship between psychological outcomes of exposure to trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression) was different as a function of the type of traumatic exposure (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) or as a function of gender. We found a significant relationship between interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (? = .77) and anxiety symptoms (? = .32) in women, and a significant association between noninterpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (? = .59), anxiety (? =.49), and depression symptoms (? = .32) in men. For men, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = 0.14 to 1.01; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = ?0.53 to 0.43. For women, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = ?0.79 to 0.67; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = ?0.09 to 1.46. These results suggested supporting refugees in their efforts to overcome the psychological impact of trauma, including the allocation of resources in clinical services to support the psychological recovery of refugees.

AB  - ABSTRACT We examined how diverse and cumulated traumatic experiences predicted maternal prenatal mental health and infant stress regulation in war conditions and whether maternal mental health mediated the association between trauma and infant stress regulation. Participants were 511 Palestinian mothers from the Gaza Strip who reported exposure to current war trauma (WT), past childhood emotional (CEA) and physical abuse, socioeconomic status (SES), prenatal mental health problems (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms), and perceived stress during their secondtrimester of pregnancy as well as infant stress regulation at 4 months. While all trauma types were associated with high levels of prenatal symptoms, CEA had the most wide-ranging effects and was uniquely associated with depression symptoms. Concerning infant stress regulation, mothers? CEA predicted negative affectivity, but only among mothers with low WT. Against hypothesis, the effects of maternal trauma on infant stress regulation were not mediated by mental health symptoms. Mothers? higher SES was associated with better infant stress regulation whereas infant prematurity and male sex predisposed for difficulties. Our findings suggest that maternal childhood abuse, especially CEA, should be a central treatment target among war-exposed families. Cumulated psychosocial stressors might increase the risk for transgenerational problems.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine if, amongst civilian trauma patients requiring massive transfusion (MT), the use of a formal trauma transfusion pathway (TTP), in comparison with transfusion without a TTP, is associated with a reduction in mortality, or changes in indices of coagulation, blood product utilisation and complications. A systematic review of three bibliographic databases, reference lists and conference proceedings was conducted. Studies were included if comparisons were made between patients receiving transfusion with and without a TTP. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers on population characteristics, transfusion strategies, blood product utilisation, indices of coagulation, clinical outcomes and complications. Data were pooled using a random effects model and heterogeneity explored. Seven observational studies met all eligibility criteria. Amongst 1801 patients requiring MT, TTPs were associated with a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·55, 0·87). No significant increase in the mean number of PRBC transfused between TTP and control patients was seen (MD ?1·17 95% CI ?2·70, 0·36). When studies assessing only trauma patients were considered, TTPs were associated with a reduction in the mean number of units of plasma transfused (MD ?2·63, 95% CI ?4·24, ?1·01). In summary, the use of TTPs appears to be associated with a reduction in mortality amongst trauma patients requiring MT without a clinically significant increase in the number of PRBC transfused and a potential reduction in plasma transfusion. Effects of TTPs on platelet transfusion, indices of coagulation and complications remain unclear. A randomised controlled trial is warranted.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the peripheral vascular trauma. The presence of a vascular ?hard sign? is highly specific for major vascular injury and mandates operative exploration, however, absence of hard signs does not reliably exclude injury. In contrast, the ?soft signs? of vascular injury does not reliably predict major vascular trauma. It is generally accepted that in the absence of hard signs, patients with a normal peripheral vascular examination does not require further investigation regardless of the presence of soft signs. The arterial pressure index (API) has gained acceptance in some trauma centers as a useful tool in the evaluation of peripheral vascular trauma. While duplex ultrasonography is non-invasive, it is less sensitive in the diagnosis of peripheral vascular trauma than angiography and requires the presence of a trained ultrasonographer, who may not be available at all times.

AB  - Aim.? The aim of this ethnographic study was to explore the culture of a trauma team in relation to human factors. Background.? Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death in the first four decades of life in the western world. Evidence suggests that the initial assessment and resuscitation of trauma victims is most successfully carried out by an organized trauma team. Most trauma teams use Advanced Trauma Life Support principles which focus on rapid assessment and management of the patient's injuries. Similarly, most trauma education focuses on Advanced Trauma Life Support principles, concentrating firmly on the patient's physical status. Nevertheless, contemporary literature about emergency teams suggests that human factors, such as communication and interprofessional relationships, can affect the team's performance regardless of how clinically skilled the team members are. Method.? Focused ethnography was used to explore the culture of a trauma team in one teaching hospital. Six periods of observation were undertaken followed by 11 semi-structured interviews with purposively chosen key personnel. Data from transcripts of the observation field notes and interviews were analysed using open coding, followed by formation of categories resulting in the emergence of six central categories. Results.? Findings suggest that leadership, role competence, conflict, communication, the environment and the status of the patient all influence the culture of the trauma team. Interpretation of these categories suggests that trauma team education should include human factor considerations such as leadership skills, team management, interprofessional teamwork, conflict resolution and communication strategies. Relevance for clinical practice.? The findings suggest that support systems for role development of junior team leaders should be formalized. The proven airline industry techniques of Crew Resource Management, focusing on teamwork and effective communication, could be implemented into continuing professional development for trauma teams to engender collaboration and interprofessional practice.

AB  - Background and Objectives? The empiric use of a high plasma to packed red-blood-cell [fresh frozen plasma:red-blood-cells (FFP:RBC)] ratio in trauma resuscitation for patients with massive bleeding has become well accepted without clear or objective indications. Increased plasma transfusion is associated with worse outcome in some patient populations. While previous studies analyse only patients who received a massive transfusion, this study analyses those that are at risk to receive a massive transfusion, based on the trauma-associated severe haemorrhage (TASH) score, to objectively determine which patients after severe trauma would benefit or have increased complications by the use of a high FFP:RBC ratio. Methods? Multicentre retrospective study from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society. Multivariate logistic regression and statistical risk adjustments utilized in analyses. Results? A high ratio of FFP:RBC in the ≥15 TASH group was independently associated with survival, with an odds ratio of 2·5 (1·6?4·0), while the <15 TASH group was associated with increased multi-organ failure, 47% vs. 38%, (P?<?0·005). Conclusions? A predictive model of massive transfusion upon admission might be able to rapidly identify which severe trauma patients would benefit or have increased complications from the immediate application of a high ratio of FFP:RBCs. This study helps to identify the appropriate population for a prospective, interventional trial.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: 1) Describe probabilistic linkage (PL) for road trauma and rehabilitation records in New South Wales (NSW) Australia. 2) Determine the accuracy of linkage for these records. Methods: Data were extracted from the NSW Trauma Registry for all road trauma admissions for the years 2009?2012 and from Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre for January 2009 to June 2013. PL was performed using: age; sex; residential postcode; and date of acute discharge = date of admission to rehabilitation. False matches were cases that linked but were not true matches; they were determined by manual review. Reasons for incomplete linkages were explored. The benefits and limitations of the linked study dataset are described. Results: Of 3,256 road trauma records, 683 were matched to rehabilitation records. Using the field of ?discharge destination? from the trauma records, 265 patients with unmatched records were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (missed matches). This gave an overall 72% linkage rate (or sensitivity) using PL. There were 16 cases of false matches, giving a specificity of 99%. Conclusion: It was feasible to use PL to link road trauma and rehabilitation datasets in the absence of identifiers. However, this needed to be combined with careful manual review before the linked dataset could be used to make inferences on trauma rehabilitation outcomes. Implication: PL may be a cost-effective way to capture inpatient rehabilitation outcomes of multi-trauma patients.

AB  - Background: Recent studies from the USA and South Africa suggest that primary repair or resection and primary anastomosis have become the recommended treatment for most traumatic colon injuries. The aim of the present review is to determine the applicability of these studies to the urban Australian setting. Methods: All patients with colon injuries operated on at the Royal Melbourne Hospital from March 1989 to March 1999 were identified. Data were collected by a retrospective chart review. Results:? A total of 20 patients sustained 26 injuries to the colon. Blunt injuries were more common than penetrating injuries (14?vs?6). Significant other injuries occurred in 15 patients. Colostomies were performed in four patients. The overall mortality rate was 10%. There were no anastomotic leaks. Primary repair or resection and primary anastomosis were not associated with any increase in intra-abdominal complications. Conclusion:? Evidence from large trauma centres supporting primary repair or resection and primary anastomosis is also applicable to regions that have a low rate of traumatic colon injury.

AB  - Abstract Objective Evidence-based decision-making tools are widely used to guide cervical spine assessment in adult trauma patients. Similar tools validated for use in injured children are lacking. A paediatric-specific approach is appropriate given important differences in cervical spine anatomy, mechanism of spinal injury and concerns over ionising radiation in children. The present study aims to survey physicians' knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment in injured children. Methods A cross-sectional survey of physicians actively engaged in trauma care within a paediatric trauma centre was undertaken. Participation was voluntary and responses de-idenitified. The survey comprised 20 questions regarding initial assessment, imaging, immobilisation and perioperative management. Physicians' responses were compared with available current evidence. Results Sixty-seven physicians (28% registrars, 17% fellows and 55.2% consultants) participated. Physicians rated altered mental state, intoxication and distracting injury as the most important contraindications to cervical spine clearance in children. Fifty-four per cent considered adequate plain imaging to be 3-view cervical spine radiographs (anterior?posterior, lateral and odontoid), whereas 30% considered CT the most sensitive modality for detecting unstable cervical spine injuries. Physicians' responses reflected marked heterogeneity regarding semi-rigid cervical collars and what constitutes cervical spine ?clearance?. Greater consensus existed for perioperative precautions in this setting. Conclusions Physicians actively engaged in paediatric trauma care demonstrate marked heterogeneity in their knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment. This is compounded by a lack of paediatric-specific evidence and definitions, involvement of multiple specialties and staff turnover within busy departments. A validated decision-making tool for cervical spine assessment will represent an important advance in paediatric trauma.

AB  - Trauma remains a major cause of death throughout the world, especially for patients younger than 45 years. Due to rapid advances in clinical management, both in the acute and prehospital settings, trauma patients survive devastating injuries at unprecedented rates. However, these patients can often face life threatening complications that stem from the robust innate immune response induced by severe hemorrhage, leading to further tissue injury rather than repair. The complement and coagulation cascades are key mediators in this disordered reaction, which includes the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy. There is increasing evidence that cross-talk between these two pathways allows rapid amplification of their otherwise targeted responses and contributes to overwhelming and prolonged systemic inflammation. In this article, we summarize the initial steps of innate immune response to trauma and review the complex complement and coagulation cascades, as well as how they interact with each other. Despite progress in understanding these cascades, effective therapeutic targets have yet to be found and further research is needed both to improve survival rates as well as decrease associated morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aims to compare the trauma care systems in Asian countries. Methods Asian countries were categorised into three groups; ?lower middle-income country?, ?upper middle-income country? and ?high-income country?. The Medline/PubMed database was searched for articles published from January 2005 to December 2014 using relevant key words. Articles were excluded if they examined a specific injury mechanism, referred to a specific age group, and/or did not have full text available. We extracted information and variables on pre-hospital and hospital care factors, and regionalised system factors and compared them across countries. Results A total of 46 articles were identified from 13 countries, including Pakistan, India, Vietnam and Indonesia from lower middle-income countries; the Islamic Republic of Iran, Thailand, China, Malaysia from upper middle-income countries; and Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore from high-income countries. Trauma patients were transported via various methods. In six of the 13 countries, less than 20% of trauma patients were transported by ambulance. Pre-hospital trauma teams primarily comprised emergency medical technicians and paramedics, except in Thailand and China, where they included mainly physicians. In Iran, Pakistan and Vietnam, the proportion of patients who died before reaching hospital exceeded 50%. In only three of the 13 countries was it reported that trauma surgeons were available. In only five of the 13 countries was there a nationwide trauma registry. Conclusion Trauma care systems were poorly developed and unorganised in most of the selected 13 Asian countries, with the exception of a few highly developed countries.

AB  - Objective. To reevaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography for detecting and classifying solid-organ injuries from blunt abdominal trauma by comparing ultrasonography with computed tomography (CT) and laparotomy. Methods. Six hundred four patients with blunt abdominal trauma were examined by both B-mode ultrasonography and CT for a study period of 14 years. The ultrasonographic examiners were divided into 2 groups depending on their experience with ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic results were then compared with CT and surgical findings. This was a retrospective study. Results. In 198 patients, solid-organ injuries were identified on CT, laparotomy, or both. Sensitivity values in group A (experts) were 87.5% for hepatic injuries, 85.4% for splenic injuries, 77.6% for renal injuries, and 44.4% for pancreatic injuries. Sensitivity values in group B were 46.2% for hepatic injuries, 50.0% for splenic injuries, and 44.1% for renal injuries. The detection rates in group A were 80% to 100% for different types of hepatic injuries except superficial injuries (20%) and 70% to 100% for different types of splenic injuries. The detection rates for renal parenchymal and pancreatic duct injuries were 53.3% and 80%, respectively. The detection rates for injuries requiring intervention were 86.1% in group A and 66.7% in group B. Conclusions. The sensitivity of ultrasonography with the use of CT and surgical findings as reference standards decreased compared with our prior study. However, ultrasonography was found to enable experienced examiners to detect and classify parenchymal injuries efficiently, despite disadvantages in detecting superficial and vascular injuries. Ultrasonography should be used to explore not only free fluid but also solid-organ injuries.

AB  - Abstract Introduction:? The present article reviews the clinical and imaging clearance of the thoracic and lumbar spines of blunt trauma victims and the evolution of these strategies with the use of new imaging technologies. Methods:? A comprehensive literature search was performed, and articles identified were critically appraised Results:? Twenty papers were identified, 12 directly comparing computed tomography screening with plain X-rays. Evidence-based protocols are presented. The evolution of imaging strategies in response to new technology is described. Conclusions:? Thoracolumbar spine screening is best done using reformatted images acquired when scanning the chest and abdomen of high-risk multi-trauma patients. If computed tomography is not clinically indicated for investigation of other injuries then plain films are the first line investigation.
