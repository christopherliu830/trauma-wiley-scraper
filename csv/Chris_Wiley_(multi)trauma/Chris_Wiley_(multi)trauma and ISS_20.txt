AB  - ABSTRACT Orthopedic trauma, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruption, is a common source of osteoarthritis in the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive multi-planar imaging modality commonly used to evaluate hard and soft tissues of diarthrodial joints following traumatic injury. The contrast provided by generated images enables the evaluation of bone marrow lesions as well as delamination and degeneration of articular cartilage. We will provide background information about MRI signal generation and decay (T1 and T2 values), the utility of morphologic MRI, and the quantitative MRI techniques of T1?, T2, and T2* mapping, to evaluate subjects with traumatic knee injuries, such as ACL rupture. Additionally, we will provide information regarding the dGEMRIC, sodium, and gagCEST imaging techniques. Finally, the description and utility of newer post hoc analysis techniques, such as texture analysis, will be given. Continued development and refinement of these advanced MRI techniques will facilitate their clinical translation. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is suggested to reflect the adequacy of oxygen delivery, and the main objective of the present study was to determine whether ScvO2 is associated with outcome in haemodynamically stabilized trauma patients. Methods: Haemodynamically unstable trauma patients receiving a central venous line within 1?h of admission were eligible for inclusion in this prospective observational study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), lactate and ScvO2 were recorded at inclusion and every 6?h for 36?h or until lactate was <2.0?mmol/l and ScvO2 was >75% in two consecutive measurements. Patients with a MAP of ≥70?mmHg were considered to be haemodynamically stabilized. The outcome measure was complications defined as infections, delta sequential organ failure assessment score of >0, and mortality. Results: Fifty patients with a median new injury severity score of 27 (17?34) were analysed. Complications occurred in 33 patients. An association between ScvO2 following resuscitation to MAP ≥70?mmHg and complications was detected with an odds ratio of 0.94 (95% confidence interval; 0.89?0.99). This association was also significant when adjusted for injury severity. The result implies that a low ScvO2 value is associated with more complications. The optimal cut-off for ScvO2 to discriminate between patients who did or did not develop complications was found to be 66.5% (56?86%). Conclusions: These data suggest that low ScvO2 in haemodynamically stabilized patients is associated with a poor outcome and that ScvO2 represents a potential endpoint of resuscitation in trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Several anaesthetic drugs have demonstrated antibacterial properties in vitro. Anaesthetics can primarily affect the cell wall of both susceptible and multi-resistant bacteria. They may also have a synergistic effect with conventional antibiotics through an unknown mechanism. We present three cases of a chronic venous ulcer infected by multi-resistant bacteria refractory to conventional systemic antibiotics, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment with topical sevoflurane was performed for 1 month without systemic antibiotics. Patients with an MRSA infection showed progressive improvement with negative culture at the end of the treatment. Multi-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infection persisted at the end of treatment with positive culture. The local adverse events were mild and transient, including heat, pruritus and erythema. Topical sevoflurane may have an antibacterial effect on sensitive and multi-resistant strains. It can allow more complete surgical cleaning, leaving a cleaner wound with less fibrin and necrotic tissue. This decreases the bacterial colonisation and therefore the infectious risk, the bad smell and the exudation. The simultaneous use of conventional antibiotics and topical sevoflurane can have a synergistic antimicrobial effect.

AB  - Three patients arc reported, each with a reddish macule or plaque (7?10 mm) induced by trauma. The histology of these lesions showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and marked dilation of vessels in the papillary to deep dermis. The electron microscopic study revealed a layer of endothelial cells surrounding the dilated vessels, suggestive of telangiectasia. The relationship between this entity and solitary angiokcratoma is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Emergency department (ED) alcohol-related presentation data are not routinely collected in Australia and New Zealand. It is likely that previous research has underestimated the numbers of patients presenting with alcohol-related conditions. This study aimed to quantify the level of alcohol harm presenting to EDs in Australia and New Zealand [Correction added on 23 Jan 2018, after first online publication: The ?aims? section was missing and is updated in this version]. Design Multi-centre, prospective study. Patients were screened prospectively for alcohol-related presentations during a 7-day period in December 2014. Part 1 involved screening to determine alcohol-positive ED presentations and data collection of patient demographic and clinical information. Part 2 involved a consent-based survey conducted with patients aged ≥ 14 years to perform Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores. Setting Eight EDs in Australia and New Zealand, representing differing hospital role delineations. Participants A total of 8652 patients aged ≥ 14 years attended and 8435 (97.5%) were screened. Measurements The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients who had an alcohol-related presentation termed ?alcohol-positive?, using pre-defined criteria. It included injuries, intoxication, medical conditions and injuries caused by an alcohol-affected third party. Secondary outcomes included demographic and clinical information, the type of alcohol-related presentations and AUDIT scores. Findings A total of 801 [9.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.9?10.1%] presentations were identified as alcohol-positive, ranging between 4.9 and 15.2% throughout sites. Compared with alcohol-negative patients, alcohol-positive patients were more likely to be male [odds ratio (OR) = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.63?2.21], younger (median age 37 versus 46 years, P < 0.0001), arrive by ambulance (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.68?2.25) or police/correctional vehicle (OR = 4.56, 95% CI = 3.05?6.81) and require immediate treatment (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 2.03?05.06). The median AUDIT score was 16 (interquartile range = 10?24). Conclusions Almost one in 10 presentations to emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand are alcohol related.

AB  - Abstract This study investigated 1) trauma symptom changes following the implementation of a life skills intervention; 2) the relationship between demographic characteristics, cognitive functioning, life skill knowledge and changes in trauma symptoms; and 3) predictive factors of trauma symptoms during housing transitions. Participants (N?=?72) enrolled in intervention modules to increase residential stability (room and self-care, money management, nutrition management or safe community participation), completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, ACLS-2000 and a Practical Skills Test at baseline, post-intervention and 3 and 6 months later to examine differences in trauma symptoms and treatment outcomes. Trauma symptoms were highest at baseline and decreased significantly for most participants over time. For a subgroup of females experiencing abuse and individuals who were homeless less than 1 year, there was an increase in symptoms at 3 months post-intervention (highest rate of housing transition). This small convenience sample represents a limited geographic area. Replication of the study with larger groups for generalization, and further investigation into the specific impact of symptoms on function were recommended for future research.

AB  - Background Child survival initiatives historically prioritized efforts to reduce child morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases and maternal conditions. Little attention has been devoted to paediatric injuries in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to evaluate the demographics and outcomes of paediatric injury in a sub-Saharan African country in an effort to improve prevention and treatment. Methods A prospective trauma registry was established at the two university teaching campuses of the University of Rwanda to record systematically patient demographics, prehospital care, initial physiology and patient outcomes from May 2011 to July 2015. Univariable analysis was performed for demographic characteristics, injury mechanisms, geographical location and outcomes. Multivariable analysis was performed for mortality estimates. Results Of 11?036 patients in the registry, 3010 (27·3 per cent) were under 18?years of age. Paediatric patients were predominantly boys (69·9 per cent) and the median age was 8?years. The mortality rate was 4·8 per cent. Falls were the most common injury (45·3 per cent), followed by road traffic accidents (30·9 per cent), burns (10·7 per cent) and blunt force/assault (7·5 per cent). Patients treated in the capital city, Kigali, had a higher incidence of head injury (7·6 per cent versus 2·0 per cent in a rural town, P?<?0·001; odds ratio (OR) 4·08, 95 per cent c.i. 2·61 to 6·38) and a higher overall injury-related mortality rate (adjusted OR 3·00, 1·50 to 6·01; P = 0·019). Pedestrians had higher overall injury-related mortality compared with other road users (adjusted OR 3·26, 1·37 to 7·73; P = 0·007). Conclusion Paediatric injury is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Delineating trauma demographics is important when planning resource utilization and capacity-building efforts to address paediatric injury in low-resource settings and identify vulnerable populations.

AB  - Abstract: A pure electroporation injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent osmotic swelling of the tissue. The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile (water) protons and a restricted (protein) proton pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this injury. Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the transverse magnetic relaxation time (T2) in MRIs of healthy and electrically injured tissue. In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the MRI contrast, the degree of structural alteration of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane pores), and edema. The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle tissues, in that edema will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair mechanisms.

AB  - The goals of interstitial implant brachytherapy include delivery of the target dose in a uniform manner while sparing sensitive structures, and minimizing the number of needles and sources. We investigated the use of a multi-species source arrangement ( with ) for treatment in interstitial prostate brachytherapy. The algorithm utilizes an ?adjoint ratio,? which provides a means of ranking source positions and is the criterion for the Greedy Heuristic optimization. Three cases were compared, each using seeds: case I is the base case using alone, case II uses seeds mixed with , and case III uses mixed with . Both multi-species cases result in lower exposure of the urethra and central prostate region. Compared with the base case, the exposure to the rectum and normal tissue increases by a significant amount for case III as compared with the increase in case II, signifying the effect of slower dose falloff rate of higher energy gammas of in the tissue. The number of seeds and needles decreases in both multi-species cases, with case III requiring fewer seeds and needles than case II. Further, the effect of on uniformity was investigated using the seeds in multi-species implants. An increase in uniformity was observed with an increase in the number of seeds implanted. The effects of prostate size on the evaluation parameters for multi-species implants were investigated using and , and an acceptable treatment plan with increased uniformity was obtained.

AB  - The orbit is made up of seven bones, of which, the inferior wall is most vulnerable to injury and the lateral wall, the least common. In assessing facial trauma, it is crucial to include a comprehensive examination and to manage the orbital fractures accordingly. Orbital floor fracture may present with enophthalmos, diplopia and inferior orbital neuropathy. The infra-orbital rim may show a step-off deformity. Full ophthalmologic evaluation is important to rule out optic nerve neuropathy, retinal bleed, and corneal abrasion. Fracture extending to the superior orbital fissure is known as the superior orbital fissure syndrome, often presented with third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves dysfunction. Orbital roof fracture may involve the frontal lobe and frontal sinus. Fracture involving the naso-orbital ethmoid complex may present with CSF leak, diplopia, displaced medial canthus and nasal fracture. High-resolution 1.5mm CT scans is most useful in the aid of diagnosis in addition to tomography. Displaced fractures should be corrected surgically before bony union. Two examples of complex orbital fractures will be presented, illustrating the importance of a multi-surgical team approach to achieve the optimum results.

AB  - Abstract The brutal murder of James Byrd Jr. in June 1998 unleashed a storm of media, interest groups, high profile individuals and criticism on the Southeast Texas community of Jasper. The crime and subsequent response?from within the community as well as across the world?engulfed the entire town in a collective trauma. Using natural disaster literature/theory and employing an ecological approach, Jasper, Texas was investigated via an interrupted time series analysis to identify how the community changed as compared to a control community (Center, Texas) on crime, economic, health, educational, and social capital measures collected at multiple pre- and post-crime time points between 1995 and 2003. Differences-in-differences (DD) analysis revealed significant post-event changes in Jasper, as well as a surprising degree of resilience and lack of negative consequences. Interviews with residents conducted between March 2005 and 2007 identified how the community responded to the crisis and augmented quantitative findings with qualitative, field-informed interpretation. Interviews suggest the intervention of external organizations exacerbated the severity of the events. However, using strengths of specific local social institutions?including faith based, law enforcement, media, business sector and civic government organizations?the community effectively responded to the initial threat and to the potential negative ramifications of external entities.

AB  - Background It is unknown how traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One potential mechanism is via alteration of fear-learning processes that could affect responses to trauma memories and cues. We utilized a prospective, longitudinal design to determine if TBI is associated with altered fear learning and extinction, and if fear processing mediates effects of TBI on PTSD symptom change. Methods Eight hundred fifty two active-duty Marines and Navy Corpsmen were assessed before and after deployment. Assessments included TBI history, PTSD symptoms, combat trauma and deployment stress, and a fear-potentiated startle task of fear acquisition and extinction. Startle response and self-reported expectancy and anxiety served as measures of fear conditioning, and PTSD symptoms were measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Results Individuals endorsing ?multiple hit? exposure (both deployment TBI and a prior TBI) showed the strongest fear acquisition and highest fear expression compared to groups without multiple hits. Extinction did not differ across groups. Endorsing a deployment TBI was associated with higher anxiety to the fear cue compared to those without deployment TBI. The association of deployment TBI with increased postdeployment PTSD symptoms was mediated by postdeployment fear expression when recent prior-TBI exposure was included as a moderator. TBI associations with increased response to threat cues and PTSD symptoms remained when controlling for deployment trauma and postdeployment PTSD diagnosis. Conclusions Deployment TBI, and multiple-hit TBI in particular, are associated with increases in conditioned fear learning and expression that may contribute to risk for developing PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Background Practice guidelines for childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) recommend trauma-focused psychotherapies, mainly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a brief trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment for PTSD in adults, but with few well-designed trials involving children and adolescents. Methods We conducted a single-blind, randomized trial with three arms (n = 103): EMDR (n = 43), Cognitive Behavior Writing Therapy (CBWT; n = 42), and wait-list (WL; n = 18). WL participants were randomly reallocated to CBWT or EMDR after 6 weeks; follow-ups were conducted at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. Participants were treatment-seeking youth (aged 8?18 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD (or subthreshold PTSD) tied to a single trauma, who received up to six sessions of EMDR or CBWT lasting maximally 45 min each. Results Both treatments were well-tolerated and relative to WL yielded large, intent-to-treat effect sizes for the primary outcomes at posttreatment: PTSD symptoms (EMDR: d = 1.27; CBWT: d = 1.24). At posttreatment 92.5% of EMDR, and 90.2% of CBWT no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. All gains were maintained at follow-up. Compared to WL, small to large (range d = 0.39?1.03) intent-to-treat effect sizes were obtained at posttreatment for negative trauma-related appraisals, anxiety, depression, and behavior problems with these gains being maintained at follow-up. Gains were attained with significantly less therapist contact time for EMDR than CBWT (mean = 4.1 sessions/140 min vs. 5.4 sessions/227 min). Conclusions EMDR and CBWT are brief, trauma-focused treatments that yielded equally large remission rates for PTSD and reductions in the severity of PTSD and comorbid difficulties in children and adolescents seeking treatment for PTSD tied to a single event. Further trials of both treatments with PTSD tied to multiple traumas are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Although existing research suggests that certain childhood traumas such as childhood sexual abuse are associated with interpersonal (e.g., marital) difficulties in adulthood, there has been limited research on interpersonal sequelae of other types of traumas. In addition, the association between childhood traumas and interpersonal outcomes has often been limited to a particular outcome such as divorce, and existing studies have rarely controlled for the co-occurrence of other traumas when evaluating interpersonal outcomes. The current study sought to evaluate the associations between 7 childhood traumas and 2 marital outcomes?marital disruption (i.e., divorce and separation) and marital satisfaction?in a large, national probability sample. Results from univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that (a) probability of marital disruption was higher among people who during childhood had experienced physical abuse, rape, or serious physical attack or assault; and (b) current marital satisfaction was lower among people who during childhood had experienced rape or sexual molestation. Results support the importance of childhood traumas in predicting 2 important marital outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Plantation-grown trees have to cope with an increasing pressure of pest and disease in the context of climate change, and breeding approaches using genomics may offer efficient and flexible tools to face this pressure. In the present study, we targeted genetic improvement of resistance of an introduced conifer species in Canada, Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), to the native white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck). We developed single- and multi-trait genomic selection (GS) models and selection indices considering the relationships between weevil resistance, intrinsic wood quality, and growth traits. Weevil resistance, acoustic velocity as a proxy for mechanical wood stiffness, and average wood density showed moderate-to-high heritability and low genotype-by-environment interactions. Weevil resistance was genetically positively correlated with tree height, height-to-diameter at breast height (DBH) ratio, and acoustic velocity. The accuracy of the different GS models tested (GBLUP, threshold GBLUP, Bayesian ridge regression, BayesCπ) was high and did not differ among each other. Multi-trait models performed similarly as single-trait models when all trees were phenotyped. However, when weevil attack data were not available for all trees, weevil resistance was more accurately predicted by integrating genetically correlated growth traits into multi-trait GS models. A GS index that corresponded to the breeders? priorities achieved near maximum gains for weevil resistance, acoustic velocity, and height growth, but a small decrease for DBH. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to breed for high-quality, weevil-resistant Norway spruce reforestation stock with high accuracy achieved from single-trait or multi-trait GS.

AB  - Abstract Limb salvage in fungal osteomyelitis of the post-traumatic lower extremity represents a difficult clinical problem requiring aggressive management. We report lower extremity salvage by radical bony debridement, free tissue transfer, distraction osteogenesis with bone-docking, and a novel antifungal regimen in a clinical setting of infection with Scedosporium inflatum, historically requiring amputation in 100% of cases. We treated Scedosporium inflatum osteomyelitis of the tibia and calcaneus with radical debridement of infected bone, free partial medial rectus abdominis muscle flap coverage, transport distraction osteogenesis, and combination voriconazole/terbinafine chemotherapy, a novel antifungal regimen. We achieved successful control of the infection, limb salvage, and an excellent functional outcome through aggressive debridement of infected bone and soft tissue, elimination of dead space within the bony defect, the robust perfusion provided by the free flap, the hypervascular state induced by distraction osteogenesis, and the synergism of the novel antifungal regimen. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The personal stories that youth in juvenile facilities report to their counselors are heartbreaking because they are filled with accounts of excessive trauma resulting from neglect, physical, sexual, and emotional violence perpetrated on these children. Perry found that trauma develops from severe neglect, abuse, and living in terrorizing environments. Trauma changes the neural processing ability within the child's developing brain which can lead to hypervigilance and dysfunctional behavior. Widom found that children who had been abused or neglected as children have 30% higher arrests as a juvenile and as an adult for a violent offense.
