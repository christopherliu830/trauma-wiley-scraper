AB  - Massive transfusion is a common consequence of major haemorrhage in the trauma patient. It affects the entire process of care, both for the clinicians involved in the patient's care and for the blood bank, given the consequences and complications of transfusions. This article will highlight the pathophysiology leading to the need for massive transfusion and provide some modern surgical approaches to decrease the transfusion requirement and lessen its effect on the individual patient. Practical suggestions for a massive transfusion protocol, based on our experience and the available literature will be provided. Finally the article will examine the complications of a massive transfusion and outline the steps in the prevention and management of these complications.

AB  - Abstract Infection remains the Achilles heel of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. However, an optimal antimicrobial surgical infection prophylaxis (SIP) regimen has not been established. This study evaluated the efficacy of a single-drug SIP compared to a multi-drug SIP on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing continuous-flow LVAD (CF-LVAD) and pulsatile LVAD (P-LVAD) implantation. An electronic search was performed to identify studies in the English literature on SIP regimens in patients undergoing LVAD implantation. Identified articles were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen articles with 1,311 (CF-LVAD: 888; P-LVAD: 423) patients were analyzed. Overall, 501 (38.0%) patients received single-drug SIP, whereas 810 (62.0%) received multi-drug SIP. Time to infection was comparable between groups. There was no significant difference in overall incidence of LVAD-specific infections [single-drug: 18.7% vs. multi-drug: 24.8%, P = 0.49] including driveline infections [single-drug: 14.1% vs. multi-drug: 20.8%, P = 0.37]. Compared to single-drug SIP, patients who received multi-drug SIP had a significantly lower survival rate [single-drug: 90.0% vs. multi-drug: 76.0%, P = 0.01] and infection-free survival rate [single-drug: 88.4% vs. multi-drug: 77.3%, P = 0.04] at 90 days. However, there were no significant differences in 1-year survival and 1-year infection-free survival between groups. No survival differences were observed in the CF-LVAD subset as well. This study demonstrated no additional advantage of a multi-drug compared to a single-drug regimen for SIP. Although there was a modest advantage in early survival among CF-LVAD and P-LVAD patients who received single-drug SIP, there were no significant differences in the 1-year survival and 1-year infection-free survival.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the experience of three highly specialized centres in the vascular evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) in teenagers, as there is little information on this topic, and although clinical guidelines support the use of vascular studies in selected cases, our experience is that vascular evaluation aimed at diagnosing organic ED is uncommon in teenagers, and most are designated as having psychogenic ED. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a retrospective multi-institutional analysis of three ED databases (1998?2003) we assessed males aged ≤19?years presenting with ED. The review of these databases focused on demographic characteristics, risk factors for ED, erectile function, results of vascular evaluation, and the causes of ED. RESULTS In all, 40 males aged 14?19?years were identified. The mean (range) duration of ED at presentation was 22.6?(4?84)?months. The major risk factors for ED were antecedent perineal trauma (37%) and penile trauma or surgery (15%). The mean (sd) International Index of Erectile Function ?erectile function? domain score was 15?(4). Information obtained by history taking was not predictive of the cause of ED. Vascular studies were performed in 62% of the patients and 48% of these patients were found to have an underlying vascular pathology; 42% of the latter group were found to be possible candidates for surgical intervention and another 16% needed further angiographic evaluation. CONCLUSION ED in teenagers should not be routinely categorized as psychogenic without an adequate vascular evaluation, as a significant percentage have abnormal erectile haemodynamics consistent with vasculogenic ED.

AB  - Abstract The potential effects of maternal trauma on mother?infant interaction remain insufficiently studied empirically. This study examined the effects of the September 11, 2001, trauma on mother?infant interaction in mothers who were pregnant and widowed on 9/11, and their infants aged 4?6 months. Split-screen videotaped interaction was coded on a one-second basis for infant gaze, facial affect, and vocal affect; and mother gaze, facial affect, and touch. We examined the temporal dynamics of communication: self-contingency and interactive contingency of behavior by time-series methods. We documented heightened maternal and infant efforts at engagement in the 9/11 (vs. control) dyads. Both partners had difficulty tolerating moments of looking away as well as moments of negative behavior patterns. Heightened efforts to maintain a positive visual engagement may be adaptive and a potential source of resilience, but these patterns may also carry risk: working too hard to make it work. A vigilant, hyper-contingent, high-arousal engagement was the central mode of the interpersonal transmission of the trauma to these infants, with implications for intervention.

AB  - This study describes initial and one-year follow-up findings on verbal memory testing of two patients who sustained moderate head injuries. The two main purposes were (a) to capture the specific patterns of memory disorders shown by these two head-trauma patients, and (b) to explore the nature of the recovery of these disorders. Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the trauma, and about various aspects of the accident itself causing the trauma. The main conclusions to be drawn from the study are that the memory disorders demonstrated are based on difficulties in memory organization, and that the two patients differ in the nature of the recovery of the deficits.

AB  - Abstract??? The aim of the study was to establish the level of knowledge on the management of dental trauma among physicians at Pondicherry, India. A questionnaire was designed and was given to physicians working in medical colleges or as residents in advanced training programs in medicine in Pondicherry, India. The questionnaire contained a clinical situation of tooth avulsion and various treatment options. Only 5.5% of the medical professionals knew about reimplantation and none knew that the patients? mouth was the best transport medium. 90% of them accepted that they had no knowledge on dental trauma management. As the physicians get an opportunity to attend a case of dental trauma in emergency or private practice, it is vital that they possess sufficient knowledge on primary management of tooth avulsion, before referring to dentists.

AB  - BACKGROUND Despite countless advancements in trauma care a survivability gap still exists in the prehospital setting. Military studies clearly identify hemorrhage as the leading cause of potentially survivable prehospital death. Shifting resuscitation from the hospital to the point of injury has shown great promise in decreasing mortality among the severely injured. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our regional trauma network (Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council) developed and implemented a multiphased approach toward facilitating remote damage control resuscitation. This approach required placing low-titer O+ whole blood (LTO+ WB) at helicopter emergency medical service bases, transitioning hospital-based trauma resuscitation from component therapy to the use of whole blood, modifying select ground-based units to carry and administer whole blood at the scene of an accident, and altering the practices of our blood bank to support our new initiative. In addition, we had to provide information and training to an entire large urban emergency medical system regarding changes in policy. RESULTS Through a thorough, structured program we were able to successfully implement point-of-injury resuscitation with LTO+ WB. Preliminary evaluation of our first 25 patients has shown a marked decrease in mortality compared to our historic rate using component therapy or crystalloid solutions. Additionally, we have had zero transfusion reactions or seroconversions. CONCLUSION Transfusion at the scene within minutes of injury has the potential to save lives. As our utilization expands to our outlying network we expect to see a continued decrease in mortality among significantly injured trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a pilot study of a 1-year multi-modal treatment for incest survivors, incorporating individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. The treatment was designed to provide a therapeutic context in which the affective intensity and meaning originally attached to the traumatic experience could be tolerated, and in which a thoughtful, reflective construction of the impact of the trauma could be developed. PTSD symptoms decreased in all participants, with all but one no longer meeting the diagnosis at post-treatment and follow-up. Using a narrative methodology, maladaptive schemas and overwhelming affects, ?trauma themes?, were also assessed to understand the survivors' views about themselves, others and the world around them. Participants demonstrated a steady pattern of improvement in the resolution of trauma themes. A discussion of the complex posttraumatic response to incest is included, as is a brief description of the treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a review of the research on those treatments for childhood trauma deemed 'Well-Supported by Research Evidence' or 'Supported by Research Evidence' by the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC). Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), a well-supported treatment originally designed for families impacted by child sexual abuse or violence, is explored in greater detail as this model has the strongest evidence base among treatments for childhood trauma with effectiveness documented in over 50 scientific studies, including 20 randomised trials. TF-CBT is a components-based, hybrid approach to treating children who have experienced trauma and their non-offending caregivers. Psychoeducation about TF-CBT helps caregivers and children have a general understanding of what treatment will entail and how it will address the trauma symptoms experienced.

AB  - Abstract Background: Provision of enteral nutrition (EN) support is historically inadequate in the critically ill population. An interdisciplinary approach utilizing various strategies has been shown to improve initiation of timely EN support. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the implementation of a series of interventions led by an interdisciplinary team was associated with changes in the initiation of nutrition support in a level 1 trauma center. Methods: Patients admitted between 2009 and 2013 with isolated closed head trauma injuries were identified through the hospital?s trauma center database. The initial population consisted of 159 patients; after exclusion criteria, 141 patients were included in the statistical analyses. Two statistical analyses were conducted. The first calculated the average days to the initiation of nutrition start by admission year. The second estimated the association between admission year and time to nutrition initiation with a generalized linear model. Results: Time to initiate nutrition therapy was estimated to decrease by 1.46 days (47.31%) from 2009 to 2013. The time to initiate nutrition in 2013 was 1.63 days. A significant association was found between the time to initiate nutrition and the 2012 and 2013 binary variables while controlling for confounding variables. The time frame was estimated to be 1.09 (P = .008) and 1.75 (P = .000) days shorter in 2012 and 2013 relative to 2009. Conclusions: An interdisciplinary effort utilizing multiple strategies identified and addressed barriers, resulting in a reduction of variability and a proactive approach to early EN.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study examined the relationship between sexual trauma and eating disorder behavior, taking into account the effects of developmental stage of the victim and the effects of multiple sexual assaults. Method Four groups of adult women took part in this study. Subjects were either victims of childhood sexual abuse, victims of rape in adulthood, victims of both childhood sexual abuse and rape, and controls who were not traumatized sexually. All subjects were assessed with semistructured interviews and self-report inventories that assessed eating disorder behavior, general psychopathology, and impulsivity. Results Victims of childhood sexual abuse differed from controls on measures of eating disorder behavior and individuals who had experienced both childhood sexual abuse and rape in adulthood were most likely to display eating disorder-related psychopathology. Victims of childhood sexual abuse also distinguished themselves with high levels of eating disorder behavior plus multiple forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. Discussion This study provides additional support for the association between childhood sexual abuse and eating disorder behavior. Childhood sexual abuse may be particularly linked to the presence of binge eating behavior and several other forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. ? 2001 by John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To provide guidance for managing the problem of missing data in clinical studies of trauma in order to decrease bias and increase the validity of findings for subsequent use. Organizing Construct: A thoughtful approach to missing data is an essential component of analysis to promote the clear interpretation of study findings. Methods: Integrative review of relevant biostatistics, medical and nursing literature, and case exemplars of missing data analyses using multiple linear regression based upon data from the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma (NSCOT) was used as an example. Findings and Conclusions: In studies of traumatically injured people, multiple imputed values are often superior to complete case analyses that might have significant bias. Multiple imputation can improve accuracy of the assessment and might also improve precision of estimates. Sensitivity analyses which implements repeated analyses using various scenarios may also be useful in providing information supportive of further inquiry . This stepwise approach of missing data could also be valid in studies with similar types or patterns of missing data. Clinical Relevance: In interpreting and applying findings of studies with missing data, clinicians need to ensure that researchers have used appropriate methods for handling this issue. If suitable methods were not employed, nurse clinicians need to be aware that the findings may be biased.

AB  - Background:? The role of pre-hospital trauma care and the effect of pre-hospital rapid sequence intubation (RSI) on patient outcome are still not clear. This study evaluated the impact of pre-hospital trauma care by emergency physicians (EP) on mortality from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a 180-day Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Methods:? A 48-month parallel non-controlled cohort study compared a group of 64 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9; Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15] who received pre-hospital advanced life support (ALS) with RSI and were transported to the hospital by EPs (EP group), with a group of 60 patients who did not receive pre-hospital ALS with RSI [emergency medical technicians (EMT) group]. Results:? There were no significant statistical differences between the groups in age (P= 0.79), mechanism of injury (P= 0.68), gender (P= 0.82), initial GCS (P= 0.63), initial SaO2 in the field (P= 0.63), initial systolic blood pressure in the field (P= 0.47) and on-scene time (P= 0.41). In the EP group, there was significantly better first hour survival (97% vs. 79%, P= 0.02), first day survival (90% vs. 72%, P= 0.02), better functional outcome (GOS 4?5: 53% vs. 33%, P < 0.01; GOS 2?3: 8% vs. 20%, P < 0.01) and shortened hospitalization time in intensive care unit (ICU) (P= 0.03) and other departments (P= 0.04). In total hospital mortality, we detected no differences between both groups [EP group: 40% (95% CI: 34?45%) vs. EMT group 42% (95% CI: 36?47%, P= 0.76], except in a subgroup of patients with GCS 6?8 where there was significantly lower total hospital mortality in the EP group (24% vs. 78%, P < 0.01). Conclusion:? After starting the trauma care system with emergency physicians in our region, there was a decrease in the number of deaths on hospital admission, a reduction in hospital mortality in the GCS group 6?8, a change in the temporal distribution of deaths, an improvement in functional neurological outcome and shortened hospitalization time.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Patients suffering dental trauma are unprepared for the disability challenge and necessary rehabilitation, while a traumatic event places an expanded demand on the dentist who is focused on treating disease. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of traumatic dental injuries (TDI) on patients and to compare patients? and dentists? perceptions of the event. Material and methods TDI patients (aged ≥ 21 years) attending a tertiary dental hospital from 2011 to 2013, and their dentists were recruited with informed consent. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods design was adopted. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) quantitatively identified patients with ?very often,? ?fairly often? or ?occasionally? in at least one of the OHIP-14 questions (Phase 1) to participate in the qualitative phase of the study through focus group discussions (FGD) (Phase 2). FGD for dentists was conducted separately. Results Quantitative analysis showed 28%-55% of TDI patients had ?occasional? to ?very often? discomfort during eating, increased self-consciousness and embarrassment. Qualitative analysis showed patients were concerned with aesthetic disability, treatment cost and potential tooth loss but overcame their negative outlook and accepted prescribed protective measures. Dentists appreciated patients? concerns about aesthetics and functional disruptions but were less attuned to patients? sense of guilt and fear of judgement. Conclusions TDI exert functional, psychological and social impacts on patients. Patients? and dentists? perspectives were useful for understanding the need for continuity of care, and the findings could contribute to effective TDI management.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the clinical dogma that very high doses of methylprednisolone helpful in spinal cord injury are also helpful in optic nerve trauma. Methods: The right optic nerve of 29 male rats received a 5 second traumatic crush followed 30 minutes later by one of five intravenous treatments (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg, or saline). Treatment was continued for three additional administrations at 6 hour intervals. Untreated sham controls (n = 7) were also prepared. Six weeks after injury, animals were sacrificed, perfused and optic nerves systematically counted. RESULTS: Axon counts (means +/? s.e.m.) were as follows: Saline = 16,670 +/? 8,900 (n = 5); Methylprednisolone: 30 mg/kg = 8,098 +/? 4,741 (n = 5); 60 mg/kg = 6,925 +/? 6,517 (n = 4); 90 mg/kg = 2,663 +/? 2,653 (n = 4); 120 mg/kg = 6,149 +/? 3,487 (n = 6). Consequently, the data revealed that saline treated animals retained more axons than those that were administered methylprednisolone (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that methylprednisolone exacerbates axonal loss following crush injury in the rat optic nerve. Based on the results of this study, clinical studies of traumatic optic neuropathy in the future should also examine the possibility that corticosteroid treatment may have an adverse effect on visual outcome following optic nerve trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounting for 80% of head injury diagnoses, recognition of individuals at risk of cognitive dysfunction remains a challenge in the acute setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential role for computerised cognitive testing as part of a complete ED head injury assessment. Methods mTBI patients (n =?36) who incurred a head injury within 24?h of presentation to the ED were compared to trauma controls (n = 20) and healthy controls (n =?20) on tests assessing reaction time, speed and attention, episodic memory, working memory and executive functioning. Testing occurred during their visit to the ED at a mean of 12?h post-injury for mTBI and 9.4?h for trauma controls. These tasks were part of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery iPad application. Healthy controls were tested in both a quiet environment and the ED to investigate the potential effects of noise and distraction on neurocognitive function. Results Reaction time was significantly slower in the mTBI group compared to trauma patients (P =?0.015) and healthy controls (P =?0.011), and deficits were also seen in working memory compared to healthy controls (P?≤?0.001) and in executive functioning (P =?0.021 and P <?0.001) compared to trauma and healthy controls. Performances in the control group did not differ between testing environments. Conclusion Computerised neurocognitive testing in the ED is feasible and can be utilised to detect deficits in cognitive performance in the mTBI population as part of a routine head injury assessment.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To examine the diagnostic yield differences between computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at The Alfred Hospital, Australia in order to justify patient management that results in all subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) patients receiving a 4 vessel cerebral angiogram as part of their investigations despite findings on CTA. Methods: The retrospective study of radiology reports in cases of acute non traumatic SAH in which both CTA and DSA had been performed was conducted in July 2006 to December 2008. Results: Sixty-three patients over two years were included in our study. Twenty (32%) of these patients had no aneurysm identified on CTA or DSA. A total of 68 aneurysms were found in 40 patients. Twelve (30%) of these patients had aneurysms that were only identified on DSA and not on CTA at the time of initial reporting. Three (5%) patients had false positive CTs. While our positive predictive value of CTA approached near 100%, the negative predictive value was found to be less than 70% with an overall diagnostic accuracy of our CTA reports to be 76%. Eighty one percent of the undiagnosed aneurysms on CTA were less than or equal to 3 mm in size. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the need for a CTA to be used in combination with a formal 4 vessel subtraction angiogram in every case presenting with a SAH despite the findings of the CTA.

AB  - Background: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. Methods: A prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip fracture (≥65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30?min after admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4?h of admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. Results: The number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1%), with a decrease from 34% (45 of 132) in the control group to 22% (29 of 131) in the intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically older, more often had >4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the SPMSQ test. Conclusion: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during hospitalization by 35%.
