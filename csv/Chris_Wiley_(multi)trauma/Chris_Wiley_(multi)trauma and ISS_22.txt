AB  - Abstract Background: Blast injury is uncommon, and remains poorly understood by most clinicians outside regions of active warfare. Primary blast injury (PBI) results from the interaction of the blast wave with the body, and typically affects gas-containing organs such as the ear, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. This review investigates the mechanisms and injuries sustained to the abdomen following blast exposure. Methods: MEDLINE was searched using the keywords ?primary blast injury?, ?abdominal blast? and ?abdominal blast injury? to identify English language reports of abdominal PBI. Clinical reports providing sufficient data were used to calculate the incidence of abdominal PBI in hospitalized survivors of air blast, and in open- and enclosed-space detonations. Results: Sixty-one articles were identified that primarily reported clinical or experimental abdominal PBI. Nine clinical reports provided sufficient data to calculate an incidence of abdominal PBI; 31 (3·0 per cent) of 1040 hospitalized survivors of air blast suffered abdominal PBI, the incidence ranging from 1·3 to 33 per cent. The incidence for open- and enclosed-space detonations was 5·6 and 6·7 per cent respectively. The terminal ileum and caecum were the most commonly affected organs. Surgical management of abdominal PBI is similar to that of abdominal trauma of other causes. Conclusion: Abdominal PBI is uncommon but has the potential for significant mortality and morbidity, which may present many days after blast exposure. It is commoner after blast in enclosed spaces and under water. Copyright ? 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of canine brain diseases are often nonspecific. Single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques allow quantification of chemical biomarkers for tissues of interest and may help to improve diagnostic specificity. However, published information is currently lacking for the in vivo performance of these two techniques in dogs. The aim of this prospective, methods comparison study was to compare the performance of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy in the brains of eight healthy, juvenile dogs using 3 Tesla MRI. Ipsilateral regions of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy were performed in symmetric regions of interest of each brain in the parietal (n = 3), thalamic (n = 2), and piriform lobes (n = 3). In vivo single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios from the same size and multi-voxel spectroscopy ratios from different sized regions of interest were compared. No significant difference was seen between single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios for any lobe when regions of interest were similar in size and shape. Significant lobar single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy differences were seen between the parietal lobe and thalamus (P = 0.047) for the choline to N-acetyl aspartase ratios when large multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest were compared to very small multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest within the same lobe; and for the N-acetyl aspartase to creatine ratios in all lobes when single-voxel spectroscopy was compared to combined (pooled) multi-voxel spectroscopy datasets. Findings from this preliminary study indicated that single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques using 3T MRI yield comparable results for similar sized regions of interest in the normal canine brain. Findings also supported using the contralateral side as an internal control for dogs with brain lesions.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - Abstract Objective. Assessment of apolipoprotein E genotype, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in different types of dementia. Subjects. 102 consecutive referrals to an old age psychiatry service based at Manchester were classified according to clinical criteria based on ICD 10. Results. Thirty-seven were considered to have Alzheimer's disease, 16 multi-infarct dementia and 33 to be free from dementia. Sixteen patients, in whom a definitive diagnosis could not be reached or sufficient information was not available, were excluded from the study. There was an increase in the prevalence of the Apo E4 allele in both Alzheimer's disease (?2=3.82, p<0.05) and multi-infarct dementia (?2=1.93, p<0.16) by Wald tests compared to individuals without dementia. The increased prevalence of the E4 Allele in multi-infarct dementia was not related to serum lipid levels. Conclusion. The hypothesis that the onset of multi-infarct dementia may be precipitated by E4's mediation of higher serum cholesterol levels is not supported by the present study. ? 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In January of 1995 a massive earthquake struck the city of Kobe, Japan. This article examines how this event became an opportunity for extending global networks of the science and medicine of trauma. The article is based on ethnographic research in Kobe and Los Angeles with psychiatrists who responded to the earthquake in its immediate aftermath. Three aspects of the process are examined: 1) changes in psychiatric institutions that were ongoing at the time of the earthquake, 2) the place of psychiatry in Japanese cultural self-criticism, and 3) the particular technologies for identifying and treating trauma. Globalization in this case cannot be seen as an imposition of Western cultural forms, but rather an ongoing process that reproduces differences between cultures as particular elements travel between them.

AB  - Abstract The effectiveness of a locally developed trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) program for maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was examined across different therapists in a child protection clinic setting. An earlier phase of the research piloting the program had provided promising results. This second phase involved two studies evaluating the completed TF-CBT manual delivered by (a) the developer and (b) other therapists. A single-case multiple-baseline design was used to demonstrate the controlling effects of the treatment on PTSD symptoms and child coping. Eight 9?13-year-old abused children with PTSD were treated. Positive outcomes support the effectiveness of the TF-CBT program delivered by both the developer and other therapists. The study design and methodology were robust enough to confirm empirically the clinically beneficial effects and potential for this new program. It was also apparent, however, from study limitations, including missing data for some patients, that there are a number of challenges in carrying out such research in a busy child protection service setting with multiply-abused patients. This paper considers implications and ways forward for engaging in empirically supported practice as well as future development and research.

AB  - Abstract New trends in medical liability require critical analysis. The Michigan Supreme Court recently abrogated the community standard rule so far as specialists are concerned in malpractice cases. Common law required that a physician exercise that degree of reasonable diligence and skill that is ordinarily exercised by physicians engaged in the same line of practice in the particular community. Now, so far as specialists are concerned, the standard of care is that of a reasonable specialist practicing medicine in the light of present day scientific knowledge; geographical conditions or circumstances control neither the standard of the specialist's care nor the competence of an expert witness' testimony in a malpractice case. This leaves to courts and juries the privilege of deciding whether and when research and experimental work has progressed to a points that it should be adopted by the medical profession for administration to patients. It overlooks the differences which exist between private practice in the field and clinical practice under multi-personnel supervision, as well as the differences between services performed by the private practitioner and doctors engaged in research. To the extent that the doctors may be called upon to use new procedures before their sound professional judgment has determined their effects, the patients may suffer. Assault and battery imposes liability against a physician who treats a patient without his consent, notwithstanding any allegation of negligence. From this has come the doctrine of informed consent, which holds that a physician subjects himself to liability if he withholds any facts which are necessary for his patient to form the basis of an intelligent consent to the proposed treatment. There are no guidelines as to how far a physician must go in explaining the risks in order to obtain informed consent. The only prescription in this expanding area of uncertainty is the use of carefully drafted consent forms coupled with sound judgment on the part of the physician. Liability for breach of contract can be founded without the requirement of expert testimony against the physician. There is no standard of care involved, and the tryer of fact simply resolves the matter on the question of veracity between the plaintiff-patient and the defendant-physician. Although the common law has recognized that physicians could be liable for objective contracts to do certain acts, the Michigan Supreme Court has recently imposed liability against a physician on the basis of a subjective contract of cure. The Court imposed contractual liability based upon the physician's representations as to the quality of a particular result, thus expanding the physician's statements of reassurance to form a contract of cure. Since the veracity of the parties determines the resolution of this claim, it is advisable that the physician record his disclaimers of guarantees in his medical records, albeit the same has no medical significance. Practical experience indicates that juries have difficulty in believing that doctors can remember what they told a patient some years ago, and a simple notation in the records to refresh his recollection might well control the outcome.

AB  - Abstract This chapter presents some key concepts related to brain development, brain functioning, and traumatology that provide invaluable perspective when crafting juvenile justice practice, programs, and policy. It summarizes some of the key implications of this neurodevelopmental perspective. If the youth was maltreated in the context of their primary caregiving relationships, a neutral or minimally negative relational interaction can be enough to move the individual along this arousal continuum and result in maladaptive social interactions and very impulsive (often aggressive) responses. Some of the primary neural systems impacted by developmental trauma are those involved in the stress response. The majority of research in impaired cortical development and executive functioning suggests that the neuropsychological factors involved in offending behavior include compromised executive functioning (weaker cortically-mediated functions) in combination with an increase in impulsivity and other dysregulated diencephalon/brainstem mediated functions.

AB  - Abstract The effect of the fibrinolysis inhibitor tranexamic acid on early thrombus formation following microvascular trauma was investigated in the central arteries of ears in 86 rabbits (in all 172 vessels), divided into four separate blind randomised studies. In the first part a common end-to-end anastomosis was done and in the last three studies a severe trauma-arteriotomy/intimectomy was performed. Parameters studied were vessel bleeding times, patency rates, weights of intraluminal thrombotic material, haematocrit and plasma fibrinolytic activity. In the first study consisting of 14 control animals and 18 animals treated with 14 mg/kg bw of tranexamic acid, end-to-end anastomosis was performed on the central artery of one ear and on the central vein of the other ear. In the second, third, and fourth studies consisting of 18, 20, and 16 control vessels and the same number of corresponding vessels in treated animals a 7-mm longitudinal arteriotomy followed by a deep 5-mm-long intimectomy was performed. The second and third treated groups were given 14 mg/kg bw of tranexamic acid 5 min and 1 h, respectively, before reflow and the fourth group 28 mg/kg bw 5 min before reflow. The difference between the second and third studies was the addition, to mimic clinical situations, of 8.5 ml saline/kg bw 2 h before reflow in the third study. In conclusion, treatment with a single clinical dose, 14 mg/kg of tranexamic acid, did not influence vessel bleeding times or thrombus formation in the anastomotic or severe trauma models and seems safe to use. Not even a double clinical dose, 28 mg/kg, influenced thrombus formation in a statistically significant way. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MICROSURGERY 17:278?285 1996

Explosions in the understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms which lead to type 2 diabetes have recently been elucidated. In particular, the central role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the unfolding protein response (UPR) in insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has recently been discovered. We hypothesize that ER stress and UPR are not only central for type 2 diabetes but also for stress-induced diabetes. We review here the evidence that post-burn insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia have pathophysiologic mechanisms in common with type 2 diabetes. These recent discoveries not only highlight the importance of ER stress in the post-burn patient recovery, but furthermore enable new models to study fundamental and interventional aspects of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.

AB  - Summary The important role of molar teeth in the dentition mainly consists in their contribution to mastication, because they carry a considerable part of the occlusal load. This chapter reveals how the posterior position of molars makes them less accessible for cleaning, whether it may be self-performed or carried out by a dental professional. This fact, combined with the unique anatomy of molars, poses a challenge for all dentists focusing on molar retention. The evolution of more than one root sets molars apart from the rest of the dentition: in multi-rooted teeth the enamel organ expands with projections of Hertwig's root sheath. Aetiological factors interact with the anatomical factors and may lead to periodontal destruction and attachment loss in molars, and thus result in a furcation defect. It can be concluded that special care needs to be taken when placing restorations, and overhangs need to be diagnosed and removed as early as possible.

AB  - Objective? To present the technique for intra-articular catheter placement and report the clinical outcomes of 38 cases of equine synovial trauma and/or infection treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials administered via an intrasynovial catheter (ISC). Design? Retrospective study. Procedure? Medical records of 38 horses treated for synovial trauma and sepsis with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC from 1995 to 2008 were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained via clinical re-evaluation or telephone contact with the owners. Results? The majority of horses (84%) received amikacin and Timentin? four times daily. In addition, synovial lavage through the ISC was carried out in 27 horses (71%). Only radiological evidence of osteolysis had a significant negative impact on both lameness at the time of hospital discharge and the long-term outcome. In total, 92% of horses treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had clinical resolution of infection. Catheter obstruction occurred in three cases, necessitating replacement or removal, and two synovial fistulae developed at sites of open drainage. The majority of horses treated had a favourable outcome, with 86% being at least pasture sound and 43% returned to riding. Conclusion? Septic synovial structures treated with frequent antimicrobial administration through an ISC had a good prognosis for survival and 43% returned to riding, which is consistent with the results of other studies. The use of a simple ISC should be considered when broad-spectrum intrasynovial antimicrobial administration and lavage of a septic synovial structure are indicated.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of paratracheal air cysts (PACs), their correlation with different lung diseases and their connection with the trachea by chest multi detector computed tomography (MDCT). Methods We retrospectively reviewed chest MDCT images of 8240 consecutive patients obtained from January 2010 to December 2011 with a 16-detector multi-detector CT scanner. PACs were assessed for prevalence, location, level, size and the presence of visible communication with the trachea. MDCT diagnoses were classified as normal, primary or metastatic malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and other lung diseases. We randomly selected 330 patients who had no visible PACs for the control group. We evaluated the associations between patients' demographic findings (age and sex), MDCT findings of lung and the presence of PACs. The findings of the PACs and control groups were compared. Statistical analysis used chi-squared test and Mann?Whitney U-test for evaluation. Results PACs were presented in 301 patients (4%); 204 men and 97 women, ranging in age from 14 to 91 years (median?=?57 years). There was no significant difference in the presence of PACs by age (P?>?0.05). Male subjects showed higher prevalence (P?=?0.005). Fifty PACs (16.6%) showed communication with the trachea or main bronchus. Although the relation between COPD and PACs was statistically significant (P?<?0.001), there was no relation between primary or metastatic malignancies, pneumonia and other lung diseases and PACs. Conclusion PACs are common in MDCT and should not be misdiagnosed as pneumomediastinum. It should be kept in mind that PACs may be associated with COPD.

AB  - Abstract:? Sending young children to boarding school may be considered a particularly British form of child abuse and social control. The trauma of the rupture with home may be followed by other ordeals such as emotional deprivation and, in extreme cases, physical and sexual abuse. The taboo on expressing emotion, which is common in such institutions, may lead to an encapsulation of the self. Consequently, the needs of the distressed child/self remain active, but unconscious, within the adult. This maybe disguised by an armoured, and very often socially successful, persona. The psychological interplay, between these two facets of the personality, may be detrimental to intimate relationships. In clinical practice the emotional conflict between a desire for intimacy and anticipated exile comes to the fore. Three examples demonstrate how within the transference this may lead to a dependent and erotic atmosphere, which abruptly changes to sever all connection. Changes in the frame, breaks in analysis, and confessions of emotional need are all points at which vigilance is required if such disturbance in analysis is not to end in its abrupt termination.

AB  - Background Patients with traumatic bladder rupture frequently have associated pelvic fracture. With increasing numbers of pelvic fractures fixed internally, there are concerns that conservative management of bladder rupture may increase the risk of pelvic metalware infection. This study aims to determine if operative repair of bladder rupture in comparison to conservative management with catheter drainage alone is associated with a lower rate of infection of internal fixation device for concurrent pelvic fracture. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of level IV evidence. From July 2001 through June 2013, 45 multi-trauma patients at a level 1 trauma centre were identified to have sustained bladder rupture with concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation. Clinicopathological data were extracted from the TraumaNET database, medical records and health-coding database. Patients were stratified into two retrospective cohorts, management with surgical repair and management with catheter drainage alone. Fischer's exact test was used to determine whether the rate of pelvic metalware infection was different in the two cohorts. Results Of the 45 patients, 13 had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, 28 had extraperitoneal bladder rupture and four had combined intra-extraperitoneal bladder rupture. The median age for this cohort was 31. Bladder rupture was surgically repaired in 36 patients and managed conservatively with catheter drainage in nine patients. The rate of pelvic internal fixation device infection was lower in patients managed with surgical repair compared with conservative management (5.6% versus 33.3%, P = 0.047). Conclusion Operative repair of bladder rupture is associated with a lower rate of pelvic orthopaedic hardware infection in the presence of concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation.

AB  - Abstract Background: To examine whether the complex branched fibers observed in mdx mutant mice were formed in normal skeletal muscles, long-term repetitive muscle trauma was applied to muscle of normal Wistar male rats. Methods: Three kinds of artificial muscle trauma?crush injury, bupivacaine hydrochloride treatment, and forced stretching of contracting muscle (eccentric contraction)?were performed once a week for 10 weeks to achieve a state of repetitive degeneration and regeneration in the muscles. Two weeks after the final treatment, numerical, histochemical, and three-dimensional analyses by scanning electron microscopy were performed. Results: Mean numbers of total branched fibers of the three groups were increased compared with normal control values, especially in the bupivacaine treatment group (three- to fivefold greater than in the other two groups). Aggregations of fibers of the same type which usually appear in mdx mice were observed in various parts of histological sections of the bupivacaine treatment group and only in a part of the crush injury group. No aggregations were observed in sections of the forced stretching group. In the three-dimensional analysis, complex branched fibers appearing as an ?anastomosing syncytial reticulum? were observed only in the bupivacaine treatment group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the formation of an anastomosing syncytial reticulum is one of the adaptation mechanisms of normal skeletal muscle rather than a specific event in mdx mutant mice, and long-term repeated trauma of the same fiber is necessary for this formation. Adaptive changes in the muscles with the three different types of muscle trauma are discussed. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract: This article considers the development of violence with particular reference to family factors in violence such as the quality of the parent-child relationship. In taking a developmental approach to violence, a link is established between the maltreatment of children in an attachment context and the risk of violence via the child's capacity to envision mental states in the other. Evidence from epidemiology and neuroscience is brought to bear on this link. Finally, some studies of prevention of violence that are likely to enhance attachment and mentalizing are considered.
