AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the rationale behind and experiences with traditional and newly evolving concepts of fluid therapy in the traumatized patient, and to review conventional and novel fluid preparations for use in trauma resuscitation. Data sources: Human and veterinary clinical and research studies. Human data synthesis: Current treatment guidelines recommend aggressive fluid resuscitation with lactated ringers solution (LRS) or saline as optimum management of hemorrhagic shock in trauma, regardless of whether bleeding is controlled or not. The rationale behind this strategy is to restore intravascular volume as rapidly as possible to ensure adequate vital organ perfusion. Recently, this strategy has been challenged, especially in patients with uncontrolled hemorrhage, as neither laboratory evidence nor clinical trials support this practice. Current research indicates that vigorous fluid infusion may exacerbate bleeding and cause severe hemodilution, both impairing resuscitation outcome. As a result, a new line of thinking is emerging that balances the risks and benefits of intravenous volume infusion by offering the clinician alternative treatment strategies and emphasizes continuous endpoint-oriented monitoring. ?Hypotensive? or ?hypovolemic? resuscitation techniques as well as initial volume replacement with fluids other than LRS or saline (e.g., hypertonic saline [HTS], HTS with dextran 70 [HTS-D]) have been introduced in human medical practice as additional options for treatment of victims of trauma under certain circumstances. Clinical studies evaluating the use of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) in the trauma setting are underway and may soon lead to an expansion of the fluid arsenal available to the clinician for treatment of trauma patients. Veterinary data synthesis: Based on available animal data, neither strict guidelines nor a clear fluid preference for resuscitation of traumatic shock have been defined. Although systematic clinical trials are missing, combinations of crystalloid and colloid (natural or artificial) appear to be as effective for resuscitation as crystalloid alone. Judicious use of an HBOC (e.g., Oxyglobin?) as a substitute for blood/red blood cells may be recommended in situations where whole blood or pRBCs are not or not yet available. Conclusions: The search for optimal methods of fluid resuscitation in trauma is ongoing. At this point the best solution is a differentiated approach to fluid therapy, one that tailors type and volume of resuscitation solution(s) used to the type and severity of injury in an individual patient and uses monitoring of perfusion and oxygenation parameters to guide resuscitation. Crystalloid fluids are effective for resuscitation but may need to be combined with or replaced by colloidal fluids in certain clinical situations.

AB  - Summary The location of care for many brain-injured patients has changed since 2012 following the development of major trauma centres. Advances in management of ischaemic stroke have led to the urgent transfer of many more patients. The basis of care has remained largely unchanged, however, with emphasis on maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion as the key to preventing secondary injury. Organisational aspects and training for transfers are highlighted, and we have included an expanded section on paediatric transfers. We have also provided a table with suggested blood pressure parameters for the common types of brain injury but acknowledge that there is little evidence for many of our recommendations. These guidelines remain a mix of evidence-based and consensus-based statements. We have received assistance from many organisations representing clinicians who care for these patients, and we believe our views represent the best of current thinking and opinion. We encourage departments to review their own practice using our suggestions for audit and quality improvement.

AB  - Abstract The restoration of a traumatized tooth may require minimally invasive or more extensive treatment options. The majority of injuries occur in the younger population, so management should consider the long-term outcome, failure and future treatment needs over the course of, often, many decades. The aim should be to provide a tooth-restoration complex that closely mimics the functional and aesthetic qualities of an intact tooth for as long as possible. This narrative review will assess the relevant literature pertinent to restoration of traumatized teeth in order to provide guidance for the practising clinician.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To investigate the effect on survival of two operations done at various intervals before the induction of monobacterial or multibacterial peritonitis in rats. Design: Laboratory study. Setting: Teaching hospital, Belgium. Material: Inbred male white wistar R/A rats. Interventions: Posterolateral laparotomy, hindleg amputation, or control (anaesthetic only) (n = 90 animals in each group), followed by induction of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis at 1, 7 or 14 days. Further groups of rats were similarly operated on (50 in each group), but peritonitis was induced by caecal ligation and puncture. Main outcome measure: Survival 7 days after induction of peritonitis. Results: Of the rats in which E. coli was used to induce peritonitis 27/28 (96%), 29/29 (100%), and 21/30 (70%) had survived 7 days after induction of peritonitis in the group that underwent posterolateral laparotomy, compared with 18/30 (60%), 20/28 (71%), and 18/28 (64%) in the control group; p < 0.001, 0.002, and 0.78, respectively. The figures for hindleg amputation were 21/27 (78%), 23/27 (85%), and 17/30 (57%). The corresponding figures for S. aureus peritonitis were for posterolateral laparotomy 28/30 (93%), 20/30 (67%), and 24/29 (83%) compared with controls 21/30 (70%), 9/30 (30%), and 20/29 (69%); p < 0.04, 0.009, and 0.75, respectively. The figures for hindleg amputation were 21/30 (70%), 12/30 (40%), and 23/30 (77%). Similar results were obtained with peritonitis induced by caecal ligation and puncture. Conclusions: Althought surgical trauma may depress various aspects of the immune response in rats, it does not decrease their resistance to intraperitoneal microbial infections. The previous opening of the peritoneal cavity seemed to improve survival in our model. Copyright ? 1998 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - This article presents an overview of the philosophy and practical principles underlying the Linking Human Systems Approach based on the theory of resilience in individuals, families, and communities facing crisis, trauma, and disaster. The Link Approach focuses on tapping into the inherent strength of individuals and their families and emphasizes resilience rather than vulnerability. It has been successfully used in combating critical public health problems, such as addiction, HIV/AIDS, and recovery from major trauma or disaster. Also, three specific models of Link intervention aimed at the individual, family, and community levels are discussed, with special emphasis on the family-level intervention. These interventions are directed toward mobilizing resources for long-term physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual healing.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Little is known about adult dental trauma experience at the population level. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and associations of dental injuries in New Zealand (NZ) adults. Materials and Method Information about dental and orofacial trauma in a representative sample of NZ adults (aged 18-94) was collected in a national oral health survey. As well as self-reported information, the maxillary six anterior teeth were examined for signs of dental trauma. Survey weights were used. Results Of the 40.9% (95% CI: 37.6, 44.2) who reported previous orofacial trauma, 69.1% (95% CI: 64.3, 73.5), or just over one-quarter of the sample, reported that this included a dental injury. More males than females had experienced orofacial trauma (51.3% [95% CI: 45.8, 56.8] and 31.4% [95% CI: 27.9, 35.1], respectively). The most common injury was a ?chipped or broken tooth? (66.6%, 95% CI: 60.6, 72.1). Almost three-quarters had sought treatment. Clinical examination revealed an overall trauma prevalence of 23.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 26.0) with more males than females affected. Some 14.9% (95% CI: 12.8, 17.2) had one injured tooth, while 6.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 8.1) had two injured teeth. The maxillary central incisors were the most frequently affected. Most participants with clinical signs of trauma had only one of the six maxillary teeth affected. The most common clinical dental trauma observation was evidence of ?treatment? or an ?untreated enamel fracture?, and these were more common among males and those aged 35-44 years. Conclusion Traumatic dental injuries constitute an important public health issue. More emphasis on preventing them in the NZ adult population is warranted, and public awareness of State-funded cover for dental injuries may need to be bolstered to enable equitable access for injury care. Overall, a greater emphasis on prevention and the importance of initial care for dental injuries could reduce the individual and societal burden.

AB  - Abstract Among the millions of edentulous Americans, a persistent minority have not been able tolerate wearing dentures. Complicating factors may have precluded surgical intervention with grafts or dental implants to improve the physical and anatomic limitations of these unfortunate patients. A heat-cured polymer liner containing multiple small suction cups has been used for decades to successfully restore many such debilitated individuals. Two middle-aged female patients with edentulous maxillae and near fully dentate mandibles had both reached a point where they could no longer retain a maxillary complete denture, or function with it. Both had experienced multiple failed surgical attempts to improve their situations. They were both successfully restored with maxillary complete dentures containing heat-cured silicone liners with multiple small suction cups. Two young female maxillectomy patients had significant difficulties wearing maxillary obturators due to defect size and absence of defect undercuts. One had an edentulous maxilla, while the other had no axial undercuts on her few remaining maxillary teeth. Without an obturator, both suffered considerable air and fluid leaks, unintelligible speech, and swallowing problems. They too were successfully restored with obturators containing a heat-cured, multi-cup, silicone liner. The multi-cup, silicone denture liner has offered an economic, noninvasive alternative for patients unable or unwilling to undergo surgical intervention to facilitate prosthesis retention.

AB  - Abstract: The current policy climate in Britain requires that agencies work together to improve their performance and provide a better service to clients. This is especially apparent in recent initiatives designed to improve the services afforded to victims of crime. Whilst there is an established literature dealing with both the potential benefits of, and challenges posed by, multi-agency work (for example, Crawford 1997; Hughes 2007; Maguire 2004; Pearson et al. 1992; Taylor 2003), the unique issues arising from multi-agency partnerships dealing with sexual violence have received less attention, even though the interface of criminal justice and health is a relatively new and unusual phenomenon warranting scrutiny. For the current study, interviews with professionals working together to develop a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) were conducted to address this gap. Positive aspects of multi-agency work identified by the respondents included: a shared concern over the poor quality of existing arrangements; a shared vision for a better response to victims; sharing a broader view of the victim; and having experience with, and commitment to, multi-agency work. Continuing challenges were noted as: sustained multi-agency participation; diverse agency cultures; competing agendas and priorities across agencies and systems; funding and staffing issues; and future responsibility for, and ownership of, the SARC. Implications of the research are discussed.

Members of a women psychologists? organization and a group of sexual violence counselors completed questionnaires regarding the extent of their work with survivors and their psychological functioning. Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported more disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the goodness of other people), more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and more self-reported vicarious trauma. Symptomatology was not related to counselors? own history of victimization. Qualitative data regarding difficult and enjoyable aspects of working with survivors also were gathered, along with data on the strategies used by counselors to cope with work-related stress. implications for counselor training are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Exposure to stressful environments in early childhood can cause a toxic stress response and lead to poor health outcomes, including obesity, cardiac disease, diabetes, and mental illness. In animals and maltreated children, the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against the physiological disruptions associated with a toxic stress response; however, the specific caregiver and parenting characteristics that best promote a protective relationship in humans remain largely unexplored, particularly in families living in high-risk environments. In this study, framed in an ecobiodevelopmental (EBD) model, a cross-sectional design is being used to study 54 multi-ethnic, urban maternal-child dyads with children at early school age (4?9 years). Mothers? past experiences, mental health, and caregiving patterns and children's hair cortisol, C-reactive protein, pro-inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, BMI, behavior, and school performance are being analyzed to identify maternal characteristics that may protect against children's toxic stress response in families at high risk for exposure to stressors such as poverty, trauma, or exposure to violence.

AB  - The clinical trial of a multi-channel cochlear prosthesis has been carried out on 10 profoundly-totally deaf adult patients. Speech perception tests have shown that all the patients received significant benefit from the device. They obtained improvements in understanding running speech from 47% to 550% when using the device in conjunction with lipreading compared to lipreading alone. With an open-set CID sentence test, three patients obtained scores showing an ability to understand speech without the need to lipread, and a further three patients had scores indicating they could also receive useful information without lipreading. In two patients, very limited open-set scores for electrical stimulation alone were obtained. This was most probably due to the fact that only a few channels of stimulation were possible due to cochlear disease, and they were therefore receiving information more like a single-channel device. The prosthesis has also been found to provide considerable help in hearing and recognizing everyday sounds.

AB  - Abstract Pain is one of the main complaints of trauma patients in (pre-hospital) emergency medicine. Significant deficiencies in pain management in emergency medicine have been identified. No evidence-based protocols or guidelines have been developed so far, addressing effectiveness and safety issues, taking the specific circumstances of pain management of trauma patients in the chain of emergency care into account. The aim of this systematic review was to identify effective and safe initial pharmacological pain interventions, available in the Netherlands, for trauma patients with acute pain in the chain of emergency care. Up to December 2011, a systematic search strategy was performed with MeSH terms and free text words, using the bibliographic databases CINAHL, PubMed and Embase. Methodological quality of the articles was assessed using standardized evaluation forms. Of a total of 2328 studies, 25 relevant studies were identified. Paracetamol (both orally and intravenously) and intravenous opioids (morphine and fentanyl) proved to be effective. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) showed mixed results and are not recommended for use in pre-hospital ambulance or (helicopter) emergency medical services [(H)EMS]. These results could be used for the development of recommendations on evidence-based pharmacological pain management and an algorithm to support the provision of adequate (pre-hospital) pain management. Future studies should address analgesic effectiveness and safety of various drugs in (pre-hospital) emergency care. Furthermore, potential innovative routes of administration (e.g., intranasal opioids in adults) need further exploration.

AB  - Asymptomatic tumors are not uncommon, may be diagnosed during clinical examination or during surgical interventions for other purposes such as treatment of a hemorrhage due a blunt trauma. Case report? 6 year-old boy had fallen, hitting his abdomen against a rock, and arrived at hospital ten hours later. Initial assessment he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain; his physical examination showed: respiratory rate: 16?mov/min, blood pressure: 100???80?mmHg, heart rate: 100?bat/min, and Glasgow coma score: 15. His abdomen was distended, with guarding and rebound tenderness, and had a palpable mass. FAST ultrasound was positive; and Ct-scan showed an abdominal mass with 15???12???7?cm dimension, and moderate amount of free blood in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9?mg/dl, hematocritic 28.8%, white blood cells 6.900?cel/dl. Midline laparotomy was performed, a large, injured and bleeding mesenteric mass was found encircling superior mesentery artery and several small bowel loops; 500?ml of free blood was found in the peritoneal cavity. Mesenteric mass was partially removed with a segment of the small bowel. Findings of anatomico-pathologic examination revealed an intestinal Burkitt lymphoma, with mesenteric linfonodes. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and started with quimotherapy. Comments? This case report shows an unusual traumatic abdominal blending that could not be clearly diagnosed before laparotomy was performed. The emergency of this case was bleeding control, decision to remove mass was taken only for this purpose, and not to treat the tumor. As removal of the whole mass was impossible, a partial removal was performed.
