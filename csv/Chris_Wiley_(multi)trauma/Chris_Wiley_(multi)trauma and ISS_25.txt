AB  - The clinical trial of a multi-channel cochlear prosthesis has been carried out on 10 profoundly-totally deaf adult patients. Speech perception tests have shown that all the patients received significant benefit from the device. They obtained improvements in understanding running speech from 47% to 550% when using the device in conjunction with lipreading compared to lipreading alone. With an open-set CID sentence test, three patients obtained scores showing an ability to understand speech without the need to lipread, and a further three patients had scores indicating they could also receive useful information without lipreading. In two patients, very limited open-set scores for electrical stimulation alone were obtained. This was most probably due to the fact that only a few channels of stimulation were possible due to cochlear disease, and they were therefore receiving information more like a single-channel device. The prosthesis has also been found to provide considerable help in hearing and recognizing everyday sounds.

AB  - Purpose To visualize healthy and abnormal articular cartilage, we investigated the potential of using the 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) signal's magnitude and frequency and maps of relaxation. Materials and Methods After optimizing imaging parameters in five healthy volunteers, 3D multi-echo GRE magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired at 3T in four patients with chondral damage prior to their arthroscopic surgery. Average magnitude and frequency information was extracted from the GRE images, and maps were generated. Cartilage abnormalities were confirmed after arthroscopy and were graded using the Outerbridge classification scheme. Regions of interest were identified on average magnitude GRE images and compared to arthroscopy. Results All four patients presented with regions of Outerbridge Grade I and II cartilage damage on arthroscopy. One patient had Grade III changes. Grade I, II, and III changes were detectable on average magnitude and maps, while Grade II and higher changes were also observable on MR frequency maps. For average magnitude images of healthy volunteers, the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnitude image averaged over three echoes was 4.26?±?0.32, 12.26?±?1.09, 14.31?±?1.93, and 13.36?±?1.13 in bone, femoral, tibial, and patellar cartilage, respectively. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using different imaging contrasts from the 3D multi-echo GRE scan to visualize abnormalities of the articular cartilage. ? 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Level of Evidence: 1 J.

AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with severe abdominal trauma injuries can have improved outcomes if a priority-oriented approach is taken to surgical intervention. This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in young individuals worldwide. However, the understanding of TBI at secondary phase remained obscure, and more knowledge of the pathophysiology of TBI is necessary. In this study, we examined the influence of bone fracture (BF) on TBI and investigated whether blocking high mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein, an inflammatory mediator, could be effective to alleviate TBI. We found neurological severity was significantly increased by BF at 4 days post-TBI with longer removal time of adhesive tape and higher percentage of left turn in the corner test compared to TBI treatment alone. Additionally, higher brain lesion volume and severer brain oedema in TBI + BF mice supports the negative effect of BF on TBI. HMGB1 level was significantly stimulated by BF, suggesting the important role of HMGB1 in the development of secondary TBI. Notably, ablation of HMGB1 significantly reduced this negative influence of BF on TBI. These results suggest that HMGB1 can be massively induced by the systemic immune activation triggered by BF, which in turn aggravates inflammation. Blocking HMGB1 reduced the inflammatory effect of BF and therefore helps lessen the severity of secondary TBI. In conclusion, these results provided the evidence that anti-HMGB1 may be an effective and feasible method to alleviate TBI.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of anterior and posterior instrumentation with different debridement and graft fusion methods for multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 81 patients with multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis who underwent anterior or posterior instrumentation combined with different methods of debridement, decompression, and graft fusion from January 2002 to December 2012. All patients were divided into an anterior instrumentation group and a posterior instrumentation group. In the anterior instrumentation group, there were 39 patients who underwent transthoracic debridement. In the posterior instrumentation group, there were 34 patients who underwent trans-costotransverse decompression and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation, and another 8 patients underwent combined anterior debridement and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation in a single-stage or two-stage procedure. The kyphotic angles were calculated from lateral spinal X-rays using the modified Konstam method. The symptoms and signs of tuberculosis, fusion level, fusion time of the bone graft, average kyphosis angle, average correction, average loss of correction, and clinical complications were recorded. The average follow-up period was 37?months (range, 17?72?months). Results The cohort consisted of 47 males and 34 females with an average age of 38?years. The mean durations of the operations were 3.5 ± 0.4?h in the anterior group and 4.0 ± 0.3?h in the posterior group ( P < 0.05). The mean blood loss volumes during surgery were 450 ± 42 and 560 ± 51?mL for the anterior group and the posterior group, respectively ( P < 0.01). The kyphotic deformities were corrected from 32.1° ± 10.3° to 10.2° ± 2.1° in the anterior group and from 33.8° ± 11.7° to 12.6° ± 2.7° in the posterior group ( P < 0.01). The neurologic statuses of the 23 patients with preoperative neurologic deficits improved in each group. Fusion was confirmed radiographically at 5.4 ± 1.2?months (range, 4?12?months) in the anterior group and 5.6 ± 1.4?months (range, 4?13?months) in the posterior group ( P > 0.05). Postoperative relapses were noted in 1 and 3 patients in the anterior and the posterior group, respectively. Conclusion Posterior instrumentation was more effective than anterior instrumentation in the correction of kyphosis and the maintenance of the correction. However, postoperative sinus formation was more frequent in patients who underwent a single-stage posterior procedure.

AB  - Summary: A multi-institutional study on the prognosis of patients with epilepsy was performed in Japan from 1975 to 1977, including 20 institutions. The outcome of epileptic seizures and social adjustment 10, 5, and 3 years after the onset of the illness was studied in three different groups of epileptic patients, respectively. The number of successfully followed-up cases was 1,868 in total, follow-up rate being 42%. The data were analyzed statistically by use of analysis of variance. The rate of remission of seizures in all was 58.3% and the rate of normal social adjustment 62.6%. The remission rate showed no significant difference among the 10-, 5-, and 3-year outcome groups. The study on the outcome of seizure control indicated that the prognosis of seizure control is more favorable (a) in idiopathic than in residual or symptomatic epileptics; (b) in patients with onset before 10 years of age than in those with onset after 10 years; (c) in patients with less frequent seizures; (d) in sleep epilepsy than in waking and diffuse epilepsies; (e) in patients who started treatment within 1 year of onset of seizure; (f) in patients with single-type partial seizures than in those with partial seizures combined with tonic-clonic seizures; (g) in patients without high grade EEG background abnormality; and (h) in patients without neurological symptoms, intellectual deficits, personality disturbances, or psychotic symptoms. Factors that determine the prognosis of social adjustment were almost similar to those for remission of seizures. There was a close correlation between the outcome of seizure control and that of social adjustment. Correlation coefficient between follow-up rate and remission rate in 15 of the 20 collaborated institutions was 0.55 (p < 0.05), showing a tendency that the remission rate becomes higher as the follow-up rate is raised. RÉSUMÉ Une étude collaborative multi-institutionnelle sur le pronostic des épilepsies a été effectuée au Japon de 1975 à 1977 dans 20 institutions différentes. Le devenir des crises et l'adaptation sociale ont été appréciés chez 3 groupes différents de patients 10 ans, 5 ans et 3 ans après le debut de la maladie. Le nombre des cas dont l'évolution a pu être suivie de façon satisfaisante est de 1868, ce qui répond à une proportion de 42%. Les données ont ete analysees statistiquement par analyse de variance. Le taux de rémission des crises a été au total de 58,3% et le taux d'adaptation sociale normale de 62,6%. Il n'a pas été noté de différence significative du taux de rémission entre les 3 groupes. En ce qui concerne le pronostic des crises, il s'est avéré meilleur: 1o chez les sujets qui présentent une épilepsie idiopathique (et non symptomatique); 2o chez ceux dont les crises sont apparues avant l'âge de 10 ans; 3o chez ceux dont le crises sont rares; 4o chez ceux dont les crises surviennent pendant le sommeil; 5o chez ceux qui ont débuté le traitement dans l'année qui a suivi le début des crises; 6o chez ceux qui présentent un seul type de crises partielles par rapport à ceux dont les crises partielles sont combinees à des crises tonicocloniques; 7o chez ceux dont les rythmes de fond EEG ne sont pas très anormaux; 8o chez ceux qui ne présentent pas de troubles neurologiques, de déficit intellectuel, de troubles de la personnalité ou de symptomes psychotiques. Les facteurs qui déterminent le pronostic de l'adaptation sociale sont à peu près les mêmes que ceux qui concernent la rémission des crises. Il y a d'ailleurs une étroite corrélation entre ces deux pronostics. Le coefficient de corrélation entre le taux de rémission et la durée de l'observation des sujets dans 15 des 20 institutions collaboratives est de 0,55 (p < 0,05) et exprime la tendance pour le taux de rémission d'être d'autant plus grand que la durée d'observation est prolongée. RESUMEN Entre los an?os 1975 y 1977 se realizó en Japón un estudio multi-institucional (abarcando 20 Centros) con objeto de establecer el pronóstico de pacientes con epilepsia. Se estudiaron le evolución de las crisis comiciales y la integración social en 3 grupos diferentes de pacientes epilepticos 10 años, 5 an?os y 3 an?os después del comienzo de la enfermedad. El número de casos seguidos con éxito fue 1.868 en total, siendo la tasa de seguimiento del 42%. Se analizaron estadísticamente los datos por medio del análisis de la varianza. La tasa de remisión de las crisis fue en total del 58,3% y la tasa de ajuste social del 62,6%. La tasa de remisión no mostró diferencias significativas en los grupos evolutivos de 10, 5 y 3 años. El estudio pronóstico reveló que el control de los ataques era más favorable en la epilepsyía idiopática que en la residual o sintomática; en pacientes con un comienzo de las crisis antes de los 10 años de edad que después; en pacientes con crisis menos frecuentes; en epilepsyía relacionada con el sueño que la que tenia lugar durante la vigilia o era difusa; en pacientes que empezaron tratamiento antes del año del inicio de los ataques; en enfermos con un único tipo de crisis parciales que en aquéllos que presentaban crisis parciales y tónico-clonicas; en pacientes sin anomalías groseras de la actividad de fondo en el EEG y en enfermos sin síntomas neurológicos, déficit intelectual, alteraciones de la personalidad o síntomas psicóticos. Los factores que determinaron el pronóstico en lo que respecta a ajuste social eran casi similares a los relacionados con la remisión de los ataques. Hubo una estrecha correlación entre el pronóstico del control de las crisis y el grado de ajuste social. El coeficiente de correlación entre la tasa de revisiones y la tasa de remisiones en 15 de los 20 Centros fue 0,55 (p< 0,05), mostrando una tendencia a que las remisiones fuesen mayores a medida que la tasa de re-evaluaciones aumenta. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Eine kollaborative Studie über die Prognose von Patienten mit Epilepsie wurde in Japan an 20 Institutionen von 1975 bis 1977 durchgeführt. Der Verlauf epileptischer Anfälle und die soziale Anpassung wurden 10 Jahre, 5 Jahre und 3 Jahre nach Beginn der Erkrankung in 3 verschiedenen Gruppen epileptischer Patienten untersucht. Insgesamt wurden 1868 Patienten erfolgreich verfolgt, das sind 42%. Die Daten wurden mit Hilfe der Varianz-analyse statistisch bearbeitet. Die Heilungsquote für alle Anfälle betrug 58,3%, die Rate der normalen sozialen Anpassung 62,6%. Die Heilungsquote zeigte keine deutlichen Unterschiede zwischen den Zehnjahres-, Fünfjahres- und Dreijahresergebnissen. Die Aufschlüsselung ergab, daß die Prognose hinsichtlich Anfallsfreiheit günstiger bei der idiopathischen als bei der residualen Oder symptomatischen Epilepsie ist; günstiger schneiden Patienten mit Anfallsbeginn vor dem Alter von 10 Jahren ab, Patienten mit seltenen Anfällen, Patienten mit Schlaf-Epilepsie verglichen mit Wachoder diffuser Epilepsie, Patienten, bei denen die Behandlung innerhalb eines Jahres nach erstem Anfall eingeleitet wurde, Patienten mit isolierten Herdanfällen als solche mit Partialanfällen kombiniert mit tonisch-klonischen Krämpfen, Patienten ohne hochgradige Hintergrundsveranderungen im EEG, Patienten ohne neurologische Symptome, intellektuelle Defekte, Verhaltungsstorungen oder psychotische Symptome. Die Faktoren, die die Prognose hinsichtlich der sozialen Eingliederung bestimmen, waren ähnlich denen, die eine Anfallsfreiheit entschieden. Der Korrelationskoeffizient zwischen der Verlaufsrate und der Anfallsfreiheit betrug bei 15 der 20 kolla-borierenden Institutionen 0,55 (p < 0,05). Er zeigt somit die Tendenz, daß die Anfallsfreiheit höher wird in dem Maße, in dem die Häufigkeit der Kontroll-untersuchungen zunimmt.

AB  - Background: We investigated the incidence and severity of post-injury morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)-treated trauma patients. We also identified risk factors in the early phase after injury that predicted the later development of complications. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study design was used. One hundred and sixty-four adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24?h were included during a 21-month period. The incidence and severity of morbidity such as multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), severe sepsis and 30-day post-injury mortality were calculated and risk factors were analyzed with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The median age was 40 years, the injury severity score was 24, the new injury severity score was 29, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 15, sequential organ failure assessment maximum was 7 and ICU length of stay was 3.1 days. The incidences of post-injury MOF were 40.2%, ALI 25.6%, severe sepsis 31.1% and 30-day mortality 10.4%. The independent risk factors differed to some extent between the outcome parameters. Age, severity of injury, significant head injury and massive transfusion were independent risk factors for several outcome parameters. Positive blood alcohol was only a predictor of MOF, whereas prolonged rescue time only predicted death. Unexpectedly, injury severity was not an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions: Although the incidence of morbidity was considerable, mortality was relatively low. Early post-injury risk factors that predicted later development of complications differed between morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Background Flexion?extension radiography (FER) has been utilised for the detection of ligamentous injury in patients who have been cleared of bony injury. Some studies call into question the diagnostic accuracy of FER, the high proportion of inadequate FER images and the adverse effects of prolonged cervical collar immobilisation although awaiting FER. Methods We conducted a two-part retrospective study of trauma patients presenting to a trauma centre between January 2007 and December 2014. A cross-sectional analytic study was used to determine diagnostic accuracy and a case?control design was used to compare characteristics and complications of those having FER with similar patients not having FER. Inclusion criteria were age ≥16, blunt trauma mechanism, a normal computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine and FER to assess for ligamentous injury. The reference standard was magnetic resonance imaging evidence of ligamentous disruption or a therapeutic intervention to treat ligamentous instability. Results There were 176 participants meeting inclusion criteria. Studies were considered inadequate in 168 participants (95.5%). There were zero true positives, four false positives, 168 true negatives and four false negatives: sensitivity 0% (0.0?60.2%), specificity 97.7 (94.2?99.4%), positive predictive value 0% (0.0?60.2%) and negative predictive value 97.7 (94.2?99.4%). Participants having FER remained in cervical collars and in hospital longer than control patients. Complications of cervical collar use were uncommon. Conclusion FER does not contribute additional diagnostic accuracy for the detection of ligamentous injury to the cervical spine following a normal CT of the cervical spine. We recommend FER be removed from cervical spine clearance protocols.

AB  - Abstract Periodontal health states are difficult to quantify and no formal scale quantifying patients' utilities for periodontal health states exits. Multi-attribute utility (MAD) techniques were used to develop such a scale. The MAU scale maybe used to quantify patients' assessment of their current periodontal health and that of possible treatment outcomes. Such data, combined with probability values in formal decision analysis techniques would result in improved rationality of treatment planning for periodontal disease. 20 patients attending for routine undergraduate care were interviewed. Data from these interviews were sorted into groups of common interest (domains). Intra-domain health statements were complied from the interview content. 21 patients ranked the intra-domain statements on a scale of 0?100. This same group of patients also performed an inter-domain weighting. Mean results showed that patients were 2? as concerned with how they felt and with the prognosis of possible outcomes, than with how they looked and what facts they knew about their oral health. However, the real value of utilities research lies in application of individual results to treatment planning, as there is a wide range of opinion regarding outcome health states.

AB  - The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF) is widely used to measure childhood abuse of all types. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the instrument. The participants constituted four subsamples (n = 517): substance abusers (n = 126), psychiatric patients (n = 210), prisoners (n = 109) and adolescents in out-of-home placements (n = 72). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a reasonable fit of the data to the original five-factor structure of the CTQ-SF. Measurement invariance was found across gender and the four subsamples. It was concluded that the Norwegian version of the CTQ-SF has acceptable psychometric properties, with good reliability and satisfactory accuracy, to assess different dimensions of childhood trauma.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Strychnos nux-vomica L. (Loganiaceae), widely used in folk medicine, is grown extensively in southern Asian countries. Its major bioactive constituents are strychnine and brucine, which are frequently used in traditional herbal medicines for treatment of nervous diseases, vomiting and traumatic pain. Objective A new method using a carbon-paste electrode modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT/CPE) was developed and validated for single or simultaneous determination of strychnine and brucine in Strychnos nux-vomica seeds. Additionally, an environmentally friendly method was successfully applied to reduce the levels of strychnine and brucine in seeds. Materials and methods Cyclic voltammetry, chronocoulometry and differential pulse voltammetry were used with multi-walled carbon nanotube modified carbon-paste electrodes. Results The peak currents increase linearly with the strychnine and brucine concentrations in the ranges of 50?1000 and 5?355?µ m, and the detection limits for strychnine and brucine were 0.43 and 0.28?µ m, respectively. Of the processing methods used, the greatest reduction in the strychnine and brucine levels was observed in samples processed using milk and saltwater. Conclusion A new, sensitive and selective method was developed for the measurement of strychnine and brucine. This method was successfully applied to the determination of strychnine and brucine in unprocessed and processed Strychnos nux-vomica seed. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Communities with major recreational attractions tend to be rural and to have high injury experience both because of environmental hazards unique to rural areas and because they attract urban visitors who may be unfamiliar with the area andits roads, engaging in activities for which they are poorly prepared, and using equipment that is rented, in poor condition, or even of inherently hazardous design or construction. Alcohol abuse by visitors is often aproblem. Once injured, visitors may have difficulty gaining access to emergency care andwhen received, such care may be limited in both quantity and quality. While the influx of visitors to rural areas brings jobs and income, it also may bring crowding, violence, unintentional injury and other stresses. Most rural recreational communities do not actively plan as a community to deal with these problems, but rather approach them piecemeal and with limited communication among all necessary participants. Such planning is essential if progress is to be made.

AB  - It is well established that connection and support are associated with supporting recovery from eating disorders whereas isolation and feeling misunderstood can be barriers to change. While the consumer and recovery movements have long advocated for treatments that go beyond symptom reduction alone to include factors such as connection with others, there are few treatments that are designed to target these directly for young people with eating disorders and their families. In 2014 the Sydney Children's Hospital Network Eating Disorder Service at The Children's Hospital at Westmead introduced multi-family therapy (MFT), the first program of its kind in Australia, with a primary aim being to increase solidarity and support for families in addition to helping promote eating disorder recovery more broadly. Rooted in the principles of family therapy for anorexia nervosa, MFT generally brings together six to eight families for a four-consecutive day workshop followed by six single follow-up workshops over the course of six months. This paper reviews the current literature available on MFT, describes its introduction at a specialist tertiary eating disorder service in Australia, explores preliminary feedback from families, and discusses the importance of creating solidarity for families affected by eating disorders.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for almost a decade for hemophilic patients with inhibitors. Its off-label use as a hemostatic agent in massive bleeding caused by a wide array of clinical scenarios is rapidly expanding. While evidence-based guidelines exist for rFVIIa treatment in hemophilia, none are available for its off-label use. Objectives:?The aim of this study is to develop expert recommendations for the use of rFVIIa in patients suffering from uncontrolled bleeding (with special emphasis on trauma) until randomized, controlled trials allow for the introduction of more established evidence-based guidelines. Methods:?A multidisciplinary task force comprising representatives of the relevant National Medical Associations, experts from the Medical Corps of the Army, Ministry of Health and the Israel National Trauma Advisory Board was established in Israel. Recommendations were construed based on the analysis of the first 36 multi-trauma patients accumulated in the prospective national registry of the use of rFVIIa in trauma, and an extensive literature search consisting of published and prepublished controlled animal trials, case reports and series. The final consensus guidelines, together with the data of the first 36 trauma patients treated in Israel, are presented in this article. Results:?Results of the first 36 trauma patients: The prolonged clotting assays [prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)] shortened significantly within minutes following administration of rFVIIa. Cessation of bleeding was achieved in 26 of 36 (72%) patients. Acidosis diminished the hemostatic effect of the drug, while hypothermia did not affect it. The survival rate of 61% (22/36) seems to be favorable compared with published series of similar, or less severe, trauma patients (range 30%?57%). Conclusions:?As a result of the lack of controlled trials, our guidelines should be considered as suggestive rather than conclusive. However, they provide a valuable tool for physicians using rFVIIa for the expanding off-label clinical uses.

AB  - The 2010 earthquakes in Haiti initiated crises for one of the world's poorest nations. This transpired amidst pervasive, pre-disaster hardships, with the resulting situation described as ?acute on chronic? trauma exposure. The current paper provides a description of a dynamic model focused on three factors of consideration for similar crises: cultural context, unfolding traumatic events and developmental processes. Knowledge from developmental psychology can inform humanitarian aid efforts to effectively address the unique needs of children. Recommendations are offered for research, clinical work and policy related to the mental health needs of children where ?acute on chronic? conditions exist.

AB  - Objective To assess the association between parental post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and offspring PTSD and its specificity for other disorders in a non-clinical epidemiological cohort of Australian Vietnam veterans, their partners and their sons and daughters. Method Veterans were interviewed twice, in 1992?1994 and 2005?2006; partners were interviewed in 2006?2007, and their offspring in 2012?2014. A total of 125 sons and 168 daughters were interviewed from 197 families, 137 of which also included partners who were the mothers of the children. Statistical analysis used multi-level modelling to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals while controlling for clustering effects within families. Parent PTSD diagnoses were examined for associations with offspring trauma exposure, PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses. Results Veteran PTSD increased the risk of PTSD and no other disorder in both sons and daughters; partner PTSD did not. Veteran depression was also a risk factor for sons? PTSD, and alcohol disorder was linked to alcohol dependence in sons and PTSD in daughters, but not when controlling for veteran PTSD. Conclusion We conclude that PTSD in a Vietnam veteran father increases the risk specifically for PTSD in his sons and daughters.

AB  - Background To evaluate whether the symptoms of children and adolescents with clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) form classes consistent with the diagnostic criteria of complex PTSD (CPTSD) as proposed for the ICD-11, and to relate the emerging classes with treatment outcome of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). Methods Latent classes analysis (LCA) was used to explore the symptom profiles of the clinical baseline assessment of N = 155 children and adolescents participating in a randomized controlled trial of TF-CBT. The treatment outcomes of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and of patients with CPTSD were compared by a t-test for depended samples and a repeated-measures ANOVA. Results The LCA revealed two distinct classes: a PTSD class characterized by elevated core symptoms of PTSD (n = 62) and low symptoms of disturbances in self-organization versus a complex PTSD class with elevated PTSD core symptoms and elevated symptoms of disturbances in self-organization (n = 93). The Group ? Time interaction regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms was not significant. Pre?post effect sizes regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms were large for both groups (PTSD: d = 2.81; CPTSD: d = 1.37). For disturbances in self-organization in the CPTSD class, we found medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.40?1.16) after treatment with TF-CBT. Conclusions The results provide empirical evidence of the ICD-11 CPTSD and PTSD distinction in a clinical sample of children and adolescents. In terms of relative improvement from their respective baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms, patients with PTSD and CPTSD responded equally to TF-CBT; however, those with CPTSD ended treatment with clinically and statistically greater symptoms than those with PTSD.
