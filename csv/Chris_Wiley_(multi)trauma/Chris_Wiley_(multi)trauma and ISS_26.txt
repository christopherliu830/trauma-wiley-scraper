AB  - Background To evaluate whether the symptoms of children and adolescents with clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) form classes consistent with the diagnostic criteria of complex PTSD (CPTSD) as proposed for the ICD-11, and to relate the emerging classes with treatment outcome of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). Methods Latent classes analysis (LCA) was used to explore the symptom profiles of the clinical baseline assessment of N = 155 children and adolescents participating in a randomized controlled trial of TF-CBT. The treatment outcomes of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and of patients with CPTSD were compared by a t-test for depended samples and a repeated-measures ANOVA. Results The LCA revealed two distinct classes: a PTSD class characterized by elevated core symptoms of PTSD (n = 62) and low symptoms of disturbances in self-organization versus a complex PTSD class with elevated PTSD core symptoms and elevated symptoms of disturbances in self-organization (n = 93). The Group ? Time interaction regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms was not significant. Pre?post effect sizes regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms were large for both groups (PTSD: d = 2.81; CPTSD: d = 1.37). For disturbances in self-organization in the CPTSD class, we found medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.40?1.16) after treatment with TF-CBT. Conclusions The results provide empirical evidence of the ICD-11 CPTSD and PTSD distinction in a clinical sample of children and adolescents. In terms of relative improvement from their respective baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms, patients with PTSD and CPTSD responded equally to TF-CBT; however, those with CPTSD ended treatment with clinically and statistically greater symptoms than those with PTSD.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a tentative understanding of the characteristics of the extreme traumas, elsewhere called ?complex PTSD?, that some refugees and asylum-seekers bring into therapy. It suggests that these kinds of traumas suffered during adulthood may involve a disintegration of the self and a loss of ?psychic skin?. This conceptualization is derived from the treatment of a refugee who survived multiple extreme traumas and with whom efforts were made in therapy to identify a complex methodology making use of supplementary therapeutic tools in addition to individual psychotherapy. The case demonstrates how the disintegration of self implies not only a deep somato-psychic dissociation, but also a loss of intrapsychic and interpersonal space. In the treatment this was worked through via repetition of the victim-aggressor dynamics at multiple levels. In the end, the therapeutic context was structured like a set of concentric layers, creating a ?bandage? over the patient's wounds whilst his ?psychic skin? was able to regenerate. The conditions triggered by extreme traumas in refugees challenge some of the cornerstones of individual psychoanalytic technique, as well as the idea that individual therapy may be thought of as existing in an environmental vacuum.

AB  - Summary Multi-lumen extensions used to infuse multiple fluids via a single intravenous cannula might increase resistance and so limit the flow that can be achieved. We constructed low-pressure and high-pressure models and compared the effect of two different multi-lumen extensions on flow rate. Both multi-lumen extensions reduced flows by up to 76% (p < 0.001). The effect was greatest with large cannulae and in the high-pressure model, with the longer and narrower extension most impeding flow. Multi-lumen extensions can therefore significantly impede fluid flow, and should be avoided or removed when rapid infusion is required. These effects are less important in paediatric anaesthesia where smaller cannulae are used. Manufacturers should include internal diameter or flow effects on the packaging of these extensions to assist clinicians in making such decisions.

AB  - Abstract A low-cost 3D printed model has been introduced into the oral and maxillofacial surgery teaching program of undergraduate students to improve education and mechanical comprehension of craniofacial trauma. Steps of the 3D printed haptic model building process are listed. 3D printed models of facial fractures were obtained from Data Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data. Computed Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) freeware was used to create new fractures on the standard tessellation language (STL) file. 3D printed haptic model appears to be an efficient low-cost support for craniofacial trauma education of undergraduate students.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the ventricular rate response of rate-adaptive (VVIR) pacemakers in dogs using a multi-stage exercise test. Methods: The rate-responsiveness of VVIR pacemakers was assessed in seven dogs with complete atrioventricular (AV) block and implanted with various models of pulse generators (six motion sensors and one automatic dual-sensor rate-response pacemaker). Response activity was assessed with a multi-stage exercise test on a treadmill. Atrial and ventricular rate were analysed retrospectively at the end of the test and the AV ratio was calculated after each minute of exercise. Results: During exercise, the mean (sd) AV ratio recorded in all paced dogs was 1.7 (0.5) (expected physiological ratio 1.0), although a variety of individual performances was observed. A poor response (AV ratio 2.8 [0.2]) was obtained with the automatic dual-sensor pacemaker, suggesting that this type of rate-responsive device may not be indicated for implantation in dogs with complete AV block. The overall AV ratio for the six dogs implanted with motion sensors was 1.4 (0.2), showing a better performance of these pacemakers during exercise. Clinical Significance: This multi-stage exercise test represents an easy and repeatable method for assessing the accuracy of rate-responsive sensors and offers valuable information for the correct setting of VVIR pacemakers in dogs.

The patient developed fever and crusted, nodulo-ulcerative lesions of the skin after accidental superficial trauma to the forehead. The biopsy revealed suppurative granulomatous inflammation with intracellular and extracellular yeast-like cells with associated clear halo measuring 3?4 ?m in size. Systemic involvement was not found. The lesions cleared after treatment with itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. The medication was continued for a total period of 3 months, with no signs of recurrence after one-year of follow-up.

AB  - In recent years, local activists in the Global North and South have been organizing to improve degraded and abandoned spaces in marginalized neighborhoods by creating parks, playgrounds, urban farms, or community gardens. This paper integrates existing knowledge on urban place attachment and sense of community with scholarship on environmental justice in order to understand the role of place attachment in environmental mobilization in distressed neighborhoods across political systems and urbanization contexts. It examines the different forms of connections that activists develop and express toward neighborhoods with long-time substandard environmental conditions and how their experience of the neighborhood shapes their engagement in environmental revitalization projects. This comparison of three neighborhoods in Barcelona, Boston, and Havana shows that activists in all three places intend for their environmental endeavors to express grief at the loss of community, fears of erasure, and emotional connection and feelings of responsibility to place. To address environmental trauma, they aim to construct nurturing, soothing, ?safe havens,? recreate rootedness, and remake place for residents.

Are multi family groups appropriate for patients with first episode psychosis? A 5-year naturalistic follow-up study. Objective:? To compare outcome over 5?years for patients who participated in multi family groups (MFGs) to those who refused or were not offered participation. Method:? Of 301 first episode psychotic patients aged 15?65?years, 147 participated in MFGs. Outcome was measured by drop-out rates, positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) symptom scores, and duration of psychotic episodes during the follow-up period. Results:? Multi family group participants had a significantly lower drop-out rates at 5-year follow-up than patients who did not participate. However, the MFG participants had significantly less improvement in PANSS positive and excitative symptoms and had significantly longer duration of psychotic symptoms during the follow-up period. Conclusion:? Multi family groups appear to increase the chance of retaining patients in a follow-up study, but adjustment of the programme may be necessary with first episode psychosis patients to meet their needs better.

AB  - The sequelae of child maltreatment tend to extend current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are more severe after single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe after child maltreatment than after single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more prevalent after single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more prevalent after child maltreatment. The Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) assessed PTSD and trauma-related symptoms in 256 children (83 children exposed to single trauma, 173 to child maltreatment). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed trauma-unrelated symptoms. Single-trauma children reported significantly more severe PTSD and trauma-related symptoms. Significantly more severe trauma unrelated symptoms were reported after child maltreatment. A significant relation was found between clinical PTSD and more severe trauma-related symptoms in both samples. Likelihood of children meeting PTSD symptoms after trauma seems to decrease when traumatization becomes more complex. Findings support our assumption that symptomatology of maltreated children extends current PTSD symptoms.

AB  - ABSTRACT Survival and causes of death of 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) were examined. The patients were originally found in a community-based epidemiological survey of dementia, and all patients with AD or MID alive on the prevalence day were included. The 6-years survival rate for AD was 21.1% vs. the expected rate 48.5%, that for MID 11.9% vs. 45.2% expected. A comparison of relative survival rates suggested that MID carries a less favorable survival prognosis than AD. The mean durations were: AD 5.7 years and MID 5.2 years; median duration being 5 years in both diseases. The excess mortality in both AD and MID was independent of age. In AD, the survival rate decreased with increasing severity of dementia, while in MID the mortality was the same regardless of the severity of the dementia. The dementia disorder was the underlying cause of death in 68% of AD patients, and in 38% of MID patients, bronchopneumonia being the most frequent immediate cause of death in both groups. As a cause of death, acute cerebrovascular accidents occurred more often in MID patients than in the general population of comparable age. Malignant diseases were less frequent as a cause of death in both dementia groups than in the general population.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Objective To evaluate outcome and adverse events following ventral stabilization of the atlantoaxial (AA) joint in dogs with clinical AA subluxation using screw/polymethymethacrylate (PMMA) constructs in a retrospective, multi-center cohort study. Study Design Historical cohort study. Animals 35 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 3 institutions were reviewed to identify dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw and PMMA constructs. Data on signalment, pre- and postoperative neurologic status, imaging performed, and adverse events were retrieved. Neurologic examination data were abstracted to generate a modified Frankel score at admission, discharge, and re-examination. Telephone interview of owners >180 days postoperative was conducted. Results Thirty-five dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw/PMMA constructs were included. Most dogs were young (median age 1 year), small breed dogs with acute onset of neurologic signs (median duration 22.5 hours). Most dogs were non-ambulatory at the time of admission (median modified Frankel score 3). Adverse events were identified in 15/35 dogs including 9 dogs with major adverse events. Four dogs required a second surgery due to vertebral canal violation (n?=?2) or implant failure (n?=?2). Re-examination at 4?6 weeks postoperative reported 15/28 dogs with improved neurologic status and 19/28 dogs were ambulatory. Telephone follow-up was available for 23/35 dogs with 23/23 reported as ambulatory (median follow-up 390 days). Conclusions Ventral application of screw and PMMA constructs for AA subluxation, as described here, is associated with clinical improvement in the majority of dog. Major adverse events are infrequent and the technique is considered relatively safe.

AB  - Abstract Multi-family therapy (MFT) has yet to be evaluated in families of adults with anorexia nervosa (AN). The study aims were: (i) assess the feasibility of MFT for AN; and, (ii) assess whether MFT is associated with improved outcomes for families compared with single-family therapy (SFT). Adult patients with AN consecutively referred to an eating disorder treatment program were assigned (non-randomly) to receive eight sessions of SFT or MFT. Assessment occurred pre-therapy, immediately post-therapy, and at 3-month follow-up. A total of 37 female patients (13 SFT, 24 MFT) and 45 family members (16 SFT, 29 MFT) completed treatment. There were significant time effects for patients' BMI, eating disorder-related psychopathology and multiple family outcome measures. There were no differences between MFT and SFT on family outcome measures at end of treatment and 3?months post treatment. MFT is a feasible intervention that can be used in adult intensive treatment for those with AN. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

Participants Thirty-six patients with a cyclodialysis cleft from 2003 to 2017 were recruited. Methods Clefts were treated with cycloplegic agents, laser therapy and/or surgery. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative best recorded visual acuity (BRVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and the rate of cleft closure. Results The mean age was 45?±?17?years and 29 (80.6%) patients were male. One eye (2.8%) received only medical therapy, 5 (13.9%) received laser, 14 (38.9%) underwent surgery after laser failure and 16 (44.4%) eyes received exclusively surgery. Over 80% of eyes had a BRVA improvement of more than two lines. Closure was attained in 30 eyes (93.8%; n?=?32), with postoperative stabilized IOP?≥?12?mmHg in 29 eyes (80.6%; n?=?36) and postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 in 20 eyes (58.8%; n?=?34). Improved postoperative BRVA was related to better preoperative BRVA (P =?0.006) and preoperative IOP?≥?4?mmHg (P =?0.03). There was no significant difference between treatment approach for IOP?≥?12?mmHg (P =?0.85) or postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 (P =?0.80). Only two eyes at last follow-up required IOP lowering medication. Conclusions and Relevance There was a high closure rate with most eyes eventually requiring surgery. Clinically significant improvements in BRVA were found in most eyes. Improved postoperative BRVA was significantly related to better preoperative BRVA and IOP.

AB  - Abstract Background With an aging population increasing presentations of cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can be expected to old age services. While progress has been made in recent years in relation to the understanding and development of aetiological theories, classification, assessment and management strategies and protocols in the adult population, similar advances have lagged behind for the elderly. Aims To review the adult literature regarding PTSD and discuss how this might apply to an elderly population. An attempt is made to highlight a better awareness of the field of psychological trauma in the elderly in the hope of stimulating debate and research. Method A review of the adult literature is conducted relating to classification, aetiology, demographic features, vulnerability, assessment, clinical management including psychotherapy and medications and how these may apply to the elderly. Results Little has been published in this field that directly relates to the elderly. The adult literature allows insight into understanding how PTSD may present in the elderly, and how they may be managed. Conclusions Further specific research is needed in the elderly in order to facilitate a better understanding of PTSD that present in this unique population. This will lead to better clinical assessment, management and treatment provision. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
