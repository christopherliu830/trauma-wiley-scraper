Effects of a yoga breath intervention alone and in combination with an exposure therapy for PTSD and depression in survivors of the 2004 South-East Asia tsunami. Objective:? This study evaluated the effect of a yoga breath program alone and followed by a trauma reduction exposure technique on post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami. Method:? In this non-randomized study, 183 tsunami survivors who scored 50 or above on the Post-traumatic Checklist-17 (PCL-17) were assigned by camps to one of three groups: yoga breath intervention, yoga breath intervention followed by 3?8?h of trauma reduction exposure technique or 6-week wait list. Measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-17) and depression (BDI-21) were performed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24?weeks. Data were analyzed using anova and mixed effects regression. Results:? The effect of treatment vs. control was significant at 6?weeks (F2,178?=?279.616, P?<?0.001): mean PCL-17 declined by 42.5?±?10.0 SD with yoga breath, 39.2?±?17.2 with Yoga breath?+?exposure and 4.6?±?13.2 in the control. Conclusion:? Yoga breath-based interventions may help relieve psychological distress following mass disasters.

AB  - Summary The main causes of acquired auricular defects are surgical treatment of skin tumors and trauma. Due to the complex anatomy of the external ear, surgical reconstruction of defects in this area is challenging for surgeons, especially in case of midhelix-antihelix involvement with significant loss of soft tissue and cartilage. Our purpose is to illustrate the main reconstructive techniques of large midhelix and antihelix defects, as well as the advantages or disadvantages associated with each surgical procedure. Primary closure/wedge technique is mainly used in elderly, multimorbid subjects where single-stage procedures are desirable, but several complex chondrocutaneous, retroauricular, temporoparietal full-thickness flap procedures can also be used to recreate an ear with normal appearance. Auricular reconstruction of large midhelix-antihelix defects requires a good knowledge of auricular anatomy and the various surgical procedures available for such defects.

AB  - Long-term survival was examined for 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID). The 14-year survival rate for AD was 2.4% versus an expected rate of 16.6%, and for MID 1.7% versus 13.3% expected. MID showed a more malignant natural course than AD. Men carried a less favourable survival prognosis than women, both in AD and MID: the relative risk of dying for women was half that for men in both diseases. In MID, advanced disability indicated a relative risk of dying over twice as high. In both diseases the risk of death was substantially higher in the event of occurrence of primitive reflexes.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of apoptosis of monocytes in an experimental model of multiple trauma and its probable correlation to bacterial translocation. Thirty-two rabbits were applied in three groups: A, controls; B, myotomy of the right femur; and C, myotomy and fracture of the right femur. Blood was sampled for the estimation of endotoxins [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, derived after centrifugation over Ficoll, were incubated in flasks and apoptosis of non-adherent lymphocytes and adherent monocytes was estimated after staining for Annexin-V and flow cytometry. TNF-α of supernatants of cultured monocytes was also determined. Tissue segments were cultured after death. Median survival of groups A, B and C was?>?14,?>?14 and 9·00?days, respectively. Apoptosis of lymphocytes in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48 h and of monocytes in group C higher than group A at 2 and 4 hours. LPS in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48?h. Apoptosis of lymphocytes and monocytes was correlated positively with serum TNF-α and negatively with TNF-α of monocyte supernatants. Cultures of organ segments of group A were sterile. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from liver, lung and spleen in five animals in group B (45·45%) and in six in group C (54·54%). Early apoptosis of blood monocytes supervened after multiple trauma; the phenomenon was accompanied by apoptosis of blood lymphocytes and subsequent bacterial translocation.

AB  - Abstract Aim To evaluate the impact of multi-professional teamwork (MPTW) and leadership training interventions on patient outcomes in acute hospital settings. Background Although investigations of teamwork and leadership training in acute hospital settings indicate that such programs can optimize patient outcomes, evidence-based recommendations on the content, duration and frequency of training programs associated with clinical evidence are still absent. Design Quantitative systematic review. Data Sources A search was conducted for relevant papers published during the period from 2000-February 2014. Review Methods Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were appraised for quality and a risk-of-bias assessment was conducted. The review used a structured approach for literature search, data evaluation, analysis and presentation. A narrative summary was used to report results. Results Two MPTW and leadership interventions in stroke units have the greatest impact on patient outcomes in acute hospital settings. The interventions? impact on patient outcomes, explored in the ten remaining studies, is associated with great uncertainty due to several alternative explanations of the findings. Conclusion Research designs that test such interventions must be improved before recommendations on the ultimate program can be made. This can be achieved by strengthening the design, methodology and descriptions of interventions and the use of more consistent patient outcomes. Building a safety culture adjacent to implementing teamwork and leadership training interventions is essential for improving patient outcomes.

AB  - A Study on Upper Extremity Cumulative Trauma Disorder in Different Unorganised Sectors of West Bengal, India: Somnath Gangopadhyay, et al. Department of Physiology, Ergonomics Laboratory, University College of Science and Technology, University of Calcutta, India?Cumulative trauma disorder (CTD) is a term used to describe a class of soft tissue injuries that result due to a number of occupational activities. These disorders commonly occur among workers who are engaged in highly repetitive jobs involving continuous hand exertion, vibration and localized mechanical pressure. In the present investigation, an attempt was made to evaluate the prevalence of CTD among workers associated with strenuous hand intensive jobs in unorganized sectors in India and to highlight the unsafe working conditions to which these workers have been exposed for several years. For this purpose, an experiment was performed on 25 male workers from each group. The groups were classified into meat cutters, typists, tailors, visual display terminal (VDT) operators & weavers. For the symptom survey, a questionnaire and checklist method was implemented. Along with these, a detailed time study was performed among the workers during different activities in the total work cycle. For this study a two-tail chi-square test of independence was applied to determine whether or not the feeling of discomfort had any significant association with the repetitiveness of the work. From the observations and analysis of the results, it was revealed that all the activities are repetitive, i.e. over 50% of the work cycle of each activity involved the respective main activity where similar kinds of motion patterns were performed. Therefore it can be concluded that high repetitiveness, prolonged work activity and remaining in static posture for a prolong period of time may be regarded as the causative factors in the occurrence of CTD.

AB  - Summary Serratus anterior plane and pectoral nerves blocks are recently described alternatives to established regional anaesthesia techniques in cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery and trauma. We performed a systematic review to establish the current state of evidence for the analgesic role of these fascial plane blocks in these clinical settings. We identified relevant studies by searching multiple databases and trial registries from inception to June 2019. Study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis and studies were instead qualitatively summarised and stratified by type of surgery and comparator. We identified 51 studies: nine randomised control trials; 13 cohort studies; 19 case series; and 10 case reports. The majority of randomised controlled trials studied the serratus anterior plane block in thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with only two investigating pectoral nerves blocks. The evidence in thoracic trauma comprised only case series and reports. Results indicate that single-injection serratus anterior plane and the pectoral nerves blocks reduce pain scores and opioid consumption compared with systemic analgesia alone in cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac-related interventional procedures and chest trauma for approximately 6?12 h. The duration of action appears longer than intercostal nerve blocks but may be shorter than thoracic paravertebral blockade. Block duration may be prolonged by a continuous catheter technique with potentially similar results to thoracic epidural analgesia. There were no reported complications and the risk of haemodynamic instability appears to be low. The current evidence, though limited, supports the efficacy and safety of serratus anterior plane and the pectoral nerves blocks as analgesic options in cardiothoracic surgery.

AB  - Abstract Innovations in clinical genetics have increased diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of inherited genetic conditions (IGCs). This has led to an increased number of families seeking genetic testing and / or genetic counselling and increased the clinical load for genetic counsellors (GCs). Keeping pace with biomedical discoveries, interventions are required to support families to understand, communicate and cope with their Inherited Genetic Condition. The Socio-Psychological Research in Genomics (SPRinG) collaborative have developed a new intervention, based on multi-family discussion groups (MFDGs), to support families affected by IGCs and train GCs in its delivery. A potential challenge to implementing the intervention was whether GCs were willing and able to undergo the training to deliver the MFDG. In analysing three multi-perspective interviews with GCs, this paper evaluates the training received. Findings suggests that MFDGs are a potential valuable resource in supporting families to communicate genetic risk information and can enhance family function and emotional well-being. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is feasible to train GCs in the delivery of the intervention and that it has the potential to be integrated into clinical practice. Its longer term implementation into routine clinical practice however relies on changes in both organisation of clinical genetics services and genetic counsellors? professional development.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the seriously injured older adult; characterize and compare the differences in injury characteristics and outcomes in three subgroups of seriously injured older adults: aged 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 and older; and identify risk factors for death, complications, and discharge placement at hospital discharge. DESIGN: A retrospective secondary analysis of a statewide trauma data set from 1988 through 1997. SETTING: Data submitted from all designated trauma centers in Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: The data set yielded 38,707 patients with a mean age of 77.5 years with serious injury (mean number of injuries = 3.6, mean number of body systems involved = 2). MEASUREMENTS: Key outcomes were mortality, complications, and discharge placement. Abbreviated Injury Score categorized injuries and Injury Severity Score (ISS) quantified anatomic severity of injury. RESULTS: Mortality was 10%. Mean length of stay was 11.5 days. Just over half (52.2%) of survivors were discharged home; 25.4% were discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Injury severity, total number of injuries, complications, and increasing age were predictors of mortality (P < .01). The presence of preexisting comorbid medical conditions increased the odds of experiencing a complication over threefold. Increasing age, total number of injuries, injury to extremities or abdominal contents, injuries due to falls, and lower functional level predicted discharge to a skilled nursing facility (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic injuries affect older adults of all ages and are typically multisystem and life threatening. The standard ISS does not fully capture the potential for mortality in older adults and does not predict discharge placement. The majority of older adults survive multisystem injury. Our findings indicate the need to examine outcomes beyond mortality and to make the identification and management of comorbid conditions a priority. A geriatric consultation service could be an important addition to the interdisciplinary trauma team.

AB  - Abstract This report describes a new approach for fabricating microchannels within three-dimensional electrospun constructs. These key features serve to mimic the fascicular architecture and fibrous extracellular matrix found in native nerve. Both electrospun fibers and multi-channeled structure nerve guides have become areas of increasing interest for their beneficial roles in nerve repair. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a guide that incorporates both. Multiple parallel channels provide a greater number of defined paths and increased surface area compared to cylindrical guides. Additionally, the fibrous nature of electrospun fibers permits better mass transport than solid-walled constructs. The flexible fabrication scheme allows tailoring of nerve guide parameters such as channel diameters ranging from 33 to 176?µm and various wall thicknesses. Channel and fiber structures were assessed by optical and electron microscope images. Geometric calculations estimated a porosity of over 85% for these guides with 16% or less from the channels. In vitro culture with Schwann cells demonstrated cellular infiltration into channels with restricted migration between fibers. Finally, cell proliferation and survival throughout the guide indicates that this design warrants future in vivo examination. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109:1571?1582. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Despite clinical observations that many veterans have multiple sources of war-related guilt, many problematic guilt issues are commonly not treated or even detected by clinicians. We describe development of a survey that systematically assesses idiosyncratic sources of guilt across the spectrum of events that are potential sources of trauma-related guilt from the war-zone. A multimethod strategy was used to develop a survey with strong content validity. Results indicate the survey is temporally stable, substantially correlated with other measures of guilt, and highly correlated with measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Findings confirm that many Vietnam veterans have multiple sources of severe war-related guilt. The survey may have important clinical utility for problem identification, treatment planning, and evaluating treatment efficacy.

AB  - Background:? Comparatively little is known about the cognitive appraisals and coping styles of child road traffic accident (RTA) survivors that are associated with chronic post-traumatic reactions. Methods:? Seventy-five children and young people aged 7?18 who were involved in a road traffic accident and attended an accident and emergency department were assessed 8?months after their accident. Post-traumatic symptoms were assessed by diagnostic interview (CAPS-C) and self-report questionnaires (IES). Demographic, accident and injury severity variables were recorded. Informed by the Ehlers and Clark (2000) model, trauma memory, subjective appraisals of the trauma and cognitive coping styles were assessed. Results:? Gender was the only non-cognitive variable associated with significant post-traumatic reactions and explained 5?6% of the overall variance. Trauma memory did not significantly contribute to the final regression model. The addition of the remaining cognitive factors assessing subjective appraisals of the trauma and cognitive coping style resulted in the model accounting for 61?65% of the variance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 8?months post trauma. Conclusion:? This study adds support to the applicability of the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model to children. The results indicate that the theoretically determined appraisals and cognitive coping styles are associated with chronic post-traumatic reactions. The findings suggest the need to develop trauma-focused interventions for children that directly address these key cognitions during therapy.

Participants Male and female (n?=?162) injecting drug users (IDUs) registered for syringe exchange. Measurements Traumatic event re-exposure was identified each month with the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire. PTSD symptoms were measured with the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale?Revised, given every 4 months. Outcome measures collected monthly were days of drug use (heroin, cocaine) and drug abuse treatment-seeking behavior (interest, calls to obtain treatment, treatment participation). Findings Each traumatic event re-exposure was associated with about 1 more day of cocaine use after accounting for the previous month's cocaine use [same month adjusted B, standard error?=?1.16 (0.34); 1 month later: 0.99 (0.34)], while PTSD symptoms had no effect. Traumatic event re-exposure increased interest in drug abuse treatment [same month adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals?=?1.34 (1.11?1.63)] and calling to obtain treatment [same month 1.58 (1.24?2.01); 1 month later 1.34 (1.03?1.75)]. Each 10% increase in PTSD symptom severity was associated with persistent increased interest in treatment [same month 1.25 (1.10?1.42); 1 month later 1.16 (1.02?1.32); 2 months later 1.16 (1.02?1.32)] and calling to obtain treatment [same month 1.16 (1.02?1.32)]. Neither traumatic events nor PTSD symptoms were associated with participants receiving treatment. Conclusions Becoming exposed again to traumatic events among injecting drug users is associated with an increase in cocaine use up to 1 month later, but drug use is not related to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Both traumatic event re-exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms predict drug abuse treatment-seeking behavior for up to 2 months.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the relationship between emotions, depression and eating disorders. Initially, a review is undertaken of the current state of the research and clinical literature with regard to emotional factors in eating disorders. This literature is then integrated within a version of the multi-level model of emotion proposed by Power and Dalgleish. The aim of this paper is to incorporate a basic emotions, multi-modal perspective into developing a new emotions-based model that offers a theoretical understanding of psychological mechanisms in eating disorders. Within the new Schematic Propositional Analogical Associative Representation System model applied to eating disorders, it is argued that the emotions of anger and disgust are of importance in eating disorders and that the eating disorder itself operates as an inhibitor of emotions within the self. It is hoped that the development of a multi-levelled model of eating disorders will allow for the construction of number of specific testable hypotheses that are relevant to future research into the psychological treatment and understanding of eating disorders.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: The central importance of emotions in eating disorders, and these emotions can operate over a number of cognitive levels of processing.

AB  - Abstract The 2006 Lebanon War exposed children in the north of Israel to daily rocket attacks. To cope with the massive psychological needs, a teacher-delivered protocol focusing on enhancing personal resilience was implemented. Children were assessed for risk factors, symptoms, and adaptation before the 16-week program (Time 1; n = 983) and after its completion (Time 2; n = 563). At a 3-month follow-up (Time 3; n = 754) children were assessed together with a waiting-list comparison group (n = 1,152). Participating children showed a significant symptom decrease at Time 2 and significantly fewer symptoms than the control group at Time 3. Six or more risk factors were associated with greater symptoms and parental concern about the child's adaptive functioning. Teachers are valuable cost-effective providers for clinically informed interventions after mass trauma and disaster.

AB  - Abstract Earlier clinical and bioarchaeological studies found that injury recidivists were most likely to be young adult males. Since then, the clinical meaning of the injury recidivist has expanded to include all individuals with multiple injuries, and other aspects of health have been considered. Our study sought to apply these advances to paleopathology and place multiple injuries in a wider context by investigating: the age and sex distribution of those with single and multiple fractures, and if people with multiple injuries had poorer general health. The sample of 213 males and 190 females (≥18?years old) from six populations in England, Siberia, and Sudan ranged in date from the 3rd century BC to the mid-19th century AD. Health variables included cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, periostitis, Schmorl's nodes, enamel hypoplasias, dental caries, and periodontitis. Ante-mortem injuries were: fractures (0/1/≥2), myositis ossificans, dental trauma, and sharp-force injuries. The data were analysed using chi-square and hierarchical loglinear analyses (P?=?0.05). No significant three-way association between age, sex, and injury was found. There was no difference between the sexes when individuals with single versus multiple injuries were compared. There were significant differences in the age-distribution of people with 0 and 1/≥2 fractures. Males and those 26?35?years old were most likely to have fractures and multiple injuries. Porotic hyperostosis was significantly associated with fractures. There was no significant relationship between general poor health and multiple injuries. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background Data examining the effect of operator years in practice and volume on adverse events (AE) after cardiac catheterization in patients with congenital heart disease is limited. Methods and Results Data were prospectively collected using a multi-center registry (C3PO). 10,885 catheterizations performed between 02/07 and 06/10 at eight institutions were included. AE rates were risk-adjusted for hemodynamic vulnerability, procedure type risk group, and age and compared between operators with different years in practice (YIP) and volume. AE occurred in 13% of procedures. Operators with less than five YIP had higher adjusted odds of any AE (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14?1.77) or a high severity AE (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04?1.75), when compared with operators with 5 to less than 25 YIP (5?<?25), while operators with ≥25 YIP had higher odds of a high severity (but not any) AE (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08?1.80). Operators with <5 YIP had a higher percentage of preventable AE (out of all AE, 16% vs. 8%, P?<?0.001) as well as higher odds of vascular or cardiac trauma (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11?2.97), or technical AE (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.31?2.99) when compared with operators with 5?<?25 YIP. There was no consistent relationship between operator volume, and incidence of AE. Conclusions Operators with less than 5 years in practice have higher risk-adjusted AE rates. While an important consideration in guiding and mentoring operators with fewer years in practice, it is important to emphasize that reporting adverse events does not take into account procedural efficacy. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
