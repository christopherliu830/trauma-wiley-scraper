AB  - Background There are no randomized studies that compare outcomes after single-incision (SLC) and conventional multi-incision (MLC) laparoscopic cholecystectomy under an optimized perioperative analgesic regimen. Methods This patient- and assessor-blinded randomized three-centre clinical trial compared SLC and MLC in women admitted electively with cholecystolithiasis. Outcomes were registered on the day of operation (day 0), on postoperative days 1, 2, 3 and 30, and 12?months after surgery. Blinding of the patients was maintained until day 3. The primary endpoint was pain on movement measured on a visual analogue scale, reported repeatedly by the patient until day 3. Results The intention-to-treat population comprised 59 patients in the SLC and 58 in the MLC group. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to any of the pain-related outcomes, on-demand administration of opioids or general discomfort. Median duration of surgery was 32·5?min longer in the SLC group (P?<?0·001). SLC was associated with a reduced incidence of vomiting on day 0 (7 versus 22 per cent; P?=?0·019). The incidences of wound-related problems were comparable. One patient in the SLC group experienced a biliary leak requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The rates of incisional hernia at 12-month follow-up were 2 per cent in both groups. Cosmetic rating was significantly improved after SLC at 1 and 12?months (P?<?0·001). Conclusion SLC did not significantly diminish early pain in a setting with optimized perioperative analgesic patient care. SLC may reduce postoperative vomiting.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI), which are mostly due to road traffic crash (RTC), are a major public health concern. This article describes the incidence, severity and outcome of TBI caused by RTC in New Caledonia over a five-year period. Methods: Data of all individuals admitted in intensive care unit with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤8 at admission) caused by RTC in New Caledonia from 2008 to 2012 were analysed. Causes and severity of trauma, demographic data, and short-term as well as last available long-term outcome of patients were analysed. Five types of road users were compared (car drivers, car passengers, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians). Outcome was defined according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale classification. Results: A total of 109 patients were included in the study. The median age of patients was 24 [IQR18?33] years with a sex ratio of 2.8 (80 men/29 women). The rate of 44 among Melanesian males was two times higher that among 16 European males (22/100,000 people vs 11/100,000 people). The total survival at the Intensive Care Unit discharge (short-term outcome) was 84%, being the highest among passengers (88%) and the lowest among motorcyclists (69%). Of the patients tested for psychoactive substances, half tested positive. Lost to follow-up rate was 67%. Conclusion: Poor outcome occurs in patients with RTC-related TBI, with young Melanesian men being the most affected. Public health action should focus on this group using culturally appropriate messages.

AB  - Abstract? ??The aim of this work was to study the prevalence and clinical presentation of root fractures in a series of patients with dental trauma. Treatment strategies were classified and outcomes after a 6-month period presented. The study population comprised 76 patients (between the ages of 2 and 55 years) with 93 root fractures in their teeth (18 primary, 75 permanent). Data were collected following the taking of a detailed clinical history, objective clinical examination and photographic and radiological investigation. Since most of the primary teeth were extracted, only cases with root fracture of permanent teeth were followed-up: in all, 24 patients with 31 teeth with root fractures. The prevalence of root fractures in permanent teeth was 7.7% of all injuries, while in primary teeth it was 3.8%. The most frequently involved teeth were the maxillary incisors with a percentage of 75% in permanent teeth. Moreover, 40% of root fractures in permanent teeth were associated with fracture of the alveolar bone and of the soft tissues and in 45% of cases, the adjacent teeth were also injured. The results of this study reaffirm the necessity for scrupulous diagnosis of teeth after a traumatic injury. Adjacent teeth and those in the opposing arch should not be ignored. Treatment is multi-disciplinary, requiring surgical, orthodontic, operative and prosthetic compliance. Periodic check-up is essential.

AB  - Abstract Kinematics is the analysis of motions without regarding forces or inertial effects, with the purpose of understanding joint behaviour. Kinematic data of linked joints, for example the upper extremity, i.e. the shoulder and arm joints, contains many related degrees of freedom that complicate numerical analysis. Visualisation techniques enhance the analysis process, thus improving the effectiveness of kinematic experiments. This paper describes a new visualisation system specifically designed for the analysis of multi-joint kinematic data of the upper extremity. The challenge inherent in the data is that the upper extremity is comprised of five cooperating joints with a total of fifteen degrees of freedom. The range of motion may be affected by subtle deficiencies of individual joints that are difficult to pinpoint. To highlight these subtleties our approach combines interactive filtering and multiple visualisation techniques. Our system is further differentiated by the fact that it integrates simultaneous acquisition and visual analysis of biokinematic data. Also, to facilitate complex queries, we have designed a visual query interface with visualisation and interaction elements that are based on the domain-specific anatomical representation of the data. The combination of these techniques form an effective approach specifically tailored for the investigation and comparison of large collections of kinematic data. This claim is supported by an evaluation experiment where the technique was used to inspect the kinematics of the left and right arm of a patient with a healed proximal humerus fracture, i.e. a healed shoulder fracture.

AB  - Abstract Adolescents are at high risk for violence exposure and initiation of drug use. Co-occurring substance use and trauma exposure are associated with increased risk of mental health disorders, school underachievement, and involvement with multiple systems of care. Coordination and integration of systems of care are of utmost importance for these vulnerable youth. This study delineates the negative sequelae and increased service utilization patterns of adolescents with a history of trauma, substance abuse, and co-occurring trauma and substance abuse to support the need for integrated mental health and substance abuse services for youth. Data from two national sources, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment demonstrate the increased clinical severity (measured by reports of emotional and behavioral problems), dysfunction, and service utilization patterns for youth with co-occurring trauma exposure and substance abuse. We conclude with recommendations for an integrated system of care that includes trauma-informed mental health treatment and substance abuse services aimed at reducing the morbidity and relapse probability of this high-risk group.

AB  - Abstract Background: This study was undertaken to measure survival of patients with multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma treated by cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy through a multi-institutional collaboration. Methods: A multi-institutional data registry, established by the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group, was used to identify patients with peritoneal mesothelioma and the subgroup with multicystic tumours, treated by cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Outcomes for this subgroup are reported. The primary endpoint was overall survival. A secondary endpoint was the incidence of treatment-related complications. Results: Of 405 patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, 26 (6·4 per cent) had multicystic tumours. There were 20 women and six men with a mean(s.d.) age of 42(12) years. The median peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 14 (range 6?39). There was no perioperative mortality. Six patients developed grade III or IV complications. After a median follow-up of 54 (range 5?129) months, all 26 patients were still alive. Conclusion: Multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma appears to be a distinct subtype of peritoneal mesothelioma, where long-term survival may be achieved through cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity of platelets of an age- and sex-matched group of controls was compared with several groups of inpatients having non-familial dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), Parkinson's disease (PD), multi-infarct dementia (MID), mixed types of these 3 diseases and a group of other central nervous system (CNS) organic disorders. All patients were subjected to several psychometric tests, including the Sandoz Clinical Assessment - Geriatric Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Mini-Mental State Examination and the Organic Mental Disorder Scale (OMDS). A statistically significant enhancement of MAO-B activity could be observed in DAT patients and in PD patients, whereas the MID group showed a mean activity similar to that of the control group and the group with other organic CNS disorders. In DAT patients the degree of dementia in the OMDS test and the enhancement of MAO activity were positively correlated, but PD did not show such a correlation. It is concluded that the increase of MAO activity in PD and in DAT might be due to a disease-related enhanced affinity to oxygen and to such oxygen-derived radicals as superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. However, a possible drug-induced enhancement of MAO activity in PD cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the MAO-B activity values in platelets of individual patients or controls are not indicative of diagnosis or prognosis of any of these diseases and are of no disease-related specificity.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objectives of the present study were to describe the injury profiles of cyclists presenting to an ED and determine the risk of significant head injury associated with bicycle helmet use. Methods This was a retrospective single trauma centre study of all adult cyclists presenting to an inner city ED and undergoing a trauma team review between January 2012 and June 2014. The outcome of interest was significant head injury defined as any head injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale score of two or more. Variables analysed included demographic characteristics, helmet use at time of incident, location, time and the presence of intoxication. Results The most common body regions were upper limb injuries (57%), followed by head injuries (43%), facial injuries (30%) and lower limb injuries (24%). A lower proportion of people wearing helmets had significant head injury (17% vs 31%, P = 0.018) or facial injury (26% vs 48%, P = 0.0017) compared with non-helmet users. After adjustment for important covariates, helmet use was associated with a 70% decrease in the odds of significant head injury (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.15, 0.76, P = 0.008). Conclusions Head injuries were common after inner city cycling incidents. The use of helmets was associated with a reduction in significant head injury.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe haemodynamic resuscitation practices in ED patients with suspected sepsis and hypotension. Methods This was a prospective, multicentre, observational study conducted in 70 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand between September 2018 and January 2019. Consecutive adults presenting to the ED during a 30-day period at each site, with suspected sepsis and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<100?mmHg) despite at least 1000?mL fluid resuscitation, were eligible. Data included baseline demographics, clinical and laboratory variables and intravenous fluid volume administered, vasopressor administration at baseline and 6- and 24-h post-enrolment, time to antimicrobial administration, intensive care admission, organ support and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 4477 patients were screened and 591 were included with a mean (standard deviation) age of 62 (19) years, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 15.2 (6.6) and a median (interquartile range) systolic blood pressure of 94?mmHg (87?100). Median time to first intravenous antimicrobials was 77?min (42?148). A vasopressor infusion was commenced within 24?h in 177 (30.2%) patients, with noradrenaline the most frequently used (n = 138, 78%). A median of 2000?mL (1500?3000) of intravenous fluids was administered prior to commencing vasopressors. The total volume of fluid administered from pre-enrolment to 24?h was 4200?mL (3000?5661), with a range from 1000 to 12?200?mL. Two hundred and eighteen patients (37.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Overall in-hospital mortality was 6.2% (95% confidence interval 4.4?8.5%). Conclusion Current resuscitation practice in patients with sepsis and hypotension varies widely and occupies the spectrum between a restricted volume/earlier vasopressor and liberal fluid/later vasopressor strategy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? Addiction is a frequent comorbid disorder in schizophrenia and associated with poor outcome. The present study sought to determine whether addicted and non-addicted schizophrenic patients are impaired differentially on the executive abilities of working memory and multi-tasking which are relevant for maintaining abstinence. Design? Comparisons of executive performance in clinical and control groups. Setting? In-patient setting. Participants? The cognitive profile of schizophrenic patients with and without comorbid substance abuse disorder was compared with that of patients suffering from major depression or alcoholism and healthy participants. Measurements? A range of cognitive tasks was used to assess: (i) the ability to update continuously context information in working memory and to use it for action selection; and (ii) the capacity to divide attention between different sensory input channels and to coordinate verbal and manual responses. Findings? Single-diagnosis schizophrenic patients showed pronounced impairments on measures of online maintenance and use of context information. Their ability to coordinate different sensory input channels (divided attention) was also impaired. Addicted schizophrenics showed evidence of impaired sensory input management and of reduced context sensitivity, when age differences were controlled. Conclusions? The present study indicates severe working memory and multi-tasking deficits in schizophrenia which are, however, not exacerbated by comorbid addiction.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the relationship between acute cortisol responses to trauma and subsequent PTSD symptoms (PTSS) in children and their biological mothers. Urinary cortisol levels were assessed in 54 children aged 8?18 upon admission to a level-1 trauma center. Six weeks posttrauma, 15-hour urine samples were collected from children and their mothers. Depression and PTSS were assessed at 6 weeks (N = 44) and 7 months (N = 38) posttrauma. Higher child in-hospital cortisol significantly predicted 6-week child PTSS. This was true only for boys at 7 months. In mothers, lower 6-week cortisol levels significantly predicted 7-month PTSS. Results extend findings of differing directions of acute hormonal predictors of PTSS in adults versus children to a sample of genetically related individuals.

AB  - The majority of potentially preventable deaths after trauma are related to hemorrhage and occur early after injury, with the largest number of deaths occurring before hospital arrival. Approximately one-fourth of trauma deaths may be potentially preventable through early medical and surgical interventions. Interventions dedicated to bleeding control and hemostatic resuscitation have demonstrated merit in decreasing hemorrhagic injury mortality. Advancing these novel strategies to the casualty in the prehospital phase of care, particularly in tactical or austere environments, may prove beneficial for hemorrhage mitigation to temporize the window of survival to definitive care. Future studies of resuscitation and survival after traumatic injury must include analysis of prehospital deaths to fully understand the outcomes of early interventions.
