AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delusions and misidentifications have been reported in dementia ranging from 10% to 73% in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and up to 40% in multi-infarct dementia (MID) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in 61 AD and 31 MID patients both the frequency and the content of delusions during the course of illness and to evaluate the relationship between these and both functional and mental decline. The results indicated that delusion experiences had occurred in 45% of AD patients and in 38% of MID patients, occurring most frequently during the first year of illness. Patients who experienced psychiatric symptoms showed higher mini mental state examination scores and were less impaired in functional disability measures. With regard to the content, no significant differences were observed between AD and MID patients; 53% of psychotic symptoms were found to be paranoid delusions while 47% were misidentification delusions.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies showing the overall impact of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) on the treatment of critically ill patients in a general intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: A prospective observational study on the effects of MDCT on the treatment of patients in a 12-bed medical?surgical ICU in a university hospital providing tertiary care. Results: During the 9-month study period, there were 343 admissions with ICU length of stay longer than 48?h. Of these patients, 64 (19%) had had inconclusive findings with other modalities of radiological imaging, and they underwent altogether 82 MDCT examinations. Fifty examinations (61%) resulted in a change of treatment. The changes included 22 surgical interventions, 16 percutaneous or paranasal interventions, 15 changes of antimicrobial therapy, three withdrawals of active treatment, and four other changes of treatment. Eight patients underwent two and one patient underwent three changes of treatment. Twenty examinations (24%) were regarded as otherwise necessary for clinical decision-making, although no change in the treatment was indicated. Twelve examinations (15%) failed to provide any additional information relevant to the patient's treatment. Conclusion: Sixty-one percent of the MDCT examinations led to a change of treatment, and 24% of them otherwise contributed to or supported clinical decision-making, suggesting that MDCT examination is helpful in the case of general ICU patients, with inconclusive findings with other imaging modalities.

(2011)?Developing a multi-systemic fall prevention model, incorporating the physical environment, the care process, and technology: a systematic review. Journal of Advanced Nursing67(12), 2501?2524. Abstract Aims.? This paper reports a review that assessed the effectiveness and characteristics of fall prevention interventions implemented in hospitals. A multi-systemic fall prevention model that establishes a practical framework was developed from the evidence. Background.? Falls occur through complex interactions between patient-related and environmental risk factors, suggesting a need for multifaceted fall prevention approaches that address both factors. Data sources.? We searched Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and the Web of Science databases for references published between January 1990 and June 2009 and scrutinized secondary references from acquired papers. Review methods.? Due to the heterogeneity of interventions and populations, we conducted a quantitative systematic review without a meta-analysis and used a narrative summary to report findings. Results.? From the review, three distinct characteristics of fall prevention interventions emerged: (1) the physical environment, (2) the care process and culture and (3) technology. While clinically significant evidence shows the efficacy of environment-related interventions in reducing falls and fall-related injuries, the literature identified few hospitals that had introduced environment-related interventions in their multifaceted fall intervention strategies. Conclusion.? Using the multi-systemic fall prevention model, hospitals should promote a practical strategy that benefits from the collective effects of the physical environment, the care process and culture and technology to prevent falls and fall-related injuries. By doing so, they can more effectively address the various risk factors for falling and therefore, prevent falls. Studies that test the proposed model need to be conducted to establish the efficacy of the model in practice.

AB  - Abstract Background: We report a multi-institutional experience with intravascular stenting (IS) for treatment of coarctation of the aorta. Methods and Results: Data was collected retrospectively by review of medical records from 17 institutions. The data was broken down to prior to 2002 and after 2002 for further analysis. A total of 565 procedures were performed with a median age of 15 years (mean = 18.1 years). Successful reduction in the post stent gradient (<20 mm Hg) or increase in post stent coarctation to descending aorta (DAo) ratio of >0.8 was achieved in 97.9% of procedures. There was significant improvement (P < 0.01) in pre versus post stent coarctation dimensions (7.4 mm ± 3.0 mm vs. 14.3 ± 3.2mm), systolic gradient (31.6 mm Hg ± 16.0 mm Hg vs. 2.7 mm Hg ± 4.2 mm Hg) and ratio of the coarctation segment to the DAo (0.43 ± 0.17 vs. 0.85 ± 0.15). Acute complications were encountered in 81/565 (14.3%) procedures. There were two procedure related deaths. Aortic wall complications included: aneurysm formation (n = 6), intimal tears (n = 8), and dissections (n = 9). The risk of aortic dissection increased significantly in patients over the age of 40 years. Technical complications included stent migration (n = 28), and balloon rupture (n = 13). Peripheral vascular complications included cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) (n = 4), peripheral emboli (n = 1), and significant access arterial injury (n = 13). Older age was significantly associated with occurrence of CVAs. A significant decrease in the technical complication rate from 16.3% to 6.1% (P < 0.001) was observed in procedures performed after January 2002. Conclusions: Stent placement for coarctation of aorta is an effective treatment option, though it remains a technically challenging procedure. Technical and aortic complications have decreased over the past 3 years due to, in part, improvement in balloon and stent design. Improvement in our ability to assess aortic wall compliance is essential prior to placement of ISs in older patients with coarctation of the aorta. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract A variant of the Implicit Association Test focusing on the association of sexual and aggressive themes was administered to 90 college students (61 women) and correlated with a series of variables based on participant history of sexually traumatic events. A history of sexual abuse was correlated with increased difficulties in processing sexual and aggressive concepts simultaneously. Furthermore, this relationship remained significant after controlling for general level of emotional distress, and even after controlling for self-reported aggressiveness and positive feelings towards sex. The findings provide grounds for further exploration of deficits in associations between sexual and aggressive concepts as a possible indicator of the cognitive effects of sexual abuse.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of hyperarousal and hypervigilance. Increasing research on the ?gut?brain? axis (bidirectional signaling between the gut and the brain) has drawn links between PTSD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), an exceedingly common yet incompletely understood gastrointestinal condition. This meta-analysis thus aimed to examine the body of evidence and extent of association of PTSD with IBS. Methods Using the keywords [early abuse OR childhood abuse OR violence OR trauma OR PTSD] AND [irritable bowel syndrome or IBS], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Medline, Embase, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases yielded 11,257 papers published in English between January 1, 1988, and May 1, 2018. Of these, only eight studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Results The eight studies (four cross-sectional and four cohort) contained a total of 648,375 subjects. Most studies were from the USA and conducted on army veterans. The funnel plot revealed a roughly symmetrical distribution of studies, and Egger test was not significant for publication bias (P = 0.583). Random-effects meta-analysis found PTSD to be a significant risk factor for IBS (pooled odds ratio 2.80, 95% confidence interval: 2.06 to 3.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions Overall, PTSD is associated with an increased likelihood of IBS. This is the first meta-analysis to specifically examine the association between PTSD and IBS, and it provides insights into the probable (patho)physiology and management of IBS, supporting a holistic consideration of the psychosocial aspects of IBS and further research into effective multi-modal therapeutics.

AB  - Abstract Drug addiction is a chronic brain disorder with no proven effective cure. Assessing both structural and functional brain alterations by using multi-modal, rather than purely unimodal imaging techniques, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying addiction, which in turn may facilitate future treatment strategies. However, this type of research remains scarce in the literature. We acquired multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging from 20 cocaine-addicted individuals and 19 age-matched controls. Compared with controls, cocaine addicts showed a multi-modal hypo-status with (1) decreased brain tissue volume in the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); (2) hypo-perfusion in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, right temporal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and (3) reduced irregularity of resting state activity in the OFC and limbic areas, as well as the cingulate, visual and parietal cortices. In the cocaine-addicted brain, larger tissue volume in the medial OFC, anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum and smaller insular tissue volume were associated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Decreased perfusion in the amygdala and insula was also correlated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Tissue volume, perfusion, and brain entropy in the insula and prefrontal cortex, all showed a trend of negative correlation with drug craving scores. The three modalities showed voxel-wise correlation in various brain regions, and combining them improved patient versus control brain classification accuracy. These results, for the first time, demonstrate a comprehensive cocaine-dependence and craving-related hypo-status regarding the tissue volume, perfusion and resting brain irregularity in the cocaine-addicted brain.

AB  - This article considers over 25 years of ethnographic fieldwork, conducted among members of a Japanese multinational corporation, their families and surrounding communities, as an entwining of informants? and an anthropologist's biographies both across time and in widely dispersed locations: Japan, Thailand, France and on the US?Mexico border. The research also required analysis of the re-contextualisation of relations of a particular set of interlocutors at multiple sites, further suggesting the productivity of long-term ethnographic work that mimics the lives of informants, in this case within their global corporate network. It is suggested that the challenges shared by Japanese ?salarymen? and their families (and the anthropologist as de facto participant) in managing lives and work (and research), including with different sets of ?foreign? co-workers at different sites across the globe, for years at a time, created family-like co-dependencies. The relevance of felt relations unfolding under day-to-day conditions over a long period of time is further revealed in the article through a detailed ethnographic account of a traumatic event and its aftermath ? the 11 March 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami ? which profoundly, and tellingly, further entwined the lives of the anthropologist and his informants.

AB  - Abstract A detailed finite element model of the human kidney for trauma research has been created directly from the National Library of Medicine Visible Human Female (VHF) Project data set. An image segmentation and organ reconstruction software package has been developed and employed to transform the 2D VHF images into a 3D polygonal representation. Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces were then mapped to the polygonal surfaces, and were finally utilized to create a robust 3D hexahedral finite element mesh within a commercially available meshing software. The model employs a combined viscoelastic and hyperelastic material model to successfully simulate the behaviour of biological soft tissues. The finite element model was then validated for use in biomechanical research. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract With the growing elusiveness of the state apparatus in late modernity, military service is one of the last institutions to be clearly identified with the state, its ideologies and its policies. Therefore, negotiations between the military and its recruits produce acting subjects of citizenship with long-lasting consequences. Arguing that these negotiations are regulated by multi-level (civic, group, and individual) contracts, we explore the various meanings that these contracts obtain at the intersectionality of gender, class, and ethnicity; and examine how they shape the subjective experience of soldierhood and citizenship. More particularly, we analyse the meaning of military service in the retrospective life stories of Israeli Jewish women from various ethno-class backgrounds who served as army secretaries ? a low-status, feminine gender-typed occupation within a hyper-masculine organization. Findings reveal that for women of the lower class, the organizing cultural schema of the multi-level contract is that of achieving respectability through military service, which means being included in the national collective. Conversely, for middle-class women, it is the sense of entitlement that shapes their contract with the military, which they expect to signify and maintain their privileged status. Thus, while for the lower class, the multi-level contract is about inclusion within the boundaries of the national collective, for the dominant groups, this contract is about reproducing social class hierarchies within national boundaries.

AB  - Background The literature is sparse on written test development in a post-graduate multi-disciplinary setting. Developing and evaluating knowledge tests for use in multi-disciplinary post-graduate training is challenging. The objective of this study was to describe the process of developing and evaluating a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test for use in a multi-disciplinary training program in obstetric-anesthesia emergencies. Methods A multi-disciplinary working committee with 12 members representing six professional healthcare groups and another 28 participants were involved. Recurrent revisions of the MCQ items were undertaken followed by a statistical analysis. The MCQ items were developed stepwise, including decisions on aims and content, followed by testing for face and content validity, construct validity, item?total correlation, and reliability. Results To obtain acceptable content validity, 40 out of originally 50 items were included in the final MCQ test. The MCQ test was able to distinguish between levels of competence, and good construct validity was indicated by a significant difference in the mean score between consultants and first-year trainees, as well as between first-year trainees and medical and midwifery students. Evaluation of the item?total correlation analysis in the 40 items set revealed that 11 items needed re-evaluation, four of which addressed content issues in local clinical guidelines. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 for reliability was found, which is acceptable. Conclusion Content and construct validity and reliability were acceptable. The presented template for the development of this MCQ test could be useful to others when developing knowledge tests and may enhance the overall quality of test development.

AB  - This multi-center study evaluated guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in Class II furcation defects using a polylactic acid biodegradable barrier in 29 patients with mandibular and maxillary molar defects. Following an initial hygienic phase, surgical flaps were elevated, and the sites scaled and root planed. Furcation defect perimeter was measured and a customized barrier (thickness 600 to 750 ?) was applied to cover the defect. Barriers adhered directly to tooth and bone. At baseline, sites were measured for probing depth (PD) (6.0 ± 0.2 [SE] mm), gingival margin location (GML) (?0.2 ± 0.2 mm), and attachment level in both vertical (AL-V) (6.2 ± 0.2 mm) and horizontal (AL-H) (5.4 ± 0.2 mm) directions. After the surgical procedure, there was good compatibility between the gingival tissues and barrier material. Clinically, barriers fragmented and became displaced in 3 to 6 weeks. Substantial granulation tissue was sometimes present between barrier and root surfaces. Comprehensive periodontal examination parameters were measured 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate changes from baseline. At 6 and 12 months postsurgery, GML was close to the presurgical level (?0.5 ± 0.2 mm). There was clinically and statistically significant improvement in all other parameters: mean PD reduction (2.2 mm), AL-V gain (1.7 mm), and AL-H gain (2.5 mm). These results indicated favorable clinical regenerative outcomes after using this barrier material in Class II furcation defects in humans. J Periodontol 1995; 66:377?385.

AB  - Background Work-related crushing injuries are serious but preventable. For 2013 through 2015, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics? (BLS) Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) reported 1260 crushing injuries in Michigan. In 2013, Michigan initiated multi-data source surveillance of work-related crushing injuries. Methods Records from all 134 of Michigan's hospitals/emergency departments (EDs), the Workers Compensation Agency (WCA) and Michigan's Fatality Assessment Control and Evaluation (MIFACE) program were used to identify work-related crushing injuries. Companies, where individuals were hospitalized or had an ED visit for a crushing injury, potentially had an OSHA enforcement inspection conducted. Results From 2013 through 2015, there were 3137 work-related crushing injury incidents, including two fatalities. The Michigan OSHA program completed inspections at 77 worksites identified by the surveillance system. Conclusion The Michigan multisource surveillance system identified two and a half times more crushing injuries than BLS and was useful for initiating case-based enforcement inspections.

AB  - Abstract Objective Blood pressure (BP) cuffs are potential vectors for transmission of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). The present study aims to determine MRO colonisation rates in BP cuffs from areas of high patient flow as an assessment of the quality of disinfection and infection control practices. Methods BP cuffs in the ED, high dependency unit (HDU) and operating theatres (OT) were prospectively examined after routine disinfection procedures. Swabs collected from the inner and outer surfaces of BP cuffs during inter-patient intervals were plated onto replicate organism detection and counting, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) chromogenic agar plates to detect rates of bacterial, MRSA and VRE colonisation, respectively. Results High bacterial colonisation rates were detected in BP cuffs from all three areas. BP cuffs from OT were significantly less colonised compared with cuffs from HDU and ED; 76% versus 96% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for inner surfaces and 86% versus 98% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for outer surfaces, respectively. Equivalent or higher bacterial growth was observed on the inner surface compared with outer surface in 54%, 84% and 86% of BP cuffs from OT, HDU and ED, respectively. MRSA was detected in 3 of 150 (2%) swabs collected, but no VRE was detected. Conclusion Although MRSA and VRE were infrequently isolated, current disinfection and infection control protocols need to be improved given the greater recovery of organisms from the inner compared with outer surfaces of BP cuffs.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The pathogenetic mechanisms causing a dementing brain disease after temporary ischemia, heat shock, or brain trauma are surveyed. These lesions increase beta amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) synthesis. This process is potentiated by an ischemic glutamate release that opens cellular Ca2+ channels, inhibiting glucose turnover and ATP production, which is, under these conditions, accompanied by the generation of beta amyloid (beta A), even in young persons. Beta amyloid starts a vicious circle by inactivating the glycolytic key enzyme, phos-phofructokinase, which, with age, exhausts the functional reserve capacity of the brain. This demonstrates that beta A is an epiphenomenon of a dementing brain disease, triggered by the disturbance of glucose turnover and oxidative phosphorylation. Clinical studies have shown that a dementing brain disease can be clearly objectified and monitored by 18F-2-deoxyglucose PET studies. This paper looks briefly a pharmacologic approaches to this disease using models of temporary ischemia, the testing of 14C-deoxyglucose turnover, or examination with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. In conclusion, the key process of all dementing brain diseases of the Alzheimer type is a decreased glucose turnover and subsequently decreased oxidative phosphorylation, linked directly to a secondary amyloid formation and nerve cell atrophy.
