AB  - Despite advances in evidence-based treatments (EBTs), research suggests these interventions are not utilized in practice settings. This study examined implementation of multi-family psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP), an EBT for childhood mood disorders, in two outpatient community clinics. Fifteen community therapists facilitated MF-PEP. Twenty community clinicians referred 40 children ages 8?12 with mood disorders and their parents who participated in MF-PEP. Preliminary descriptive findings based on observations and self-report questionnaires demonstrated implementation outcomes of acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of MF-PEP at these clinics. Parents also demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of mood disorders posttreatment. Preliminary results support implementation of MF-PEP in practice settings and suggest community-based MF-PEP may be associated with improvement in clinical outcomes.

AB  - Migraine or headache is a common problem in the active duty population, in the recently deployed service members, and is a cardinal symptom of traumatic brain injury. While there is increasing appreciation of the clinical burden of post-traumatic headache (PTHA) in the military traumatic brain injury population, there remain significant research gaps related to the epidemiology of PTHA, including lack of understanding of natural history, whether there are predisposing factors that predict the development or prognosis of headache post trauma and, most basically, the features that distinguish PTHA from other forms of chronic headache. Although diagnostic criteria for PTHA are included in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition, revised, these criteria are somewhat arbitrary and were not empirically defined. This lack of precision about the PTHA phenotype limits the rigor of observational studies of PTH but does not appear to significantly hamper treatment, provided the treatment involves a multi-modality approach.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the Intensive In-home Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service (IICAPS), a large-scale home-based intervention that collaboratively engages the family, school, and various other service providers (e.g. health practitioners or judicial systems) to prevent the hospitalization, institutionalization or out-of-home placement of children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. Multi-informant data (youth, parents and clinician) on the level of youth problem severity and functioning was gathered from 7169 youth and their families served by the IICAPS network, pre- and post-intervention. A newly developed ?Multi-informant Latent Consensus? (MILC) approach was employed to measure mental health ?baseline levels? and change, within a Structural Equation Modeling framework. The MILC approach demonstrated promise integrating information from multiple informants involved in the therapeutic process to yield a more accurate and systemic view of a child's level of functioning and problem severity than each report taken individually. Results indicated that the IICAPS family and community based intervention model led to a reduction of problem severity and improved functioning in children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance.

AB  - ABSTRACT Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) trauma often occurs in combination with injury to the articular cartilage of the knee, this can result in earlier radiographic evidence of post traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee compared to the contralateral, ACL intact knee; however, the biomechanical and biological mechanisms associated with the onset and progression of this disease are not understood. We sought to gain insight into the mechanisms by determining the relationship between articular cartilage injury associated with ACL trauma and the expression of synovial fluid biomarkers of articular cartilage metabolism, and to evaluate the relationship between these biomarkers and the patient's perspective of the outcomes. Synovial fluid samples were acquired from 39 ACL injured subjects at an average of 10 weeks after injury, and 32 control subjects with normal knees (documented with clinical exam and MRI assessment). Subjects in the ACL-injured group were classified as low-risk for future OA if they displayed an International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Grade 2 articular cartilage lesion or less and high-risk for future OA if they had an ICRS Grade 3A articular cartilage lesion. The patient's perspective of the injury was evaluated with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS). There were no significant differences in mean concentrations of the markers of type II collagen metabolism (CPII, C2C, and C1,2C) or the aggrecan breakdown Alanine?Arginine?Glycine?Serine (ARGS) -fragment between control subjects and the subjects in the low- and high-risk groups (p-value range: 0.80?0.43). Associations between ARGS-aggrecan concentration and KOOS subscales of symptoms and pain were significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.03 and p?=?0.01, respectively). Likewise, there was strong evidence in support of an association between the markers of type II collagen metabolism (C1,2C and CPII concentrations) and the KOOS subscale of pain between the low- and high-risk groups (p?=?0.051 and 0.077, correspondingly). In ACL injured subjects with concomitant Grade 3A articular cartilage injuries, concentrations of synovial fluid ARGS-aggrecan were directly associated with improvements in KOOS symptoms and pain. These findings suggest the possible involvement of ARGS-aggrecan in a localized tissue repair response involving an increase in aggrecan turnover following severe knee trauma. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Forty-two patients with post-traumatic stress reactions were assessed 40 weeks after the traumatic event and given either an immediate (n = 29) or delayed (n = 13) eight sessions of psychotherapy. The patients in the delayed condition improved somewhat during the waiting list period, but at the end of treatment the two conditions were not significantly different. However, treatment gains were a little higher in the immediate group, with up to a 32% reduction in symptoms. There were no significant differences between therapists. The rate of improvement while under therapy was much higher than while awaiting assessment. Improvements were greatest for those with high Psychoticism and Obsessive Compulsive scores.

AB  - Background Previous studies have shown that children with isolated linear skull fractures have excellent clinical outcomes and low risk of surgery. We wish to identify other injury patterns within the spectrum of paediatric mild head injury, which need only conservative management. Children with low risk of evolving neurosurgical lesions could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Methods We retrospectively analysed all children with mild head injury (i.e. admission Glasgow coma score 13?15) and skull fracture or haematoma on a head computed tomography scan admitted to Westmead Children's Hospital, Sydney over the years 2009?2014. Data were collected regarding demographics, clinical findings, mechanism of injury, head computed tomography scan findings, neurosurgical intervention, outcome and length of admission. Wilcoxon paired test was used with P value <0.05 considered significant. Results Four hundred and ten children were analysed. Three hundred and eighty-one (93%) children were managed conservatively, 18 (4%) underwent evacuation of extradural haematoma (TBI surgery) and 11 (3%) needed fracture repair surgery. Two children evolved a surgical lesion 24 h post-admission. Only 17 of 214 children transferred from peripheral hospitals needed neurosurgery. Overall outcomes: zero deaths, one needed brain injury rehabilitation and 63 needed child protection unit intervention. Seventy-five percentage of children with non-surgical lesions were discharged within 2 days. Eighty-three percentage of road transfers were discharged within 3 days. Conclusions Children with small intracranial haematomas and/or skull fractures who need no surgery only require brief inpatient symptomatic treatment and could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Improved tertiary hospital transfer guidelines with protocols to manage clinical deterioration could have cost benefit without risking patient safety.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study The microbiota plays a key role in health and disease. Probiotics are a potential way to therapeutically modify the intestinal microbiota and prevent disease. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotics on the bacterial microbiota of foals during and after administration. Study design Randomised placebo controlled field trial. Methods Thirty-eight healthy neonatal foals enrolled in a previous study were selected. The foals had received a multi-strain probiotic (four Lactobacillus spp. 3?4 ? 103 colony-forming units (cfu)/g each, Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis, 1 ? 103?4 cfu/g) or placebo once daily for 3 weeks. A total of 3 faecal samples were collected from each foal at 2-week intervals and assessed via metagenomic sequencing. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare data between treatment groups. Results There were no changes on the phylum, order or class level between treatment groups at any age (all P>0.05) but some significant changes in relative abundance of families. Probiotic administration did not result in an increased relative abundance of lactobacilli or bifidobacteria at any age (Lactobacillus: P = 0.9, P = 0.1 and P = 0.2, Bifidobacterium: P = 0.3, P = 0.6 and P = 0.1 for Weeks 2, 4 and 6, respectively). Lactobacillus was enriched in the probiotic group at Week 6 on LEfSe analysis (linear discriminant analysis score 0.34, P = 0 .02). There was no effect on alpha diversity (all P>0.2) or community structure when parsimony and unifrac analysis were applied (all P>0.6). Conclusions There were limited effects of probiotic treatment on the bacterial microbiota of foals. The studied probiotic based on lactobacilli and bifidobacteria has a limited potential for therapeutic modification of the gastrointestinal microbiota.

AB  - Summary Background Salmonella enterica is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections in veterinary hospitals ? with outbreaks of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella among equine cases resulting in high case fatality rates and substantial financial cost. Objectives Study objectives were to 1) investigate factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella enterica and 2) evaluate the effect shedding may have on health outcomes of previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Study design Retrospective case?control study with prospective cohort study. Methods Analysis of medical records (N = 373; 94 culture positive, 279 culture negative) was undertaken to determine factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella. Additionally, a follow-up study was conducted to assess long-term outcomes associated with shedding among previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Data regarding exposures of interest were collected retrospectively from medical records. Information on long-term outcomes was obtained by phone interview of owners. Multivariable regression techniques were used to investigate factors associated with shedding and subsequent health outcomes. Results Horses experiencing diarrhoea during hospitalisation were more likely to shed Salmonella (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.02, 3.45) compared with horses without diarrhoea, but isolates tended to be susceptible strains. Antimicrobial therapy during hospitalisation was not associated with shedding or recovery of MDR strains. Shedding did not increase long-term risk for non-survival, colic or abnormal faeces after hospital discharge; nor increase risk for hospitalisation or occurrence of abnormal faeces in stablemates. Main limitations Data collection was reliant upon the quality of medical records and owner recall, which may have led to information bias. The study population was derived from central Kentucky and may differ from horse populations in other regions. Conclusions and clinical importance In general, Salmonella shedding was not associated with decreased average survival times or impacts to health of stablemates, perhaps due to owner implemented biosecurity precautions. Regardless, recently hospitalised horses should be segregated after discharge, in addition to employing rigorous hygiene practices. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting Information.

Method Overall, 165 Danish psychiatric outpatients answered the International Trauma Questionnaire, the Life Event Checklist, and the World Health Organization Well-being Index. ICD-10 diagnoses were extracted from the hospital record. Chi-square analysis, t-tests, and conditional probability analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results Nearly all patients (94%) had experienced at least one traumatic event. CPTSD (36%) was more common than PTSD (8%) and had considerable overlap with ICD-10 affective, anxiety, PTSD, personality, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. ICD-11 PTSD overlapped with ICD-10 anxiety, PTSD, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. A subgroup of patients with ICD-10 PTSD (23 %) did not meet criteria for ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. Conclusion Traumatic experiences are common. ICD-11 CPTSD is a highly prevalent disorder in psychiatric outpatients. One quarter with ICD-10 PTSD did not meet criteria for either ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. PTSD and CPTSD had considerable overlap with ICD-10 disorders.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper explores the effect of plant profitability on the closure decision in multi-locational manufacturing firms where the firm is selecting between different sites undertaking similar production activities. The paper draws upon a new interview survey of large multi-locational manufacturing firms. Analysis of the interview data shows that plant profitability is the key to understanding only one-third to one-half of selective closures and that decisions taken by subsidiaries are more likely to rely on plant profitability measures than decisions taken at the corporate head office. In analyzing a regional economy, a poor level of plant profitability is indicative of a plant at risk of closure but the absence of such a characteristic is not necessarily an indication of an assured future for a plant.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this report was to review retrospectively the management of splenic trauma at a major Australian tertiary referral centre (Westmead Hospital) over a 10 year period. Forty-nine patients (0-15 years of age) with documented blunt splenic trauma were identified. The causes of splenic injury were road trauma (73%) and falls (27%). There were 22 minor injuries (Injury severity score [ISS] <16) and 27 severe injuries (ISS ≥16). All nine deaths were related to road trauma (mean ISS = 59). The investigation most commonly used was CT scanning (47%). Peritoneal lavage was performed in six patients (12%). Management involved non-operative care in 29 patients (57%), exploratory laparotomy alone in 5 (10%), splenic salvage in 2 (4%) and splenectomy in 13 (26%). This experience supports the view that non-operative management of splenic injury in haemodynamically stable children is safe and is the preferred treatment. Experienced assessment and meticulous observation is necessary. Laparotomy is indicated if there is continuing haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation. Operative management is aimed at splenic salvage with splenectomy being reserved for uncontrolled haemorrhage.

Method A comparison was made to 70 cases with unsatisfactory response to treatment and 90 controls with a better response to treatment goals. Results Forty-five percent had a history of sexual abuse, other violent traumas, or both. Significant statistical differences were observed between both groups in exposure variables. The highest probability of poor outcome was observed in patients with sexual abuse and exposure to other violent acts (odds ratio [OR] = 6.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1?19.07). The risk of dropout or relapse was, respectively, 10 and 3 times greater among those exposed. Discussion Violent social conditions should be noted as another form of trauma with potential impact on outcome in Colombian women with eating disorders. ? 2005 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aim Our primary aim was to calculate the head computed tomography (CT) scan rate in children with a minor head injury (MHI) when the Dutch National guidelines were followed in clinical practice. The secondary aim was to determine the incidence of CT abnormalities and the guideline predictors associated with traumatic abnormalities. Methods We performed a multi-centre, prospective observational cross-sectional study in the emergency departments of six hospitals in The Netherlands between 1 April 2015 and 31 December 2016. Results Data on 1002 patients were studied and 69% of cases complied with the guidelines. The overall CT rate was 44% and the incidence of traumatic abnormal CT findings was 13%. CT scans were performed in 19% of children under two years of age, 48% of children between two and five years and 63% of children aged six years or more. Multivariate regression analysis for all age categories showed that CT abnormalities were predicted by a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 15, suspicion of a basal skull fracture, vomiting and scalp haematomas or external lesions of the skull. Conclusion Strict adherence to the Dutch national guidelines resulted in CT overuse. New guidelines are needed to safely reduce CT scan indications.

AB  - In recent years, a number of family therapists have conceptualized psychotherapy as a dialogical activity. This view presents family therapy researchers with specific challenges, the most important of which is to find ways of dealing with the dialogical qualities of the multi-actor dialogues that occur, for example, in family therapeutic conversations. In this article, we propose some preliminary ideas concerning qualitative investigations of multi-actor dialogues. Our aim is to work toward an integration of Bakhtin?s theoretical concepts with good practices in qualitative research (e.g., dialogical tools and concepts of a narrative processes coding system) in order to make sense of family therapy dialogues. A specific method that we have called Dialogical Methods for Investigations of Happening of Change is described. This method allows for a general categorization of the qualities of responsive dialogues in a single session, and also for a detailed focus on particular sequences through a microanalysis of specific topical episodes. The particular focus is on the voices present in the utterances, the positioning of each speaker, and the addressees of the utterances. The method is illustrated via an analysis of a couple therapy session with a depressed woman and her husband.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Surgical treatment of traumatic abdominal hernias is usually delayed for 2?3 months following injury. The residual defects are then repaired by herniorrhaphy or mesh herniorrhaphy. Objective To describe the outcome following herniorrhaphy (without a mesh) within 21 days of initial injury to repair external traumatic lateral abdominal hernias in horses and mules. Study design Descriptive case series. Methods Twenty-two cases were included. Surgical treatment involved exposure of the hernia sac and closing of the abdominal wall defect with interrupted Mayo mattress or cruciate sutures after reduction of the herniated organ into the peritoneal cavity. Data collected included cause and site of the hernia, surgical findings, immediate and long-term post operative complications, return to use, duration of convalescence and hernia recurrence. Results Falling while crossing impassable pathways was the most common initial cause of the hernia (9/11 horses and 10/11 mules). Adhesion formation to underlying viscera was found intraoperatively in 2 cases. Uncomplicated healing occurred in all animals except 3 with suture abscesses and one with a subcutaneous seroma. At the time of follow-up (6?24 months after surgery), complete recovery without recurrence of herniation was achieved and animals had returned to their previous use. Conclusion Herniorrhaphy within 21 days using interrupted Mayo mattress or cruciate pattern sutures can be effective for treating external traumatic abdominal hernias in horses and mules. The Summary is available in Chinese ? see Supporting Information.

AB  - Summary Two equids weighing <250?kg were examined several days after suffering severe mid-diaphyseal dorsal metatarsal lacerations. Distal limb vascular disruption was suspected in both cases. Nonselective computed tomography angiography with contrast medium injected peripherally via the jugular veins was used to evaluate the vascular supply to the distal limb. The use of this imaging technique demonstrated either intact or disrupted distal limb vasculature. The imaging results were verified with a positive long-term outcome in the case with a diagnosis of an intact vasculature and with histological findings of avascular necrosis in the case with a diagnosis of disrupted vasculature.

AB  - Abstract Hydraulic fracturing has provided a persistent, polarizing, and highly politicized source of controversy internationally and in numerous national contexts for just under a decade. This research uses hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) operations in New Zealand as a vignette through which to understand the underlying causes of controversy and the appropriateness of attempts to address them. A multi-method approach using interviews (n = 25), diagrammatic analysis, and newsprint media was applied to evidence two major findings. First, previous attempts to explain fracking controversy based on social constructivist theory lack a multi-scalar approach to the assessment of factors that influence risk perceptions. It is found that risk perception surrounding fracking in New Zealand reflects intra-scalar interactions between factors originating at the international, national, regional, and local scale. Second, there is a concerning absence of critique pertaining to the concept of ?social license to operate? (SLO), which has been advocated both internationally and nationally as an appropriate form of stakeholder engagement. This article contributes to the SLO outcomes literature by establishing a need to consider multi-scalar influences on risk perception when explaining diverse SLO outcomes in communities where fracking operations are prospective or already taking place.
