AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to test the association of current contextual income inequality, contextual income inequality experienced during childhood, and individual factors with oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in adolescents. Methods Individual data of 3,854 adolescents aged 15?19 years from the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SB Brasil Project) nested within 27 cities and contextual income inequality were analysed. OHRQoL was assessed using the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) questionnaire. The individual variables were demographic characteristics, socio-economic factors, and oral clinical measures. The Gini Index was used to evaluate city-level income inequality in 2003 (during childhood) and in 2010 (current) according to the tertiles of distribution. Multi-level Poisson regression was used to test the association of contextual income inequality and individual characteristics with OIDP extent according to the WHO framework on social determinants of health. Results The prevalence of OIDP was 34.5%. In the adjusted analysis, adolescents living in the cities with high-level income inequality during childhood were 1.75 times more likely (95% confidence interval 1.23?2.48) to have a higher mean of OIDP extent. Current income inequality was not associated with OIDP extent in adolescents. Conclusions Contextual income inequality during childhood was a structural determinant of OHRQoL among Brazilian adolescents after adjustment for individual demographic characteristics, socio-economic factors and oral clinical measures. Reducing social inequalities through inter-sectoral actions should be on the political agenda to improve adolescents' oral health.

AB  - Abstract Background This single-centre study evaluated the outcome of a pancreatoduodenectomy for Grade 5 injuries of the pancreas and duodenum. Methods Prospectively recorded data of patients who underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy for trauma at a Level I Trauma Centre during a 22-year period were analysed. Results Nineteen (17 men and 2 women, median age 28 years, range 14?53 years) out of 426 patients with pancreatic injuries underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy (gunshot n = 12, blunt trauma n = 6 and stab wound n = 1). Nine patients had associated inferior vena cava (IVC) or portal vein (PV) injuries. Five patients had initial damage control procedures and underwent a definitive operation at a median of 15?h (range 11?92) later. Twelve had a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) and 7 a standard Whipple. Three patients with APACHE II scores of 15, 18, 18 died post-operatively of multi-organ failure. All 16 survivors had Dindo-Clavien grade I (n = 1), grade II (n = 7), grade IIIa (n = 2), grade IVa (n = 6) post-operative complications. Factors complicating surgery were shock on admission, number of associated injuries, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gross bowel oedema and traumatic pancreatitis. Conclusions A pancreatoduodenectomy is a life-saving procedure in a small cohort of stable patients with non-reconstructable pancreatic head injuries. Damage control before a pancreatoduodenectomy will salvage a proportion of the most severely injured patients who have multiple injuries.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Common peroneal nerve (CPN) injury occurs in 10?40% of patients following knee dislocation. Is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using routine knee protocols able to adequately evaluate CPN injury and predict long-term outcome? Methods Trauma patients presenting for knee MRI at a single public hospital, between July 2007 and May 2017, were retrospectively identified using radiology and orthopaedic databases. Medical records were retrieved for clinical scores. MRI images were scored by two independent radiologists blinded to the clinical CPN status and scores correlated with initial clinical scores using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Final cohort included 107 patients (81 males and 26 females) with a mean age of 39 (range 19?81 years). MRI was considered to be adequate for coverage of the CPN in 84 patients. Fourteen patients had CPN injury clinically (seven complete and seven partial). Concordance between MRI scores and initial clinical scores was 0.456 (P = 0.01). MRI sensitivity and specificity for CPN injury on the 84 adequate scans were 54.5% and 93.2% respectively. All seven cases of partial CPN injury and three of seven cases of complete CPN injury recovered fully. High MRI scores of 5 and 8 were given for the two patients with a persisting complete CPN palsy. Highest scores for partial CPN injury subjects were 2 and 4. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging using a routine knee protocol is not adequate for the assessment of CPN injury in many subjects. More specific MRI neural sequences with complete CPN coverage may be worth trialing.

AB  - Objective:? This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a four-session, caregiver?child Intervention, the Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention (CFTSI), to prevent the development of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) provided within 30 days of exposure to a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Method:? One-hundred seventy-six 7 to 17-year-old youth were recruited through telephone screening based on report of one new distressing posttraumatic stress symptom after a PTE. Of those, 106 youth were randomly assigned to the Intervention (n = 53) or a four-session supportive Comparison condition (N = 53). Group differences in symptom severity were assessed using repeated measures with mixed effects models of intervention group, time, and the interaction of intervention and time. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess treatment condition and any subsequent traumas experienced as predictors for full and partial PTSD diagnosis at 3-month follow-up. An exploratory chi-square analysis was performed to examine the differences in PTSD symptom criteria B, C, and D at follow-up. Results:? At baseline, youth in both groups had similar demographics, past trauma exposures and symptom severity. At follow-up, the Intervention group demonstrated significantly fewer full and partial PTSD diagnoses than the Comparison group on a standardized diagnostic measure of PTSD. Also, there was a significant group by time interaction for Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children?s Posttraumatic Stress and Anxiety Indices as the CFTSI group had significantly lower posttraumatic and anxiety scores than the Comparison group. Conclusions:? The results suggest that a caregiver?youth, brief preventative early intervention for youth exposed to a PTE is a promising approach to preventing chronic PTSD.

AB  - Purpose: To compare calculated effective doses for pediatric CT exams using the new and old ICRP recommendations. Methods and Materials: A total of 178 pediatric patients who underwent trauma CT studies were analyzed retrospectively. Subjects were divided into 6 groups according to the type of exams performed, ranging from only a head scan to a full body assessment (head/face/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis). Two versions of ImPACT software (ImPACT CT, version 0.99x & 1.0) were used to analyze study data and extract the effective dose: the older version used ICRP-60 to calculate effective doses whereas ImPACT 1.0 used ICRP-103 recommendations. The correction factors for pediatrics, which are included in spreadsheet, were applied to obtain the equivalent pediatric effective dose. A paired student's t-test was used with significance threshold set at 0.01. Results: Pediatric effective doses using ICRP 103 were found to be significantly different from those calculated with ICRP 60 (p < 0.01) for the following scan groups: head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis, head/chest/abdomen/pelvis, head/neck, head/face, and head only. The difference in effective doses of full body group (head/face/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis) was not found to be significant (p = 0.035).Conclusion: Our analysis showed that the calculated effective doses from CT studies using the newer ICRP 103 differed significantly from the old ICRP recommendations. The only scans which did not exhibit significant difference (p>0.01) were when face scans were included in the ?full body? scan. This is probably due to the fact that the new tissue weighting factors of face organs did not change significantly from ICRP-60. However, when only a head and face scans were performed, the difference was found to be highly significant most likely because of the inclusion of the brain and salivary glands, which accounted for a larger contribution of the received doses from head than face scan, in the new ICRP weighting factors.

AB  - Abstract Physiological aging affects brain structure and function impacting morphology, connectivity, and performance. However, whether some brain connectivity metrics might reflect the age of an individual is still unclear. Here, we collected brain images from healthy participants (N?=?155) ranging from 10 to 80 years to build functional (resting state) and structural (tractography) connectivity matrices, both data sets combined to obtain different connectivity features. We then calculated the brain connectome age?an age estimator resulting from a multi-scale methodology applied to the structure?function connectome, and compared it to the chronological age (ChA). Our results were twofold. First, we found that aging widely affects the connectivity of multiple structures, such as anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, insula, cingulum, hippocampus, parahippocampus, occipital cortex, fusiform, precuneus, and temporal pole. Second, we found that the connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamus to frontal areas, also known as the fronto-striato-thalamic (FST) circuit, makes the major contribution to age estimation. In conclusion, our results highlight the key role played by the FST circuit in the process of healthy aging. Notably, the same methodology can be generally applied to identify the structural?functional connectivity patterns correlating to other biomarkers than ChA.

AB  - Abstract??? It is important that mouthguards have an adequate thickness of material if they are to be effective in the prevention of trauma. The aim of this study was to quantify dimensional changes that occur on thermoforming ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sheets used in the construction of mouthguards. Fourteen batches of 3?mm thick sheet EVA were thermoformed over dental models under a number of common processing conditions including, model height, inclination, shape and model temperature, model position on thermoforming platform, plasticizing time and evacuation method. Thickness of thermoformed material was determined at anterior and posterior sites and measurements were compared to determine the magnitude and patterns of stretching collectively and within each processing condition. Overall, sheets of 3-mm EVA stretched by 52% during the thermoforming conditions tested. Incisal/cuspal sites were found to be significantly thinner when compared with all other locations measured. A number of thermoforming conditions were demonstrated to have a significant effect on the degree to which the EVA material stretched. For the combination of materials and equipment tested in this study, current thermoforming practices may cause excessive thinning of EVA in critical areas including incisal edges and cusp tips, thereby reducing the protective effect for professionally made mouthguards. To optimize protection in vulnerable areas, it is important that clinicians distinguish between EVA sheet thickness and the cross-sectional dimensions achieved in the finished mouthguards. They need to be specific in their prescription of the thickness of material they require especially in critical areas.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Digital ulcers (DUs) are a major cause of disease-related morbidity and difficult to treat vascular complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Demonstrating treatment efficacy has traditionally focussed upon clinician assessment of DUs alone. No existing patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument captures the multi-faceted impact of SSc-DU. We report the findings of a multi-centre qualitative research study exploring the patient experience of SSc-DU. Methods Patient focus groups (FGs) were conducted across 3 scleroderma units, following a topic guide devised by SSc patients, experts and experienced qualitative researchers. A purposive sampling framework ensured the experiences of a diverse group of patients were captured. FGs were audio recorded, transcribed, anonymised, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. We continued FGs until thematic saturation was achieved. Results Twenty-nine SSc patients with a history of DU disease participated in 4 FGs across the UK (Bath, Manchester and London). Five major inter-related themes (and sub-themes) were identified which encompass the patient experience of SSc-DUs: ?Disabling pain and hypersensitivity?, ?Deep and broad-ranging emotional impact?, ?Impairment of physical and social activity?, ?Factors aggravating occurrence, duration and impact? and ?Mitigating, managing and adapting?. Conclusion The patient experience of SSc-DU is multi-faceted and comprises a complex interplay of experiences associated with significant pain and morbidity. Patient experiences of SSc-DU are not captured using existing SSc-DU outcomes. Our findings shall inform the development of a novel PRO instrument to assess the severity and impact of SSc-DUs for use in future SSc-DU clinical trials.

The study includes the comprehensive behavioral health characterization of over 3600 study participants and the genetic, metabolomic, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging data for many of the participants. The study design also incorporates an infrastructure for a data repository to re-contact participants for follow-up studies. The overwhelming majority (94%) of participants consented to be re-contacted for future studies, and our recently completed feasibility study indicates that 73?83% of these participants could be reached successfully for enrollment into longitudinal follow-up investigations. Longitudinal concurrent cohort follow-up studies will be conducted (5?10+ years post-baseline) to examine predictors of illness chronicity, resilience, recovery, functional outcome, and other variables, and will include neuroimaging, genetic/epigenetic, serum biomarker, and neurocognitive studies, among others. To date, the PDMH study has generated more than 35 publications from the baseline data and the repository has been leveraged in over 20 publications from follow-up studies drawing from this cohort. Limitations that may affect data collection for a longitudinal follow-up study are also presented.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the occurrence and the type of after office-hours traumatic dental injuries managed by the Dental Unit of the Accident and Emergency Department at the Singapore General Hospital. During a 2-year period (from August 1990 to July 1992), 461 trauma patients (314 males, 147 females) sustained injuries to 968 teeth. The distribution in different races of Chinese: Malay: Indian: others was 7.3: 1.3: 0.9: 0.5. The predominant age groups were 2?3 years, 3?4 years and 17?18 years; 71.3% of the teeth sustained luxation type injuries, the remaining 28.7% had fractures, 45.3% of the cohort had concomitant soft tissues injuries, while 13.7% had associated facial bone fractures. Teenager traumas were more common during school vacations. It is concluded that thorough standardized documentation is imperative to obtain baseline information on dental trauma. This could facilitate future preventive measures, education and research.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - Recent scientific reports and popular press describing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) collectively link this condition to a broad array of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including extremely rare and multi-determined behaviors such as murder-suicide. These reports are difficult to reconcile with several decades of research on the science of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its consequences, especially the natural history and prognosis of mild TBI. This article attempts to reconcile these sources by reviewing the state of the science on CTE, with particular attention to case definitions and neuropathological criteria for this diagnosis. The evidence for links between TBI, CTE, and catastrophic clinical events is explored, and the complexity of attributing rare frequency behavioral events to CTE is highlighted. The clinical and medicolegal implications of the best available evidence are discussed, concluding with a cautionary note against prematurely generalizing current findings on CTE to entire populations of persons with, or at risk for, concussion exposures.

AB  - Computed tomography is the cornerstone of modern radiology and arguably the most important modality in terms of clinical impact. CT is used extensively for emergencies, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, orthopedic and other applications - often as the first and only imaging procedure needed for diagnosis, characterization, staging, treatment planning, and follow-up. CT is often the first and only modality needed. There is high likelihood that a patient will have a CT scan in the emergency department, as an outpatient, or as an inpatient for a multitude of indications - trauma, suspected infection or malignancy, and frequently to investigate symptoms such as pain and fever, or to answer a question raised by another test, such as an EKG abnormality or ultrasound finding. Many other modalities are available, including MRI, ultrasound, fluoroscopy and nuclear medicine PET and SPECT. Depending on the clinical question, more than one modality may be required, so questions raised in a CT exam could be resolved with PET or MRI. Each modality has strengths and limitations which are known and recognized relative to the clinical indication. Since pre-certification may be required by payors prior to imaging, these indications are important for reimbursement. The principal drivers for clinical imaging, both single and multi-modality today are reimbursement, radiation dose, workflow efficiency, and availability. Multimodality imaging is most frequently applied to solve complex or demanding clinical problems, and almost never used for screening. A major advantage of CT in hospitals and clinics as well as free-standing imaging centers, is its availability 24/7, while other modalities such as US and MRI may be limited to scheduled examinations in the majority of cases. Multimodality scanners based on CT incorporate PET/SPECT and MRI to combine morphologic and functional imaging. The most demanding imaging applications are cardiovascular, where complex motion and small morphologic features coexist, so imaging methods that are very satisfactory elsewhere in the body may not be successful. Clinical CT scanning consists of administering toxic materials, e.g., contrast media, while monitoring the EKG and illuminating the body with high brightness x-rays. Larger area detectors and higher acquisition rates are welcome improvements, but don't solve all of the problems encountered with scan variability due to respiratory, whole body, and cardiac motion, especially in a spectrum of patients from infant to massively obese adult sizes (< 1 kg to 250 kg or more). The challenges and pitfalls in CT and multimodality imaging will be delineated and evaluated relative to current and future technology. Learning Objectives: 1. The role of x-ray computed tomography (CT) is central to multimodality imaging in diagnosis, staging, treatment planning and follow-up. 2. The principal drivers for CT and complementary use of other modalities are availability, reimbursement, workflow, and radiation dose. The influence of these factors on clinical decision making will be outlined and illustrated. 3. The limitations of a single modality, such as CT, can be overcome by integrating complementary instrumentation, especially PET/SPECT, MRI and others (such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy) to provide simultaneous morphologic and functional imaging.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the long-term outcome of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and pericardectomy for treatment of chylothorax in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Thirty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods Dogs were included if they had undergone a VATS TDL and pericardectomy and had at least 1-year follow-up or had died within 1 postoperative year. Medical records were evaluated, and recorded data included clinicopathological and diagnostic imaging results, surgical findings, complications, conversion rates, and long-term resolution and recurrence rates. Results Thirty-nine dogs met the inclusion criteria. Two dogs died intraoperatively; 1 was euthanized after severe restrictive pleuritis was diagnosed intraoperatively, and 1 underwent ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest during pericardectomy and could not be resuscitated. Conversion to an open approach was required in 1 of 39 (3%) dogs for TDL and 4 of 36 (11%) dogs for pericardectomy. Overall follow-up time was median 38 months (range, 3-115). Resolution of pleural effusion occurred in 35 of 37 (95%) dogs that survived the perioperative period. Late recurrence of pleural effusion was seen at 12, 12, and 19 months postoperatively in 3 of 35 (9%) dogs that survived the perioperative period and in which chylothorax had initially resolved. Conclusion Successful long-term resolution of chylothorax was seen in a high proportion of dogs that underwent VATS TDL and pericardectomy, although late recurrence was sometimes seen. Clinical significance Video-assisted thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation and pericardectomy are highly successful in dogs with chylothorax. Future studies should evaluate whether pericardectomy is required in dogs without evidence of pericardial disease.

AB  - Abstract Despite the many journal articles and reviews that have been published regarding the treatment of trauma to teeth, the endodontic management of these injuries is often still not fully understood. The purpose of this review is to establish clear and up-to-date guidelines for practitioners who are faced with treating dental injuries on a day-to-day basis, based on an assessment of current available scientific information relating to the endodontic management of these injuries. Treatment is discussed under the headings: infractions, uncomplicated crown fractures, complicated crown fractures, crown-root fractures, root fractures, luxation injuries, avulsion, root resorption, pulp canal obliteration and open-apex teeth. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of traumatized immature teeth where maintenance of pulp blood supply is important to encourage continued development of the root system. Only the treatment of traumatized permanent anterior teeth is reviewed. Information contained in this article is based on a review of the literature on dental trauma which involved a MEDLINE search using the key words ?dental trauma? and the individual topics listed above. The guidelines produced by the International Association of Dental Traumatology, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and the American Association of Endodontists were also reviewed and the recommendations contained in this paper are in concert with the major recommendations of these bodies.

AB  - Abstract An increasing emphasis has been placed across health care on evidence-based medicine with higher level studies, such as randomized trials and prospective cohort studies. Historically, clinical research in orthopaedic surgery has been dominated by studies with low patient numbers from a limited number of surgeons. The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that orthopaedics has fewer multi-center collaborative studies as compared to other medical disciplines. We chose three leading journals from general medicine, a leading journal from the surgical subspecialties of obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology and otolaryngology, and three leading journals from orthopaedic surgery based on highest impact factor. We compared the percentage of collaborative studies and the number of contributing institutions and authors in original research manuscripts published in 2009 between general medical, surgical subspecialty and orthopaedic surgery journals. A significantly higher percentage of manuscripts resulted from multicenter collaborative efforts in the general medical literature (p?<?0.000001) and the other surgical subspecialty literature (p?<?0.000001) compared to the orthopaedic surgery literature. Manuscripts published in the general medical journals came from more institutions (p?<?0.0001) and had significantly more authors (p?<?0.000001) than those published in the orthopaedic surgery journals. There is an opportunity to stimulate greater multicenter collaborative research, which correlates with increased patient numbers, a higher level of evidence and more generalizable findings, in the orthopaedic surgery community. These efforts can be supported through increased funding, surgeon participation, and appropriate expansion of authorship for multicenter studies in orthopaedic journals. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract This paper contrasts the loss of mind from the loss of brain cells in Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative conditions with the threats to one's mind from the mindlessness of others from a cognitive-analytic perspective. Case studies are presented that show how the therapeutic framework of Cognitive-Analytic Therapy (CAT: Ryle 1990, 1995, 1997) can bring containment for both client and therapist for clients facing this dilemma, particularly when past trauma is potentially overwhelming. This is set in a dialogue with the pioneering work of Tom Kitwood (1990, 1995, 1997) in dementia care, in which Kitwood's thesis of the ?malignant social psychology? surrounding people with dementia is re-stated in terms of ?reciprocal roles? developed in Cognitive-Analytic Therapy.
