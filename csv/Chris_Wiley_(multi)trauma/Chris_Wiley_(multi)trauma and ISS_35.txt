AB  - Objectives To compare the progression-free survival of dogs with high-grade T-cell lymphoma treated with either a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone-based or a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine chemotherapy protocol. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, cases were selected based on histologic or cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma, T-cell phenotype, hypercalcaemia, or both, and no previous chemotherapy for lymphoma. Treatment was not randomly allocated. Results Seventy-three dogs were included in this study: 50 in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 23 in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. The median progression-free survival was 133?days for dogs in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 97?days for dogs in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. When golden retrievers (n?=?16) were evaluated ?separately, progression-free survival was longer in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone versus mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine treatment group (median PFS 154?days versus 70.5 days, respectively). Clinical Significance The progression-free survival time for dogs with multi-centric T-cell lymphoma treated with a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine protocol was similar to that of dogs treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Further studies, including those evaluating golden retrievers separately, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Abstract Researchers recognize that the connection between alcohol and peer violence may relate to community level ecological factors, such as the location of businesses that sell alcohol. Building on previous research among adults, this study examines the relationship between alcohol outlet density and violent behaviors among adolescents, taking into account demographic characteristics, individual alcohol use, and neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators. Data drawn from a diverse Emergency Department based sample of 1,050 urban adolescents, combined with tract level data from the state liquor control commission and U.S. Census, were analyzed. Results of multivariate multi-level regression analysis indicate that alcohol outlet density is significantly related to adolescents' violent behaviors, controlling for demographic characteristics and individual alcohol use. Census tract level socioeconomic indicators were not significantly associated with youth violence. Findings suggest that alcohol outlet density regulation should be considered as part of broader violence prevention strategies for urban adolescents.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To generate a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields using images acquired from 7 T, multi-echo, gradient-echo MRI for the evaluation of epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders as well as investigating (apparent transverse relaxation rate) and quantitative volume magnetic susceptibility (QS) of the subfields. Experimental Design: Healthy control subjects (n?=?17) were scanned at 7 T using a multi-echo gradient-echo sequence and susceptibility-weighted magnitude images, and QS maps were reconstructed. We defined a hippocampal subfield labeling protocol for the magnitude image produced from the average of all echoes and assessed reproducibility through volume and shape metrics. A group-wise diffeomorphic registration procedure was used to generate an average atlas of the subfields for the whole subject cohort. The quantitative MRI maps and subfield labels were then warped to the average atlas space and used to measure mean values of and QS characterizing each subfield. Principal Observations: We were able to reliably label hippocampal subfields on the multi-echo susceptibility images. The group-averaged atlas accurately aligns these structures to produce a high-resolution depiction of the subfields, allowing assessment of both quantitative susceptibility and across subjects. Our analysis of variance demonstrates that there are more apparent differences between the subfields on these quantitative maps than the normalized magnitude images. Conclusion: We constructed a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields for use in voxel-based studies and demonstrated in vivo quantification of susceptibility and in the subfields. This work is the first in vivo quantification of susceptibility values within the hippocampal subfields at 7 T. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3588?3601, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Depression is the most common mental disorder for young people, and it is associated with educational underachievement, self-harm, and suicidality. Current psychological therapies for adolescent depression are usually focused only on individual-level change and often neglect family or contextual influences. The efficacy of interventions may be enhanced with a broader therapeutic focus on family factors such as communication, conflict, support, and cohesion. This article describes a structured multi-family group approach to the treatment of adolescent depression: Behaviour Exchange Systems Therapy for adolescent depression (BEST MOOD). BEST MOOD is a manualized intervention that is designed to address both individual and family factors in the treatment of adolescent depression. BEST MOOD adopts a family systems approach that also incorporates psychoeducation and elements of attachment theories. The program consists of eight multifamily group therapy sessions delivered over 2 hours per week, where parents attend the first four sessions and young people and siblings join from week 5. The program design is specifically aimed to engage youth who are initially resistant to treatment and to optimize youth and family mental health outcomes. This article presents an overview of the theoretical model, session content, and evaluations to date, and provides a case study to illustrate the approach.

AB  - Abstract Background Purulent pericarditis is an acute and fulminant disease characterized by pus accumulation in the pericardial space. Its incidence has declined substantially and the common pathogen has changed since the beginning of the antibiotic era; however, it is still found in some patients with immunocompromised conditions. Case report We report a rare case in which the onset of diabetes mellitus presented as extremely high HbA1c concentration, ketoacidosis, multi-site abscesses and purulent pericarditis. After antibiotic therapy and pericardiocentesis, the purulent pericarditis still did not resolve and further intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy also failed. Finally, this patient was treated successfully by surgical debridement and pericardiectomy. Conclusion In the immunocompromised state of severe hyperglycaemia, purulent pericarditis is a possible complication of uncontrolled infection. If purulent pericarditis cannot be cured using non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic therapy, pericardiocentesis and intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy, a surgical pericardiectomy should be considered to avoid morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aims to describe the association between sociodemographic factors and trajectories of disease, disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA). Methods Data were collected prospectively over 3 years in the Singapore Early Arthritis Cohort study. Trajectories were modeled using multi-trajectory group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) and determinants of trajectory membership were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Results Two hundred and thirteen patients were included: 58.2% Chinese, 16.4% Malay, 21.6% Indian, mean (SD) age 51.3 (12.6) years and symptom duration 21.8 (15.3) weeks. In the multi-trajectory analysis, three groups of disease trajectories and corresponding disability and HRQoL trajectories were identified: group 1 (moderate disease rapid response, 49.9%), group 2 (high disease rapid response, 31.1%) and group 3 (high disease slow response, 19.1%). Malay patients had higher relative risk ratio (RRR) of being in trajectory groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (RRR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.05-3.98 and RRR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.45-6.43, respectively) while patients with tertiary education had lower relative risk (RRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.89 and RRR = 0.33, (95% CI 0.14-0.83, respectively). In the analysis of individual outcomes, ethnicity, education level and body mass index were determinants of the heterogeneous disease activity trajectories. Gender and education level were determinants of the disability trajectories. Only gender was a determinant of the HRQoL trajectories. Further, 96.2% of the patients were treated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Conclusion Disparities in sociodemographic factors should be taken into consideration in formulating treatment strategies in ERA.

AB  - Abstract Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) is an uncommon medical condition that may be encountered by otolaryngologists and facial plastic surgeons. TTS begins with damage to the trigeminal nerve or its central sensory connections, causing anesthesia in a dermatomal distribution. With repeated scratching and manipulation, an ulceration occurs, often in the alar region. In this multi-institutional report, we summarize a small series of patients with TTS. Treatment options are discussed along with a review of the relevant literature. Although rare, it is important that practicing otolaryngologists be familiar with the classic signs and symptoms of this condition in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) presents in young, otherwise-healthy individuals. This study examined recurrence and survival characteristics after surgical resection for FLC by utilizing an international multi-institutional database. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for FLC from six institutions (1993?2010) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was studied with life tables and Cox regression models. Results Thirty-five patients (13 female, 37%) were included (median age: 32 years). R0 resection was achieved in all curative-intent operations (n?=?30), and palliative operations were performed for five patients. Crude 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 22% and 3%, respectively. For curative-intent surgery, overall and recurrence-free survivals at 5 years were 62% and 45%, respectively. In patients who achieved a 4-year disease-free interval after surgery, none subsequently developed recurrence. In multivariate models, presence of extrahepatic disease was the only factor that independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38?22.55, P?=?0.016) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.64, 95% CI: 1.48?21.49, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Patients with surgically amenable FLC had encouraging long-term survival. Recurrence-free survival to 4 years suggested possible freedom from disease thereafter. Recurrent resectable disease was associated with an excellent prognosis, and repeat surgery should be strongly considered. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014; 110:412?415. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.

AB  - Abstract This paper explores the social interaction among participants in a church service in an online multi-user virtual reality (VR) environment. It examines some of the main features of prayer meetings in a religiously-oriented virtual world and also what sets this world apart from other virtual worlds. Next, it examines some of the issues of research ethics and methods that are raised in the study of online behavior in virtual worlds. The paper then analyzes the text exchanges between participants in a virtual church service and some of the ways in which these compare with the content of a conventional church service. Finally, the paper draws out some implications for our understanding of the relation between interaction in the virtual and in the ?real? world.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice in the majority of liver injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in primary treatment and outcomes in a single Dutch Level 1 trauma centre with wide experience in angio-embolisation (AE). Methods:? The prospective trauma registry was retrospectively analysed for 7-year periods before (Period 1) and after (Period 2) the introduction of AE. The primary outcome was the failure rate of primary treatment defined as liver injury-related death or re-bleeding requiring radiologic or operative (re)interventions. Secondary outcomes were liver injury-related intra-abdominal complications. Results:? Despite an increase in high-grade liver injuries, the incidence of primary non-operative management more than doubled over the two periods, from 33% (20 of 61 cases) in Period 1 to 72% (84 of 116 cases) in Period 2 (P < 0.001). The failure rate of primary treatment in Period 1 was 18% (11/61), compared with 11% (13/116) in Period 2 (P= 0.21). Complication rates were 23% (14/61) and 16% (18/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.22). Liver-related mortality rates were 10% (6/61) and 3% (4/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.095). The increase in the frequency of non-operative management was even higher in high-grade injuries, in which outcomes were improved. In high-grade injuries in Periods 1 and 2, failure rates decreased from 45% (9/20) to 20% (11/55) (P= 0.041), liver-related mortality decreased from 30% (6/20) to 7% (4/55) (P= 0.019) and complication rates fell from 60% (12/20) to 27% (15/55) (P= 0.014). Liver infarction or necrosis and abscess formation seemed to occur more frequently with AE. Conclusions:? Overall, liver-related mortality, treatment failure and complication rates remained constant despite an increase in non-operative management. However, in high-grade injuries outcomes improved after the introduction of AE.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mutations in FLNA (Filamin A, OMIM 300017) cause X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia (XL-PNH). XL-PNH-associated mutations are considered lethal in hemizygous males. However, a few males with unusual mutations (including distal truncating and hypomorphic missense mutations), and somatic mosaicism have been reported to survive past infancy. Two brothers had an atypical presentation with failure to thrive and distinct facial appearance including hypertelorism. Evaluations of these brothers and their affected cousin showed systemic involvement including severe intestinal malfunction, malrotation, congenital short bowel, PNH, pyloric stenosis, wandering spleen, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, inguinal hernia, and vesicoureteral reflux. The unanticipated finding of PNH led to FLNA testing and subsequent identification of a novel no-stop FLNA mutation (c.7941_7942delCT, p.(*2648Serext*100)). Western blotting and qRT-PCR of patients' fibroblasts showed diminished levels of protein and mRNA. This FLNA mutation, the most distal reported so far, causes in females classical XL-PNH, but in males an unusual, multi-organ phenotype, providing a unique insight into the FLNA-associated phenotypes. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Through the application of the Delphi technique, this study draws on the expertise of British child protection academics and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines in seeking to develop a consensus opinion on possible early indicators of child abuse and neglect. The search for early indicators is described in the context of a secondary preventative approach to the problem of child maltreatment. A very tentative conclusion arising from the study is that the early indicators of child abuse and neglect that achieved consensus of agreement may help in diagnosing child abuse and neglect at an earlier stage, although they are not necessarily diagnostic. Alternative explanations, differential diagnoses and information-gathering are paramount, as is a willingness and ability to act on concerns. Although great caution is urged, it is suggested that the findings from the study are credible and of interest to those who are working towards more timely recognition and referral of abused and neglected children.

AB  - Purpose: The pathophysiology and clinical phenomenology of epileptic psychoses are wide and varied, and an internationally accepted classification system has yet to be established. A multi-axial classification should be developed to capture the complexity of clinicai situations and to describe the heterogeneity of individuals presenting with the same diagnosis. We propose a new 5-axial classification system based on a review of the previous literature and evaluate its validity and applicability in Japan by a multi-institutional design. Methods: According to the ICD-10 guidelines, psychosis is defined as the presence of hallucination, delusions, or a limited number of behavioral abnormalities, such as gross excitement and overactivity, marked psychomotor retardation, and catatonic behavior, without disturbance of consciousness. Among the patients with epilepsy and psy- choses treated by the authors at 6 epilepsy clinics, 128 patients were randomly selected to participate as subjects. Those patients who developed epilepsy after the onset of their psychoses were excluded. The average age of the subjects was 39.4 years, average age of onset of epilepsy was 13.3 years, and average age of onset of psychoses was 27.9 years. Results: The first axis codes the type of epilepsy and laterality of epileptic focus. Temporal lobe epilepsy (48%) and other localization-related epilepsies (14%) were prevalent, but all types of epilepsy were seen. Left-sided (29%) and right-sided foci (27%) were in equal proportion, and bilateral foci (9%) also were found. The second axis codes the type of psychoses and clinical course. Paranoid schizophrenia-like disorder (41%) and delusional disorder (19%) were prevalent; whereas acute transient psychotic disorder (9%), catatonic disorder (7%), hallucinosis (6%), and hebephrenic schizophrenia-like disorder (4%) were relatively infrequent. Single episode (24%), recurrent episodes (34%), and chronic course (34%) were found in almost equal proportion. Therc were several cases with chronic course after recurrent episodes (3%). The third axis codes the temporal relationship between seizure occurrence and EEG changes during psychoses. lnterictal onset (69%) was most frequent followed by postictal (15%), para-ictal (6%), and other (5%). EEG changes during psychoses were seen in 38%, and normalization of the EEG was seen in 4%of patients. In 22%, EEG could not be recorded during psychoses (22%). The fourth axis codes the precipitating factors of psychoses. Specific personality trait (20%), changes in drug-regimen (l4%), co-morbidity with other psychiatric disorders (12%), and psychosocial factors (10%) were seen. The fifth axis codes the organic background. Abnormal findings by brain imaging techniques (38%). mild intelligence deficiency (30%), and previous history of brain damage (27%) were noted. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate the heterogeneity of epileptic psychoses. We have proposed a 5-axial classification that appears to provide a convenient format for organizing and communicating clinical information to assist clinical practice and facilitate research. Using those guidelines, we may be able to improve our under- standing of the pathogenesis, develop suitable treatment, predict the prognosis, and ultimately establish appropriate intervention strategies.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.

AB  - During one year all ankle inversion injuries seen at the acute ward of our institution were divided into grades of severity and classified according to the maximal area of tenderness at the time of clinical examination. Seven years later 648 of the subjects (91%) evaluated their ankle with the help of a questionnaire. Location of maximal tenderness at the time of injury was: lateral fibular ligaments 61%, lateral midfoot ligaments 24%, base of the fifth metatarsal/peroneal tendons 5% and combined lesions 8%. 39% were considered minor, 46% were moderate, and 15% severe. All cases followed a functional treatment protocol. Seven years post- injury 32% reported chronic complaints of pain, swelling or recurrent sprains. 72% of the subjects with residual disability reported that they were functionally impaired by their ankle ? in most cases a question of not performing sports at a desired level. 4% experienced pain at rest and were severely disabled. 19% were bothered by repeated inversion injuries ? 43% of these subjects felt that they could compensate by using an external ankle support. There was no correlation between the severity of the sprain as judged at the time of injury and the frequency of residual disability or between the area of maximal tenderness at the time of injury and the area of maximal pain at the time of follow-up.
