AB  - During one year all ankle inversion injuries seen at the acute ward of our institution were divided into grades of severity and classified according to the maximal area of tenderness at the time of clinical examination. Seven years later 648 of the subjects (91%) evaluated their ankle with the help of a questionnaire. Location of maximal tenderness at the time of injury was: lateral fibular ligaments 61%, lateral midfoot ligaments 24%, base of the fifth metatarsal/peroneal tendons 5% and combined lesions 8%. 39% were considered minor, 46% were moderate, and 15% severe. All cases followed a functional treatment protocol. Seven years post- injury 32% reported chronic complaints of pain, swelling or recurrent sprains. 72% of the subjects with residual disability reported that they were functionally impaired by their ankle ? in most cases a question of not performing sports at a desired level. 4% experienced pain at rest and were severely disabled. 19% were bothered by repeated inversion injuries ? 43% of these subjects felt that they could compensate by using an external ankle support. There was no correlation between the severity of the sprain as judged at the time of injury and the frequency of residual disability or between the area of maximal tenderness at the time of injury and the area of maximal pain at the time of follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Abdominal metastases (AM) from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are rare and prognosis is poor. The aims of the study were to (a) identify risk factors for the development of AM and to (b) investigate the outcome of AM-patients. Methods Seven-hundred-sixty-nine STS-patients with localised disease at diagnosis treated at three tumour centres (2000-2016) were retrospectively included (409 males; mean age, 55.6 years [range, 8-96 years]; median follow-up, 4.1 years [interquartile-range, 2.5-6.6 years]). Results Two-hundred-two patients (26.3%) developed secondary metastases, and 24 of them AM (3.1%). Ten patients developed first AM (FAM) after a mean of 2.4 years and 14 patients late AM (LAM, after being diagnosed with metastases to other sites) after a mean of 2.0 years. Patients with liposarcoma had a significantly higher risk of developing AM (P?=?.007), irrespective of grading. There was no difference in post-metastasis-survival (PMS) between patients with AM at any time point and those with metastases to other sites (P?=?.585). Patients with LAM or FAM showed no difference in post-abdominal-metastasis-survival (P?=?.884). Conclusions Survival in patients with AM is poor, irrespective of whether they develop secondarily to other metastases or not. Patients at high-risk of AM (ie, liposarcoma) may be followed-up regularly by abdominal-ultrasound/CT.

AB  - ABSTRACT Two categories of joint overloading cause post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA): single acute traumatic loads/impactions and repetitive overloading due to incongruity/instability. We developed and refined three classes of complementary models to define relationships between joint overloading and progressive cartilage loss across the spectrum of acute injuries and chronic joint abnormalities: explant and whole joint models that allow probing of cellular responses to mechanical injury and contact stresses, animal models that enable study of PTOA pathways in living joints and pre-clinical testing of treatments, and patient-specific computational models that define the overloading that causes OA in humans. We coordinated methodologies across models so that results from each informed the others, maximizing the benefit of this complementary approach. We are incorporating results from these investigations into biomathematical models to provide predictions of PTOA risk and guide treatment. Each approach has limitations, but each provides opportunities to elucidate PTOA pathogenesis. Taken together, they help define levels of joint overloading that cause cartilage destruction, show that both forms of overloading can act through the same biologic pathways, and create a framework for initiating clinical interventions that decrease PTOA risk. Considered collectively, studies extending from explants to humans show that thresholds of joint overloading that cause cartilage loss can be defined, that to at least some extent both forms of joint overloading act through the same biologic pathways, and interventions that interrupt these pathways prevent cartilage damage. These observations suggest that treatments that decrease the risk of all forms of OA progression can be discovered. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary? The advent of selective internal urethrotomy under direct vision has enabled precision endoscopic surgery to be undertaken on a wide range of urethral strictures. A multi-centre survey of 197 cases involving 322 urethrotomy procedures from 5 urological departments in England is reported. The overall results after a follow-up of up to 4 years suggest that there is no indication for further procedures currently existing in 160 (81%) of those cases subjected to selective internal urethrotomy. The additional injection of triamcinalone acetate into the strictured area prior to urethrotomy is recommended in resistant cases The procedure of selective internal urethrotomy is, in our opinion, the best primary method for the treatment of urethral stricture, and it is hoped this will reduce the indications for anastomotic or substitution urethroplasty.

AB  - Objective To describe contemporary outcomes of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAVP) performed in 22 US centers. Background: BAVP constitutes first-line therapy for congenital aortic stenosis (cAS) in many centers. Methods We used prospectively-collected data from two active, multi-institutional, pediatric cardiac catheterization registries. Acute procedural success was defined, for purposes of this review, as a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg and no more than mild aortic regurgitation (AR) for patients with isolated cAS. For patients with mixed aortic valve disease, a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg without worsening of AR was considered successful outcome. Results In 373 patients with a median age of 8 months (1 day to 40 years of age) peak systolic gradient had a median of 59 [50, 71] mm Hg pre-BAVP and 22 [15, 30] mm Hg post-BAVP (P?<?0.001). Procedural success was achieved in 160 patients (71%). The factors independently associated with procedural success were: first time intervention (OR?=?2.0 (1.0, 4.0) P?=?0.04), not-prostaglandin dependent, (OR=3.5 (1.5, 8.1); P?=?0.003), and isolated cAS (absence of AR) (OR?=?2.1 (1.1?3.9); P?=?0.03). Twenty percent of patients experienced adverse events, half of which were of high severity. There was no procedural mortality. Neonatal status was the only factor associated with increased risk of high severity adverse events (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.5?9.0). Conclusion In the current era, BAVP results in procedural success (gradient reduction with minimal increase in AR) in 71% of patients treated at US centers where BAVP is considered first-line therapy relative to surgery. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Medical imaging and emergency departments work collaboratively to interpret trauma radiographs. In addition to accurate radiographic interpretation, clear communication is crucial to ensure appropriate and timely management of musculoskeletal injuries. This two-step ?how to guide? provides the reviewer with a recipe for effectively evaluating trauma radiographs for traumatic pathology and succinctly documenting the findings. Step 1 is a systematic search of the radiograph: soft tissues, bones, alignment of joints and satisfaction of search (SBASS). Utilising SBASS increases reviewer confidence in identifying traumatic pathology of the appendicular and axial skeleton. Step 2 is a streamlined communication model for the documentation of pathological findings. The WWW acronym (What is it? Where is it? What is it doing?) can be adapted to describe simple or complex traumatic pathology.

AB  - Abstract Background Single-event multi-level chemoneurolysis (SEMLC) is a single-session procedure that treats various limbs of patients with spasticity at multiple levels with chemoneurolytic agents. Phenol is used in combination with botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) to enable spastic muscles to be treated without overdosing with BTX-A. Objective To review unintended effects (UEs) of SEMLC for children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Design Retrospective chart review. Setting Pediatric rehabilitation outpatient clinic at an academic medical center. Participants The study included 98 children with CP who underwent SEMLC on at least one occasion. Interventions SEMLC. Main Outcome Measures UEs, the goal achievement for each SEMLC session, and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS-ER). Results A total of 98 subjects and 146 SEMLC procedures were reviewed. Patients had a mean age of 7.56 years (standard deviation, 4.28); 57% were male; and 14 had hemiplegia, 22 had diplegia, 8 had triplegia, and 54 had quadriplegia. Most SEMLCs (72%) were performed with a combination of BTX-A and 5% phenol in a session. UEs were reported for 31/146 (21%) of SEMLC sessions, with 16 of 31 UEs being temporary weakness. The overall incidence of UEs of the group that received combined agent treatment was not different from the group that received BTX-A only (P = .267). Transient pain occurred in 7 of 105 patients who were treated with the combined agents BTX-A and phenol. Dysesthesia did not develop in any of the patients. The type of CP, GMFCS level, number of muscles injected, and doses of medications were not correlated with the incidence of UEs. Conclusions SEMLC using combined BTX-A and phenol is a safe procedure for children with spastic CP. It could be a treatment option for patients with diffuse spasticity, because combining agents allowed more muscles to be treated without enduring or serious UEs. Patient and family education is essential to prepare them for the occurrence of common UEs, such as temporary weakness and pain.

AB  - Summary The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are effective statistical tools for evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests for binary-class medical data. However, many real-world biomedical problems involve more than two categories. The Volume Under the ROC Surface (VUS) and Hypervolume Under the ROC Manifold (HUM) measures are extensions for the AUC under three-class and multiple-class models. Inference methods for such measures have been proposed recently. We develop a method of constructing a linear combination of markers for which the VUS or HUM of the combined markers is maximized. Asymptotic validity of the estimator is justified by extending the results for maximum rank correlation estimation that are well known in econometrics. A bootstrap resampling method is then applied to estimate the sampling variability. Simulations and examples are provided to demonstrate our methods.

AB  - Abstract ? A cross-sectional survey was carried out on 3702 boys and girls aged 9?14 years, attending public and private primary schools in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A multi-stage sampling technique using an equal probability scheme was adopted to select the children. The response rate for the total sample was 97%. Dental examinations were carried out by one dentist (MISC). Intra-examiner agreement was very good. The prevalence of dental injuries increased from 8% at the age of 9 years to 13.6% at 12 and 16.1% at 14 years. Adjusted results showed that children from high socio-economic backgrounds were 1.4 (95% CI=1.15?1.79) times more likely to present with a dental injury than children with low SES. Boys were 1.7 times (95% CI=1.41?2.16) more likely to have dental injuries than girls. Children with an overjet size greater than 5.0 mm were 1.37 times (95% CI=1.06?1.80) more likely to have a dental injury than children with an overjet size equal or lower than 5.0 mm. Finally, children with an adequate lip coverage were 0.56 times (95% CI=0.44?0.72) less likely to have a traumatic dental injury than those with inadequate lip coverage.

AB  - The participation and support of the family in the rehabilitation process is essential. The family of the brain-injured person, placed in a stressful situation, needs nursing care and intervention. This need is identified in the literature and supported by experience. The dimensions of a family care plan are included in a step-by-step approach, with emphasis on the assessment phase. Specific areas addressed in the assessment are the overall family system, phases of recovery, and the response to crisis. A care plan is provided as a guide. The care plan must be expanded and individualized to meet the needs of the family unit or family member to be most effective.

To quantify the impact of edentulousness on residual ridge volume, denture stomatitis (DS), as well as oral health behaviours among geriatric denture-wearers. Background:? Residual ridge resorption (RRR) is the primary intraoral complication of complete edentulism, but individual variation among geriatric patients has been observed. Materials and methods:? Data collection relied upon a 10-year retrospective chart review of all complete denture-wearing geriatric patients presenting at the Removable Prosthodontics Clinic, Dental School of Athens, between 1993 and 2002. Analyses relied on descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate methods based on ordinal logistic regression. Results:? A total of 873 records of geriatric patients (age mean?=?72; median?=?70; range?=?65?95) comprised our analytical sample. Subjects? mean (SD) time since edentulation was 7.7 (10.2) years. Eleven percent were diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder (TMD). While 28% of patients reported cleaning their dentures at least daily, 6% presented with denture stomatitis (DS). Each added year of edentulism increased the odds of mandibular RRR: OR (95% CI)?=?1.05 (1.03, 1.07). Nightly denture wear was the strongest risk factor for DS. Finally, independent of age and sex, each year of being edentulous increased the odds of presenting with TMD: OR (95% CI)?=?1.03 (1.01, 1.05). Conclusion:? Time since edentulation was strongly associated with mandibular but not maxillary RRR, as well as TMD development.

AB  - Abstract We report the case of an ultimately successful liver transplant recipient whose post-transplant course was complicated by the early development of multiple abscesses in the graft. Post-transplant cholangiography identified multiple shear injuries to the second and third order intrahepatic bile ducts, originating from blunt trauma to the donor liver. Treatment was non-operative following recent reports of the successful management of intrahepatic bile duct injury in the stable trauma patient. This discussion adds to the limited literature available on the transplantation of injured donor livers, despite this being a relatively common practice. Further experience is needed in determining the appropriate criteria for the use of traumatized donor livers. Cholangiography carried out on the back table may help to determine if such injured livers are suitable for transplantation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Procedural cooperation between cardiac surgeon and interventional cardiologist to facilitate interventions such as device delivery or angioplasty (hybrid procedure) has become increasingly common in the management of patients with congenital heart disease. Design.? Data were prospectively collected using a multicenter registry (C3PO). Between February 2007 and December 2008, seven institutions submitted data regarding 7019 cardiac catheterization procedures. Procedural data and adverse events (AEs) of 128 hybrid procedures were evaluated. Results.? There was significant variability in the number of hybrid procedures per center, ranging from one to 89 with a median of eight. A total of 60% of interventional (vs. strictly diagnostic) hybrid procedures were performed by one center. The median weight was 3.7?kg (0.7?86?kg). Single-ventricle circulation was present in 60% of the procedures. Hybrid procedures included: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent placement (n = 55), vascular rehabilitation (n = 25), ventricular septal defect (VSD) device closure (n = 7), valvotomy (n = 3), and diagnostic hybrid procedures (n = 38). Sixteen AEs occurred in 15/128 (12%) procedures. These included minor or trivial AEs (n = 9), moderate AEs (n = 5), major AEs (n = 1), and catastrophic AEs (n = 1). The type of AE documented included arrhythmias (n = 6), hypoxia or hypotension (n = 3), vessel or cardiac trauma (n = 2), and other events (n = 5). Of documented AEs, 9/16 (56%) were classified as not preventable, 6/16 (38%) as possibly preventable, and 1/16 (6%) as preventable. The incidence of AE related to PDA stent placement with surgical exposure (5/50, 10%) was significantly lower when compared with PDA stent placement performed percutaneously (4/5, 80%, P= .002). Conclusion.? Hybrid procedures appear to have a low incidence of associated major AEs. PDA stent placement performed as a palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or complex single/two ventricle patients may have a lower incidence of AEs if performed using a direct approach with surgical exposure rather than a percutaneous approach. Accurate definitions of these innovative procedures are required to facilitate prospective data collection.
