AB  - Abstract This study examined how the characteristics of people with mental illness who are participants in post-booking jail diversion programs affect recidivism and time spent incarcerated. The study employed data from a multi-site, federally funded jail diversion initiative. A pre?post comparison design was used to compare experiences of arrest and days spent in jail of diverted individuals for the 12 months following enrollment with the 12 months prior to enrollment. Also compared were differences in 12-month public safety outcomes. Data were collected between February 2003 and August 2007. The findings suggest that people with mental illness who are diverted from jail to community-based services experience fewer arrests and jail days. Approximately half of the sample were never arrested during the 12 months following enrollment. The strongest differences between people who experienced reduced contact with the criminal justice system and people with unchanged or increased contact were found in measures of criminal history. The results suggest that services targeted to diverted individuals with mental illness should address public safety goals, not just those of public health. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Procedural cooperation between cardiac surgeon and interventional cardiologist to facilitate interventions such as device delivery or angioplasty (hybrid procedure) has become increasingly common in the management of patients with congenital heart disease. Design.? Data were prospectively collected using a multicenter registry (C3PO). Between February 2007 and December 2008, seven institutions submitted data regarding 7019 cardiac catheterization procedures. Procedural data and adverse events (AEs) of 128 hybrid procedures were evaluated. Results.? There was significant variability in the number of hybrid procedures per center, ranging from one to 89 with a median of eight. A total of 60% of interventional (vs. strictly diagnostic) hybrid procedures were performed by one center. The median weight was 3.7?kg (0.7?86?kg). Single-ventricle circulation was present in 60% of the procedures. Hybrid procedures included: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent placement (n = 55), vascular rehabilitation (n = 25), ventricular septal defect (VSD) device closure (n = 7), valvotomy (n = 3), and diagnostic hybrid procedures (n = 38). Sixteen AEs occurred in 15/128 (12%) procedures. These included minor or trivial AEs (n = 9), moderate AEs (n = 5), major AEs (n = 1), and catastrophic AEs (n = 1). The type of AE documented included arrhythmias (n = 6), hypoxia or hypotension (n = 3), vessel or cardiac trauma (n = 2), and other events (n = 5). Of documented AEs, 9/16 (56%) were classified as not preventable, 6/16 (38%) as possibly preventable, and 1/16 (6%) as preventable. The incidence of AE related to PDA stent placement with surgical exposure (5/50, 10%) was significantly lower when compared with PDA stent placement performed percutaneously (4/5, 80%, P= .002). Conclusion.? Hybrid procedures appear to have a low incidence of associated major AEs. PDA stent placement performed as a palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or complex single/two ventricle patients may have a lower incidence of AEs if performed using a direct approach with surgical exposure rather than a percutaneous approach. Accurate definitions of these innovative procedures are required to facilitate prospective data collection.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Abstract During the past two decades, with a huge and rapidly increasing clinical need for bone regeneration and repair, bone substitutes are more and more seen as a potential solution. Major innovation efforts are being made to develop such substitutes, some having advanced even to clinical practice. It is now time to turn to natural biomaterials. Nacre, or mother-of-pearl, is an organic matrix-calcium carbonate coupled shell structure produced by molluscs. In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that nacre is osteoinductive, osteoconductive, biocompatible, and biodegradable. With many other outstanding qualities, nacre represents a natural and multi-use biomaterial as a bone graft substitute. This review aims at summarising the current needs in orthopaedic clinics and the challenges for the development of bone substitutes; most of all, we systematically review the physiological characteristics and biological evidence of nacre's effects centred on osteogenesis, and finally we put forward the potential use of nacre as a bone graft substitute. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract When a single coil is used to measure perfusion by arterial spin labeling, saturation of macromolecular protons occurs during the labeling period. Induced magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) effects decrease tissue water signal intensity, reducing the sensitivity of the technique. In addition, MTC effects must be properly accounted for in acquiring a control image. This forces the image to a single slice centered between the labeling plane and the control plane. In this work, a two-coil system is presented as a way to avoid saturation of macromolecular spins during arterial spin labeling. The system consists of one small surface coil for labeling the arterial water spins, and a head coil for MRI, actively decoupled from the labeling coil by using PIN diodes. It is shown that no signal loss occurs due to MTC effects when the two-coil system is used for MRI of rat brain perfusion, enabling three-dimensional perfusion imaging. Using the two-coil system, a multi-slice MRI sequence was used to study the regional effects of amphetamine on brain perfusion. Amphetamine causes significant increases in perfusion in many areas of the brain including the cortex, cingulate, and caudate putamen, in agreement with previous results using deoxyglucose uptake to monitor brain activation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? To review the literature addressing the assessment and management of pain in patients with polytraumatic injuries including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and blast-related headache, and to identify patient, clinician and systems factors associated with pain-related outcomes. Design.? Systematic review. Methods.? We conducted searches in MEDLINE of literature published from 1950 through July 2008. Due to a limited number of studies using controls or comparators, we included observational and rigorous qualitative studies. We systematically rated the quality of systematic reviews, cohort, and case-control design studies. Results.? One systematic review, 93 observational studies, and one qualitative research study met inclusion criteria. The literature search yielded no published studies that assessed measures of pain intensity or pain-related functional interference among patients with cognitive deficits due to TBI, that compared patients with blast-related headache with patients with other types of headache, or that assessed treatments for blast-related headache pain. Studies on the association between TBI severity and pain reported mixed findings. There was limited evidence that the following factors are associated with pain among TBI patients: severity, location, and multiplicity of injuries; insomnia; fatigue; depression; and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions.? Very little evidence is currently available to guide pain assessment and treatment approaches in patients with polytrauma. Further research employing systematic observational as well as controlled intervention designs is clearly indicated.

AB  - Clinico-pathological studies have shown that the clinical diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia (MID) is even more difficult than that of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The study evaluated the significance of course characteristics for the diagnosis of MID and DAT. Course characteristics were rated when 57 demented patients were admitted to our neurogeriatric department. Diagnosis of MID and DAT, respectively, was established after a follow-up study with repeated neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological investigations. In 21 cases diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem neuropathology. MID lacked the typical course of the disease in about two thirds of patients, while most DAT patients presented with the typical course of primary degenerative dementia. Features of the ?typical? clinical course of MID (abrupt onset, stepwise deterioration) helped to exclude DAT, whereas MID could not be excluded on the basis of a history of insidious onset and gradual decline.

AB  - After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R), many studies have reported a deficit of performance on the injured leg during multi-joint tasks. However, the total mechanical joint work (WTotal), parameter best related to the vertical displacement of the body mass center during vertical jumping, has not yet been studied. The aim of this research was to compare asymmetries between ACL-R subjects and healthy matched subjects, through the analysis of the kinematics and kinetics during a single-leg squat jump. Asymmetries are defined by the Limb Symmetry Index (LSI). A greater LSI was observed for WTotal in the ACL-R group than in the healthy group. There was no difference in LSI for knee joint work between the two groups, while the LSI for hip and ankle joint work was significantly larger in the ACL-R group. This was explained by greater LSI for the hip and ankle joint range of motion in the ACL-R group than in the healthy group. After ACL-R, patients exhibited greater asymmetries than healthy subjects during single-leg squat jump. Physiotherapists should focus on quality execution of multi-joint movement, especially on hip and ankle joints range of motion in order to reduce asymmetries and to improve vertical jumping performance.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - SUMMARY From a review of the literature, it can be concluded that it is always advantageous and usually necessary to distribute the casualties of a disaster to several hosp-hospitals rather than allowing 1 hospital, the nearest to the scene, to bear the whole load. The potential of these hospitals would be enhanced if their preparedness and planning included anticipation of their functioning as part of a framework of the entire capacity of the medical services of an entire small country, or a region of a larger one. For the smooth functioning of this framework, central co-ordination and control of the distribution of the load, the movements within it, the strengthening of its various component parts is necessary and services other than medical (transport, communications, etc.) are essential. The establishment of a multihospital system for disaster situations for a whole region is suggested. This would integrate all medical facilities and services of the region, as well as promoting additional services, first horizontally integrated and later vertically, and would have a central governing body with full authority to prepare the system for the calamity and to execute the implementation of the plan when disaster occurs. This body may find it useful to base some of its decision in the planning as well as the implementing stage, on an assumed population of casualties that is characteristic for the region and on implications that may be drawn from the population.

AB  - Abstract Cigarette smoking is a complex behavior to which environmental, psychological, and genetic factors contribute. Applying a multifactorial model, we examined the role of genetic variation in the dopamine transporter (DAT1) in smoking initiation (SI) and nicotine dependence. The participants were female college students who had never smoked (n?=?148) or had smoked daily for at least a year (n?=?242). All participants provided extensive background information and completed a series of psychological instruments. Five SNPs were genotyped in the 3? and 5? regions of DAT1. Data were analyzed by logistic regression. The best fitting model for SI (P?=?1.9???10?17, Nagelkerke R2?=?0.33) revealed novelty seeking (OR?=?1.14, P?=?0.000004) and lifetime traumatic experience (OR?=?2.3, P?=?0.001) as risk factors and a DAT1_E15?+?274?DAT1_VNTR G-9 haplotype as protective (OR?=?0.57, P?=?0.03). In the model for nicotine dependence (P?=?1.4???10?8, Nagelkerke R2?=?0.27) novelty seeking was a risk factor (OR?=?1.07, P?=?0.03); the DAT1_E15+274?DAT1_VNTR G-9 haplotype (OR?=?0.37, P?=?0.001) and the interaction between trauma and a DAT1_E15?+?274?DAT1_VNTR C-9 haplotype (OR?=?0.15, P?=?0.01) were protective. Lifetime experience of trauma was associated with high nicotine dependence among non-carriers of the C-9 haplotype but not among carriers of this haplotype. These findings indicate that in the context of a multifactorial model, haplotypes in the 3? region of DAT1 influence the propensity of young women to initiate smoking as well as the severity of nicotine dependence once the habit is established. A haplotype in the 3? untranslated region of DAT1 modifies the effect of lifetime traumatic experience on the severity of nicotine dependence. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation and infection that can be used as a predictive risk marker of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals or as a prognostic marker of recurrent ischemia and death among patients with coronary heart disease or stroke. We developed a sensitive, disposable, and easy to operate sensor based on heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay for high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurement. We used screen-printed electrodes modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and protein A to ensure the oriented immobilization of anti-CRP antibodies. CRP was quantitatively measured down to a concentration of 0.5?ng mL?1, enabling high dilution of the samples before measurement and consequently reducing interferences present in the serum. The sensor developed is suitable for point of care detection of hs-CRP at clinically relevant concentrations for the diagnosis of both conventional and low-grade inflammations.

AB  - Abstract Objective The proportion of adults in Australia meeting or exceeding the national guidelines for physical activity has remained relatively static over the past 10 years. The research objective was to measure self-reported physical activity and sedentary behaviour among ED patients in accordance with Australia's current physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines, revised in 2014. Methods A convenience sample of participants was recruited from three EDs in Melbourne between February and May 2016. Eligible participants were administered the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ? Short Form plus researcher-derived questions. Participants were assessed as whether meeting the physical activity guidelines or not, using pre-defined criteria. Results The proportion of 18?64 year olds meeting all of the physical activity guidelines was 19.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.2?22.8). A majority of participants (63.1%, 95% CI 58.5?67.7) met the aerobic component of the guidelines although only 28.9% (95% CI 24.5?33.3) of participants reported undertaking strength building exercises two or more times per week. Adults in the oldest age group were found to be less likely to engage in muscle strengthening exercises (23.3%, n = 30) than those in the youngest age group (40.0%, n = 60, P = 0.005). Average daily sitting time (minutes) did not differ between men (median = 300) and women (median = 360, P = 0.118). Conclusions Overall adherence with physical activity guidelines is low among adults attending the ED. All adults need to be encouraged to undertake muscle strengthening activities, especially adults in older age groups.

AB  - Summary The shoulder has greatest range of motion of any joint in the body, and is a frequent site of injury. Shoulder girdle includes proximal humerus, scapula, and lateral clavicle. The anatomic structures involved in fracture of the proximal humerus include humeral head, anatomic neck, surgical neck, and greater and lesser tuberosities. The fractures to the proximal humerus result from a direct blow, fall on an outstretched hand in the elderly, or are related to glenohumeral joint fracture-dislocation. Fractures of the humeral shaft may result from direct trauma, high-velocity motor vehicle accidents or a fall. Scapular fractures are infrequent as the scapula is surrounded and protected by large and prominent muscle attachments. Acromioclavicular joint injury is commonly due to a fall onto the point of the shoulder. Radiographs are generally the first step in initial imaging modality for patients with shoulder trauma.

AB  - Abstract Survival from cancer has improved over the past decade resulting in more long-term survivors. The literature on multi-dimensional quality of life (QOL) among long-term (5+ years) adult survivors is reviewed for each of seven cancer sites (i.e. breast, ovarian, cervical, prostate, colorectal, head and neck, and Hodgkin's disease survivors). Overall, long-term survivors experience good to excellent QOL. Physical domain QOL was the most frequently measured while spiritual domain QOL was the least frequently measured. QOL varies according to treatment received and by age for all groups with older persons (excepting head and neck and Hodgkin's disease survivors) reporting better QOL. QOL improves with time for breast cancer survivors and tends to decrease over time for prostate cancer survivors. Issues regarding sexual functioning affected the social domain?especially for breast and prostate cancer survivors. Social support improves psychological domain QOL for breast, cervical, and colorectal survivors. Review of findings may assist researchers and clinicians wishing to enhance the QOL of the long-term survivor population by identifying the most pressing and widely experienced concerns and by providing directions for future research.
