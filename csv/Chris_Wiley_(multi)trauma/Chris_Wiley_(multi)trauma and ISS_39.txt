AB  - Abstract Thoraco-abdominal trauma can in rare cases involve diaphragmatic rupture and subsequent herniation of intra-abdominal contents. We report a case of this complication in a 5-year-old boy who was injured in a car crash, and who manifested respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability after 48 h of being monitored in the pediatric intensive care unit. Multiple radiologic investigations were inconclusive and the definite diagnosis was established only on thoracoscopic exploration.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience. Methods Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24 months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) subscores respectively. Results In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P?<?0.001, cluster size?>?20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group and three CAPS subscores. Discussion These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole in dogs with diagnosis of meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology. Methods: Medical records of 10 dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology and treated with ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole were reviewed at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Laboratory abnormalities, side effects, clinical and cerebrospinal fluid responses to treatment and association between blood ciclosporin level and response to treatment were evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis was available in three patients. Results: No significant abnormalities were detected on serial complete blood count and serum chemistry panel in any of the dogs. Side effects of ciclosporin therapy included excessive shedding, gingival hyperplasia and hypertrichosis. Overall median survival time for all dogs in the study was 930 days (range, 60 to more than 1290 days). In all dogs, serial cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a marked improvement in the inflammation. Clinical Significance: Results suggest that ciclosporin either alone or in combination with ketoconazole may be a safe and effective treatment for meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Cognitive processing speed is crucial for human cognition and declines with aging. White matter hyperintensity (WMH), a common sign of WM vascular damage in the elderly, is closely related to slower psychomotor processing speed. In this study, we investigated the association between WMH and psychomotor speed changes through a comprehensive assessment of brain structural and functional features. Multi-modal MRIs were acquired from 60 elderly adults. Psychomotor processing speeds were assessed using the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A). Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between TMT-A and brain features, including WMH volumes in five cerebral regions, diffusivity parameters in the major WM tracts, regional gray matter volume, and brain activities across the whole brain. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to demonstrate the contribution of each index to slower psychomotor processing speed. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that WMH volume in the occipital lobe and fractional anisotropy of the forceps major, an occipital association tract, were associated with TMT-A. Besides, resting-state brain activities in the visual cortex connected to the forceps major were associated with TMT-A. Hierarchical regression showed fractional anisotropy of the forceps major and regional brain activities were significant predictors of TMT-A. The occurrence of WMH, combined with the disruption of passing-through fiber integrity and altered functional activities in areas connected by this fiber, are associated with a decline of psychomotor processing speed. While the causal relationship of this WMH-Tract-Function-Behavior link requires further investigation, this study enhances our understanding of these complex mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Background:? There were 59 unprovoked shark attacks worldwide in 2008. Twelve of these occurred in Australia, ranking it as second only to the USA. In February 2009, two attacks occurred within 72?h in Sydney, Australia. Methods:? The two patients involved survived severe limb trauma. Case 1 suffered bite trauma to the lower limb and hand and underwent staged debridement and early amputation. Case 2 presented with a hand severed at the level of the wrist that was initially replanted. However, it would succumb to progressive necrosis after 12 days. We discuss the aspects of these cases that contributed to the patients' survival and ultimately good functional outcomes. Discussion:? New paradigms for the management of major trauma patients have emerged over the last decade. We consider recent advances in the understanding of pre-hospital tourniquet use, rapid transit to the operating suite and damage control surgery, and examine how they impacted on the management of our patients. Very little is known about the microbiology of shark bites. Organisms from sea water, the patient's skin and the shark's mouth must all be considered when selecting appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis. The planning of definitive surgery in severe limb trauma is dependent on the interactions of a number of factors including physical, psychological and social issues. The decision to ultimately replant or amputate the effected limb is best made in union with the patient and their family.

AB  - Abstract The relation between state formation and identity in MENA multi-sectarian societies is examined, taking Syria as a case study. The paper looks at the impact of the mix of sectarianism and nationalism on the formation of state institutions and the impact of the latter on this mix. The flawed export of the Westphalian state system to MENA established the structural context?multiple identities, hybrid states?wherein the two identities compete, overlap, and coexist. Next, the factors that explain varying identity patterns in MENA are surveyed and their likely consequences for state formation; then, reversing the analysis, the impact of state formation and state institutions on the nationalism?sectarianism balance is examined. The Syrian case is briefly discussed in order to illustrate the argument, looking at three periods when the identity balance interacted differently with state formation: pre-Ba'thist Syria when nationalism eclipsed sectarianism; Ba'thist Syria (1970-2000) when patrimonial instrumentalization of sectarianism was compensated for by inclusive bureaucratic institutions, populist policies, and nationalist ideology; neo-liberal Syria under Bashar al-Asad (2000-2010) when inclusion shrank, reanimating sectarianism; and civil war Syria (2010-) when partial state failure fostered exclusionary militant sectarianism at the expense of nationalism.

AB  - Abstract Nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections are very frequent in intensive care units (ICU). The risk of death after severe infection is high, but the precise rate of death in ICU attributable to nosocomial infection is not known. The goal of this project was to build a statistical model to predict the occurrence of nosocomial infections in ICU and the outcome of the patients. We collected data on 676 consecutive patients admitted to an ICU for more than 24 hours between 1993 and 1996. The following data were collected for each patient: history; clinical examination at entry; subsequent infections; outcome. A multi-state heterogeneous semi-Markov model was determined and then validated; the initial data set was randomly split into two groups: two-thirds (450 patients) to build the model and one-third (226 patients) to validate it. The model defined five states: ICU admission; first simple infection; first complicated infection; death, and discharge from the ICU. Transitions between these states determined nine different events. The global model of patient histories can be divided into nine survival models, each corresponding to one of these events. The possible events from a given state were considered to be competing. Since many risk factors induced non-proportional hazard functions, piecewise exponential models were used to model event occurrence. The effect of continuous covariates on hazard functions has been described with a non-parametric method that enables non-linear relations to be shown. Among other things, the model allows patients' post-admission histories to be predicted from data available at ICU admission. The bootstrap estimator of the attributable risk of death due to simple or complicated nosocomial infections is 44.2 per cent (95 per cent CI 26.0?61.6 per cent). We were also able to characterize the most highly exposed patients, those who comprise the high-risk group on whom prevention efforts must be focused. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Identifying and characterizing top predators? use of trophic resources provides important information about animal ecology and their response to changing conditions. Information from sources such as stable isotopes can be used to infer changes in resource use as direct observations in the wild are difficult to obtain, particularly in the marine environment. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values were recovered from the canine teeth of grey seals collected from haul outs in the central North Sea in the 1970/1980s (n = 44) and 2000s (n = 25), spanning a period of marked ecosystem changes in the region. Extracting material deposited during juvenile and adult life-stages, we reconstructed a multi-decadal record of Œ¥15N and Œ¥13C variation. Using established correlations between stable isotope ratios and sea bottom temperature we created a proxy for baseline isotopic variability to account for this source of temporal change. We found 1) a significant long-term decline in juvenile grey seal Œ¥15N values, suggesting trophic position has decreased over time; 2) a decline in adult Œ¥15N values and contraction in stable isotopic niche space after the North Sea regime shift, signifying both a decline in trophic position and change in foraging habits over the 20th century; and 3) evidence for dietary segregation between juvenile and adult animals, showing juvenile individuals feeding at a lower trophic position and in more nearshore areas than adults. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mining archived biological samples to address ecological questions and imply important ontogenetic and long-term shifts in the feeding ecology of a top predator. Long-term changes in grey seal trophic dynamics may be partly in response to well documented ecosystem changes in the North Sea. Such indirect monitoring of marine predators may have utility when set in the context of ecosystem assessments where paucity of long-term monitoring data is prevalent.

AB  - Summary Aim? To evaluate the impact of European Society of Endodontology curriculum guidelines on undergraduate teaching in the UK. Methodology? A postal questionnaire was designed by two authors (WPS, GB) in 2003. This included open and closed questions relating to endodontic curricula and the impact of curriculum guidelines. This was sent with a cover letter to the thirteen UK undergraduate schools. Data harvest was completed a year after the initial questionnaires were sent. Responses were collated and analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results? Eight (62%) questionnaires were returned. Analysis revealed divergence from aspects of curriculum guidelines. Guidelines were applied by seven schools. Four schools had not applied guidelines related to endodontic surgery as this was taught by Departments of Oral Surgery. One respondent stated that the established curriculum was too inflexible to allow application. There was wide variation in curriculum structure with combinations of outcome, competency and problem-based learning. No schools had a separate department of Endodontology. All schools felt graduates should be competent at de-novo treatment of single and multi-rooted teeth. In general, competence was expected in single canal re-treatment but not multi-rooted teeth. Patient recruitment proved a major barrier to meeting guidelines. Number of cases to be completed by graduation ranged from 6 to 14 in total. Three schools felt that guidelines were not achievable citing lack of time, funds and appropriate staff. All schools provided operative techniques classes prior to clinical treatment. These ranged from 20 to 120?hours (mean 43, S.D. 35.24.). Cases completed in these classes varied. For single rooted teeth this ranged from one to six (mean 2.57). For multi-rooted teeth this ranged from one to three (mean 2.14). Most schools had at least one faculty member with a special interest in Endodontology. In seven schools however, teaching was also carried out by staff with no special interest. Five schools did not have a separate endodontic clinic. Five respondents had undergraduate learning in outreach centres. Trauma teaching was mainly carried out by in Departments of Paediatric Dentistry. Conclusions? There is wide variation in the delivery of endodontic curricula in the U.K. Whilst curriculum guidelines are available, there are barriers to delivering these. Consideration should be given to revision of guidelines in light of their evident inapplicability in some areas.

AB  - Background:? Negative trauma-related cognitions have been found to be a significant factor in the maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. Initial studies of such appraisals in trauma-exposed children and adolescents suggest that this is an important line of research in youth, yet empirically validated measures for use with younger populations are lacking. A measure of negative trauma-related cognitions for use with children and adolescents, the Child Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI), is presented. The measure was devised as an age-appropriate version of the adult Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (Foa et al., 1999). Methods:? The CPTCI was developed and validated within a large (n?=?570) sample, comprising community and trauma-exposed samples of children and adolescents aged 6?18?years. Results:? Principal components analysis suggested a two-component structure. These components were labelled ?permanent and disturbing change? and ?fragile person in a scary world?, and were each found to possess good internal consistency, test?retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminative validity. The reliability and validity of these sub-scales was present regardless of whether the measure was completed in the acute phase or several months after a trauma. Scores on these sub-scales did not vary with age. Conclusions:? The CPTCI is a reliable and valid measure that is not specific to the type of trauma exposure, and shows considerable promise as a research and clinical tool. The structure of this measure suggests that appraisals concerning the more abstract consequences of a trauma, as well as physical threat and vulnerability, are pertinent factors in trauma-exposed children and adolescents, even prepubescent children.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changes to bed configuration and patient mix on nurses? workload in a single ward. Design Multi-method case study. Method The study was undertaken in an acute 28-bed ward in a tertiary referral public hospital in Queensland, Australia. Ward-level administrative data were obtained for a 2-year period, 12¬†months before bed configuration changes in October 2015 and 12¬†months after. These data included patient activity (bed occupancy, transfers, length of stay and casemix) and nurse staffing (budgeted and actual staffing levels, employment status and skillmix). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ward nurses (N¬†=¬†17) to explore the impact of the bed configuration changes on their workload. Results Administrative data showed that the bed configuration changes resulted in more complex and dependent patients, increased patient transfers and greater variability in casemix. The interview data found these changes to patient complexity and activity intensified workloads, which were further increased by staffing decisions that resulted in greater reliance on temporary staff. Conclusion Hospitals already possess the data and expert knowledge needed to improve staffing and bed management decisions without the need for additional, costly workload systems. Impact Determining appropriate nurse staffing in light of the complexities and variation of patient needs at the ward level remains a challenge. This study identified increases in patient complexity, dependency, variability and churn that increased workload. Staffing grew but hidden factors associated with temporary staffing and skillmix further intensified nurses? workload. Harnessing existing data and the expertise and experience of nursing unit managers (NUMs) would help staff wards more efficiently and effectively, providing reasonable workloads and appropriate skillmix that can enhance the safety and quality of patient care. To facilitate this, NUMs need access to accurate, timely, data and authority in staffing and bed management decisions.

AB  - Objectives: To review the presenting clinical signs, treatment and survival of dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma and, if possible, to identify useful prognostic indicators. Methods: Medical records of 44 dogs were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical signs, clinical stage, time of diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, Student's t test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Chi-square/Fisher Exact test as appropriate. Results: The most frequent clinical signs were cough (12 dogs, 27%), enlarged lymph nodes (11 dogs, 25%) and dysphagia (11 dogs, 25%). Anorexia and lethargy were less common but were significantly associated with a poor outcome. No matter what treatment modalities were used, survival times were short and median survival time for all the dogs in the study was 179 days. However, there were a small number of long-term survivors. Clinical Significance: Dogs with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma that suffered anorexia and lethargy had shorter survival times than patients without these clinical signs. Although surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seem to increase the median survival time of dogs diagnosed with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, there is no highly effective treatment for canine tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - Abstract The relationship between farming and cancer risk was investigated in an integrated series of case-control studies conducted from 1985 to 1991 in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, north-east Italy. Patients with cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, colon and rectum, pancreas, breast, thyroid gland, kidney and urinary tract, bladder, prostate, soft-tissue sarcomas, Hodgkin's diseases, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myelomas, and controls admitted to hospital for acute, non-neoplastic conditions, were interviewed. For males, a significantly elevated relative risk was seen for oral cavity and pharynx. Farming, however, was associated with a significant protection against cancer of the colon and rectum and bladder. In females, only one significant association emerged, for multiple myeloma. A few significant interactions between cancer risk and year of birth (i.e., before 1930 or 1930 and after) were observed. The risk of cancer of the larynx was significantly elevated in younger male farmers but not in older ones. Our multi-site case-control study confirms that farmers have, for some cancer sites, a distinctive pattern. Excesses of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx in farmers are characteristic of the present study area and, possibly, of similar European rural populations who have in common high levels of alcohol consumption and, at least in the past, unbalanced diets.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims The gold standard procedure after a severe nerve injury is the nerve autograft, yet this technique has drawbacks. In recent years, progress has been made in the development of artificial nerve guides to replace the autograft, but no device has been able to demonstrate superiority. The present study introduces an adaptable foundation design for peripheral nerve regeneration. Methods Silk fibroin was electrospun, creating a tri-layered material with aligned fiber surfaces and a randomly deposited fiber interior. This material was rolled into a micro-channeled conduit, which was then enveloped by a jacket layer of the same tri-layered material. Results The proposed implant design succeeds in incorporating various desirable aspects of synthetic nerve guides, while facilitating the surgical implantation process for medical application. The aligned fiber surfaces of the conduit support axon guidance, while the tri-layered architecture improves its structural integrity compared with a fully aligned fiber material. Moreover, the jacket layer creates a small niche on each end which facilitates surgical implantation. An in vivo study in rats showed that nerve regeneration using this device was comparable to results after direct suture. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study, therefore, advances the development of tissue engineered nerve grafts by creating an optimized guidance conduit design capable of successful nerve regeneration.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma can result in tooth loss despite best efforts at retaining and maintaining compromised teeth (Dent Traumatol, 24, 2008, 379). Upper anterior teeth are more likely to suffer from trauma, and their loss can result in significant aesthetic and functional problems that can be difficult to manage (Endod Dent Traumatol, 9, 1993, 61; Int Dent J 59, 2009, 127). Indeed, teeth of poor prognosis may not only present with compromised structure but trauma may also result in damage to the support tissues. Injury to the periodontium and alveolus can have repercussions on subsequent restorative procedures (Fig. 19). Where teeth are identified as having a hopeless prognosis either soon after the incident or at delayed presentation; planning for eventual tooth loss and replacement can begin at the early stages. With advances in both adhesive and osseointegration technologies, there are now a variety of options for the restoration of edentate spaces subsequent to dental trauma. This review aims to identify key challenges in the provision of tooth replacement in the traumatized dentition and outline contemporary methods in treatment delivery.

AB  - Abstract Objective This exploratory study is the first to examine family-based treatment (FBT) adherence and association to treatment outcome in the context of a large-scale, multi-centre study for the treatment of adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Method One hundred and ninety recorded FBT sessions from 68 adolescents with anorexia nervosa and their families were recruited across multiple sites (N¬†=¬†6). Each site provided 1?4 tapes per family over four treatment time points, and each was independently rated for therapist adherence. Results There were differences in adherence scores within and between sites. ANOVA produced a main effect for site, F(5, 46)¬†=¬†8.6, p¬†<¬†.001, and phase, F(3, 42)¬†=¬†12.7, p¬†<¬†.001, with adherence decreasing in later phases. Adherence was not associated to end of treatment percent ideal body weight after controlling for baseline percent ideal body weight (r¬†=¬†.088, p¬†=¬†.48). Conclusions Results suggest that FBT can be delivered with adherence in phase one of treatment. Adherence was not associated with treatment outcome as determined using percent ideal body weight.

AB  - Abstract Each year, 1.4 million people in the United States are seen in a hospital for a traumatic brain injury. Those with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury frequently go through a course of inpatient neurorehabilitation prior to discharge back into the community. A broad overview of neurorehabilitation is presented, including the standards for admission to inpatient rehabilitation and the members and roles of the neurorehabilitation team. Common medical complications that are managed after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury are reviewed. The spectrum of arousal issues is summarized. The evidence regarding neurorehabilitation is then reviewed. Future studies that are underway to better understand the utility of neurorehabilitation are then discussed.
