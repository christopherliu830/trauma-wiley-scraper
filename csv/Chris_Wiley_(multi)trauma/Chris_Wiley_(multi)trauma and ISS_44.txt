AB  - Systemic adenosine has been shown in earlier case reports and a small placebo-controlled study to reducepathological sensory dysfunction such as tactile allodynia in neuropathic pain. To evaluate this further, the effects of systemic adenosine infusion (50 ?g/kg/min for 60 min) on tactile sensory dysfunction and pain was evaluated in 26 patients suffering peripheral neuropathic pain characterized by dynamic tactile allodynia. A randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled technique was used in this multi-centre study. Psychophysical methods were used to evaluate sensory dysfunction and spontaneous pain. The area of dynamic tactile allodynia was significantly reduced by adenosine compared with placebo (p=0.043), but spon-taneous pain and tactile pain threshold were not significantly improved compared with the effects of placebo treatment. As a secondary outcome, a higher incidence of positive subjective effects on the clinical pain condi-tion, in a few cases with long duration (several months), following adenosine treatment was found when theglobal effect of respective treatment was assessed (p=0.028). The results demonstrate involvement of adenosine receptor-sensitive pain mechanisms in some aspects of the sensory dysfunction often found in neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract ? This study aimed to assess the prevalence of injuries to the permanent incisors in Blumenau, Brazil. In addition, the relationship between dental injuries and socio-economic indicators was examined. A cross-sectional survey was carried out. It included a random sample of 652 children aged 12 years, from both sexes, attending public and private primary schools in Blumenau, Brazil. Multi-stage sampling technique and proportional representation were adopted. A trained and calibrated dentist collected the data through clinical examinations and interviews. Clinical examination included type of damage, treatment provided and needed, size of incisal overjet and type of lip coverage. The response rate was 82.5%. The prevalence of dental injuries was 58.6%. Boys experienced more injuries than girls, 67.2% and 50.2% (P=0.001), respectively. Children from mothers with higher schooling experienced more dental injuries than those from of mothers with lower schooling, 68.2% and 56.6% (P=0.03). Father?s level of education, parents? employment status and family income were not statistically significantly associated with dental injuries (P>0.05). There was a tendency for children with incisal overjet greater than 5 mm (P=0.2) and inadequate lip coverage (P=0.1) to have more dental injuries, but differences were not statistically significant. Nearly all (97.3%) children who had dental injuries needed treatment. In conclusion, the prevalence of dental injuries in Blumenau, Brazil, was very high, treatment of dental injuries was severely neglected, and boys and children from mothers with high schooling were more likely to have experienced dental injuries.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of the recently developed Eye Movement Desensitization (EMD) procedure on traumatic memory symptomatology. Twenty-two subjects suffering from symptoms related to traumatic memories were used in the study. All had been victims of traumatic incidents concerning the Vietnam War, childhood sexual molestation, sexual or physical assault, or emotional abuse. Memories of the traumatic incident were pivotal to the presenting complaints which included intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, sleep disturbances, low self-esteem, and relationship problems. Dependent variables were (1) anxiety level, (2) validity of a positive self-statement/assessment of the traumatic incident, and (3) presenting complaints. These measures were obtained at the initial session and at 1- and 3-month follow-up sessions. The results of the study indicated that a single session of the EMD procedure successfully desensitized the subjects' traumatic memories and dramatically altered their cognitive assessments of the situation, effects that were maintained through the 3-month follow-up check. This therapeutic benefit was accompanied by behavioral shifts which included the alleviation of the subjects' primary presenting complaints.

AB  - Abstract Facilitated attention toward angry stimuli (attention bias) may contribute to anger proneness and temper outbursts exhibited by children with high irritability. However, most studies linking attention bias and irritability rely on behavioral measures with limited precision and no studies have explored these associations in young children. The present study explores irritability-related attention biases toward anger in young children (N = 128; ages 4?7 years) engaged in a dot-probe task with emotional faces, as assessed with event-related brain potential (ERP) indices of early selective attention and multi-method assessment of irritability. Irritability assessed via semi-structured clinical interview predicted larger anterior N1 amplitudes to all faces. In contrast, irritability assessed via a laboratory observation paradigm predicted reduced P1 amplitudes to angry relative to neutral faces. These findings suggest that altered early attentional processing occurs in young children with high irritability; however, the nature of these patterns may vary with methodological features of the irritability assessments. Future investigations using different assessment tools may provide greater clarity regarding the underlying neurocognitive correlates of irritability. Such studies may also contribute to the ongoing debates about how to best define and measure irritability across the developmental spectrum in a manner that is most informative for linkage to neural processes.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the hypothesis that disordered eating in second- and third-generation women would be related to their levels of Holocaust exposure and family dysfunction. Method One hundred eight mother-daughter dyads were ascertained through the daughters, all Israeli college students 18--35 years of age. Mothers and daughters assessed themselves on family function, Holocaust exposure and disordered eating. Results The disordered eating of women of the third generation was partially predicted by their mothers' disordered eating and by their mothers' Holocaust exposure. The second generation reported more maternal over-protection and emotional over-involvement than did the third generation. Contrary to expectation, the third-generation women were more Holocaust exposed than were the second generation. Discussion The nature of Holocaust exposure for second and third generations needs further study and clarification in relation to disordered eating. There is considerable disparity between the results of clinical and qualitative studies which tend to find a strong relationship between Holocaust exposure and psychopathology, and population-based quantitative studies which tend to find a much weaker relationship.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the volume of in-stent neointimal proliferation, assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), at 6-month follow-up after implantation of a coronary Carbofilm?-coated stent (Tecnic Carbostent?, Sorin Biomedica Cardio, Saluggia, Italy) versus a conventional 316 L stent (Rx Multi-Link Penta, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Background: Many trials suggest that stent characteristics and coating could be important determinants of restenosis. Methods: From October 2004 to May 2005, 63 patients were randomized to Tecnic (T, n = 30) or Penta (P, n = 33). The primary end-point was in-stent volume of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) measured by IVUS at 6 months. The secondary end-points included binary restenosis, minimal luminal diameter (MLD), target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Results: There were no significant differences between T and P as to mean age, male gender, clinical status, complexity of the lesion, lesion length, reference vessel diameter before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), MLD pre-PCI, and stent-to-artery ratio. However, MLD poststenting was greater in P group than T group (2.81 ± 0.45 mm vs. 2.49 ± 0.33 mm, P < 0.002). At 6 months, angiographic late lumen loss (0.61 ± 0.51 mm vs. 0.92 ± 0.61 mm, P < 0.043), in-stent obstruction (25.86 ± 16.48% vs. 38.33 ± 19.56%, P = 0.021), and in-stent late loss volume (31.62 ± 29.75 mm3 vs. 57.28 ± 37.16 mm3, P = 0.016) were significantly lower in T group than in P group. Conclusion: Penta stent appears to offer a better deployment and a larger MLD post-PCI than Carbofilm-coated stent. However, a thicker NIH was observed on Penta stent at 6-month follow-up, when compared to Tecnic.

AB  - Aim:? While volumetric and metabolic imaging on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients has been intensively performed, few studies using electroencephalograms (EEG) have been done as yet. The aim of the present study was to investigate abnormalities in functional connectivity of cortical networks in PTSD. Methods:? Non-linear interdependence (NI), a measure of bidirectional, non-linear information transmission between two time series, was used. Resting EEG were recorded for 18 PTSD patients and 18 sex-matched healthy subjects on 16 channels with their eyes closed. Results:? The NI patterns in PTSD patients were hemisphere asymmetric: an increase in NI in the fronto-parieto-temporal regions of the left hemisphere (F7, F3, T3, C3, T5 and P3) and a decrease in the fronto-parieto-occipital regions of the right hemisphere (F4, C4, P4 and O2). The non-linearity of NI in EEG, estimated from the surrogate data method, exhibited an increase in the PTSD patients as compared with that of healthy subjects, particularly in the left hemispheric cortex. Conclusion:? Abnormal functional connectivity in PTSD can be assessed using NI, a measure of multi-channel EEG.

AB  - Abstract Bone grafts are an important part of orthopaedic surgeon's armamentarium. Despite well-established bone-grafting techniques, large bone defects still represent a challenge. Efforts have therefore been made to develop osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic bone-replacement systems. The long-term clinical goal in bone tissue engineering is to reconstruct bony tissue in an anatomically functional three-dimensional morphology. Current bone tissue engineering strategies take into account that bone is known for its ability to regenerate following injury, and for its intrinsic capability to re-establish a complex hierarchical structure during regeneration. Although the tissue engineering of bone for the reconstruction of small to moderate sized bone defects technically feasible, the reconstruction of large defects remains a daunting challenge. The essential steps towards optimized clinical application of tissue-engineered bone are dependent upon recent advances in the area of neovascularization of the engineered construct. Despite these recent advances, however, a gap from bench to bedside remains; this may ultimately be bridged by a closer collaboration between basic scientists and reconstructive surgeons. The aim of this review is to introduce the basic principles of tissue engineering of bone, outline the relevant bone physiology, and discuss the recent concepts for the induction of vascularization in engineered bone tissue. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract A role for CD36 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammation and lipid metabolism has been well-documented. However, little is known about the role of CD36 in cerebral ischemia. The intent of this review is to develop the concept that CD36, whose functions have been implicated in other pathological events, is a prototypic inflammatory receptor that contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The importance of CD36 as a treatment target is indicated by the fact that many treatment strategies that are effective in experimental models of stroke exhibit little or no efficacy in clinical trials. The failure of clinical trials may be due to the use of animal models of stroke that do not reflect traditional risk factors for stroke in humans. The discussion will be focused on two risk factors, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, that modulate CD36 responses. Blocking the expression and function of CD36 by pharmacological or genetic means will provide insight not only toward identifying CD36 as a novel molecular target but also for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat stroke victims. More importantly, coupling clinically relevant conditions with CD36-mediated ischemic injury may provide an appropriate animal model paradigm and develop a scientific understanding that could lead to clinical translational studies involving human subjects.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of the Royal Melbourne Hospital trauma database. Mechanisms analysed were those outlined by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and Advanced Trauma Life Support/Early Management of Severe Trauma prehospital triage guidelines. Results: There were 621 MVA analysed, 253 with major injury (40.7%). Multivariate logistic regression indicated prolonged extrication time (P < 0.0001), cabin intrusion (P = 0.047), high speed (P = 0.003) and ejection from vehicle (P = 0.04) were statistically associated with major injury. Vehicle rollover and fatality in the same vehicle were not statistically associated with major injury. Conclusions: These data suggest that existing guidelines for the prehospital triage of MVA victims, based on mechanistic criteria alone may need revision.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) reconstruction at two different slice thicknesses (1?mm, ?high resolution? vs. 5?mm, ?routine?) with respect to the detection of blebs and bullae (BBs) in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). Methods Thirty-one patients underwent wedge resection of BBs (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral) for PSP from January 2010 to January 2013. Two observers assessed the presence and locations of BBs independently using high-resolution CT (HRCT) and routine CT reconstruction, and compared the sensitivities of each reconstruction method for BB detection using operative findings as a standard reference. In addition, the number of BBs in each CT image set was recorded and inter-observer agreements were evaluated. Results Sensitivity for the detection of BBs was significantly better for HRCT than routine CT (97.0% vs. 63.6% for observer 1 and 94.0% vs. 57.6% for observer 2, respectively, both P-values?<?0.001). On a per-bleb and a per-bulla basis, inter-observer agreements regarding BBs by HRCT were good and very good (k?=?0.66 and 0.94, respectively) and superior to those determined by routine CT (k?=?0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion Different slice thickness reconstructions influence the diagnostic efficacy of MDCT for the detection of BBs in patients with PSP. High-resolution thin slice CT reconstruction was found to have a significantly greater sensitivity than routine thicker slice thickness reconstruction for the detection of BBs.

AB  - Dr John Paul Stapp was not only the ?fastest human on earth;? he was also the quickest to stop. In 1954, Dr Stapp attained a then world record land speed of 632?mph (1020?km/h), going from a stand still to a speed faster than a .45 bullet in 5?s on a rocket sled, and then to a dead stop in 1.4?s, all in the name of safety. Stapp pioneered research on the effects of mechanical forces on living tissues during aircraft crashes. Stapp planned a series of tests on humans and set out to develop a harness to hold them. First, he used a dummy to perfect the harness and after 32 sled runs, he was ready to try it out on a human crash test dummy, himself. By 1954, Stapp had volunteered for 29 deceleration and windblast experiments. On his last run he sustained more than 40?g?s. He suffered fractured ribs and wrist, and retinal haemorrhages which left him temporarily blind. Whilst at the Air Force Stapp also began a car-crash study program to investigate fatalities in auto accidents. From this program, safety recommendations for the car industry were established including fastening seats more securely to the car body, improving bumper design and proving the effectiveness of seat belts. Stapp?s work resulted in the 3-point restraint system of today?s belts which has saved millions of lives. Stapp is also credited with coining one of the most famous phrases in history. One of his assistants, Capt E. Murphy, rigged a harness incorrectly yielding no data on the forces Stapp was subjected to. After discovering what happened, Stapp observed, ?If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way.? It has been called ?Murphy?s Law? ever since.

AB  - Abstract Objective Rumination, the repetitive and recursive rehearsal of cognitive content, has been linked to depression and anxiety in physically well populations, and to post-traumatic growth (PTG) in physical illness populations. Women diagnosed with breast cancer may experience both psychological distress and PTG. As rumination may influence outcomes through distinct pathways, this study investigated the association of intrusion, brooding and instrumental subcomponents of rumination with psychological distress and PTG in the breast cancer context. Methods Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (n?=?185), mean age 55.98 years (SD?=?9.26), completed an online survey including the Multi-dimensional Rumination in Illness Scale, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, Post-traumatic Growth Inventory, Medical Outcomes Social Support Survey, demographic and health-related questions. Results As predicted, regression analyses indicated that brooding was positively related to depression, anxiety and stress, but was also negatively related to the PTG dimensions of new possibilities and spiritual growth. Partially supporting the study hypotheses, intrusion was positively associated with stress and the PTG of relating to others and new possibilities. As hypothesised, instrumental rumination was positively associated with all five dimensions of PTG. Conclusions Rumination is a key consideration in both positive and negative psychological responses of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Associations of specific components of rumination with varying psychological outcomes suggest differential paths by which the specific subcomponents of rumination exert this influence.

AB  - Low back pain patients (n=142) on sick leave for at least 8 weeks were given a multi-modal cognitive behavioural treatment program (MMCBT) that lasted for 4 weeks. Before treatment, all patients were tested with a comprehensive test battery. The outcome at 12-month follow-up was predictable from the pretest, but only when combining medical and psychological data. Patients who returned to work (Returners, 50%) in the MMCBT group were characterised by less pain, more psychological strength, were evaluated by the physiotherapist as having a good prognosis for return to work, and were less educated. Patients who did not return to work (Non-returners) in the MMCBT group felt tense and unfit, felt hopelessness concerning the future, were less physically active, thought their complaints would worsen if they continued working, and reported fewer difficulties driving a car. Returners to work (58%) in the randomised control group (n=81), who received ordinary physical therapy, were characterised by high levels of energy, less subjective health complaints, less exhaustion for a condition test, and did not work in positions giving a constant load on the back. There was no significant differences between number of patients who had returned to work in the MMCBT and the control group. Non-returners in the control group lacked energy, trained less regularly, worked in occupations that gave an almost constant load on the back, and did not expect to be back to work in the course of a couple of weeks. It seems to be important to develop further diagnostic tools to identify those who might benefit from extensive or specific treatments.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a challenging condition for which there is no reference standard for treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide outcome data on the largest study to date evaluating pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for ON and to determine whether any demographic, clinical, or treatment characteristics are associated with success. Design.? Retrospective data analysis was conducted in 102 subjects evaluating the effect of myriad factors on treatment success. Setting.? This study was conducted in academic civilian and military pain treatment centers. Patients.? One hundred and two consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of ON were treated with PRF of the greater and/or lesser occipital nerve. Outcome Measures.? A positive primary outcome was predefined as ≥50% pain relief lasting at least 3 months. The secondary outcome measure was procedural satisfaction. Results.? Fifty-two (51%) patients experienced ≥50% pain relief and satisfaction with treatment lasting at least 3 months. Variables associated with a positive outcome included a traumatic inciting event (65.7% success rate; P?=?0.03), lower diagnostic block volumes (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62?0.82; P?<?0.0001), and employment of multiple rounds of PRF (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.77?4.92; P?<?0.0001). Factors correlating with treatment failure included extension of pain anterior to the scalp apex (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14?0.73; P?=?0.006) and ongoing secondary gain issues (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11?0.33; P?<?0.0001). Conclusion.? PRF may provide intermediate-term benefit in ON to a significant proportion of refractory cases. Careful attention to selection criteria and treatment parameters may further improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - Summary Fusarium circinatum causes pitch canker disease in a wide range of pine trees, including Pinus radiata, with devastating economic consequences. To assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of growth of this pathogen in radiata pine, we examined the process of infection using both real-time PCR to quantify fungal biomass inside the plant host, and confocal microscopy using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain of F. circinatum. Pathogen growth exhibited three distinct phases: an initial exponential increase in fungal biomass, concomitant with pathogen colonization of the cortex and phloem; a slowdown in fungal growth coincident with sporulating hyphae deep within the host; and stabilization of the fungal biomass when the first wilting symptoms appeared. The number of resin ducts in the xylem was found to increase in response to infection and the fungus grew inside both constitutive and traumatic resin ducts. These results indicate that conidiation may contribute to the spatial or temporal dissemination of the pathogen. Moreover, the present findings raise the intriguing possibility that the generation of traumatic resin ducts may be of more benefit to the fungus than to the plant.
