AB  - Abstract??? The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of dental injuries and the influence of determining factors in preschool children from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A cross-sectional survey was carried out through clinical examinations and the application of a questionnaire to the parents of 419 children aged 0 to 5?years attending preschool. The sample was stratified by region, type of institution and age. The eighteen preschools visited were chosen randomly. The prevalence of traumatic injury to primary teeth was 39.1%. Enamel fractures were the most common traumatic injury (49.7%). Boys were 1.62 times more likely to have dental injuries than girls. Children with inadequate lip coverage were 3.75 times more likely to have a traumatic dental injury than those with adequate lip coverage. Children attending state preschools had nearly two times greater chances of having dental trauma than children attending private preschools. It was concluded that the prevalence of dental injuries in preschool children is high in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and constitutes a public health problem.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Several modalities have been advocated to treat traumatic scars, including surgical techniques and laser resurfacing. Recently, a plasma skin regeneration (PSR) system has been investigated. There are no reports on plasma treatment of traumatic scars. The objective of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of plasma treatment of traumatic scars in Asian patients. Materials and Methods Twenty Asian patients with traumatic scars were enrolled in the study. Three treatments were performed at monthly intervals with PSR, using energy settings of 2 to 3J. Patients were seen 1 week after each individual treatment and 3 months after the last treatment. Improvement was determined by patient questionnaires and physician evaluation of digital photographs taken prior to treatment and at 3 months post-treatment. The patients were also evaluated for any side effects from the treatment. Results Nine of 20 patients showed more than 50% improvement. The average pain score on a 10 point scale was 5.8±1.3 SD and all patients tolerated the treatments. The average re-epithelization time was 7.3±2.8 SD days. Temporary and local hyperpigmentation was observed in four patients and this hyperpigmentation disappeared within 3 months. Hypopigmentation and worsening of scarring were not observed. Conclusions Plasma treatment is clinically effective and is associated with minimal complications when used to treat traumatic scars in Asian patients. However, deep traumatic scars are resistant to plasma treatment. Lasers Surg. Med. 41:128?130, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Purpose. This article constitutes the first effort to consider debasement employing the Millon Clinical Multi-axial Inventory III (MCMI-III) in a forensic clinical population and incorporating the recommendations of Van Denburg and Choca (1997). It considers the proposition (Rogers, 1990a) that the pathogenic and criminological models of malingering can be rejected in favour of the adaptional model. Methods. A total of 142 MCMI-III profiles were collected over a 17-month period by a forensic psychology service. Of these, 47 had Debasement scale scores greater than 74. From the remaining 75, a group of 47 were randomly selected for comparative purposes. Of the total sample there were 75 males and 19 females, 68 were out-patients and 26 were in-patients, the latter having been detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, applicable to England and Wales. The two groups were compared on personality variables, offending history, presenting problems and referral circumstances. Results. There is tentative support for Rogers (1990a) in that situational variables appear to have a significant impact on debasement as would be predicted by the adaptional model of malingering. However, this was insufficient evidence to reject the pathogenic and criminological models of malingering. Conclusions. It is suggested that a longitudinal study examining the impact of different stages of the mental health or criminal justice system on debasement, and other validity scales, would illuminate the adaptional model further. Factors that influence the inclination to exaggerate psychopathology and which could be manipulated experimentally are also noted. Some speculation about the possible combined use of Debasement and Histrionic, Narcissistic and Compulsive scales in distinguishing between malingerers is offered.

AB  - Abstract Objective ED chest pain assessments can be challenging, lengthy and contribute to overcrowding. Rapid accurate risk stratification strategies should improve ED length of stay (EDLOS). Emergency, Biochemistry and Cardiology implemented new guidelines using paired (<3?h) multiple cardiac markers to stratify patients. The intervention would reduce chest pain EDLOS. We observed for safety and disposition effects. Methods This is a single-site, prospective observational, before and after intervention study. In December 2009, paired multiple cardiac markers, the second at least 4?h from pain, replaced late troponins. The 4 h rule (ED flow improvement) started in April 2009 (unplanned confounder). Demographics, clinical features, risk assessment and disposition; preferably prospective. Administrative datasets provided disposition outcomes, 4 months pre-/post-intervention. Follow up with partially blinded adjudications assessed for 45?day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Before intervention, consecutive patients were enrolled with mixed prospective/retrospective data. After, sampling occurred whenever prospective data were collected. Results Adjudicated patients were n?=?1029 (14.2% MI, 14.9% MACE), 426 before, 603 after. EDLOS reduced 87?min (416?329; P?<?0.001), similar to triage 2 patients without chest pain. Possibly, avoidable MACE occurred in five of 598 discharges (0.8%, CI 0.3?1.8%) with non-significant decreases (0.5%, CI 0.1?1.8%) post-intervention. Disposition changes included greater observation ward use (3.8?12.3%; P?<?0.001), more discharges (47.4?52.9%, P?=?0.002), less transfers (9.3?6.9%, P?=?0.014) and less late inpatient discharge decisions (15.2?8.7%, P?=?0.001). Conclusion Paired cardiac markers performed adequately for avoidable MACE, and disposition improved significantly. A confounding system change meant the reduced EDLOS (primary outcome) was unable to be associated with the intervention.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury is a worldwide health issue and a significant cause of preventable deaths and disabilities. We aimed to describe population-based data on intensive care treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland over 15 years period. Methods Retrospective review of all intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury at The National University Hospital of Iceland 1999?2013. Data were collected on demographics, mechanism of injury, alcohol consumption, glasgow come scale upon admission, Injury Severity Scoring, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, length of stay, interventions and mortality (defined as glasgow outcome score one). All computerized tomography scans were reviewed for Marshall score classification. Results Intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury were 583. The incidence decreased significantly from 14/100.000/year to 12/100.000/year. Males were 72% and the mean age was 41 year. Majority of patients (42%) had severe traumatic brain injury. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from low heights (36.3%). The mortality was 18.2%. Increasing age, injury severity score, Marshall score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score are all independent risk factors for death. Glasgow coma scale was not an independent prognostic factor for outcome. Conclusions Incidence decreased with a shift in injury mechanism from road traffic accidents to falls and an increased rate of traumatic brain injury in older patients following a fall from standing or low heights. Mortality was higher in older patients falling from low heights than in younger patients suffering multiple injuries in road traffic accidents. Age, injury severity score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and Marshall score are good prognostic factors for outcome. Traumatic brain injury continues to be a considerable problem and the increase in severe traumatic brain injury in the middle age and older age groups after a seemingly innocent accident needs a special attention.

AB  - Aim:? To determine whether intrasubject reproducibility could be observed in the frontal cortex and to assess the mental-health status of subjects in each session. Methods:? We measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration ([oxy-Hb]) during a letter version of the verbal fluency task using near-infrared spectroscopy imaging in twenty healthy adults over two sessions approximately two months apart. Additionally, the mental-health status of the subjects in each session was evaluated according to the State?Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, the Profile of Mood States, and the revised edition of the Neuroticism?Extroversion?Openness Personality Inventory. The association between those scores and [oxy-Hb] changes during the verbal fluency task in each session was investigated. Results:? Performance on the verbal fluency task was about equal across the two sessions, and frontal activation during the task was observed globally in approximately the same region. In the test?retest reliability, acceptable values were shown in both the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of the mean [oxy-Hb] changes and the correlation coefficients of the whole waveforms for each subject in the two sessions. Mental-health status as measured by several questionnaires was within the healthy range, and no correlation with the frontal activation was seen, except in several channels. Conclusion:? The current results suggest that the measurement experience exerted very little influence, except for in a very small region. In addition, the intrasubject reproducibility of frontal activation measured by multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy was well demonstrated in mentally healthy subjects at intervals of two months.

AB  - Abstract Background: Hypothermia is commonly used for organ and tissue preservation in multiple clinical settings, but its role in the management of injured patients remains controversial. There is no doubt that temperature modulation is a powerful tool, and hypothermia has been shown to protect cells during ischaemia and reperfusion, decrease organ damage and improve survival. Yet hypothermia is a double-edged sword: unless carefully managed, its induction can be associated with a number of complications. Methods: A literature review was performed to include important papers that address the impact of hypothermia on key biological processes, and explore the potential therapeutic role of hypothermia in trauma/haemorrhage models. Results: No clinical studies have been conducted to test the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia in injured patients. However, numerous well designed animal studies support this concept. Despite excellent preclinical data, there are several potential barriers to translating hypothermia into clinical practice. Conclusion: Therapeutic hypothermia is a promising life-saving strategy. Appropriate patient selection requires a thorough understanding of how temperature modulation affects various biological mechanisms. Copyright ? 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the incidence and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) in children. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients younger than 18 years of age treated for DFSP over a period of 11 years (2000?2011) in Madrid, Spain. The sample consisted of 13 children. The average annual incidence of DFSP in the pediatric population corresponded to 1.02 cases per million person-years (95% confidence interval 0.55, 1.73). Sites of involvement were diverse, with 15.3% of tumors found in acral locations. The median tumor size was 3.5 cm ? 3 cm and the median time from apparent onset to diagnosis was 36 months. Histopathologic examination revealed conventional (77.0%), pigmented (15.4%), and myxoid (7.6%) variants. The mitotic index was consistently <5 per 10 high-power fields. All lesions were removed using surgical excision. One patient developed a local recurrence because of initial affected margins; none developed metastases. The median duration of clinical follow-up was 70.5 months. This study estimated the average annual incidence rate of DFSP in a population of patients younger than 18 years and reviewed the experience of several hospitals in the management of this tumor.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic dental injuries (TDI) have emerged as a significant global public health concern. One major problem which is developing and yet unreported is the incidence of traumatic dental injuries and soft tissue facial trauma due to the inadvertent falling of smartphones on to the face during their use in rest time. This is related to the weight of the smartphones and their excessive use in all parts of the world. This paper aims to highlight this phenomenon as an emerging aetiological factor for dental and facial injuries in children.

AB  - Aim To determine which factors relate to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, in adult patients who are admitted to critical care units. Background Patient survival rates from critical care areas are improving each year and this has led to interest in the long-term outcomes for patients who have been discharged from such environments. Patients typically require invasive and extensive treatment, which places a stress on physical and mental health. Prevalence estimates of post-traumatic stress disorder in the critical care discharge population vary from 5?63%, yet it remains unclear what the predisposing factors are. Design A systematised review. Method Subject heading and keyword searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect, with 23 articles identified that examined the relationship between critical care and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Results Three main themes were identified; Critical Care Factors, Patient Factors and Experience Factors. Eight key and three potential causative factors were found: younger age, female, previous psychiatric history, length of ICU stay, benzodiazepine sedation, use of stress hormones, delusional memory and traumatic memory, delirium, GCS score of ≤9 on admission & use of mechanical restraint. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress reactions can be strongly related to the development and presence of traumatic and delusional memories. Younger patients may exclude themselves from research to avoid their traumatic thoughts. The role of prior psychiatric illness is unknown. Distinction between ?factual? and ?false? or delusional memory as occurs in the literature maybe unhelpful in understanding trauma reactions. Relevance to clinical practice There are around 38,000 occupied critical care beds each year in England. The scale of the issue is therefore substantial. Risk factors can be isolated from available evidence and provide a rudimentary risk assessment tool to inform practice development in this area.

AB  - Objective: To develop an easy-to-use system for initiating and monitoring enteral and parenteral nutrition support for pediatric inpatients. Design: A multidisciplinary pediatric nutrition support team developed a system to deliver appropriate nutrition support to pediatric inpatients. The package was devised and implemented to improve timeliness, safety, and efficacy of pediatric inpatient nutrition support. The goals included an easy to complete nutrition assessment, a system for early appropriate initiation of nutrition, advancement toward projected goal calories, and monitoring parameters for improved outcomes. Results The comprehensive evidence based package consisted of a four-sided laminated pocket reference with flow charts and tables; concise enteral and parenteral clinical nutrition support pathways; and computerized parenteral nutrition order form, a lab order set, and four one-page information sheets for initiation and advancement of age specific parenteral nutrition. A lecture summarizing this manuscript with handouts and bibliography heightened awareness in each department primarily responsible for the care for pediatric patients (Pediatrics, Family Practice, and Surgery) in our hospital. Conclusion: This package is a comprehensive educational tool for our housestaff. We believe it increases the likelihood of appropriate nutrition assessment and delivery by physicians working with pediatric inpatients at our hospital. It is easily adaptable to fit the needs of any inpatient pediatric nutrition support practice setting.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper describes a multi-national group of political asylum seekers, designated as ?heroes? because they seem to have chosen to resist, when instead they might simply have moved elsewhere. Inspection reveals that they are also chosen by their families to continue a tradition of resistance, which has existed across generations. Once it is their turn, they endure repeated incidents of torture at the hands of oppressors, until finally they are threatened with death. Then, unlike their predecessors, they change course entirely and flee. This action is accomplished with considerable help from their families. Unlike two other resister groups, who tended to remain in the resistor role until they reached victory or death, ?heroic? asylum seekers relinquish the thrill of the fight and take flight, seemingly because of a family mandate to do so, in order to move the family elsewhere. An attempt is made to understand the complex motivation behind these acts from a psychoanalytic perspective. What happens once they arrive here, however, is hard to predict. Brief follow-up data indicates that successful adjustment is not guaranteed and will depend on a set of strengths similar to those required of all immigrants. These include a solid early attachment history, past adult experiences which have been affirming, and considerable local group support. In addition, access to services for the survivors of torture can be useful, although referral to these is (shockingly) happenstance. Thus, despite the peaceful trend their arrival may represent, many forces must come together if its goal is to be achieved. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study explored whether perceived distress from specific stressors during and after torture explain long-term complex post-traumatic symptoms of South Korean torture survivors. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of survivors who had been tortured by the homeland regime from the 1970s to the 2000s. Data from 206 survivors were gathered by key informants using target sampling and snowballing techniques. Project staff designed scales to encompass the specific types of stressors related to torture techniques used in Korea. Frequencies and distress ratings of exposure to torture, post-torture psychosocial stressors and physical damage related to torture were gathered. Psychological symptoms were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean version and subscales of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised-Korean version. Perceived distress from torture stressors was mainly divided into factors representing physical, psychological and deprivation torture by adapting a principal axis factor analysis. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that distress from psychological torture explained post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that distress from deprivation explained PTSD and anxiety after controlling for demographic variables, psychological preparedness, time span since torture and distress from trauma other than torture. Among post-torture stressors, distress from physical damage related to torture and social exclusion were strong indicators of complex symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated risk factors among mothers of children who underwent cancer surgery. Method This cross-sectional, multi-center study included a total of 60 mothers whose children underwent major thoraco-abdominal surgery and were under follow up in the outpatient setting between February 2016 and May 2016. Clinical Data Form, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Clinician-Administered PTSD scale were used. Results Of all participants, 13 (21.7%) were diagnosed with PTSD. These mothers had shorter duration of marriage, longer duration of hospital stay after surgery, and higher HADS scores, compared with the others without PTSD. Thoughts of guilt such as ?I am being punished or tested? were more frequent in mothers with PTSD. Insomnia, irritability, concentration problems, and psychological reactivity were the most common symptoms. Conclusion Post-traumatic stress disorder is a severe disorder that may worsen the daily functioning of mothers and may also have an unfavorable effect on child. It is therefore of utmost importance for clinicians to recognize PTSD and the associated risk factors in order to guide these parents.

AB  - Summary Despite the high levels of comorbidity between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sleep disturbance, little research has examined the predictors of insomnia and nightmares in this population. The current study tested both PTSD-specific (i.e. PTSD symptoms, comorbid anxiety and depression, nightmares and fear of sleep) and insomnia-specific (i.e. dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, insomnia-related safety behaviours and daily stressors) predictors of sleep quality, efficiency and nightmares in a sample of 30 individuals with PTSD. Participants participated in ecological momentary assessment to determine how daily changes in PTSD- and insomnia-related factors lead to changes in sleep. Multi-level modelling analyses indicated that, after accounting for baseline PTSD symptom severity, PTSD-specific factors were associated with insomnia symptoms, but insomnia-specific factors were not. Only daytime PTSD symptoms and fear of sleep predicted nightmares. Both sleep- and PTSD-related factors play a role in maintaining insomnia among those with PTSD, while nightmares seem to be linked more closely with only PTSD-related factors.

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this study was to clarify the actual therapeutic potential of a new transdermal drug delivery system (electromotive drug administration; EMDA) for selected patients with Peyronie's disease. Forty patients with Peyronie's disease were treated by electromotive administration of the 3-drug association orgotein-dexamethasone-lidocaine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial crossover study (study 1). Another 25 patients were treated by EMDA with a combination of verapamil-dexamethasone in an uncontrolled study (study 2). Treatment sessions lasted 20 minutes each and took place 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a current of 3 mA. Patients were assessed before treatment and at 1-and 3-month follow-up examinations. Assessments were based on sexual history, physical examination, and dynamic color Doppler ultrasonographic results. Adverse effects of EMDA were not reported. In study 1, the clinical results observed after treatment proved to be significantly better than those of the placebo. Penile pain disappeared in all patients in both studies. Penile lesion (nodule or plaque) either disappeared or significantly improved in 79% and 90% of patients treated by the 3-and 2-drug association, respectively. The improvement of penile deformity also was notable although it did not match the effect observed on penile nodules or plaque (62% and 88%, in studies 1 and 2, respectively). In both studies, more than 80% of patients reported a definite amelioration of penile rigidity, which paralleled the improvement of penile dynamic color Doppler ultrasonographic parameters. Overall, the combination of verapamil-dexamethasone achieved better clinical results than the 3-drug combination. Electromotive drug administration is a novel technique capable of safely achieving satisfactory results in selected patients with Peyronie's disease not only in terms of improvement of patient's symptoms but also due to the reduced need for penile surgery.
