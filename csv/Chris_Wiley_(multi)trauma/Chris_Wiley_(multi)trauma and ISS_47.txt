AB  - Abstract Aims: This parallel-group, multi-centre, double-blind, randomized-controlled clinical trial was undertaken to compare the clinical outcomes and patient morbidity of coronally advanced flap (CAF) alone or in combination with a connective tissue graft (CAF+CTG) in single Miller Class I and II gingival recessions. Material and Methods: Three centres enrolled 85 patients with one recession each. Surgery was performed elevating a pedicle flap; 42 sites randomly received a graft under the flap. Measurements were taken by blind and calibrated examiners. Outcome measures included recession reduction, complete root coverage (CRC), intra-operative and post-operative morbidity, dentine sensitivity, and side effects. Results: No differences were noted in the intra-operative and post-operative patient-related variables between the two groups. Surgical time was significantly shorter in the CAF group. Recession reduction was not statistically different between the two groups, even though a model showed a tendency towards improved outcomes in sites treated with CAF+CTG (adjusted difference 0.33?mm, 95% CI=?0.06 to 0.72, p=0.1002). Significantly greater probability of CRC was observed after CAF+CTG (adjusted OR=5.09, 95% CI=1.69?17.57, p=0.0033). Dentine hypersensitivity improved in both the groups. Conclusions: Both treatments were effective in providing a significant reduction of the baseline recession and dentine hypersensitivity, with only limited intra-operative and post-operative morbidity and side effects. Adjunctive application of a CTG under a CAF increased the probability of achieving CRC in maxillary Miller Class I and II defects.

AB  - Purpose To introduce novel acquisition and postprocessing approaches for susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) to remove background field inhomogeneity artifacts in both magnitude and phase data. Methods The proposed method acquires three echoes in a three-dimensional gradient echo (GRE) sequence, with a field compensation gradient (z-shim gradient) applied to the third echo. The artifacts in the magnitude data are compensated by signal estimation from all three echoes. The artifacts in phase signals are removed by modeling the background phase distortions using Gaussians. The method was applied in vivo and compared with conventional SWI. Results The method successfully compensates for background field inhomogeneity artifacts in magnitude and phase images, and demonstrated improved SWI images. In particular, vessels in frontal lobe, which were not observed in conventional SWI, were identified in the proposed method. Conclusion The new method improves image quality in SWI by restoring signal in the frontal and temporal regions. Magn Reson Med 72:452?458, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The allotransplantation of vascularized femoral diaphyses and total knee joints is a novel approach in orthopedic surgery. Allogeneic femoral diaphyses were transplanted into three patients suffering from chondrosarcoma or posttraumatic defects. Total knee joints allografts were transplanted in five patients with large bone defects of the knee and loss of the extensor apparatus caused either by major trauma alone or infection after a major trauma. Bone segments and total joints were harvested from multi-organ donors, perfused with UW-solution and transplanted within cold ischemia times of 18?25 h. Patients were immunosuppressed postoperatively primarily with cyclosporine (Cyclosporin A) and azathioprine. Two allografts (1 femur, 1 knee) were lost due to infections. Seven of the eight patients are able to walk with full weight-bearing posttransplant. Two of the patients with transplanted joint allografts subsequently received total knee arthroplasty implantations. Vascularized bone and joint allotransplantation may serve as a last line of defense treatment before considering lower limb amputation. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery 20:375?383 2000

AB  - Abstract? This cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess epi-demiological data concerning dental injuries to the permanent incisors of Syrian children. It included 1087 children aged 9 to 12 years, of both sexes, randomly selected from public and private primary schools in Damascus. The response rate was 100%. The prevalence of traumatic injuries to the permanent incisors rose from 5.2% at the age of 9 years to 11.7% at the age of 12 years (P= 0.007). The difference in prevalence between boys and girls was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The majority (59.8%) of children who had experienced injuries to the permanent incisors reported that they were not taken to the dentist for evaluation or treatment of the damage. Among those children who had experienced traumatic injuries to the teeth 93.1% presented with untreated damage. Because some injuries were minor, such as small enamel fractures, the proportion of children who needed treatment was 63.2%. There was a tendency for children with an incisal overjet greater than 5 mm to have experienced dental injuries (P=0.06). Children with inadequate lip coverage were more likely to have experienced dental injuries than those with adequate lip coverage (P=0.000). The most common reported cause of injuries to the permanent incisors was violence (42.5%), followed by traffic accidents (24.1%), collisions with people or inanimate objects (16.0%) and falls (9.1%). In conclusion, traumatic dental injury may pose a serious dental public health problem.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the utility of multimodal quantitative MRI (qMRI) and atlas-based methods to identify characteristics of lesion-driven injury and neurodegeneration in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Materials and Methods: This work is health insurance portability and accountability act compliant. High resolution T1-weighted, dual echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion tensor MRI images were prospectively acquired on 68 RRMS patients (range, 25?58 years) and 68 age-matched controls. The data were analyzed using standardized human brain atlas-based tissue segmentation procedures to obtain regional volumes and their corresponding T2 relaxation times and DTI maps. Results: Group-averaged brain atlas-based qMRI maps of T2, fractional anisotropy and diffusivities are visually presented and compared between controls and RRMS. The analysis shows a widespread injury in RRMS. Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) was substantial in RRMS. The qMRI attributes of the neocortex in combination with the CC such as T2 and diffusivities were elevated and correlated with disability. Conclusion: Using a standardized multimodal qMRI acquisition and analyses that accounted for lesion distribution we demonstrate that cerebral pathology is widespread in RRMS. Our analysis of CC and neocortex qMRI metrics in relation to disability points to a neurodegenerative injury component that is independent from lesions. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3 years (range: 54?75 years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma n = 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) n = 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma n = 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5 years (range: 51?69 years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

AB  - Hip fractures in the elderly are a serious problem for the health service due to the high rate of complications. One of these complications is pressure ulcers that, according to the literature, occur in 8.8% to 55% of patients and mainly arise in the sacral area. The present randomised controlled trial tests whether applying a new innovative multi-layer polyurethane foam dressing (ALLEVYN LIFE?), reduces the onset of pressure ulcers in the sacral area. From March to December 2016, 359 fragility hip fracture patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 182 in the control group and 177 in the experimental group. Pressure ulcers occurred overall in 36 patients (10%): 8 patients (4.5%) in the experimental group compared to 28 (15.4%) in the control group: P = 0.001, relative risk 0.29 (95% CI 0.14-0.61) with NNT of 9 (95% CI 6-21). In the experimental group the onset of pressure ulcers occurred on average on the 6th day compared to the 4th day in the control group (HR 4.4). Using polyurethane foam is effective at reducing the rate of pressure ulcers in the sacrum in elderly patients with hip fracture. The adhesiveness of this device also enables costs to be kept down.

AB  - Abstract:? A vast literature extolling the benefits of melatonin has accumulated during the past four decades. Melatonin was previously considered of importance to seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythmicity. Currently, it appears to be a versatile anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative agent, a molecule with immunomodulatory actions and profound oncostatic activity, and also to play a role as a potent neuroprotectant. Nowadays, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement with differential availability as an over-the-counter aid in different countries. There is a widespread agreement that melatonin is nontoxic and safe considering its frequent, long-term usage by humans at both physiological and pharmacological doses with no reported side effects. Endeavors toward a designated drug status for melatonin may be enormously rewarding in clinics for treatment of several forms of neurotrauma where effective pharmacological intervention has not yet been attained. This mini review consolidates the data regarding the efficacy of melatonin as an unique neuroprotective agent in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Well-documented actions of melatonin in combating traumatic CNS damage are compiled from various clinical and experimental studies. Research on traumatic brain injury and ischemia/reperfusion are briefly outlined here as they have been recently reviewed elsewhere, whereas the studies on different animal models of the experimental spinal cord injury have been extensively covered in this mini review for the first time.

AB  - Amongst all dental traumas in the permanent dentition, crown fractures account for the largest majority. This review paper will discuss the different levels of fracture, from the most superficial ones only affecting the enamel to the deepest ones with pulp exposure, including crown?root fractures. It will focus on the pulp by evaluating the pulp response to trauma and to the subsequent treatment. An attempt to correlate epidemiological, experimental, histopathological, and clinical studies will be made, so that the clinician can better understand the underlying processes which evolve towards pulp healing or pulp necrosis, thus success or failure. If handled properly, prognosis of the pulp following a traumatic crown fracture is good. In the permanent dentition, success rate ranges between 72% and 100%, the highest success rate corresponding to superficial fractures and the lowest success rate to fractures with pulp exposure.

Materials and Methods: Eleven patients were randomly scanned by a multi-slice CT (CT group) or a CBCT scanner (CBCT group). A total of 108 implants were planned on the software and placed using SLA guides. A new CT or CBCT scan was obtained and merged with the planning data to identify the deviations between the planned and placed implants. Results were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test and multiple regressions (p?<?.05). Results: Mean angular and linear deviations in the CT group were 3.30° (SD 0.36), and 0.75 (SD 0.32) and 0.80?mm (SD 0.35) at the implant shoulder and tip, respectively. In the CBCT group, mean angular and linear deviations were 3.47° (SD 0.37), and 0.81 (SD 0.32) and 0.87?mm (SD 0.32) at the implant shoulder and tip, respectively. No statistically significant differences were detected between the CT and CBCT groups (p?=?.169 and p?=?.551, p?=?.113 for angular and linear deviations, respectively). Conclusions: Implant placement via CT- or CBCT-derived mucosa-supported SLA guides yielded similar deviation values. Results should be confirmed on alternative CBCT scanners.

AB  - Abstract Advanced therapies such as bioengineered skin substitutes (BSS) and dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) have been shown to promote healing of chronic diabetic ulcers. An interim analysis of data from 60 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel group, multi-centre clinical trial showed that dHACM (EpiFix?, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, GA) is superior to standard wound care (SWC) and BSS (Apligraf?, Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA) in achieving complete wound closure within 4?6 weeks. Rates and time to closure at a longer time interval and factors influencing outcomes remained unassessed; therefore, the study was continued in order to achieve at least 100 patients. With the larger cohort, we compare clinical outcomes at 12 weeks in 100 patients with chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers treated with weekly applications of Apligraf (n = 33), EpiFix (n = 32) or SWC (n = 35) with collagen-alginate dressing as controls. A Cox regression was performed to analyse the time to heal within 12 weeks, adjusting for all significant covariates. A Kaplan?Meier analysis was conducted to compare time-to-heal within 12 weeks for the three treatment groups. Clinical characteristics were well matched across study groups. The proportion of wounds achieving complete closure within the 12-week study period were 73% (24/33), 97% (31/32), and 51% (18/35) for Apligraf, EpiFix and SWC, respectively (adjusted P = 0·00019). Subjects treated with EpiFix had a very significant higher probability of their wounds healing [hazard ratio (HR: 5·66; adjusted P: 1·3 x 10?7] compared to SWC alone. No difference in probability of healing was observed for the Apligraf and SWC groups. Patients treated with Apligraf were less likely to heal than those treated with EpiFix [HR: 0·30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·17?0·54; unadjusted P: 5·8 x 10?5]. Increased wound size and presence of hypertension were significant factors that influenced healing. Mean time-to-heal within 12 weeks was 47·9 days (95% CI: 38·2?57·7) with Apligraf, 23·6 days (95% CI: 17·0?30·2) with EpiFix group and 57·4 days (95%CI: 48·2?66·6) with the SWC alone group (adjusted P = 3·2 x 10?7). Median number of grafts used per healed wound were six (range 1?13) and 2·5 (range 1?12) for the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, respectively. Median graft cost was $8918 (range $1,486?19,323) per healed wound for the Apligraf group and $1,517 (range $434?25,710) per healed wound in the EpiFix group (P?<?0·0001). These results provide further evidence of the clinical and resource utilisation superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic wounds.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The American Heart Association recommends automated external defibrillator placement in public areas with a high probability (>1) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurring in 5 years. We aimed to determine the incidence rate of OHCA for different location categories in Singapore. Methods Cardiac arrest incidence was obtained from a national registry. Denominators for the actual number of sites per location category were obtained from public accessible sources, government officers and purchased statistics. Analysis was performed and expressed in terms of the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results From 1 October 2001 to 14 October 2004, 2254 non-trauma OHCA cases were included. Mean age for arrests was 62.2 years, with 67.5% men. The location category with the highest incidence of cardiac arrests per site per 5 years was Port/Airport/Immigration Checkpoints (5.24 CI [3.66?7.20]). Top individual site with high average incidence of cardiac arrests per 5 years was Changi Airport (25.0 CI [16.18?36.90]). Seventy-one per cent of arrests occurred in residential areas. The postal sector with the highest average incidence per 100?000 population was Bedok Reservoir (54.89), whereas that with the highest population density was Bukit Merah/Alexandra with 348.14 population per 100 km2. Conclusion In this study, we found the categories and individual sites that clearly fulfilled the American Heart Association criteria of at least 1 OHCA per site per 5 years. This study provides a model of how cardiac arrest registry data can be used to guide local health policy on automated external defibrillator deployment.

AB  - Abstract Adaptive behavior impairments have been reported in children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) but are not typically found following mild TBI. It is possible that mild TBI induces subtle changes in adaptive functioning that are not captured in conventional group comparisons. This study aimed to explore time course changes in adaptive functioning following early mild TBI. Parents of 63 children with mild TBI and 53 children with orthopedic injuries aged between 1.5 and 5 years at the time of injury completed the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II at three time points: retrospectively to assess pre-injury functioning, then at 6 and 18 months post-injury. Developmental trajectories of adaptive functioning domains (practical, conceptual, and social) reported by parents were modeled using linear mixed-model analyses. Findings suggest that mild TBI may disrupt the expected developmental progression of children's social adaptive behavior, but does not appear to alter practical and conceptual domains.

AB  - Summary Spinal clearance in unconscious children following traumatic brain injury is an area of controversy. The risk of significant injury in this high-risk group needs to be balanced against that of prolonged spinal immobilization and all its implications. No national or international guideline exists to aid clinicians faced with such a scenario. This article reviews traumatic spinal injury in children looking at prevalence, risk factors, anatomical considerations, and radiological investigation. Spinal immobilization is discussed along with the use of appropriate and targeted radiological investigations to aid clearance.

AB  - The study investigated the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in child and adolescent survivors in Turkey three years after the 1999 Marmara Earthquake, with consideration of the severity of exposure and the survivors' gender and age. A representative sample of 293 young earthquake survivors (152 female and 141 male between the ages of 8 and 15) participated in the study. Participants' scores on the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for Children indicated that 31.4% reported moderate, 24.2% reported severe, and 3.8% reported very severe traumatic stress reactions. Analysis of the Revised Impact of Events Scale for Children scores revealed that 56% reported severe PTSD symptoms. While severity of exposure and gender were significantly associated with severity of PTSD symptoms, age was not related to PTSD symptoms. The results indicated a high need for addressing the mental health problems of the child and adolescent trauma survivors in Turkey.
