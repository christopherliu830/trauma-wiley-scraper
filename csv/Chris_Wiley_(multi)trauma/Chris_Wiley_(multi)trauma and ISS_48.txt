AB  - Objective The current study investigated the role of cognitive, affective, and behavioural information in the prediction of overall attitudes towards asylum seekers. Method A sample of 98 Australian adults participated in an online self-report questionnaire where participants generated their cognitive, affective, and behavioural factors towards asylum seekers and then rated those factors on a continuum from ?positive? to ?negative?. Results Multiple regression analysis confirmed the primary role of cognitive, then affective, factors in predicting attitudes towards asylum seekers. Cognitive information accounted for a moderate, significant 31.92% of the variance in overall attitudes towards asylum seekers. The unique variance contributed by affective information accounted for a small but significant 3.46% of the variance in overall attitudes; the unique variance contributed by behavioural information was not significant. Conclusions The results provide a holistic theoretical basis for the assertion that community attitudes towards asylum seekers are based primarily on cognitive evaluations of the minority group. These findings have implications for changing community attitudes towards people seeking asylum in Australia.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current recommendations for the care of the seriously injured polytraumatized small animal patient, including team organization and facility readiness; scene assessment and care; transport; and hospital assessment and care. Data sources: Original research articles, scientific reviews, book chapters, and clinical experience. Human data synthesis: The care of the seriously injured patient is demanding and requires adequate preparation, rapid access to organized resources and equipment, and skilled personnel. Second in urgency only to stabilization of the airway and breathing is shock. In many, surgical intervention to provide improved and continued stability is required. Evidence is provided by data published comparing survival for humans with high injury scores being cared for at level I trauma centers compared with small rural hospitals. Personal experience as a member of an emergency medical team in the care of multiple injured human patients in both level I trauma centers and small hospitals is also used in this review. Veterinary data synthesis: Publications reporting large clinical series of seriously injured dogs and cats are minimal. Experimental animal models of shock caused by blood loss and the study of various organ injuries and their management are numerous. These and 35 years of the author's experience in managing severely injured dogs and cats (estimated to be >750) is also used in this review for generation of guidelines. Conclusions: Guidelines for care of severe multiple injury patients are presented and are recommended to be used in clinical veterinary medical practice to improve outcome.

AB  - Introduction: A growing number of surgeons perform lymph node transfers for the treatment of lymphedema. When harvesting a vascularized lymph node groin flap (VGLNF) one of the major concerns is the potential risk of iatrogenic lymphedema of the donor-site. This article helps understanding of the lymph node distribution of the groin in order to minimize this risk. Materials and Methods: Fifty consecutive patients undergoing abdominal mapping by multi-detector CT scanner were included and 100 groins analyzed. The groin was divided in three zones (of which zone II is the safe zone) and lymph nodes were counted and mapped with their distances to anatomic landmarks. Further node units were plotted and counted. Results: The average age was 48 years. A mean number of nodes of 6.5/groin was found. In zone II, which is our zone of interest a mean of 3.1 nodes were counted with a mean size of 7.8?mm. In three patients no nodes were found in zone II. In five patients nodes were seen in zone II but were not sufficient in size or number to be considered a lymph node unit. On average the lymph node unit in zone II was found to be 48.3?mm from the pubic tubercle when projected on a line from the pubic tubercle to the anterior superior iliac spine, 16.0?mm caudal to this line, and 20.4?mm above the groin crease. On average the lymph node unit was a mean of 41.7?mm lateral to the SCIV-SIEV confluence. Conclusion: This study provides increased understanding of the lymphatic anatomy in zone II of the groin flap and suggests a refined technique for designing the VGLNF. As with any flap there is a degree of individual patient variability. However, having information on the most common anatomy and flap design is of great value.

AB  - Each year, exposure to violent trauma takes its toll on the development of millions of children. When their trauma goes unaddressed, children are at greater risk for school failure; anxiety and depression and other post-traumatic disorders; alcohol and drug abuse, and, later in life, engaging in violence similar to that to which they were originally exposed. In spite of the serious psychiatric/developmental sequelae of violence exposure, the majority of severely and chronically traumatized children and youth are not found in mental health clinics. Instead, they typically are seen as the ?trouble-children? in schools or emerge in the child protective, law enforcement, substance abuse treatment, and criminal justice systems, where the root of their problems in exposure to violence and abuse is typically not identified or addressed. Usually, providers in all of these diverse service systems have not been sufficiently trained to know and identify the traumatic origins of the children's presenting difficulties and are not sufficiently equipped to assist with their remediation. This multiplicity of traumatic manifestations outside the mental health setting leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are dealing with a supra-clinical problem that can only be resolved by going beyond the child's individual clinical needs to enlist a range of coordinated services for the child and the family. This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of violent traumatization and will (a) describe the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the opportunities for, as well as the barriers to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.

AB  - Summary Background The GlideScope Cobalt Video laryngoscope is being used more often in children with challenging laryngoscopy. There are, however, no pediatric trials comparing it to flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the current accepted gold standard. This preliminary manikin study compares the first-attempt intubation success of the GlideScope Cobalt video laryngoscope to the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope when performed by attending pediatric anesthesiologists at two major pediatric centers. Methods This prospective randomized, crossover study evaluated 120 attempts (60 with each study device) to intubate the AirSim Pierre Robin manikin (PRM) with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and video laryngoscopy (VL). Attending pediatric anesthesiologists from two quaternary pediatric centers were eligible to participate. Each attending anesthesiologist randomly performed a single tracheal intubation attempt with one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. The primary outcome was the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation. Blinding was not feasible. We hypothesized that first-attempt success would be higher with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Results Thirty anesthesiologists from each center were randomized to use one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. We analyzed all participants' data. There was no overall difference in first-attempt success between VL and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (88.3% vs 85% respectively, P = 0.59). There were significant institutional differences in first-attempt success using VL (76.7% vs 100%). Conclusions There was no difference in first-attempt success of tracheal intubation using VL vs fiberoptic bronchoscopy when performed by attending anesthesiologists at two large pediatric centers. However, institutional differences exist in success rates with VL across the two centers. Results from single-center device evaluations should be verified by multi-center evaluations. A significant proportion of attending anesthesiologists lack experience with advanced airway devices; targeted education may enhance intubation success and patient safety.

AB  - Aims To verify the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravesical administration of 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride compared to its oral administration for treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in a randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, multi-center trial in 35 adult patients. Methods NDO was confirmed within the previous 24 months by urodynamic studies (UDS). Group 1 (n?=?18) received 10?ml 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride intravesically three times per day and group 2 (n?=?17) 5?mg oxybutynin hydrochloride orally three times per day for a period of 28 days. Primary efficacy criterion was the change in the maximum bladder capacity between the beginning of the study and after 4 weeks as assessed by UDS. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) were collected and an evaluation of anticholinergic effects was conducted. Results The increase in maximum bladder capacity was 117?ml with intravesical application (P?=?0.0002) versus 18?ml with the oral application (P?=?0.51). The difference was statistically significant (P?=?0.0086). ADR were reported by 10 (55.6%) of patients with intravesical administration, and by 14 (82.4%) of patients with oral administration. Significant differences in favor of the intravesical application were observed in ADR affecting vision (1/10 vs. 9/14), gastrointestinal tract (8/10 vs. 14/14), nervous system (2/10 vs. 8/14), and skin and subcutis (1/10 vs. 6/14). No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Conclusions This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of intravesical 0.1% oxybutynin hydrochloride in the treatment of NDO with respect to the increase in maximum bladder capacity. Neurourol.

AB  - Background:? The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the haemodynamic profile of patients with extensive burns during the early fluid resuscitation phase, (2) evaluate myocardial performance by invasive monitoring and echocardiography and (3) analyze the relations between serum cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and natriuretic peptide (ANP, BNP) concentrations and myocardial function in these patients. Methods:? Prospective, clinical study in a tertiary care burn centre. Invasive haemodynamic measurements including a pulmonary artery catheter, echocardiography, blood samples for cytokine and atriopeptide analyses. The follow-up time was up to 72?h postinjury. Results:? According to echocardiography, patients were hypovolaemic despite aggressive (median 7,9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 3.3?11.7) fluid resuscitation and adequate urine output (median 0.9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 0.46?1.35) during the first day postinjury. There were no consistent findings of hyperlactatemia, metabolic acidosis or low mixed venous oxygen saturations. Daily highest and lowest values of cardiac index and stroke volume index increased and the lowest and highest values of systemic vascular resistance decreased. Cardiac performance (stroke volume index) improved during the study period even though there were no initial signs of myocardial depression in echocardiography. Three patients received a dobutamine infusion based on clinical judgement. There was no consistent association between haemodynamic changes and plasma cytokine concentrations. Conclusion:? Persisting hypovolaemia is evident in the resuscitation phase of extensive burns despite aggressive fluid therapy and the lack of classic signs of hypoperfusion. Cardiac performance improves during the first days after extensive burn injury without association with plasma cytokine profile.

AB  - Summary The physiological derangements that are frequently witnessed in the heartbeating brainstem-dead multiorgan donor are a result of both the adverse somatic consequences of treatment strategies for acute catastrophic brain injury as well as the well-described and specific consequences of brainstem ischaemia. The latter include diabetes insipidus, hypothermia, cardiovascular instability, neurogenic pulmonary oedema and systemic inflammation, and together they jeopardise the donation potential of the brainstem-dead donor. Donor management protocols are designed to help clinical staff detect and reverse these various derangements and require a continuation, and on occasion escalation, of physiological monitoring and support on the intensive-care unit. By increasing the number and quality of organs that are available for transplantation, physiological optimisation more completely fulfils the altruistic gift being made by the donor and their family, and should therefore be seen as an important component of the donor's end of life care.

AB  - Abstract Psychotherapy with the elderly has tended to be restricted to family or behavioural paradigms with some contribution from cognitive approaches, but at least until recently, very little input from psychodynamic therapy. The reasons for this are discussed and include both patient and therapist factors. Freud himself was pessimistic regarding the prospects of working with the elderly, a viewpoint he changed as he aged. As the discipline of old age psychiatry also matures there may be increasing scope for collaboration between the mental health of the elderly teams and psychodynamically orientated therapists. We describe here one model of such collaboration, a weekly case discussion seminar, conducted in an acute admission old age psychiatry in-patient unit. The role of the seminar in discussing difficult cases will be described and a case will be discussed to illustrate the work. Finally, recommendations for broadening the scope of the work are advanced. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To determine whether pre- and post-operative administration of intravenous ibuprofen (IV-ibuprofen) can significantly decrease pain and morphine use when compared with placebo in adult orthopedic surgical patients. Design.? This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Setting.? This study was completed at eight hospitals; six in the United States and two in South Africa. Patients.? A total of 185 adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Interventions.? Patients were randomized to receive either 800?mg IV-ibuprofen or placebo every 6 hours, with the first dose administered pre-operatively. Additionally, all patients had access to intravenous morphine for rescue. Outcome Measures.? Efficacy of IV-ibuprofen was demonstrated by measuring the patient's self assessment of pain using a visual analog scale (VAS; assessed with movement and at rest) and a verbal response scale (VRS). Morphine consumption during the post-operative period was also assessed. Results.? In the immediate post-operative period, there was a 25.8% reduction in mean area under the curve-VAS assessed with movement (AUC-VASM) in patients receiving IV-ibuprofen (P?<?0.001); a 31.8% reduction in mean AUC-VAS assessed at rest (AUC-VASR; P?<?0.001) and a 20.2% reduction in mean VRS (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Patients receiving IV-ibuprofen used 30.9% less morphine (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Similar treatment emergent adverse events occurred in both study groups and there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events. Conclusion.? Pre- and post-operative administration of IV-ibuprofen significantly reduced both pain and morphine use in orthopedic surgery patients in this prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To determine injuries significantly associated with traumatic thoracic spine (T-spine) fractures Methods:? This was a case?control study undertaken in an adult trauma centre. Cases were patients admitted with a traumatic T-spine fracture between January 1999 and August 2007. Each case had two controls matched for sex, age (±5?years) and injury severity classification (major/minor). Data were collected from patient medical records and the trauma service database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine injuries significantly associated with T-spine fracture. Results:? Two hundred and sixty-one cases and 512 controls were enrolled. In both groups, mean age was 41?years and 70% of patients were male. Univariate analysis revealed a range of injuries that were significantly more common among the cases, especially cervical and lumbar spine injuries, sternal/scapular/clavicular/rib fractures, pneumo/haemothorax and pulmonary contusions (P < 0.01). Skull fractures and lower limb injuries were significantly more common among the controls (P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis revealed that only cervical and lumbar spine injuries and rib fractures were positively associated with T-spine fracture (P < 0.001). Skull fractures and lower limb injuries were negatively associated with T-spine injury (P < 0.001). Conclusion:? Cervical and lumbar spine injuries and rib fractures are significantly associated with T-spine fracture. The presence of these injuries should raise suspicion of concomitant T-spine injury.

Abstract:? Introduction:? Recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand IgG fusion protein, rPSGL-Ig (YSPSL), a fusion protein of human P-selectin ligand and IgG1-Fc, blocks leukocyte adhesion and protects against ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in animal models. Patients and Methods:? This randomized 15-center, double-blind, 59-patient Ph2a study assessed YSPSL?s safety in recipients of deceased-donor kidney allografts and its potential efficacy in improving early graft function. Two doses and two dosing modalities were evaluated. Results:? No drug-specific toxicities or increased adverse event rates were noted. Two YSPSL-treated patients died of causes determined as unrelated to study drug. YSPSL did not reduce the incidence of dialysis within the first week post-transplant (41% in treated vs. 20% in placebo patients). Renal function endpoints scored at post-operative days 1 & 2 were also not impacted by YSPSL. However, at day 5, the fraction of patients with serum creatinine above 6?mg/dL was lower in the YSPSL vs. placebo group (26% vs. 55%, p?=?0.043). Large variations in the dialysis-delayed graft function (DGF) rates were observed between centers, independently of treatment assignment, indicating subjectivity of this endpoint. Conclusion:? In this first Ph2a study in kidney transplantation, YSPSL was safe but did not impact the dialysis-DGF rate. Further studies with more objective efficacy endpoints are required to define the impact of YSPSL on early renal allograft function.

AB  - Purpose? The comprehensive describtion of the epidemiology of pelvic ring fractures (PRF) including high-energy PRF, low-energy PRF and those who die during the prehospital phase (pre-H). Methods? 12-month prospective population based study was performed in a trauma system with one Level-1 trauma centre and seven referring hospitals (population: 0.6 million). Data were collected on all PRF from the trauma system including high-energy, low energy fractures and pre-H deaths with PRF. Patient demographics, injury severity score (ISS), mortality (%) and PRF-related mortality were recorded prospectively. All high-energy deaths had autopsy at the same forensic pathology department. Data presented as percentages (%) or mean +/? SEM. Results? During the 12-month period 138 patients suffered PRF (45% male, 59+/?2 years, ISS 20+/?2, 21% mortality and 8% PRF-related mortality). Sixty-four % of the low-energy and 92% of the high-energy patients were transferred directly to the trauma center. There were 57 high-energy (71% male, 41+/?3 years, ISS 23+/?3, 14% mortality, 7% PRF-related mortality) 63 low-energy (20% male, 81+/?1 years, ISS 6+/?1, 5% mortality, 2% PRF-related mortality) and 18 pre-H died patients with PRF (47% male, 41+/?6 years, ISS 61+/?4, 100% mortality, 33% PRF-related mortality). PRF-related mortality was always due to bleeding. Conclusions? The majority of PRF-related mortality occurs pre-H. Half of the multiple-injured high-energy PRF patients still die because of the pelvic bleeding. Further preventive measures and optimization of the care of PRF patients is required. Trauma centre admission of 2/3 of the low-energy PRF is a significant load and should be further investigated in an inclusive trauma system.

AB  - Abstract Objectives One of the hallmarks of contemporary osteoporosis and bone loss is dramatically higher prevalence of loss and fragility in females post-menopause. In contrast, bioarchaeological studies of bone loss have found a greater diversity of age- and sex-related patterns of bone loss in past populations. We argue that the differing findings may relate to the fact that most studies use only a single methodology to quantify bone loss and do not account for the heterogeneity and complexity of bone maintenance across the skeleton and over the life course. Methods We test the hypothesis that bone mass and maintenance in trabecular bone sites versus cortical bone sites will show differing patterns of age-related bone loss, with cortical bone sites showing sex difference in bone loss that are similar to contemporary Western populations, and trabecular bone loss at earlier ages. We investigated this hypothesis in the Imperial Roman population of Velia using three methods: radiogrammetry of the second metacarpal (N?=?71), bone histology of ribs (N?=?70), and computerized tomography of trabecular bone architecture (N?=?47). All three methods were used to explore sex and age differences in patterns of bone loss. Results The suite of methods utilized reveal differences in the timing of bone loss with age, but all methods found no statistically significant differences in age-related bone loss. Discussion We argue that a multi-method approach reduces the influence of confounding factors by building a reconstruction of bone turnover over the life cycle that a limited single-method project cannot provide. The implications of using multiple methods beyond studies of bone loss are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of the present study was to report the clinicopathologic, radiographic and immunohistochemical features of five South American cases of intraosseous xanthomas of the mandible and to compare them to those detected in a literature review. Methods Clinical data were collected from the records of three Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology services in South America and compared with those compiled from a literature review based on a search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus). All cases were evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for CD68 and S-100. Results The series comprised four females (80%) and one male (20%) with a mean age of 23.3 ± 10.9 years (range: 13-45 years). In four cases, there was involvement of the posterior region of the mandible (80%). The lesions presented radiographically as unilocular (60%) radiolucencies with punched-out margin (80%). All cases predominantly consisted of CD68-positive and S-100-negative xanthomatous cells. No recurrences were observed after curettage, with a median follow-up of 27 months. Conclusion Intraosseous xanthoma of the jaws is a rare benign disorder. We report here five additional cases affecting the mandible, for a total of 36 cases of the jaws reported in the literature. Overall, this lesion has predilection for posterior sites of the mandible of asymptomatic young adults.

AB  - Severe Traumatic brain injury (sTBI) often instigates widespread long-lasting disability and is accompanied by extensive rehabilitation. Unsurprisingly, sTBI also holds malignant consequences for patients? close relatives. The burden caused by the injury and its severity explains some of the ramifications for the relatives. Additionally, some findings demonstrate that patients with sTBI and their relatives develop posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, although the link between PTS symptoms and physical and mental health is well-documented in literature, the effect of PTS symptoms on relatives of patients with sTBI has barely been examined. This study examines the influence of PTS symptoms of patients with sTBI and their relatives on the physical and mental health and functioning of the relatives. Patients who sustained a severe sTBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale of the head region > 3) and close relatives were included in a multi-center, prospective cohort study (TRAST-MI). One-hundred patients and their relatives were assessed at 2, 6, and 12 months post injury. Outcome variables included health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as emotional, cognitive, interpersonal, and total functioning (PCRS). Relatives? physical health was predicted by relatives? PTS symptoms (Slope=?1.76; p = .043), and mental health was predicted by both patients? (Slope=?2.77; p = .034) and relatives? (Slope=?6.59; p < .001) PTS symptoms. Functioning level was only predicted by patients? PTS symptoms (Slope=?.25; p<.001). The findings emphasize that TBI should be considered a comprehensive traumatic experience reaching further than mere physical damage to the brain and its direct consequences, affecting the injured individual and close relatives.

AB  - Aims The SUCCESS trial is a phase III study of the Vesair? balloon in the United States for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The purpose of this manuscript is to present the 3 month primary efficacy and tolerability outcome data. Methods The SUCCESS trial is a multi-center, prospective, single blind, randomized, sham-controlled study. Subjects were randomized on a 2.33:1 basis to either Vesair balloon placement or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of both a >50% reduction from baseline on 1?h provocative pad weight test and a ≥10-point improvement in symptoms on the Incontinence Quality of Life Survey (I-QOL) questionnaire assessed at the 3 month study visit. Results A total of 221 subjects were randomized, including 157 treatment arm subjects and 64 controls. The 3 month composite primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in 42.1% of treatment group subjects compared with 28.1% of controls on intention-to-treat analysis (p?=?0.046). Treatment arm subjects were significantly more likely to report at least a 50% reduction in incontinence frequency on 7-day voiding diary (55.2% vs 32.3%, P?=?0.002, ITT) and more commonly reported their incontinence was improved on Patient Global Impression of Improvement in Incontinence (PGI-I) at 3 months compared with controls (58.0% vs 37.7%, P?=?0.007, ITT). No device- or procedure-related serious adverse events nor unanticipated adverse events were reported and no cases of urinary retention were observed. All adverse events fully resolved following balloon removal. Conclusions In this phase three trial, the Vesair intravesical balloon achieved 3 month primary and secondary endpoints both objectively and subjectively.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effects of warm-supplementing kidney yang (WSKY) capsule added on risperidone on cognition in chronic schizophrenic patients. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial was conducted. All 200 patients who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with WSKY capsule (n?=?100) or placebo (n?=?100) added on risperidone for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the cognitive function assessment assessed by the classic form of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) at baseline and week 8. The secondary outcome measures were assessed including the positive and negative symptoms scale (PANSS), the social disability screening schedule (SDSS), and the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D-17) at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8. The extrapyramidal side effects were assessed each week using the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) and rating scale for extrapyramidal side effects (RSESE), while adverse events were assessed using treatment emergent symptoms scale (TESS) as additional indicators of tolerability throughout the trial. Results The response rates of the WSKY group for the number of completed categories (CC), errors responses number (ER), perseveringly errors responses number (PER), and conceptual level (CL) of WCST assessment were significantly higher than those of placebo. The reduction in the SDSS score from baseline to endpoint was significantly greater in the WSKY group than those in the placebo. There were no significant differences in the response rates for the correct responses number, perseveringly responses number (PR) of WCST between the treatment groups. The improvements in the WCST indexes, PANSS score, HAM-D-17 score were no significant differences from baseline to endpoint between the two groups at week 8.There were no significant differences in AIMS, RSESE, and TESS compared patients treated with WSKY capsule with those in placebo during treatment. Conclusion WSKY capsule added on risperidone may improve cognitive function, social function of the chronic schizophrenic patients, and the WSKY safely during treatment.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the relationship between mother and infant within multiproblem, so-called ?hard to reach? families. In an effort to understand factors contributing to problems in caring for the young children of these parents, a group of 47 families was recruited for study by the Clinical Infant Development Program of the National Institute of Mental Health. Serious social pathology was found within 75 percent of families. The lives of mothers in these families was marked by long term disruptions: 64 percent were from families characterized by recurring poverty and psychiatric illness, and 69 percent reported disruptions in parental care prior to age twelve, while more than two-thirds reported a history of being physically and/or sexually abused as children. More than 75 percent of this group of women presently showed psychiatric distress. Many of these women have difficulty in providing adequately for their young children and require innovative intervention programs in order to facilitate parenting.
