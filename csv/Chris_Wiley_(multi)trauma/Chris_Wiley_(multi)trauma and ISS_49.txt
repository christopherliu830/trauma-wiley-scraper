AB  - ?Thinking a lot? (TAL)?also referred to as ?thinking too much??is a key complaint in many cultural contexts, and the current article profiles this idiom of distress among Cambodian refugees. The article also proposes a general model of how TAL generates various types of distress that then cause PTSD-type psychopathology, a model we refer to as the TAL?PTSD model. As tested in this Cambodian refugee sample, the model is supported by the following: (1) the close connection of TAL to PTSD as shown by odds ratio (OR = 19.6), correlation (r = .86), and factor loading; and (2) the mediation of most of the effect of TAL on PTSD by TAL-caused somatic symptoms, catastrophic cognitions, trauma recall, insomnia, and irritability. The questionnaire used in the present study is provided and can be used to examine TAL in other cultural and global contexts to advance the study of this commonly encountered distress form.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU). A population-based cohort study involving 1018 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n?=?865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n?=?147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n?=?110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n?=?37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p?<?0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR?=?7.279, 95% CI: 1.299?40.784, p?<?0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p?<?0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR?=?4.554, 95% CI: 3.14?5.12, p?<?0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C?>?1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - ABSTRACT Effective, patient-centered communication facilitates interception and correction of potentially harmful conditions and errors. All team members, including women, their families, physicians, midwives, nurses, and support staff, have roles in identifying the potential for harm during labor and birth. However, the results of collaborative research studies conducted by organizations that represent professionals who care for women during labor and birth indicate that health care providers may frequently witness, but may not always report, problems with safety or clinical performance. Some of these health care providers felt resigned to the continuation of such problems and fearful of retribution if they tried to address them. Speaking up to address safety and quality concerns is a dynamic social process. Every team member must feel empowered to speak up about concerns without fear of put-downs, retribution, or receiving poor-quality care. Patient safety requires mutual accountability: individuals, teams, health care facilities, and professional associations have a shared responsibility for creating and sustaining environments of mutual respect and engaging in highly reliable perinatal care. Defects in human factors, communication, and leadership have been the leading contributors to sentinel events in perinatal care for more than a decade. Organizational commitment and executive leadership are essential to creating an environment that proactively supports safety and quality. The problem is well-known; the time for action is now.

AB  - Support from an intimate partner predicts recovery in individuals who have survived a traumatic injury, but not all partners are willing or able to provide support. To account for support provision after a traumatic injury, both members of 58 young couples were interviewed shortly after one member experienced a traumatic injury. Characteristics of the situation, the support recipient, and the support provider accounted for unique variance in support provision. Specifically, partners of trauma survivors reported providing more support when the injury was more severe, they were more religious, and their partners were higher in neuroticism. Contrary to expectations, no relationship variables were significantly associated with support provision. Results highlight the need to examine predictors of support in real-world contexts.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aimed to explore the analgesic regimes adopted in our contemporary retrieval practice and the incidence of vomiting in ED after prehospital analgesic use. Method A retrospective review was conducted on trauma patients retrieved by the Hunter Primary Retrieval Service in the Hunter New England Local Health District, New South Wales, Australia, during 2015. Results Of the 379 patients attended by the service in 2015, 196 of them (mean age 38.6, SD 19.68, years) were selected for this review. Morphine was the most commonly used analgesic (mean 68.37%; 95%?CI 61.36?74.81%), followed by fentanyl (mean 48.47%; 95%?CI 41.29?55.70%) and ketamine (mean 34.18%; 95%?CI 27.57?41.28%). Fourteen (7.14%, 95% CI 3.96?11.69%) patients vomited either prehospital or within the ED. Patients in both the emesis and the non-emesis group were comparable in demographics. None of the three studied analgesics were observed to be significantly associated with higher risk of vomiting than the others in this review, although a higher dose of fentanyl was given to the non-emesis group (P?=?0.04). Conclusions The frequency of vomiting in the retrieved patients observed in our study was less than previously reported in the literature. Opioids still prevailed over ketamine as the preferred initial analgesic, with ketamine most commonly used as an adjunct. Multi-centre trials in this field would be preferable in future in view of the relatively low incidence of vomiting in retrieved trauma patients.

AB  - Objective? To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported. Design? Retrospective/prospective study. Results? Nocardia spp infections were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable, from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1 entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured. Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion? Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of therapy leads to disease recurrence.

AB  - Summary Background? MMX? mesalazine [LIALDA? (US), MEZAVANT? XL (UK and Ireland) MEZAVANT? (elsewhere)] utilizes MMX Multi Matrix System? (MMX) technology which delivers mesalazine throughout the colon. Two phase III studies have already evaluated MMX mesalazine in patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Aim  To provide more precise estimates of the efficacy of MMX mesalazine over placebo by combining the patient populations from the two phase III studies. Methods? Combined data from two 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Patients randomized to MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day (once daily or 1.2?g twice daily), 4.8?g/day (once daily) or placebo were reviewed. The primary end point was clinical and endoscopic remission (modified Ulcerative Colitis-Disease Activity Index of ≤1 calculated as: rectal bleeding and stool frequency scores of 0, a combined Physician?s Global Assessment and sigmoidoscopy score of ≤1, no mucosal friability and a ≥1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from week 0). Results? Data from 517 patients were analysed. 8-week remission rates were 37.2% and 35.1% in the MMX mesalazine 2.4?g/day and 4.8?g/day groups, vs. 17.5% on placebo (P?<?0.001, both comparisons). 8-week complete mucosal healing rates were 32% in both MMX mesalazine groups compared with 16% on placebo. Adverse event frequency was similar in all groups. Conclusion? MMX mesalazine is effective and generally well tolerated for inducing clinical and endoscopic remission of active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.

The clinical team shares what they did, what was learned, the questions raised, and preliminary evaulations about the multiple family meeting that were the major intervention. Because of the vast diversity, training of therapists and interventions for families aimed for cultural competence. The community-based approach, preferred by union families, plus family therapy using the lens of ambiguous loss are proposed as necessary additions to disaster work.

AB  - Abstract Background Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) has been established as an evidence-based treatment for youth with traumatic stress symptoms. The versatility of TF-CBT in conjunction with its established effectiveness has led to its widespread dissemination. However, dissemination efforts have not always translated into sustainability, which has prompted a more thorough investigation into those factors that impact implementation and encouraged the development of strategies that promote sustainability. Toward this end, the aims of this study were to: (1) determine which components of TF-CBT clinicians found the most difficult to implement; (2) explore clinicians? perceptions as to why these components were challenging; and (3) examine whether the use of formalized problem-solving approaches (FPSAs) or training format was associated with implementation outcomes. Methods A mixed methods design was utilized to analyse survey data from mental health professionals (N = 85) who received TF-CBT training. Thematic analysis explored responses to questions concerning those TF-CBT components respondents found most difficult to implement, while bivariate analyses helped determine whether training format or the use of FPSAs was associated with training engagement, confidence in delivering TF-CBT, fidelity or sustainability. Results Clinicians perceived the same three components of TF-CBT as most difficult regardless of the type of training they received, and provider, youth, caregiver, and organizational-related themes emerged from thematic analysis. Bivariate analyses indicated more extended training formats and the use of FPSAs were associated with greater implementation success. Conclusion Findings suggest that perceived difficulty of TF-CBT components did not vary by training format, but more extended formats and the use of FPSAs were associated with more favourable implementation outcomes. Implementers should consider ways to utilize FPSAs within training programs, as well as focus on content identified by clinicians as difficult, as this may assist clinicians in developing skills and managing implementation barriers.

AB  - SUMMARY Recently it has been demonstrated that the CD14 molecule which is expressed on monocytes and macrophages serves as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bound to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and thus mediates LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production. Here we report that CD14 is found as a soluble (s) molecule in serum. In healthy volunteers sCD14 levels (mean ± s.e.m.) were 3.7±0.05 ?g/ml (n= 30, 25?50 years of age) as determined by ELISA (detection limit 20 ?g/ml serum) using two monoclonal antibodies in a sandwich technique. In polytraumatized patients (n= 16) significantly decreased levels (1.7 ± 0.3) were detected immediately after the trauma, which increased to 4.9±0.3 ?g/ml within the first 6 days post trauma. sCD14 remained elevated during the first 14 days post trauma in patients with the most severe injuries (injury severity score > 45 points), whereas a return to normal levels was observed in patients with an injury score of < 45 points. In addition, the levels of the high-density lipoproteins that partially inactivate free endotoxin are significantly decreased post trauma. No correlation between parameters of inflammation (C3a and neopterin levels, leucocyte counts, amount of band cells), liver function and sCD14 levels was established. Comparable to polytraumatized patients, increased sCD14 serum levels were observed in five patients with burn trauma (burned area > 35%) within the second week post trauma when clinical signs of septicaemia were evident.

AB  - Abstract Detecting the presence of injuries to the cervical spine is an important component of the initial assessment of patients sustaining blunt trauma. A small proportion of cervical spine injuries consists of ligamentous disruption. Accurate detection of ligamentous injury is essential as it may result in sequelae including radiculopathy, quadriplegia and death. Flexion?extension (FE) radiography has traditionally been utilised for the detection of ligamentous injury in patients who have been cleared of bony injury. There are controversies surrounding the use of FE for alert patients with neck pain. There are studies that call into question the diagnostic accuracy of FE, the high proportion of inadequate FE images due to muscle spasm and the adverse effects of prolonged cervical collar immobilisation while awaiting FE. Other literature indicates that FE provides no additional diagnostic information following a multi-detector helical computed tomography. This review evaluates the literature on the utility of FE for the detection of ligamentous injury and explores alternate strategies for clearing the cervical spine of ligamentous injury.
