AB  - Abstract Interest in trauma-informed approaches has grown substantially. These approaches are characterized by integrating understanding of trauma throughout a program, organization, or system to enhance the quality, effectiveness, and delivery of services provided to individuals and groups. However, variation in definitions of trauma-informed approaches, coupled with underdeveloped research on measurement, poses challenges for evaluating the effectiveness of models designed to support a trauma-informed approach. This systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature identified 49 systems-based measures that were created to assess the extent to which relational, organizational, and community/system practices were trauma-informed. Measures were included if they assessed at least one component of a trauma-informed approach, were not screening or diagnostic instruments, were standardized, were relevant to practices addressing the psychological impacts of trauma, were printed in English, and were published between 1988 and 2018. Most (77.6%) measures assessed organizational-level staff and climate characteristics. There remain several challenges to this emerging field, including inconsistently reported psychometric data, redundancy across measures, insufficient evidence of a link to stakeholder outcomes, and limited information about measurement development processes. We discuss these opportunities and challenges and their implications for future research and practice.

AB  - Summary Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Genitourinary tract injuries are rare, accounting for <3% of trauma cases. The majority of these injuries are due to blunt trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. In developed countries, iatrogenic injuries are especially prominent in the neonatal period whilst school-age children are prone to sports-related injuries, kicks and straddle injuries. Recent literature regarding pediatric genital trauma has focused on identifying and treating sexual abuse injuries as well as distinguishing these injuries from accidental trauma. This chapter reviews common etiologies for traumatic genital injuries and evaluate current diagnostic and treatment options. Risk factors, presenting signs and the evaluation of sexual abuse will also be reviewed.

AB  - Objectives This prospective study investigated whether within-individual relations between depression vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptom trajectories varied as a function of the number of prior major depressive episodes (MDEs) experienced in their lifetime. Design Participants were 68 young adults who varied with regard to their history of depression; 32 were remitted depressed and 36 were never depressed. Methods Depressive symptoms and disorders were assessed using semi-structured psychiatric interviews conducted twice over a 6-month period; interviews yielded weekly ratings of depressive symptoms during the follow-up interval. Childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes and coping were assessed with self-report measures. Data analyses were conducted using time-lagged multilevel models. Results Individuals with more previous MDEs who reported greater childhood trauma exposure, more dysfunctional attitudes, or greater use of maladaptive coping strategies experienced more rapid increases in depressive symptoms during the follow-up period. A significant interaction of coping, number of previous MDEs, and time was found indicating that among individuals with less adaptive coping (i.e., lower primary or lower secondary control coping scores), depressive symptoms rating (DSR) increased significantly in relation to number of prior depressive episodes; no change in DSR was observed for never-depressed individuals. Among individuals with higher primary control coping scores, significant increases in DSR scores were observed for individuals with ≥3 prior MDEs only. Conclusions Findings highlight the need for treatment and prevention programmes that target stress reactivity and coping strategies early in the course of depression. Practitioner points Findings highlight the need to conduct multi-dimensional assessments of depression vulnerability that examine the interplay among risk factors over time. Relations between vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptoms were stronger for individuals with more prior major depressive episodes (MDEs). Interventions for recurrent depression should focus on secondary control coping strategies that emphasize accommodation to stressful life events. Future studies should assess high-risk individuals before their first MDE to determine whether vulnerability factors linked with recurrence are pre-existing and relatively stable, or if they reflect ?scars? from MDEs.

AB  - Translations of summary This study deals with the individual and collective memory of Leningrad Siege survivors who experienced mass and prolonged wartime trauma during childhood (1941?44). While much has been published about the Siege, there has to date been no investigation by psychologists into the effects of extreme deprivation on Siege victims apart from one pilot study (Gulina et al., 2005). This study is still underway. Interviews with 80 participants (68 female and 12 male) are analysed and discussed here. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) and content analysis are utilized. Unpublished archival writings by children caught in the Siege have been analysed. The principal method of interpretation is based on a psychoanalytic understanding of child development, mourning and the metabolizing of traumatic experience. The subjective meaning of the Siege experience to individual children is considered

AB  - Clinicians are charged with being diligent in gaining competency in the latest trauma-informed interventions when working with relational trauma. This may invest therapists with an overresponsibility that is not only overwhelming and unrealistic, but serves to reduce autonomous functioning in family members. Therefore, clinicians need to become clear about what they are responsible for and what they are not, particularly when family members present as irresponsible or too anxious to think and act more effectively. Using a case vignette, this paper discusses how a clinician's focus on increasing their differentiation of self, a concept embeded in Bowen family systems theory, protects against vicarious traumatisation, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout whilst contributing to more autonomous functioning and better wellbeing outcomes for both clinicians and clients alike.

AB  - Abstract Background Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) occurs in 0.2?2.7% of blunt trauma patients and has up to 30% mortality. Conventional screening does not recognize up to 20% of BCVI patients. To improve diagnosis of BCVI, both an expanded battery of screening criteria and a multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been suggested. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of CTA restricted to the Denver protocol screen-positive patients would reduce the unnecessary use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool. Methods This is a registry-based study of blunt trauma patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital from 1998 to 2012. The diagnosis of BCVI was confirmed or excluded with CTA, magnetic resonance angiography and, if these imaging were non-conclusive, four-vessel digital subtraction angiography. Results Thirty (61%) BCVI and 19 (39%) non-BCVI patients met eligibility criteria. The Denver protocol applied to our cohort of patients had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83?100%) and a specificity of 42% (95% CI: 20?67%). With a prevalence of BCVI in blunt trauma patients of 0.2% and 2.7%, post-test odds of a screen-positive test were 0.03 (95% CI: 0.002?0.005) and 0.046 (95% CI: 0.314?0.068), respectively. Conclusions Application of the CTA to the Denver protocol screen-positive trauma patients can decrease the use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool by 95?97% and reduces its hazards.

This discussion paper reports development of a model to advance nursing science and practice in trauma care based on an analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Background.? The continuum of clinical care provided to trauma patients extends from the time of injury through to long-term recovery and final outcomes. Nurses bring a unique expertise to meet the complex physical and psychosocial needs of trauma patients and their families to influence outcomes across this entire continuum. Data sources.? Literature was obtained by searching CINAHL, PubMed and OvidMedline databases for 1990?2010. Search terms included trauma, nursing, scope of practice and role, with results restricted to those published in English. Manual searches of relevant journals and websites were undertaken. Discussion.? Core concepts in this trauma outcomes model include environment, person/family, structured care settings, long-term outcomes and nursing interventions. The relationships between each of these concepts extend across all phases of care. Intermediate outcomes are achieved in each phase of care and influence and have congruence with long-term outcomes. Implications for policy and practice.? This model is intended to provide a framework to assist trauma nurses and researchers to consider the injured person in the context of the social, economic, cultural and physical environment from which they come and the long-term goals that each person has during recovery. The entire model requires testing in research and assessment of its practical contribution to practice. Conclusion.? Planning and integrating care across the trauma continuum and recognition of the role of the injured person?s background, family and resources will lead to improved long-term outcomes.

AB  - Background Trauma remains the most frequent cause of death for patients under 35 years of age. Head injury and catastrophic haemorrhage account for the majority of early deaths. A trauma laparotomy is often necessary to arrest haemorrhage. Methods All patients who died in Queensland hospitals between 2011 and 2016 having had a trauma laparotomy were identified from the Queensland Audit of Surgical Mortality. Results About 69.0% of the 84 deaths were male with a median age of 47.6 years. About 64.3% of deaths occurred within the first 2 days following trauma. Mechanism of injury was typically road traffic accident (77.4%). Sixteen patients underwent a non-therapeutic laparotomy. Following peer-review, different management was recommended for only three patients. Conclusion This group of patients who died in the setting of a trauma laparotomy received high quality trauma care. Ongoing education is needed as some non-therapeutic laparotomies may be avoidable.

AB  - Summary Abdominal trauma is second only to head injury as a cause of serious injury in children, and the third most common cause of trauma-related death. The most common organs injured in blunt abdominal trauma are the spleen, liver and kidneys. When the spleen and liver are injured, intraperitoneal bleeding occurs (haemoperitoneum). In all suspected intra-abdominal injuries, the presence or absence of macroscopic blood in the urine must be established. The presence of macroscopic haematuria is strongly predictive of serious intra-abdominal injury and may form part of the basis for further investigation with a computerised tomography (CT) scan. Apart from those patients with intraperitoneal haemorrhage, extraperitoneal extravasation or haematuria, there is a difficult group with ill-defined symptoms and signs that may persist for several days after the injury. On the rare occasion of penetrating thoracic trauma, injuries to the mediastinal structures and lungs should be assumed until proven otherwise.

AB  - ABSTRACT Trauma is the most common cause of death and significant morbidity in childhood; abusive head trauma (AHT) is a prominent cause of significant morbidity and mortality in children younger than 2 years old. Correctly diagnosing AHT is challenging both clinically and radiologically. The primary diagnostic challenges are that the abused children are usually too young to provide an adequate history, perpetrators are unlikely to provide truthful account of trauma, and clinicians may be biased in their assessment of potentially abused children. The main radiological challenge is that there is no single imaging finding that is independently specific for or diagnostic of AHT. The radiological evaluation should be based on the multiplicity and severity of findings and an inconsistency with the provided mechanism of trauma. While the most common neuroimaging finding in AHT is subdural hemorrhage, other less well-known magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings such as the ?lollipop sign? or ?tadpole sign,? parenchymal or cortical lacerations, subpial hemorrhage, cranio-cervical junction injuries including retroclival hematomas, as well as diffuse hypoxic brain injury have been identified and described in the recent literature. While AHT is ultimately a clinical diagnosis combining history, exam, and neuroimaging, familiarity with the typical as well as the less-well known MRI findings will improve recognition of AHT by radiologists.

Aims To explore specialist intellectual disability practitioners perspectives on current health provision and developments to address trauma. Methods Twenty-five qualitative interviews were conducted with practitioners across 6 health service areas in the UK. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings Seven central themes emerged: (a) unmasked trauma; (b) trauma informed care; (c) person-centred care and support; (d) multi-disciplinary working; (e) reasonable adjustments; (f) barriers to treatment and (g) awareness, training and education. Conclusion Trauma-informed care and multi-disciplinary working are essential components for future service development. Advances in the evidence-base for effective psychological interventions for PTSD and training and education of health care staff are needed in order to improve service provision amongst this population.

Patients and Methods Relevant articles and guidelines published between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed. Graded recommendations were constructed by a multi-disciplinary panel consisting of urologists, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. These recommendations underwent formal review and debate at the Western Australian USANZ 2013 state conference, and were presented at the USANZ 2014 annual scientific meeting. Results The literature on the conservative management of renal trauma is reviewed within the framework of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury severity scale. Graded recommendations are made regarding several key topics including: imaging, inpatient management, antibiotics, return to activity, and follow-up. Grade IV injuries and intraoperative consults are examined separately in view of the difficulties these groups cause in making appropriate treatment decisions. Conclusion A practical clinical guideline is provided regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Traumatic colorectal injuries are common during times of military conflict, and major improvements in their care have arisen in such periods. Since World War II, many classification systems for colorectal trauma have been proposed, including (i) Flint Grading System; (ii) Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index; (iii) Colonic/Rectal Injury Scale; and (iv) destructive/non-destructive colonic injuries. The primary goal of these classifications was to aid surgical management and, more particularly, to determine whether a primary repair or faecal diversion should be performed. Primary repair is now the preferred surgical option. Patients who have been identified as having destructive injuries have been found to have higher anastomotic leak rates after a primary repair. Damage control principles need to be adhered to in surgical decision-making. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of injury, classifications, clinical presentation and current recommendations for the management of colorectal trauma.

Recent developments in imaging systems have enabled clinicians to visualize structural changes effectively. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cone beam computed tomography are among the most commonly used systems for dental and maxillofacial surgery. The purpose of this review is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and the clinical application for dento-alveolar trauma. Three clinical cases are described to illustrate the potential use of the NewTom 3G for diagnosis and treatment plan of dento-alveolar traumatic injuries.

AB  - This paper reviews the research evidence concerning the intergenerational transmission of trauma effects and the possible role of epigenetic mechanisms in this transmission. Two broad categories of epigenetically mediated effects are highlighted. The first involves developmentally programmed effects. These can result from the influence of the offspring's early environmental exposures, including postnatal maternal care as well as in utero exposure reflecting maternal stress during pregnancy. The second includes epigenetic changes associated with a preconception trauma in parents that may affect the germline, and impact fetoplacental interactions. Several factors, such as sex-specific epigenetic effects following trauma exposure and parental developmental stage at the time of exposure, explain different effects of maternal and paternal trauma. The most compelling work to date has been done in animal models, where the opportunity for controlled designs enables clear interpretations of transmissible effects. Given the paucity of human studies and the methodological challenges in conducting such studies, it is not possible to attribute intergenerational effects in humans to a single set of biological or other determinants at this time. Elucidating the role of epigenetic mechanisms in intergenerational effects through prospective, multi-generational studies may ultimately yield a cogent understanding of how individual, cultural and societal experiences permeate our biology.

AB  - Abstract It is critical for urban youth with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) living in poverty to have access to evidence-based interventions for their traumatic stress. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of these interventions when provided in urban, community settings. The objectives of the current study are to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy delivered from 2013 to 2016 in 15 behavioral health agencies on youth (N = 114) PTSD as well as  general mental health symptoms and  functioning, and (b) benchmark these clinical outcomes against other published efficacy and effectiveness trials. Effectiveness data are from the Philadelphia County Community Behavioral Health System, a system that has invested significantly in the training and ongoing support of clinicians providing high-quality trauma services to youth since 2012. From baseline to last assessment, youth PTSD symptom severity (d = 0.34), PTSD functional impairment (d = 0.38), and overall mental health problem severity (d = 0.29) improved. The effect sizes of  improvements were smaller than effect sizes observed in efficacy and effectiveness studies. This study is the first benchmarking study of TF-CBT and provides preliminary findings with regard to the effectiveness, and transportability, of TF-CBT to urban community settings that serve youth in poverty.
