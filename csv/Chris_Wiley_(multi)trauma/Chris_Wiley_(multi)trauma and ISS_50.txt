AB  - Abstract In situ simulation (ISS), a point of care training strategy that occurs within the patient care environment involving actual healthcare team members, provides additional benefits to centre-based simulation. ISS can serve several roles within emergency medicine (EM): improves provider/team performance, identifies and mitigates threats to patient safety and improves systems and infrastructure. The effective use of ISS fosters inter-professional team training and a culture of safety essential for high performance EM teams and resilient systems. Using a case example, this article addresses the uses of ISS in EM, strategies for implementation and mitigation strategies for ED-specific challenges.

AB  - The aim of this replication study was to determine if prior findings at one U.S. dental school about dental students' comfort discussing and perceptions of the relevance of 15 risk behaviors to adolescent patient oral health care would be observed at other institutions. All first- and fourth-year dental students (n=414) at three U.S. dental schools in fall 2017 were invited to participate, and 218 completed the survey (52.7% response rate). These students reported feeling comfortable to uncomfortable discussing risk behaviors with adolescent patients, yet perceived those risk behaviors as relevant to their oral health. There were significant differences in student comfort discussing risk behaviors with adolescents and their perceptions of relevance by gender, age, class status, and school location. Males were more comfortable than females discussing oral health risk behaviors. There were no significant differences by race/ethnicity. Fourth-year students had higher levels of comfort discussing risk behaviors than first-year students. Compared to students in the South and Midwest schools, students at the West school were more comfortable discussing selected topics and had higher perceptions of their relevance to adolescent oral health care. These results suggest there is room for improvement in this area of dental education. Dental schools should aim to strengthen students' knowledge of and comfort in discussing oral health risk behaviors with adolescent patients with the use of educational activities and clinical experiences.

AB  - Summary Whereas the gap between organ supply and demand remains a worldwide concern, resuscitation of out-of-hospital traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) remains controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate, in a prehospital medical care system, the number of organs transplanted from victims of out-of-hospital TCA. This is a descriptive study. Victims of TCA are collected in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry of the French North Alpine Emergency Network from 2004 to 2008. In addition to the rates of admission and survival, brain-dead patients and the organ transplanted are described. Among the 540 resuscitated patients with suspected TCA, 79 were admitted to a hospital, 15 were discharged alive from the hospital, and 22 developed brain death. Nine of these became eventually organ donors, with 31 organs transplanted, all functional after 1 year. Out-of-hospital TCA should be resuscitated just as medical CA. With a steady prevalence in our network, 19% of admitted TCA survived to discharge, and 11% became organ donors. It is essential to raise awareness among rescue teams that out-of-hospital TCA are an organ source to consider seriously.

AB  - Abstract Japanese macaque societies are characterized by frequent intragroup conflict both in free-ranging and zoo-housed conditions. In zoos, understanding the factors that contribute to wounding is of interest because this knowledge can aid in proactive husbandry and management planning that can minimize the negative impacts wounding can have on individual welfare. This study sought to determine whether the variables sex, season and age predicted wounding rates. Data were collected for 24 months on 119 Japanese macaques living in 10 zoos, and we analyzed the contribution of variables using generalized linear mixed models. A total of 1,007 wounds were reported, and the best model included the interaction between sex and season. Follow-up analyses revealed that females incurred more wounds than males, and this sex difference was more pronounced during the breeding compared to the nonbreeding season. On average, individuals received 4.67 (±SEM: 0.55) wounds per year and 77.31% of the population incurred at least one wound in the study period. The majority of wounds were superficial and did not require veterinary intervention. Wound locations were not randomly distributed across body regions and were most often reported on the face. Finally, macaques living in larger social groups experienced more wounds, on average. This study represents the first quantification of wounding in this species and may provide insight to help inform husbandry and management strategies in zoos.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the importance of including cultural dimensions as a fundamental component of nursing curricula and to provide some indications as to how this may be achieved. The concept of ?institutionalized racism? is examined, with reference to the absence of the cultural dimension in nursing education, and it is suggested that nurses, as members of a ?caring profession', should be in the forefront in promoting mutual cultural understanding. The argument for promoting cultural awareness is developed in the context of individualized nursing care and the nursing process. The needs of ethnic minority learners are considered along with their potential role, and that of tutors, in breaking down barriers to the acceptance of cultural diversity. Some possible reasons for the failure to include ethnographic perspectives in nurse education programmes are postulated, and finally suggestions as to how this curriculum deficit may be rectified are made. The paper concludes that British nurse educators should ensure that the needs fo learners and patients are better provided for in the future by directing more attention to ethnographic perspectives relating to learning and the provision of nursing care.

AB  - Background The prognostic value of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in dogs after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear. Objectives Determine whether MRI findings are associated with prognosis after TBI in dogs. Animals Fifty client-owned dogs. Methods Retrospective study of dogs with TBI that underwent 1.5T MRI within 14 days after head trauma. MRI evaluators were blinded to the clinical presentation, and all images were scored based on an MRI grading system (Grade I [normal brain parenchyma] to Grade VI [bilateral lesions affecting the brainstem with or without any lesions of lesser grade]). Skull fractures, percentage of intraparenchymal lesions, degree of midline shift, and type of brain herniation were evaluated. MGCS was assessed at presentation. The presence of seizures was recorded. Outcome was assessed at 48 h (alive or dead) and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results Sixty-six percent of the dogs had abnormal MRI findings. MRI grade was negatively correlated (P < .001) with MGCS. A significant negative correlation of MRI grade, degree of midline shift, and percentage of intraparenchymal lesions with follow-up scores was identified. The MGCS was lower in dogs with brain herniation (P = .0191). Follow-up scores were significantly lower in dogs that had brain herniation or skull fractures. The possibility of having seizures was associated with higher percentage of intraparenchymal lesions (P = 0.0054) and 10% developed PTE. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Significant associations exist between MRI findings and prognosis in dogs with TBI. MRI can help to predict prognosis in dogs with TBI.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with various neurocognitive deficits, and rapid assessment of the damage is potentially important for the prevention and treatment of these deficits. Imaging assessment of mild or moderate damage outside the primary lesion area after TBI, however, remains challenging. Magnetization transfer (MT) has clearly been underutilized in imaging the damage caused by TBI. Here, we applied the MT ratio (MTR) using sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) to study microstructural tissue damage in the thalamocortical pathway outside the primary lesion in a lateral fluid percussion injury rat model of TBI, 5 months after injury. MTR was decreased in layers VIb-IV of the barrel cortex and related subcortical areas, mainly indicating demyelination, which was verified by histology. The largest MTR change in the cortex was in layer VIb (?8.2%, pFDR = 0.01), and the largest MTR change in the subcortical areas was in the caudal-most portion of the internal capsule (?11.0%, pFDR < 0.005). These areas exhibited the greatest demyelination and substantial cellularity attributed to gliosis. Correlation analysis of group-averaged results from the subcortical areas revealed an excellent correlation of MTR with myelin (r2 = 0.94, p < 0.001), but no correlation with increased cellularity as detected by Nissl staining. Thus, MTR using SWIFT can be a valuable tool for the assessment of subtle changes after TBI in both cortical and subcortical areas.

AB  - This study examined factors related to children's acute symptoms following a potentially traumatic event (PTE) to more clearly identify domains that should be included in screenings of youth exposed to a PTE. In particular, the authors examined whether trauma category (i.e., sexual abuse/disclosure of abuse, intentionally perpetrated traumas other than sexual abuse, and unintentional traumas) was related to symptoms after controlling for other relevant factors. Participants were 112 youth presenting for clinical evaluation within a month of a PTE and their nonoffending caregivers. Using data from baseline assessments collected as part of a randomized controlled trial of a secondary prevention program, the following factors were tested in 3 hierarchical regression models: index PTE category, history of traumatic exposure, preindex event functioning, and parenting behaviors. Prior trauma exposure, preindex event functioning, and hostile parenting were uniquely related to children's symptoms in the acute posttraumatic period after controlling for time since the event and child age, but trauma category was not. Implications for identifying and referring children at high risk for poor outcomes in the early aftermath of a PTE are discussed. An exclusive focus on the event is insufficient and more comprehensive understanding of the child and family is required.

AB  - Background:? Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infancy is relatively common, and is likely to lead to poorer outcomes than injuries sustained later in childhood. While the headlines have been grabbed by infant TBI caused by abuse, often known as shaken baby syndrome, the evidence base for how to support children following TBI in infancy is thin. These children are likely to benefit from ongoing assessment and intervention, because brain injuries sustained in the first year of life can influence development in different ways over many years. Methods:? A literature search was conducted and drawn together into a review aimed at informing practitioners working with children who had a brain injury in infancy. As there are so few evidence-based studies specifically looking at children who have sustained a TBI in infancy, ideas are drawn from a range of studies, including different age ranges and difficulties other than traumatic brain injury. Results:? This paper outlines the issues around measuring outcomes for children following TBI in the first year of life. An explanation of outcomes which are more likely for children following TBI in infancy is provided, in the areas of mortality; convulsions; endocrine problems; sensory and motor skills; cognitive processing; language; academic attainments; executive functions; and psychosocial difficulties. The key factors influencing these outcomes are then set out, including severity of injury; pre-morbid situation; genetics; family factors and interventions. Conclusions:? Practitioners need to take a long-term, developmental view when assessing, understanding and supporting children who have sustained a TBI in their first year of life. The literature suggests some interventions which may be useful in prevention, acute care and longer-term rehabilitation, and further research is needed to assess their effectiveness.

AB  - Summary Background Previous studies investigating factors associated with survival following endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursa are limited. Objectives To investigate the factors associated with survival in horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated endoscopically and to describe the bacterial isolates involved in the synovial infections. Study design Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Methods Medical records from 128 horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated by endoscopic lavage at seven equine hospitals were reviewed. A follow-up questionnaire was used to determine survival and return to athletic performance. Descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards survival models were used to determine factors associated with survival. Results Horses underwent one (n = 107), two (n = 19), or three (n = 2) surgeries. Survival to hospital discharge was 84.4%. Univariable survival analysis revealed that administration of systemic antimicrobials prior to referral was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.18?0.91, P = 0.03). Increased mortality was associated with bone fracture/osteomyelitis (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.12?5.26, P = 0.03), tendon involvement (≥30% cross sectional area) (HR 3.78 95% CI 1.78?8.04, P = 0.001), duration of general anaesthesia (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00?1.02, P = 0.04), post-operative synoviocentesis (HR 3.18, 95% CI 1.36?7.43, P = 0.006) and post-operative wound dehiscence (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.08?5.65, P = 0.04). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed reduced mortality after systemic antimicrobial administration prior to referral (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11?0.60, P = 0.002) and increased mortality with tendinous involvement (≥30% cross-sectional area) (HR 7.92, 95% CI 3.31?19.92, P<0.001). At follow-up (median 30 months, range 0.25?13 years, n = 70) 87.1% horses were alive, 7.1% had been euthanised due to the calcaneal injury and 5.7% had been euthanised for unrelated reasons. From 57 horses with athletic performance follow-up, 91.2% returned to the same/higher level of exercise, 5.3% to a lower level and 3.5% were retired due to persistent lameness of the affected limb. Main limitations Retrospective study and incomplete follow-up. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae has an 84% survival rate to hospital discharge. Tendinous involvement reduced survival whilst systemic antimicrobials administration prior to referral improved survival.

AB  - Background:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have gained popularity in colonic surgery. Hospital stay has been reduced dramatically as a result, but remains varied in the published literature. We were interested in investigating the factors that influence hospital stay in an ERAS setting. Methods:?? Between October 2005 and November 2008 prospective data were collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resection, without a stoma, at a single site. Patients were managed within an ERAS program. Patients unable to communicate in English, with dementia or ASA >4 were excluded. Variables were tested using the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman's two tailed correlation table for continuous data. Cox regression analysis was used for modelling. Results:?? 102 patients were included. There were 57 right sided, 43 left sided and 2 total colectomies. Mean age was 66?years (95% CI, 40?88). Median day stay was 4?days (range 3?46). Indications for surgery were: malignancy (80%), diverticular disease (13%) and other (7%). Age, operation site, ASA, indication for surgery and BMI were not significant predictors of hospital stay. Factors with the strongest correlation for reduced day stay were Cr-Possum score (p = 0.006), female sex (p = 0.013), laparoscopic (n = 6) and transverse (n = 32) incisions (p < 0.001), and the operating surgeon (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression modeling, surgeon and patient gender could be eliminated as independent predictors of day stay. The other two factors added significant strength to the model. Conclusion:?? Choice of incision and Cr-POSSUM score are independent predictors of day stay in the ERAS setting.

AB  - With an increasing instance of traumatic brain injury and little advancement over recent decades in the rehabilitation of brain injury survivors and their family members, focus has shifted toward the establishment of effective whole-family resilience promotion interventions. Using the Brain Injury Family Intervention as a model, clinicians constructed two curriculum-based interventions grounded in resilience theory and drawing from the interdisciplinary approaches of neuropsychology and marriage and family therapy: (a) the Resilience and Adjustment Intervention, for individual survivors of traumatic brain jury, and (b) the Therapeutic Couples Intervention, designed to increase relational satisfaction in couples following a traumatic brain injury. The present study outlines the need for the integration of resilience tenets into rehabilitation techniques, summarizes the empirical justification for the use of an interdisciplinary approach, and offers an overview with implementation specifics regarding these two newly designed interventions.

AB  - Records were reviewed of 477 patients who had diaphragm pacemakers implanted for treatment of chronic hypoventilation. Three groups were established for comparison. (1) Center group: 165 patients operated on in six medical centers participating in a cooperative study; (2) Noncenter group, sufficient data available: 203 patients operated on by surgeons with experience limited to a few cases; (3) Nonstudy group, minimal data available: 109 patients operated on as in group 2; vital statistics only were contributed. The protocol for data gathering was comprised of 154 major variables. Basic data on age, sex, diagnosis and etiology were analyzed for homogenicity of data among the groups. A comprehensive analysis of the pacing methods, complication and results fom the Center group yielded information on the early experience with diaphragm pacing important to its future application.

AB  - Abstract In this article, we report the prevalence of traumatic events (TEs), lifetime and 12-month posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 148 women experiencing homelessness in 3 midsized cities in the United States (Omaha, NE, Pittsburgh, PA, and Portland, OR). The women ranged in age from 19 to 54 years with an average age of 38.89 years (SD = 10.18). The sample was 42.6% White/European American. We investigated the mediation of distal TEs (i.e., childhood maltreatment) by more proximal TEs associated with being homeless (i.e., homelessness-related stressors) for meeting diagnostic criteria for 12-month PTSD. Results indicated that 42.6% of the women met criteria for lifetime PTSD and 39.7% met criteria for past-year PTSD. The number of TEs reported ranged from 0 to 16 in order of prevalence with a median of 6 TEs. The correlations between childhood maltreatment and 12-month PTSD ranged from .16 to .20 and the correlations between homelessness-related stressors and 12-month PTSD ranged from .21 to .30. The mediation analysis was consistent with the association between childhood maltreatment and past-year PTSD being fully mediated by homelessness-related trauma.
