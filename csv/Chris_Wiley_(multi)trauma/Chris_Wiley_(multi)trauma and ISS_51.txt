AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety and initial efficacy of paclitaxel administration using a novel drug delivery catheter for the prevention of restenosis in infrapopliteal de novo and restenotic lesions. Background Restenosis continues to be a great challenge after percutaneous revascularization procedures for peripheral arterial disease, particularly for below-the-knee applications. Methods A prospective, multicenter first-in-human registry of a novel delivery catheter delivering liquid paclitaxel was conducted in 10 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint at 6 months was freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and the primary safety endpoint at 1, 3, and 6 months were thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Twelve (n?=?12) lesions in ten patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 83.3?±?49.2 mm, with the lesion length range of 30mm to 182 mm. At 6-month follow-up, the rate of CD-TLR was 30% (3 of 10 patients). Zero patients (0 out of 10) demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up intervals. Conclusions This first in-human experience obtained in a multicenter study of real-world de novo and restenotic lesions demonstrates a favorable safety and efficacy profile at 6 months. Randomized comparison to current drug coated balloons should be performed to further validate this approach and positive experience.

AB  - Abstract Using a quasi-experimental design, this study examined the effectiveness of a standardized intervention model designed to build resiliency in children of women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders and histories of interpersonal abuse. The children and mothers who participated in this study were a subset of the sample used for the Women, Co-occurring Disorders and Violence Study (WCDVS). The children's intervention model consisted of three components: clinical assessment, service coordination and advocacy, and a psychoeducational skills-building group. Children in the comparison group received individual, group, and family services. Six-month and 12-month outcomes were examined among 253 children. Children in the intervention group improved significantly more than children in the comparison group. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comm Psychol 35: 823?843, 2007.

AB  - Objectives Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) is a known sequela of high-energy craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma and can result in stroke or death. The objective of this systematic review is to 1) identify CMF trauma patients who may benefit from BCVI screening and 2) describe the optimal diagnostic and treatment modalities. Study Design Systematic review of the literature (1946?2013). Methods An a priori study protocol was created using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. The authors conducted a search of Ovid/Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for articles related to BCVI and CMF fractures. All abstracts were reviewed, and data was extracted to determine the incidence of BCVI in the setting of CMF trauma. Individual fracture patterns were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. The overall incidence of CMF fracture-associated BCVI was 0.45%. The majority of patients (86.6%) sustained BCVI in the setting of high-energy trauma. The distribution of CMF fractures among BCVI patients was the mandible (12.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.8%). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was the most common diagnostic modality. A total of 63.1% of patients with BCVI were managed medically. The mortality among CMF patients with BCVI was 23.9%, and stroke rate was 47.1%. Conclusion Blunt cerebrovascular injury is a rare but devastating complication of blunt trauma. The recommended screening modality is CTA, and the most common treatment is antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication. Mandibular and LeFort fractures were the most common isolated CMF injury associated with BCVI, highlighting the need for prospective trials to expand current screening criteria.

AB  - Abstract Immersion in time gives birth to consciousness, as well as conflict and torment. When human beings developed a sense of future, they also gained the ability to anticipate threats from nature or their fellow beings. They thereby created cultures that are bastions of survival, as well as places of poetry, art and religion where they could band together and reflect upon their common plight. The practice of psychoanalysis is in many ways a temporal process, a process of remembering, for owning and elaborating a past that gives us substance, thereby providing a basis for reflective consciousness. Stimulated by Freud's early writings, Lacan, Laplanche and their successors in particular have focussed extensively on time and psychoanalysis, and their views are a central point of this discussion. A substantial case study is offered that provides concrete examples of these perspectives. A multi-faceted view of temporality emerges, one that is more syncopated than linear or teleological. In conclusion, I will briefly discuss recent findings in the neuroscience of memory and ?time travel? that underpin contemporary psychoanalytic ideas in surprising ways. It is important to remember that acceptance of the contradictory nature of temporal experience can open space for increased freedom and playfulness.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of traumatic spino-pelvic dissociation (TSD) treated with modified bilateral triangular fixation. Methods Eighteen consecutive patients of TSD were included in the study from March 2011 to March 2015, and the medical records of patients were reviewed retrospectively. There were 14 men and 4 women with an average age of 33.1?±?1.4 years (range, 18?55 years). A total of 16 cases were caused by falling, and 2 cases were caused by traffic accident. All sacral fractures had associated injuries. According to the morphology of sacral fracture, U-shaped fractures were present in 10 cases, H-shaped fractures in 6 cases, and Y-shaped fractures in 2 cases. According to Roy?Camille classification, there were 12 cases of type II and 6 cases of type III. All patients received surgical treatment with modified bilateral triangular fixation, and the sacral plexus decompression was performed simultaneously on 6 cases whose scores were more than 2 according to Gibbons classification and were found having traumatic canal stenosis or sacral nerve compression detected by preoperative imaging examination. Mears? radiological evaluation criterion was applied to evaluate the reduction quality of fractures; Gibbons score was applied as the index of neurological deficiency healing, and the clinical outcome of fracture was evaluated with Majeed function assessment at last follow-up. Results All patients were followed up continuously within an average of 32.4?±?3.6?months (range, 22?48?months). All sacral fractures were healed in an average time of 11.3?±?2.8?months (range, 8?28?months). According to the Majeed function evaluation, 12 cases were classified as excellent, 4 cases as good, and 2 cases as fair. Meanwhile, the anatomical reduction was obtained in 11 cases, satisfactory reduction in 6 cases, and unsatisfactory reduction in 1 case according to Mears? radiological evaluation criterion. The average Gibbons score changed from 2.5?±?0.2 preoperatively to 1.4?±?0.5 24?months postoperatively, which had a significant difference (t?=?2.15, P?<?0.05). Conclusion Modified triangular fixation combined with internal fixations shows satisfactory clinical outcomes in the treatment of TSD, which is recommended as an effective and advanced surgical choice.

AB  - Summary Over two decades ago, the St. Vincent Declaration set a 50% reduction of lower-limb amputations as a principal target for patients with diabetes. During this time, enormous strides have been taken in our understanding of diabetic foot disease, the complexities of wound healing and the organization of care to prevent what is one of the most feared complications of the disease. Despite this, we are aware that worldwide, we have not achieved the target set in 1989, with current estimations being that a limb is lost to diabetes somewhere in the world every 30?s. However, it has to be remembered that amputation is a treatment and not a disease, and it is indeed a treatment usually prescribed at the end of a long chronic illness. It is well known that patients whose disease is severe enough for amputation to be considered frequently have other complications of their diabetes, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases and end-stage renal disease, in particular. The life expectancy of the patients is therefore frequently reduced, and their functional status poor even prior to the intervention of surgeons. Just as the functional status of the patients is often a contra-indication to other disease treatments, chemotherapy for some cancers, for example, then we should be considering carefully whether we should be removing limbs from patients whose functional and medical status will not improve significantly as a result. Equally, there may be patients who may benefit from an early amputation and ambulation with a prosthesis. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background:? Building on previous research with adolescents that examined demographic variables and other forms of substance abuse in relation to non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD), the current study examined potentially traumatic events, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other substance use, and delinquent behavior as potential correlates of past-year non-medical use of prescription drugs. Method:? A nationally representative sample of 3,614 non-institutionalized, civilian, English-speaking adolescents (aged 12?17?years) residing in households with a telephone was selected. Demographic characteristics, traumatic event history, mental health, and substance abuse variables were assessed. NMUPD was assessed by asking if, in the past year, participants had used a prescription drug in a non-medical manner. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted for each theoretically derived predictor set. Significant predictors from each set were then entered into a final multivariable logistic regression to determine significant predictors of past-year NMUPD. Results:? NMUPD was endorsed by 6.7% of the sample (n?=?242). The final multivariable model showed that lifetime history of delinquent behavior, other forms of substance use/abuse, history of witnessed violence, and lifetime history of PTSD were significantly associated with increased likelihood of NMUPD. Conclusions: Risk reduction efforts targeting NMUPD among adolescents who have witnessed significant violence, endorsed abuse of other substances and delinquent behavior, and/or endorsed PTSD are warranted. Interventions for adolescents with history of violence exposure or PTSD, or those adjudicated for delinquent behavior, should include treatment or prevention modules that specifically address NMUPD.

AB  - Abstract Warfare impacts how people and populations can move about the landscape. Ethnographers have posited that internal warfare, conflict that takes place within a single society, is strongly associated with female abduction. In contrast, external warfare, combat between different societies, is often accompanied by the in-migration of men for purposes of defence. To test this assertion, we evaluate human remains from one of the most violent eras in Andean prehistory, the Late Intermediate Period (ad 1000?1400). In the south-central highlands of Andahuaylas, Peru, this era witnessed the coalescence of two formidable polities, the Chanka and the Quichua. Ethnohistoric accounts describe internal warfare among the Chanka and external warfare between the Quichua and their neighbours. In this study, bioarchaeological and biogeochemical methods are marshalled to elucidate ancient patterns of violence and mobility with greater nuance. We employ strontium isotope analysis of tooth enamel apatite to inform on residential origin, and we reconstruct patterns of violent conflict through analysis of cranial trauma. In all, 265 crania were excavated from 17 cave ossuaries at two Chanka sites and one Quichua site. Data were collected on age, sex and cranial modification?an indicator of social identity and cranial trauma. A representative subsample of molars from 34 individuals subjected to strontium isotope analysis demonstrates that among the Chanka, violence was significantly directed towards social groups within society, marked by modified crania. The presence of two nonlocal women with signs of increased morbidity and mistreatment points to possible mobility-by-abduction. In contrast, among the Quichua, men have significantly more trauma, and wounds are concentrated on the anterior. Trauma on women is lower, nonlethal, and concentrated on the posterior. This divergent pattern is commonly observed in external warfare (raids and community defence), where men face attackers and women escape them. The presence of two nonlocal men supports a mobility model of strategic in-migration. In sum, osteological and isotopic data sets are shown to reveal divergent life-course experiences not captured by the archaeological data or historic records alone.

AB  - Abstract Ethnoracial minority status contributes to an increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after trauma exposure, beyond other risk factors. A population-based sampling frame was used to examine the associations between ethnoracial groups and early PTSD symptoms while adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic characteristics. Acutely injured trauma center inpatients (N = 623) were screened with the PTSD Checklist. American Indian and African American patients reported the highest levels of posttraumatic stress and preinjury cumulative trauma burden. African American heritage was independently associated with an increased risk of higher acute PTSD symptom levels. Disparities in trauma history, PTSD symptoms, and event related factors emphasize the need for acute care services to incorporate culturally competent approaches for treating these diverse populations.

AB  - Abstract Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs at a high frequency in severe orthopaedic extremity injuries; however, the etiology of traumatic HO is virtually unknown. Osteogenic progenitor cells have previously been identified within traumatized muscle. Although the signaling mechanisms that lead to this dysregulated differentiation pathway have not been identified, it is assumed that inflammation and fibrosis, which contribute to an osteoinductive environment, are necessary for the development of HO. The hypothesis of this study was that cytokines related to chronic inflammation, fibrogenesis, and osteogenesis become up-regulated following severe muscle trauma where HO forms. Classification of these cytokines by their differential expression relative to control muscle will provide guidance for further study of the mechanisms leading to HO. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed no significant up-regulation of cytokines typically associated with HO (e.g., BMP-4, as observed in the genetic form of HO, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva). Instead, the cytokine gene expression profile associated with the traumatized muscle included up-regulation of cytokines associated with osteogenesis and fibrosis (i.e., BMP-1 and TGF-?1). Using immunohistochemistry, these cytokines were localized to fibroproliferative lesions, which have previously been implicated in HO. This study identifies other cell and tissue-level interactions in traumatized muscle that should be investigated further to better define the etiology of HO. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Development of an organ and subsequently the whole system from an embryo is a highly integrated process. Although there is evidence that different systems are interconnected during developmental stages, the molecular understanding of this relationship is either not known or only to a limited extent. Nervous system development, amongst all, is maybe the most crucial and complex process. It relies on the correct distribution of specific neuronal growth factors and hormones to the specific receptors. Among the plethora of proteins that are involved in downstream signalling of neuronal growth factors, we find the kinase-D interacting substrate of 220 kDa (KIDINS220), also known as ankyrin-rich repeat membrane spanning (ARMS) protein. KIDINS220 has been shown to play a substantial role in the nervous system and vascular system development as well as in neuronal survival and differentiation. It serves as a downstream regulator for many important neuronal and vascular growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the neurotrophin family, glutamate receptors and ephrin receptors. Moreover, activation and differentiation of B- and T-cells, as well as tumour cell proliferation has also shown to be related to KIDINS220. This review comprehensively summarises the existing research data on this protein, with a particular interest in its role in cancer and in other pathologies.

AB  - Abstract Background Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a worse prognosis than individuals with BPD alone. A common view is that the emotional instability and impulsivity of BPD should be treated before attempting to address trauma. However, PTSD symptoms may interfere with patients' ability to benefit from such ?stabilizing? treatments. Methods The effect of BPD?PTSD comorbidity on self-harm and BPD symptom outcomes was evaluated in 89 patients receiving dialectical behaviour therapy, using multilevel modelling. Results Patients with comorbid BPD?PTSD showed a trend towards elevated BPD symptoms throughout the treatment year (??=?2.12, 95% CI?=??0.21?4.44, p?=?0.07). There was a three-way interaction between PTSD comorbidity, treatment completion and time, whereby PTSD comorbidity was associated with less reduction in self-harm frequency over time, but only in those completing the full 12?months of treatment (incident risk ratio?=?1.16, 95% CI?=?1.04?1.30, p?<?0.01). Conclusion Patients with comorbid PTSD had a poorer outcome from dialectical behaviour therapy than those with BPD alone, possibly because of the negative impact of unaddressed trauma. The results provide further grounds for recently developed treatments targeting BPD traits and PTSD symptoms simultaneously. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim:? To study and compare the type and frequency of injury to indigenous and non-indigenous patients admitted to the Orthopaedic Unit at Cairns Base Hospital. Method and analysis:? Relevant statistics for all patients were entered or calculated: demographics, length of stay, comorbidity and complications were available. After Variance Analysis, age-standardised rates of trauma were tested using confidence intervals. Results:? Of 2254 admissions for trauma in 32 months, 23% were indigenous (12% of the catchment population). Upper limb injuries were significantly higher for all indigenes, these males being admitted three times as frequently as non-indigenous males. Specific lesions showed greater differences and punch injuries were prominent in both indigenous sexes. Indigenous women were much more likely to be the victims of assault or fights than other groups. Conclusions:? Personal injury costs are high in the indigenous community, in human and material terms. More resources should be directed towards injury prevention.

AB  - Abstract The use of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to data independent tandem mass spectrometry with traveling wave ion mobility for detection and structural identification of ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine is described. The experimental design generates 4D data (chromatographic retention time, precursor accurate mass, drift time with associated calculated collisional cross-section, and time-aligned accurate mass diagnostic product ions) for each ionization mode. Confident structure identification depends on satisfying 4D data confirmation in both positive and negative ion mode. Using this methodology, a number of ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine lipids are structurally elucidated from mouse brain lysosomes. It is further determined that several ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine structures are differentially abundant between lysosomes isolated from mouse cortex following traumatic brain injury as compared to that of sham animals. The combined effort of aligning multi-dimensional mass spectrometry data with a well-defined traumatic brain injury model lays the foundation for gaining mechanistic insight in the role lysosomal membrane damage plays in neuronal cell death following brain injury.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND To assess whether the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) detection via a multi (≥12)-core prostate biopsy. METHODS From January 2004 to May 2011, 3,107 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsies due to elevated PSA levels ranging between 3 and 20?ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal exams (DREs). Multivariate logistic analysis was used to assess the potential association of LUTS and PCa detection via biopsy. The predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve. RESULTS The median International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 11, and the mean PSA was 6.81?ng/ml. Of the total subjects, PCa was detected from biopsy in 931 (30.0%) patients. In a comparison of 1,465 patients with IPSS ≥11 and 1,642 patients with IPSS <11, those with a higher IPSS were older, had higher PSA and had a larger prostate, but there were no significant differences in the PCa detection rates. However, in multivariate analysis incorporating other associated variables, a higher IPSS was significantly associated with lower odds of PCa detection (P?=?0.016). Nevertheless, addition of the IPSS did not significantly increase the accuracy of the multivariate model devised for the detection of PCa (P?=?0.098). CONCLUSIONS Although PCa was detected less commonly among men with higher LUTS, LUTS may not provide additional prognostic information beyond that which can be obtained via previously established prognostic factors.

AB  - Structured Abstract Authors??? Strauss RP, Ramsey BL, Edwards TC, Topolski TD, Kapp-Simon KA, Thomas CR, Fenson C, Patrick DL Objectives??? To describe stigma experiences of adolescents with congenital and acquired facial differences. Design??? Used baseline cross-sectional stigma-related responses from a four site (Seattle WA, Galveston TX, Chicago IL and Chapel Hill NC) US study enrolling 185 English speaking, US participants ages 11?18?years old with facial differences (60% male; 80% congenital conditions). Closed-ended, self-administered questions drawn from the Youth Quality of Life Instrument ? Facial Differences Module (YQOL-FD) determined perceptions of stigmatization. Mothers (n?=?153) were independently asked seven matching questions. Results??? Frequencies report combined responses of ?sometimes,??fairly often,? and ?very often.? Mother's responses are in parentheses. ?? 35% (47%) noticed people staring at their face in the past week. ?? 28% (43%) talked with others about how their face looks in the past month. ?? 29% (31%) heard others say something about their face in the past month. ?? 32% (32%) told peers about their facial difference in the past month. ?? 12% (12%) felt left out of doing things with peers because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 11% (8%) got into a fight because of how their face looks in the past month. ?? 20% (18%) were teased about how their face looks in the past month. Conclusions??? Stigma experiences were frequently reported by youth with facial differences and were correlated with independent parental report. This level of stigma suggests that media and public health interventions may be warranted to reduce discrimination, prejudice and negative adolescent social experiences related to facial difference.
