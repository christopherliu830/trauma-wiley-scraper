AB  - Neuropsychological evaluation of persons with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) symptoms is complicated by multiple factors. The authors explored the impact of mechanism of injury, effort testing performance, and neuropsychiatric status in a sample of military veterans (V-TBI) and civilians (C-TBI) with chronic TBI. V-TBI (n?=?74), C-TBI (n?=?67), and healthy civilian control (C-HC) participants (n?=?66), completed a battery of neuropsychological, effort, and self-report neuropsychiatric measures. Results indicated that C-HC and C-TBI participants exhibited comparably low failure rates on effort tests (6% and 3%, respectively). V-TBI participants exhibited significantly higher rates of failure (18%). Subgroups (n?=?20) of effort-screened participants matched for demographics and disability level were compared regarding neuropsychological performance and neuropsychiatric self-report. Both TBI groups exhibited limited neuropsychological impairment, relative to the C-HC participants. The V-TBI group exhibited pronounced neuropsychiatric symptomology compared with the other participant groups. The implications of these findings are discussed for evaluation in the context of disability and litigation. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract??? Traumatic granuloma is an uncommon condition considered to be a benign, reactive lesion that usually affects the tongue. The exact pathogenesis implicated in the development of this lesion is not clear. However, trauma has been found to be a contributing factor in a majority of the cases. Clinically, it often presents as an ulceration or an indurated submucosal mass. Microscopically, it is characterized by a diffuse polymorphic cell infiltrate composed predominantly of eosinophils extending deep into the submucosa causing degeneration of the underlying muscle. Recognition of the lesion is important because it often mimics oral squamous cell carcinoma. But traumatic granuloma is self-limiting and tends to resolve spontaneously. This paper describes a case of traumatic granuloma on the dorsal surface of tongue in a 62-year-old woman. The clinical aspects, pathogenesis and histopathology of this uncommon lesion are discussed with an emphasis on its benign, self-limiting nature.

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Summary Fragility fracture accounts for a large percentage of hospital attendances and admissions in orthopaedic trauma settings. Such fractures occur as a result of weakened bone mainly due to osteoporosis. The majority of this type of fracture occurs in older people who have sustained the injury following minimal trauma or following a fall. The most common reason for hospital admission is following a hip fracture. This chapter considers fragility fracture generally and then focusses on the care of the older following hip fracture. This type of injury presents numerous challenges for the orthopaedic practitioner because it often occurs in frail older people and necessitates surgery followed by a protracted period of rehabilitation. The chapter considers how evidence based practice can be applied to ensuring that this vulnerable group of patients can receive care that is focused on achieving the best outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Despite interest in the nature of the traumatic event required to meet Criterion A for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), little attention has been paid to the diagnostic ramifications of linking PTSD symptoms to a single traumatic event in the context of multiple trauma exposures. In this study, 67 dually diagnosed clients with at least 2 potential Criterion A traumatic events completed the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale twice, in counterbalanced order: once regarding their worst event and once regarding all events. When responding regarding their worst trauma, 53.7% met probable PTSD criteria. This rose to 67.2% when considering all traumas. Although preliminary, these results suggest that linking PTSD symptoms to a single traumatic event excludes a meaningful number of cases who are otherwise indistinguishable based on symptom profile.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether past history of depression is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, and whether history of gestational diabetes is associated with increased rates of postpartum depression. Research design Data for this case?control study consisted of de-identified chart records for 1439 women who received pregnancy care at a large university hospital between 1998 and 2017. Results A history of depression prior to pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes requiring insulin, although not with subtler degrees of gestational hyperglycemia. Diabetes in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Trauma history was associated with both impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy and postpartum depression. Conclusions Past episodes of depression increase risk for the most severe form of gestational diabetes; however, gestational diabetes does not contribute significantly to risk for postpartum depression. This suggests a unidirectional association, unlike the bidirectional association of diabetes with depression among the general population. History of trauma increases risk for both gestational hyperglycemia and postpartum depression, suggesting important health effects of trauma that may differ measurably from those associated with depression.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews psychological trauma from a multilevel developmental psychopathology. This perspective holds that no single approach or discipline adequately encompasses the phenomenon of psychological trauma and how it interacts with development in terms of its impact on the individual. Rather, multiple levels are preferable, including the areas of neurobiology, psychology, psychopathology, and psychiatric diagnosis, individual, familial, societal, cultural, economic, and physical. To address all of these levels, an interdisciplinary team approach is required, with individuals who have expertise in as wide a range of fields as psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, cardiology, internal medicine, statistics, radiology, physics, computer science, psychopharmacology, child development, philosophy and literature. The implication is that no single individual or specialty will have sufficient expertise and knowledge in enough areas to provide an appropriate characterization of the effects of trauma on the individual. Additionally, all of these areas will interact with developmental epoch in different ways. Use of the multilevel developmental psychopathology approach has the promise of being more helpful to individuals affected by psychological trauma.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Facial traumatic events are commonly encountered in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Primary reconstruction is a reliable procedure with function and aesthetic considerations. We conduct a retrospective study of the experience of reconstructing facial traumatic defects in the first stage. One hundred and thirty-two cases (aged 18?65) with facial traumatic events were recruited in the study from 2008 to 2014. Facial traumatic events included injured soft tissue, maxillofacial fractures and facial nerve rupture, which were repaired primarily. After primary reconstruction, encouraging functional and aesthetic outcomes were attained. Ten cases were re-operated to reconstruct partial nasal defect. Four patients who had trouble with disabled occluding relations sought help from dentists. Inconspicuous scar and function restoration were presented. Facial wounds should be reconstructed in the first stage as far as possible. Then, satisfactory functional and aesthetic results can be achieved. However, combined injury should be carefully considered in those traumatic cases before we carry out the reconstructive surgery on the face.

AB  - Background Hospital-acquired anemia is commonly described in people but limited information currently is available regarding its prevalence in animals. Hypothesis/objectives Assess the prevalence of hospital-acquired anemia in hospitalized critically ill dogs and cats, and examine its relationship with phlebotomy practices, transfusion administration, and survival to discharge. Animals Eight hundred and fifty-one client-owned animals (688 dogs and 163 cats). Methods A multicenter, observational study was conducted in which packed cell volume (PCV) was recorded at the time of admission and on subsequent hospitalization days. Signalment, number of blood samples obtained, underlying disease, whether or not blood products were administered, duration of hospitalization, and survival to discharge were recorded. Results Admission anemia prevalence was 32%, with overall prevalence during the hospitalization period of 56%. The last recorded PCV was significantly lower than the admission PCV for both dogs (admission PCV, 42% [range, 6?67%]; last recorded PCV, 34% [range, 4?64%], P < .0001) and cats (admission PCV, 31% [range, 6?55%]; last recorded PCV, 26% [range, 10?46%], P < .0001). Patients that developed anemia had significantly more blood samples obtained (nonanemic, 5 blood samples [range, 2?54]; anemic, 7 blood samples [range, 2?49], P < .0001). Hospitalized cats were significantly more likely to develop anemia compared to dogs (P < .0001), but anemic dogs were significantly less likely to survive to discharge (P = .0001). Surgical patients were at higher risk of developing hospital-acquired anemia compared to medical patients (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.4?0.9; P = .01). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Hospital-acquired anemia occurred frequently, especially in surgical patients. Additional studies focused on the direct effect of phlebotomy practices on the likelihood of anemia development in hospitalized animals are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed at exploring changes in YAP expression and their effect on periodontitis (PD) combined with traumatic occlusion (TO). Materials and Methods BALB/cJ mice were used to establish a PD model by local administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g, ATCC 33277) and a TO model by occlusal elevation (OE) using composite resin bonding on the bilateral maxillary molar. The mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) and pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) were subjected to cyclic tensile/compressive stress and inflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli) to verify in vivo results. Results Severe bone resorption was observed by microCT scanning in OE with P.g group, when compared to OE only and P.g only groups. Mechanical stress caused by OE activated the Hippo-YAP pathway in periodontal tissues and upregulated the expression of JNK/AP-1. OE with P.g further promoted the expression of YAP and JNK/AP1, leading to the upregulation of the JNK/AP-1 related inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL6. Similar results were obtained when osteoblasts were subjected to mechanical stress in vitro. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that periodontitis with TO caused severe inflammation-induced bone resorption. Activation of YAP and upregulation of JNK/AP-1 induced by TO potentially aggravated the symptoms of PD.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Traumatic occlusion (TO) can cause morphofunctional alterations that interfere in the homeostasis of the periodontium. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of TO on the periodontal repair process for teeth following subluxation. Materials and Methods Ninety Wistar rats aged 12 weeks were divided into three groups: control (C), subluxation (S) and subluxation with traumatic occlusion (S+TO). Subluxation was created with an impact force of 900 cN applied by a tensiometer and TO was created with a direct composite resin filling. Healing after two experimental periods of 7 and 21 days was assessed histologically. The Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post hoc tests were used for group comparison. Results At 7 days, there was a significant increase in periodontal ligament (PDL) width and amorphous fundamental substance, as well as a significant bone area reduction in groups S and S+TO. After 21 days, there was a significant PDL width increase in group S+TO, and in the percentage of collagen fibres in group S, whereas group S+TO showed a 52% bone area reduction compared to the same group at 7 days. Subluxation with or without TO caused only superficial root resorption. However, only group S+TO showed damage to the repair process of resorbed root areas after 21 days. Conclusion TO can increase damage to the PDL after subluxation and it can also delay the repair process after PDL damage.

AB  - Clinical data related to GTR therapy for Class II furcations were analyzed from 7 treatment centers that evaluated one of two possible treatment pairs, either bioabsorbable collagen membrane (Type I bovine tendon collagen) (COLL) versus control surgical debridement (DEBR) or COLL versus expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). After initial preparation and re-evaluation, full thickness flaps were reflected, the defects debrided, and the roots planed. Furcations and associated bony defects in each patient were randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatments in each pair, and the flaps closed. Patients received quarterly periodontal maintenance until surgical re-entry at 6 to 12 (mean 11.1) months. Data from 59 pairs of Class II furcations were analyzed via paired t, Wilcoxon signed rank, and RM ANOVA tests. COLL showed better results than DEBR for vertical defect fill, percent defect resolution, and horizontal furcation fill. When COLL was compared to ePTFE in furcations across patients, no differences were found. Both COLL and ePTFE resulted in an improvement in clinical furcation Class about 50% of the time (compared to 7% frequency with DEBR). COLL use yielded 8 and ePTFE yielded 1 clinically-complete furcation closures. COLL barriers resulted in generally favorable clinical results in furcation defects, appeared to be better than DEBR alone, and were at least similar to and often better than ePTFE. COLL of the type used in this study appears to be a useful and beneficial material for regenerative therapy in Class II furcation type periodontal defects. J Periodontol 1996;67:650?657.

AB  - Abstract Background Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) symptoms can significantly differ between patients, fluctuate over time, disappear or persist. This leads to problems in defining recovery and in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Objectives To define recovery from the patients? perspective and better understand their priorities for treatment approaches. Methods Establishing an international consortium, we used a 2-Round Delphi-based study in eight countries across Europe and North America. Participants ≥18 years who met, or had met, Budapest clinical criteria were included. Round 1 participants completed the statement: ?I would/do consider myself recovered from CRPS if/because?? alongside demographic and health questionnaires. Data were thematically organised and represented as 62 statements, from which participants identified and ranked their recovery priorities in Round 2. Results Round 1 (N = 347, 80% female, 91% non-recovered) dominant ICF themes were: activities of daily living; bodily functions; external factors; participation and personal factors. The top five priority statements in Round 2 (N = 252) were: no longer having (1) CRPS-related pain, (2) generalised pain and discomfort, (3) restricted range of movement, (4) need for medication, (5) stiffness in the affected limb. With very few exceptions, priorities were consistent, irrespective of patient demographics/geography. Symptoms affecting daily activities were among those most frequently reported. Conclusions Our data showed a small number of themes are of highest importance to CRPS patients? definition of recovery. Patients want their pain, movement restriction and reliance on medication to be addressed, above all other factors. These factors should therefore be foremost concerns for future treatment and rehabilitation programmes. Significance Those with longstanding CRPS may no longer meet diagnostic criteria but still be symptomatic. Defining recovery is therefore problematic in CRPS. Our study has identified patients? definition of recovery from CRPS, in order of priority, as relief from: their CRPS-related pain, generalised pain, movement restriction, reliance on medication, and stiffness.

AB  - Summary Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for several diseases of the aging brain, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While advancing age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, onset and progression can be strongly influenced by genetics, comorbid conditions, and environmental exposures. Cumulative subconcussive blows, such as those sustained in amateur or professional contact sports, may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite gaps in knowledge, the Committee on Long Term Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of studies, that there was sufficient evidence to support an association between severe TBI and dementia, and a ?suggestive? association between moderate TBI and dementia.

A 30-year-old black South African woman presented with a 10-month history of multiple chronic ulcers appearing on a multidermatomal herpes zoster (HZ) scar. The woman was infected with HIV, and her CD4 count was 45 cells/?L. Histology and PCR revealed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This case highlights an unusual presentation of cutaneous CMV occurring as an isotopic immune response on a pre-existing multidermatomal HZ scar.

AB  - Objectives People living with HIV (PLWH) have multidimensional concerns requiring person-centred care. Routine use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) improves outcomes. No brief PROM currently reflects the breadth of concerns for PLWH. This study sought to identify priority outcomes for PLWH, model current practice, explore views on introducing PROMs into routine care, and devise a model for person-centred care incorporating the PROM. Methods A cross-national multi-centre study (London, Brighton and Dublin) was carried out. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with adult PLWH, HIV health care professionals and HIV commissioners (responsible for planning and commissioning services) were performed. Interviews were analysed using thematic and framework analysis. Results PLWH (n = 28), professionals (n = 21) and commissioners (n = 8) described concerns related to living with HIV across six domains: physical (e.g. pain and gastrointestinal symptoms), cognitive (e.g. memory and sleep), psychological (e.g. anxiety and depression), social (e.g. isolation and intimacy), welfare (e.g. finances and fears regarding change of immigration status), and information (e.g. long-term outcomes) needs. Themes were highly inter-related, impacting across domains of need (e.g. physical and cognitive problems impacting on psychological and social wellbeing). Perceived benefits of using PROMs in routine HIV care included improved person-centredness, patient empowerment, fewer missed concerns, increased engagement with services, and informed planning of services. Potential challenges included heterogeneity of PLWH, literacy, and utility for those who struggle to engage with care. Conclusions This study presents a novel model of person-centred care incorporating an HIV-specific PROM. The model reflects priorities of key stakeholders. Explicit use of PROMs in routine HIV care could afford benefits for PLWH, clinical teams and commissioners.

AB  - Abstract Background Although lung transplantation improves quality of life, most psychosocial research focuses on adverse psychological and social functioning outcomes. Positive effects, particularly in the late-term years as physical morbidities increase, have received little attention. We provide the first data on a psychological benefit ? post-traumatic growth (PTG) ? and we focused on long-term (>5 yr) survivors. Methods Among 178 patients from a prospective study of mental health during the first two yr post-transplant, we recontacted survivors 6?11 yr post-transplant. We assessed PTG (i.e., positive psychological change resulting from the transplant) and examined its relationship to other patient characteristics with multivariable regression analyses. Results Sixty-four patients (86% of survivors) were assessed (M = 8.1 yr post-transplant, SD = 1.2). Mean PTG exceeded the scale's midpoint (M = 38.6, SD = 10.0; scale midpoint = 25). Recipients experiencing greater PTG were female (p = 0.022), less educated (p = 0.014), and had a history of post-transplant panic disorder (p = 0.005), greater friend support (p = 0.048), and better perceived health (p = 0.032). Neither other pre- or post-transplant mood and anxiety disorders nor transplant-related morbidities (acute rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) predicted PTG. Conclusions PTG exceeded levels observed in other chronic disease populations, suggesting that lung transplantation may uniquely foster positive psychological change in long-term survivors. PTG occurs despite physical and psychiatric morbidities. Whether PTG promotes other positive post-transplant psychosocial outcomes deserves attention.

AB  - Background and purpose Enzogenol, a flavonoid-rich extract from Pinus radiata bark with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties has been shown to improve working memory in healthy adults. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), oxidation and inflammation have been linked to poorer cognitive outcomes. Hence, this phase II, randomized controlled trial investigated safety, compliance and efficacy of Enzogenol for improving cognitive functioning in people following mild TBI. Methods Sixty adults, who sustained a mild TBI, 3?12?months prior to recruitment, and who were experiencing persistent cognitive difficulties [Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) score >?38], were randomized to receive Enzogenol (1000?mg/day) or matching placebo for 6?weeks. Subsequently, all participants received Enzogenol for a further 6?weeks, followed by placebo for 4?weeks. Compliance, side-effects, cognitive failures, working and episodic memory, post-concussive symptoms and mood were assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 16?weeks. Simultaneous estimation of treatment effect and breakpoint was effected, with confidence intervals (CIs) obtained through a treatment?placebo balance-preserving bootstrap procedure. Results Enzogenol was found to be safe and well tolerated. Trend and breakpoint analyses showed a significant reduction in cognitive failures after 6?weeks [mean CFQ score, 95% CI, Enzogenol versus placebo ?6.9 (?10.8 to ?4.1)]. Improvements in the frequency of self-reported cognitive failures were estimated to continue until week 11 before stabilizing. Other outcome measures showed some positive trends but no significant treatment effects. Conclusions Enzogenol supplementation is safe and well tolerated in people after mild TBI, and may improve cognitive functioning in this patient population. This study provides Class IIB evidence that Enzogenol is well tolerated and may reduce self-perceived cognitive failures in patients 3?12?months post-mild TBI.
