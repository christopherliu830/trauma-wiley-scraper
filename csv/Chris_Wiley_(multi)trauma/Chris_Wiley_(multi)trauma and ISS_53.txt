AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among people with substance use disorders, and the comorbidity is associated with negative outcomes. We report on a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of integrated cognitive?behavioral therapy (ICBT) plus standard care, individual addiction counseling plus standard care and standard care alone on substance use and PTSD symptoms. Design Three-group, multi-site randomized controlled trial. Setting Seven addiction treatment programs in Vermont and New Hampshire, USA. Participants/Cases Recruitment took place between December 2010 and January 2013. In this single-blind study, 221 participants were randomized to one of three conditions: ICBT plus standard care (SC) (n?=?73), individual addiction counseling (IAC) plus SC (n?=?75) or SC only (n?=?73). One hundred and seventy-two patients were assessed at 6-month follow-up (58 ICBT; 61 IAC; 53 SC). Intervention and comparators: ICBT is a manual-guided therapy focused on PTSD and substance use symptom reduction with three main components: patient education, mindful relaxation and flexible thinking. IAC is a manual-guided therapy focused exclusively on substance use and recovery with modules organized in a stage-based approach: treatment initiation, early abstinence, maintaining abstinence and recovery. SC are intensive out-patient program services that include 9?12 hours of face-to-face contact per week over 2?4 days of group and individual therapies plus medication management. Measurements Primary outcomes were PTSD severity and substance use severity at 6?months. Secondary outcomes were therapy retention. Findings PTSD symptoms reduced in all conditions with no difference between them. In analyses of covariance, ICBT produced more favorable outcomes on toxicology than IAC or SC [comparison with IAC, parameter estimate: 1.10; confidence interval (CI)?=?0.17?2.04; comparison with SC, parameter estimate: 1.13; CI?=?0.18?2.08] and had a greater reduction in reported drug use than SC (parameter estimate: ?9.92; CI?=??18.14?to??1.70). ICBT patients had better therapy continuation versus IAC (P<0.001). There were no unexpected or study-related adverse events. Conclusions Integrated cognitive behavioral therapy may improve drug-related outcomes in post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers with substance use disorder more than drug-focused counseling, but probably not by reducing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms to a greater extent.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the relationship between spirituality, science and therapy was explored. In this paper spirituality is discussed in a more clinical context. Family response to trauma is outlined, concentrating on the area of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and several models of adaptation are reviewed. There appear to he commonalities in response to different types of trauma. However in the area of ABI, positive outcomes have been under-reported in the literature which has focussed for various reasons on maladaptation. In viewing response to trauma as involving both the potential for positive transformation as well as suffering and burden, concepts of Frankl and Jung, spiritual belief and ?near death experience? are discussed. Examples of how families find meaning and positively appraise their experience of ABI are given.

AB  - Literature describing medical treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC) is sparse. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes, including time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST), of canine PC treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or chemotherapy, and to identify prognostic factors. Records from 8 institutions were searched for dogs with cytologically or histologically confirmed PC without bladder involvement: 67 dogs were included. Presenting signs were urinary (25), gastrointestinal ([GI], 11) and systemic (3); 16 dogs had GI and urinary signs, 7 dogs had systemic signs with concurrent GI or urinary signs and in 5 dogs the tumour was an incidental finding. Out of 27 dogs, 9 (33%) had positive urine culture. Metastases were identified in 26 dogs to lymph nodes (19), lungs (10), bone (2) and liver (1). Treatment included NSAIDs and chemotherapy (32), NSAIDs alone (31) and chemotherapy alone (4). The overall MST was 82 days (range 9-752) and median TTP was 63 days (range 9-752). Dogs receiving NSAIDs combined with chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer MST (106 vs 51 days; P?=?.035) and TTP (76 vs 44 days; P?=?.02) compared to dogs receiving NSAIDs alone. Intact dogs and those with metastatic disease had significantly shorter MST (31 vs 90 days, P?=?.018 and 49 vs 109 days, P?=?.037, respectively); intact dogs also had significantly shorter TTP (25 vs 63 days, P?=?.0003). This study suggests that a combination of NSAIDs and chemotherapy may improve outcomes in canine PC. Metastatic disease and being entire negatively influenced prognosis.

AB  - Background and Objective Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by oral bacterial infection, is considered to be a risk factor for systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus, bacterial pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin against periodontal inflammation-induced multiple organ injury in rats. Material and Methods Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups of six rats each: control; lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and LPS + melatonin. During the experimental period (10 d) all rats in the LPS and LPS + melatonin groups were given 10 ?L of LPS (from a 10 mg/mL standard solution of LPS dissolved in saline) on days 1, 3 and 5. The rats in the LPS + melatonin group were given 50 mg/kg of melatonin, daily for 10 d, starting on day 1 after the administration of LPS. All rats were killed at the end of the experimental period. Liver, kidney and lung tissues were removed for investigation by light microscopy. Results The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in the LPS group compared with the LPS + melatonin group (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the serum creatinine levels in the groups. However, the changes in serum AST, ALT and BUN levels in the experimental groups did not correlate with changes in histological data. Both LPS and LPS + melatonin groups displayed structural features similar to those of the control group. Conclusion The results revealed that increased serum AST, ALT and BUN levels following periodontitis are ameliorated with melatonin treatment.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To describe postoperative adverse events (AEs) and outcomes after transoral surgery for bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP). Study Design Prospective observational multicenter study. Methods Thirty-six patients with BVFP underwent transoral surgery using standard surgical procedures to unilaterally widen the glottic area. Postoperative adverse events (AEs) including severe adverse events (SAEs) were registered continuously. Pre- and 6-month postoperative evaluations included the 6-Minute Walk Test, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, the 12-Item Voice Handicap Index (VHI-12), and a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing graded according to the Penetration?Aspiration-Scale. Results The patients underwent posterior cordotomy, partial arytenoidectomy, or permanent laterofixation as single procedures or in combination. Forty-seven percent of the patients had postoperative AEs. Dyspnea was the most frequent AE (45%). In 40% of AEs, the events were severe (SAEs), and 72.5% were related to the study intervention. Revision surgery leading to prolonged hospitalization or rehospitalization was necessary in nine cases (25%). Laterofixation was correlated to a decreased risk of AEs (P?=?0.042). Six months after surgery, a significant improvement was seen in the SF-domains: Physical component score (P?=?0.008), physical functioning (P?=?0.001), physical role (P?=?0.031), and vitality (P?=?0.032). Concerning the voice handicap, only the VHI-12 physical subscore showed a decrease (P?=?0.005). The total score and other VHI-12 subscores did not change significantly (all P?>?0.05). Conclusion BCVP patients profit from modern transoral surgery for unilateral glottic widening; quality of life is improved; and the voice is preserved. Nevertheless, postoperative complications are frequent. Level of Evidence 2b. Laryngoscope, 125:1401?1408, 2015

AB  - Abstract??? The aim of this study was to investigate the current method for recording trauma in UK dental hospitals. A standard questionnaire was sent out to all 19 UK and Irish dental hospitals to investigate how trauma was recorded both at initial presentation and at review appointments. Where a standard form was used, a copy was requested. Each form was analysed to assess what information was being recorded and whether prompts were used. For the initial presentation of trauma, nine institutions had a standard trauma form, one used a standard form for avulsions only, seven had no form and two did not respond. For subsequent follow-up visits of trauma cases, six hospitals had a standard form, one used a standard from for avulsions only, 10 had no form and two did not respond. There was considerable variation in the questions that were asked at initial presentation of trauma cases and follow-up reviews in dento-alveolar trauma. Without consistent recording, there is little chance that multi-centred prospective clinical trials can take place in the field of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Acute cerebral lesions are associated with dysregulation of brain glucose homeostasis. Previous studies showed that knockdown of Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 impaired outcome after middle cerebral artery occlusion and that widely expressed intracellular RS1 (RSC1A1) is involved in transcriptional and post-translational down-regulation of SGLT1. In the present study, we investigated whether SGLT1 is up-regulated during traumatic brain injury (TBI) and whether removal of RS1 in mice (RS1-KO) influences SGLT1 expression and outcome. Unexpectedly, brain SGLT1 mRNA in RS1-KO was similar to wild-type whereas it was increased in small intestine and decreased in kidney. One day after TBI, SGLT1 mRNA in the ipsilateral cortex was increased 160% in wild-type and 40% in RS1-KO. After RS1 removal lesion volume 1 day after TBI was reduced by 12%, brain edema was reduced by 28%, and motoric disability determined by a beam walking test was improved. In contrast, RS1 removal did neither influence glucose and glycogen accumulation 1 day after TBI nor up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-6 or microglia activation 1 or 5 days after TBI. The data provide proof of principle that inhibition or down-regulation of SGLT1 by targeting RS1 in brain could be beneficial for early treatment of TBI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Knee injuries cause structural damage and acute inflammation that initiates the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a member of a family of enzymes that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in normal development of the musculoskeletal system, but may increase ROS production to harmful levels after joint injury. The role of ROS in both normal joint homeostasis and injury is poorly understood, but inhibition of excessive ROS production by Nox4 after joint injury could be protective to the joint, decreasing oxidative stress, and initiation of PTOA. Knee injuries were simulated using inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary human chondrocytes and a non-invasive mouse model of PTOA in C57BL/6N and Nox4 knockout mice. There is an acute decrease in Nox4 activity within 24?h after injury in both systems, followed by a subsequent sustained low-level increase, a novel finding not seen in any other system. Inhibition of Nox4 activity by GKT137831 was protective against early structural changes after non-invasive knee injury in a mouse model. Nox4 knockout mice had significant differences in structural and mechanical properties of bone, providing further evidence for the role of Nox4 in development of joint tissues and biochemical response after joint injury. Nox4 plays a significant role in the acute phase after joint injury, and targeted inhibition of inflammation caused by Nox4 may be protective against early joint changes in the pathogenesis of PTOA. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Translations of summary In this paper, I propose a psychoanalytic reading of some of the writings of Amelia Rosselli, a trilingual poet who, at the age of seven, lost her father Carlo, who was persecuted and murdered by Mussolini's regime. History and her history conflate into personal and collective trauma which defies human possibilities to work through and mourn. Rosselli's work testifies to such predicament of the human subject of the 20th century, his/her dislocation, alienation and internal irreconcilable divisions. In particular I examine Diary in three tongues, which is the most autobiographical of her works and a self-analytic piece, written after the conclusion of her second analysis. In the Diary, Rosselli employs textual strategies which convey the fragmentation and destructuring of language, where her traumatic experience resides as a wound inflicted to the symbolic order. I propose that her writings contain her unconscious memories in an estranged and melancholic language which becomes the crucible to express her impossible mourning, in a complex mixture of Eros and Thanatos which allowed her to survive psychically and to create a very personal experimental poetic discourse which made her a literary figure of international acclaim. My primary engagement will be with Freud's theory of mourning and melancholia and its successive elaboration by Kristeva, who maintains that the melancholic discourse finds its expression in the pre-verbal and infra-verbal aspects of language, which she calls ?semiotics?, in dialectic articulation with its symbolic components. Drawing on literary texts, significant inferences can be made on the psychoanalytic listening to the prosodic aspects of language as the carrier of inchoate forms of representation of that which exceeds language: trauma, raw affects, mnemic traces, that is, the unrepresented and/or unrepresentable.

AB  - Abstract Data from Cardiac Transplant Research Database (CTRD) were analyzed from 1999 to 2006 to examine the effects of different induction strategies at the time of cardiac transplantation. A total of 2090 primary heart transplants were categorized by induction with interleukin-2 receptor blocker (IL-2RB), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or no induction (NI). Probabilities for rejection and infection were estimated with parametric time-related models. Using these models, hazard was calculated for two theoretical patient profiles, one at lower risk for rejection and higher risk of infection (Profile 1) and higher risk for rejection and lower risk of infection (Profile 2). Of the 2090 transplants, 49.8% (1095) did not receive induction, 27.3% (599) received IL-2RB, and 18.0% (396) received ATG. Profile 1 patients had lower hazard for rejection with IL-2RB compared to ATG and NI (p < 0.01), but at the cost of increased risk of infection (5.0 vs. 1.8 vs. 1.6, respectively, at four wk, p < 0.01). Profile 2 patients experienced a fivefold decreased hazard for rejection when treated with IL-2RB compared with ATG and NI (p < 0.01). In patients at high risk of infection, IL-2RB reduced risk of rejection but at the expense of increased hazard for infection.

AB  - Abstract Background Demand for revision total hip replacement (RTHR) is increasing. Outcomes after RTHR are varied, with reasonable pain relief but smaller gains in function and mobility. Whether sub-optimal rehabilitation contributes to poorer functional outcomes is unclear. Current rehabilitation is not well defined and there is little research into RTHR rehabilitation. Aims and objectives To gather information about the current rehabilitation of patients undergoing planned, single-stage revision or re-revision THR surgery. Methods An online survey was developed and sent to clinicians at 117 orthopaedic centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Questions were asked about standard rehabilitation practice pre-operatively, post-operatively and immediately after discharge. The frequency (%) of responses to closed questions was analysed and free-text comments were summarized thematically. Results There were 133 respondents: mostly physiotherapists (92, 69%) and occupational therapists (39, 29%). Pre-operative education was common (112, 84%) but not uniform, and for 52 (46%) the same as for primary THR patients. Respondents were more likely to agree about the general objectives of rehabilitation, for example gait re-education with walking aids (93, 70%), and retraining functional mobility (92, 69%) rather than about specific elements including exercise prescription, duration of hip precautions and provision of occupational therapy. The provision of rehabilitation following discharge varied considerably. Conclusions This survey adds to sparse information about rehabilitation RTHR. No consensus emerged about optimal rehabilitation. The diversity in approach and lack of clear structure suggests work is needed to develop rehabilitation interventions that are tailored to this population.

AB  - Abstract Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was initially conceptualized as a psychopathology that arose as a consequence of war time experiences. More recently, available evidence has demonstrated that post-traumatic stress (PTS) as a consequence of war is buffered by social identity processes. In such contexts, identity resources are arguably more readily accessible given the integral relationship between social identities and intergroup violence. There is no evidence as yet to suggest that social identity processes may act to reduce PTS responses to naturally occurring disasters such as earthquakes and even less data pertaining to non-Western contexts where the impact of such disasters tends to be particularly catastrophic. This article reports on a study undertaken in earthquake-affected regions in Nepal devastated by the April 2015 quake and its major aftershock a month later. Participants (n=399) completed measures of their earthquake experience, Post-Traumatic Stress and Post Traumatic growth (PTG), as well as measures of community identification and collective efficacy. In total 399 people completed the measures approximately six months after the quakes. Results of the study indicated that consistent with tenets of the social identity framework, ethnic and gender group memberships impacted on reported experiences during the earthquake. Reported experience during the quakes and ethnic group membership were both related to increased symptoms of PTS. Ethnicity was also linked to the proportion of respondents reporting clinical levels of PTSD symptoms. The relationship between earthquake experience and PTG was mediated by community identification and collective efficacy. Earthquake experience also had an indirect effect on PTS through collective efficacy. Implications of these findings for those working with traumatized groups are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective: An innovative health?justice partnership was established to deliver legal assistance to women experiencing family violence who attended an Australian hospital. This paper reports on a multifaceted response to build capacity and willingness of health professionals to identify signs of family violence and engage with referral pathways to on-site legal assistance. Methods: A Realistic Evaluation analysed health professionals? knowledge and attitudes towards identification, response and referral for family violence before and after training; and use of referral pathways. Results: Of 123 health professionals participating in training, 67 completed baseline and follow-up surveys. Training improved health professionals? self-reported knowledge of, and confidence in, responding to family violence and understanding of lawyers? roles in hospitals. Belief that patients should be referred to on-site legal services increased. Training did not correspond to actual increased referrals to legal assistance. Conclusion: The program built capacity and willingness of health professionals to identify signs of, and respond to, family violence. Increase in referral rates to legal assistance was not shown. Potential improvements include better data capture and greater availability of legal services. Implications for public health: Strong hospital system supports and reliable recording of family violence referrals need to be in place before introducing such partnerships to other hospitals.

AB  - Polyurethane hydrogel foams synthesized through a facile one-pot, solvent-free process are described. The roles of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecular weight, crosslinking density, and foam stabilizer concentration on polymer properties are evaluated for potential applications as wound dressing materials. Material characterization and wound dressing relevant performance evaluations are performed to understand effects of individual components and identify promising formulations. Surprisingly for a solvent-free reaction, complete polymerization is confirmed by IR and gel fraction analyses. Foam stabilizing agent loading increases mechanical properties including Young's modulus, extensibility, and toughness while decreasing pore size and drug release rate. Mechanical properties are also dependent on the crystalline melting temperature of the PEG diol. Utilizing caffeine as a drug surrogate, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) drug-release analysis identifies that polyurethane hydrogel foams exhibit initial burst release kinetics followed by sustained release over 24 h. Antibiotic compatibility and release is demonstrated for all formulations by zone of inhibition testing against gram-positive and negative bacteria.

AB  - Abstract Aim This is a study protocol to investigate nurses' perspectives on refugee health care in two countries. The aims are to: (a) explore self-reported work environment factors, including work stressors, self-rated leadership, staffing and resources adequacy, and teamwork among Jordanian and Lebanese nurses caring for refugees; (b) investigate the relationship between nurse related outcomes (physical health; emotional exhaustion) and their psychosocial work environment; and (c) assess the association between nurses' perceived work environment factors and implicit rationing of care and quality of patient care. Background Globally, the care of refugees is achieving increased attention. Over 6.3 million people are internally displaced and 4.8 million recorded Syrian expatriates are residing in and receiving healthcare services in the neighbouring host countries. Design This is a cross-sectional, comparative study using a survey design. Method The study setting involves both private and public hospitals and primary healthcare centres that provide care to refugees on regular basis in Lebanon and Jordan. The estimated sample size includes 3,000 Registered Nurses from Lebanon and 2,500 nurses and midwives from Jordan. Discussion Workplace factors affecting quality of nursing care and psychosocial status of nurses caring for refugees will be identified. Potential findings will help leaders design interventions to support nurses who are serving refugees for safer care and better patient outcomes. Findings will assist in more efficient resource allocation and management. Impact New knowledge on the impact of providing health care for refugees will be generated based on the structure of nursing care (e.g., work environment), on the nursing process (e.g., implicit rationing of care), and nurse outcomes (health) in two hosting communities. Moreover, factors enabling resilience in patients, providers, and systems will be identified and be of potential use in addressing the growing global problem of caring for displaced persons.

AB  - Abstract Aims The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the Occlutech Figulla Flex II Occluder (OFFII) with the Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO) in patients >?8kg undergoing transcatheter ASD closure. Methods and results Randomized, controlled, multi-center prospective clinical trial with randomization 2:1 in favor of the OFFII. Primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of successful device placement and defect closure without major complications at hospital discharge. All data were assessed through a core laboratory. Interim analysis was performed when 70% of the patients were treated to evaluate for noninferiority. From a total of 176 randomized subjects, interim analysis was performed on the first 158 patients (65.2% female) (107 OFFII/51 ASO) undergoing device closure at a median weight of 42?kg (range 13-125?kg). Seventy-six percent (120 patients) completed 6-month follow-up. Successful device placement (first attempt) was achieved in 99.1% of the OFF group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.05). Early efficacy success was achieved in 94.4% of the OFFII group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.001). The incidence of major complications was 5.6% for the OFFII group compared to 9.8% for the ASO. Conclusions The OFFII device was not inferior to the ASO with less complications and greater efficacy than the ASO.

AB  - Abstract Purpose? Child sexual abuse (CSA) is rarely addressed in the Arab world. This study examined the prevalence, risk factors and consequences associated with CSA in Lebanese children before, during and after the 2006 Hezbollah-Israeli war. Method? A total of 1028 Lebanese children (556 boys; 472 girls) were administered an interview questionnaire that included the International Child Abuse Screening Tool, the Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Family Functioning in Adolescence Questionnaire. Results? In total, 249 (24%) children reported at least one incident of CSA; 110 (11%) occurred before the war, 90 (8%) took place in the 1-year period after the war to the time of the data collection and 49 (5%) occurred during the 33-day war. There were no gender differences in CSA reports before or after the war, but boys reported more incidents during the war than did girls. Girls who reported CSA had higher trauma-related symptoms for sleep disturbance, somatization, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and anxiety than did boys. There were geographic differences in the reports of abuse that may be associated with poverty and living standards. Logistic regression analyses correctly classified 89.9% of the cases and indicated that children's age, family size, fathers' education level and family functioning significantly predicted CSA during the period following the war. Conclusions? The prevalence of CSA in the current study is within the reported international range. Given the increase in the incidents of CSA during the war and the significant findings for family-related risk factors, there is an urgent need to provide multi-component culturally appropriate interventions that target the child and the family system in times of peace and conflict.
