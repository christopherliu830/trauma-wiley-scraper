AB  - SUMMARY Objective To document blood component usage in the UK medical treatment facility, Afghanistan, over a period of 4 years; and to examine the relationship with transfusion capability, injury pattern and survival. Background Haemostatic resuscitation is now firmly established in military medical practice, despite the challenges of providing such therapy in austere settings. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of blood component use in service personnel admitted for trauma. Data were extracted from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. Results A total of 2618 patients were identified. Survival increased from 76 to 84% despite no change in injury severity. The proportion of patients receiving blood components increased from 13 to 32% per annum; 417 casualties received massive transfusion (≥10 units of RCC), the proportion increasing from 40 to 62%. Use of all blood components increased significantly in severely injured casualties, to a median (IQR) of 16 (9?25) units of red cell concentrate (P?=?0·006), 15 (8?24) of plasma (P?=?0·002), 2 (0?5) of platelets (P?<?0·001) and 1 (0?3) of cryoprecipitate (P?<?0·001). Cryoprecipitate (P?=?0·009) and platelet use (P?=?0·005) also increased in moderately injured casualties. Conclusions The number of blood components transfused to individual combat casualties increased during the 4-year period, despite no change in injury severity or injury pattern. Survival also increased. Combat casualties requiring massive transfusion have a significantly higher chance of survival than civilian patients. Survival is the product of the entire system of care. However, we propose that the changes in military transfusion practice and capability have contributed to increased combat trauma survival.

AB  - Abstract White matter damage is an important consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans. Unlike rodents, ferrets have a substantial amount of white matter and a gyrencephalic brain; therefore, they may represent an ideal small mammal model to study human-pertinent consequences of TBI. Here we report immunohistochemical and behavioral results after a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury to the sensorimotor cortex of adult male ferrets. We assessed inflammation in the neocortex and white matter, and behavior at 1 day post injury and 1, 4, and 16 weeks post injury (WPI). CCI in the ferret produced inflammation that originated in the neocortex near the site of the injury and progressed deep into the white matter with time. The density of microglia and astrocytes increased in the neocortex near the injury, peaking at 4WPI and remaining elevated at 16WPI. Microglial morphology in the neocortex was significantly altered in the first 4 weeks, but showed a return toward normal at 16 weeks. Clusters of microglial cells in the white matter persisted until 16WPI. We assessed motor and cognitive behavior using the open field, novel object recognition, T-maze, and gait tests. A transient deficit in memory occurred at 4WPI, with a reduction of rearing and motor ability at 12 and 16WPI. Behavioral impairments coincide with features of the inflammatory changes in the neocortex revealed by immunohistochemistry. The ferret represents an important animal model to explore ongoing damage in the white matter and cerebral cortex after TBI.

AB  - We assess fiscal performances in G7 and selected Latin American and Asian countries. We consider two questions: (i) Have public finances been sustainable? (ii) Do countries follow more restrictive fiscal policies when debt starts to rise? We find that: (i) the traditional unit root tests often overlook the corrective actions taken by many governments; controlling for structural breaks changes the non-stationarity results dramatically among the three groups; (ii) estimation of a reaction function for governments, expanded by incorporating structural breaks, provides further evidence for significant active anti-debt policies among G7 countries, and to a lesser extent in the other regions.

AB  - Abstract No standard of care is currently recognized for treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC). This retrospective study assesses outcome following definitive-intent, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (RT) in dogs with PC. Medical records review was performed, including 18 patients from four institutions undergoing definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiotherapy to treat PC. Diagnosis was incidental in 7/18 (39%) patients. Five dogs (28%) had evidence of metastasis to loco-regional lymph nodes at diagnosis. Seventeen patients received concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 15/18 (83%) patients received maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy, with variable drugs and protocols employed. Total prescribed radiation dose ranged from 48 to 54?Gy (median 50?Gy) delivered as daily doses of 2.5-2.8 Gy. One patient was euthanized prior to completing radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was observed in nine patients; Grade 1-2 diarrhoea was the most common toxicity observed. Suspected late toxicity (urethral stricture, ureteral stricture and hindlimb oedema) was observed in three patients. Median event-free survival (EFS) following RT was 220?days, and median overall survival was 563?days. Local progression occurred in seven patients at a median of 241?days. Median overall survival was significantly longer in incidentally diagnosed dogs (581 vs 220?days in symptomatic dogs, P = .042). EFS was significantly longer in patients treated with MTD chemotherapy (241 vs 25?days, P <?.001), and significantly shorter in patients presenting with evidence of metastatic disease (109?days) vs those without (388?days, P = .008). These findings suggest that definitive-intent radiotherapy is a valuable treatment option for local control of canine PC with moderate risk of toxicity.

AB  - Medical Education 2010: 44: 1016?1026 Context? Burnout is prevalent among medical students and is a predictor of subsequent serious consideration of dropping out of medical school and suicide ideation. Understanding of the factors that protect against burnout is needed to guide student wellness programmes. Methods? A total of 1321 medical students attending five institutions were studied longitudinally (2006?2007). The surveys included standardised instruments to evaluate burnout, quality of life, fatigue and stress. Additional items explored social support, learning climate, life events, employment status and demographics. Students who did not have burnout at either time-point (resilient students) were compared with those who indicated burnout at one or both time-points (vulnerable students) using a Wilcoxon?Mann?Whitney test or Fisher?s exact test. Similarly, the differences between those who recovered and those who were chronically burned out were also compared in students with burnout at the first time-point. Logistic regression modelling was employed to evaluate associations between the independent variables and resiliency to and recovery from burnout. Results? Overall, 792 (60.0%) students completed the burnout inventory at both time-points. No differences in demographic characteristics were observed between resilient (290/792 [36.6%]) and vulnerable (502/792 [63.4%]) students. Resilient students were less likely to experience depression, had a higher quality of life, were less likely to be employed, had experienced fewer stressful life events, reported higher levels of social support, perceived their learning climate more positively and experienced less stress and fatigue (all p?<?0.05) than vulnerable students. On multivariable analysis, perceiving student education as a priority for faculty staff, experiencing less stress, not being employed and being a minority were factors independently associated with recovery from burnout. Conclusions? Modifiable individual factors and learning climate characteristics including employment status, stress level and perceptions of the prioritising of student education by faculty members relate to medical students? vulnerability to burnout.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The chronic effects of neurotrauma consortium (CENC) observational study is a multisite investigation designed to examine the long-term longitudinal effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). All participants in this initial CENC cohort had a history of deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), and/or their follow-on conflicts (Operation Freedom's Sentinel). All participants undergo extensive medical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments and either meet criteria for any lifetime mTBI or not. These assessments are integrated into six CENC core studies?Biorepository, Biostatistics, Data and Study Management, Neuroimaging, and Neuropathology. Methods The current study outlines the quantitative neuroimaging methods managed by the Neuroimaging Core using FreeSurfer automated software for image quantification. Results At this writing, 319 participants from the CENC observational study have completed all baseline assessments including the imaging protocol and tertiary data quality assurance procedures. Conclusions/Discussion The preliminary findings of this initial cohort are reported to describe how the Neuroimaging Core manages neuroimaging quantification for CENC studies.

AB  - This case study reports the outcome of dorsal and ventral stabilisation of a traumatic cervical instability in a dog. A 2-year-old, male Pointer was admitted following a motor vehicle accident. Clinical examination revealed non-ambulatory tetraparesis, severe neck pain and upper motor neuron changes in all limbs. Deep pain response was present. Subluxation of C2/3 and fractures of the dorsal spinous process and lamina of C2 were observed on radiographs. Ventral stabilisation was performed with screws and bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate). For dorsal fixation of the fractures, screws and cerclage wire were used. The dog stood up independently after 1 month, was able to walk 1.5 months postoperatively and had recovered completely at 1 year following surgery. We conclude that combined stabilisation techniques are effective for this type of cervical fracture in which the dorsal, middle and ventral structures of the vertebra are severely disrupted.

AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that abnormal brain functional connectivity may be the neural underpinning of addiction to illicit drugs and of relapse after successful cessation therapy. Aberrant brain networks have been demonstrated in addicted patients and in newly abstinent addicts. However, it is not known whether abnormal brain connectivity patterns persist after prolonged abstinence. In this cross-sectional study, whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (8 min) were collected from 30 heroin-addicted individuals after a long period of abstinence (more than 3 years) and from 30 healthy controls. We first examined the group differences in the resting-state functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in relapse-related processes, including craving and reactivity to stress following acute and protracted withdrawal from heroin. We then examined the relation between the duration of abstinence and the altered NAc functional connectivity in the heroin group. We found that, compared with controls, heroin-dependent participants exhibited significantly greater functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the NAc and weaker functional connectivity between the NAc and the left putamen, left precuneus, and supplementary motor area. However, with longer abstinence time, the strength of NAc functional connectivity with the left putamen increased. These results indicate that dysfunction of the NAc functional network is still present in long-term-abstinent heroin-dependent individuals. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Data about the predictive value of quantitative diffusion-weighted MRI in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is lacking. This study aimed to determine if specific apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds could be determined that correlate with outcome in moderate-severe TBI. METHODS This retrospective observational study investigated patients with moderate-severe TBI. MRIs obtained post-injury days 1-13 were analyzed. MRIs were obtained on a 1.5T scanner; 20-23 contiguous diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sections with a spin-echo echo planar imaging DWI 256?256 reconstructed matrix; field of view 24?24 cm; slice thickness/gap of 5/1.5 or 5/2.5 mm. The ADC value of each brain tissue voxel was determined. The percentage of voxels below different ADC thresholds was calculated and correlated with outcome. A good outcome was defined as discharge to home or a rehabilitation facility. RESULTS Seventy-six patients were analyzed. Thirty-five patients (46%) had a good outcome. The timing of MRI scans did not differ between groups, but the mean age did (42±18 years vs. 56±19 years, p<.01, good vs. poor outcome). Patients with poor outcome had significantly higher percentage of brain volume with ADC < 400?10-6 mm2/second (.85±.67% vs. .60±.29%, poor vs. good outcome, p<.05). Using a ROC curve analysis and Youden's index, an ADC <400?10-6 mm2/second in ≥.49% of brain was 85% sensitive and 46% specific for poor outcome (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative MRI offers additional prognostic information in acute TBI. A whole brain tissue ADC threshold of <400?10-6 mm2/second in ≥.49% of brain may be a novel prognostic biomarker.

AB  - Abstract The Chocolate BAR study is a prospective multicenter post-market registry designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Chocolate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter in a broad population with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The primary endpoint is acute procedural success (defined as ≤30% residual stenosis without flow-limiting dissection); secondary long-term outcomes include freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), major unplanned amputation, survival, and patency. A total of 262 patients (290 femoropopliteal lesions) were enrolled at 30 US centers between 2012 and 2014. The primary endpoint of procedure success was achieved in 85.1% of cases, and freedom from stenting occurred in 93.1%. Bail out stenting by independent adjudication occurred in 1.6% of cases and there were no flow limiting dissections. There was mean improvement of 2.1 Rutherford classes (±1.5) at 12-months, with 78.5% freedom from TLR, 97.2% freedom from major amputation, and 93.3% freedom from all-cause mortality. Core Lab adjudicated patency was 64.1% at 12 months. Use of the Chocolate balloon in an ?all-comers? population achieved excellent procedural outcomes with low dissection rates and bailout stent use.

The current study used a cross-sectional observational design to evaluate the relationship between psychological, physiological, and contextual factors and headache severity among 133 deployed military personnel and 4 civilian contractors diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) referred to a combat support hospital in Iraq. Background.? Although TBI and headache sequelae have been documented for military combatants, little is known about factors associated with headache severity. Methods.? Military personnel (n?=?157) and civilian (n?=?4) contractors referred to a combat support hospital in Iraq underwent a standardized intake evaluation which included computerized neurocognitive testing, psychological and physical health questionnaires, a clinical interview, and a physical examination by a physician. Results.? Results of zero-inflated Poisson regression modeling suggest that insomnia is associated with increased likelihood for endorsement of any headache, but loss of consciousness, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and slowed reaction time only are predictive of headache severity. Among the subset of patients presenting to the combat support hospital within 7 days of mTBI (n?=?101), number of TBI symptoms demonstrated a non-significant trend toward increased likelihood of headache endorsement of any kind, with loss of consciousness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and slowed reaction time demonstrating significant relationships with headache severity. Conclusion.? Knowledge of predictors of post-concussive headache onset and severity may assist clinicians in making important decisions regarding treatment recommendations for veterans with mTBI.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the integral roles and major influences of Emergency Medicine and emergency healthcare delivery on the past and present U. S. disaster response capabilities. These influences have occurred across all types of hazards (intentional, technological, and natural) and across all phases of comprehensive emergency management (mitigation, preparation, response, recovery). National Incident Management System (NIMS), issued by the US Department of Homeland Security in 2004 and revised in 2008 describes not only Incident Management Teams for direct management of the impacts of an incident but also describes Multiagency Coordination Systems (MACS). These concepts become increasingly important in effective public health and health care emergency response and are becoming more refined. Future roles and responsibilities are also explored, including the emerging concept of Emergency Public Health as a distinct discipline.

AB  - Background PTSD in youth may lead to long-lasting psychological implications, educational difficulties and increased healthcare costs. Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological interventions for children and young people with PTSD. Methods A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 10 psychological interventions and no treatment for children and young people with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion. Results Cognitive therapy for PTSD, a form of individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), appeared to be the most cost-effective intervention for children and young people with PTSD (with a probability of .78 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY), followed by narrative exposure (another form of individual TF-CBT), play therapy, and other forms of individual TF-CBT. After excluding cognitive therapy from the analysis, narrative exposure appeared to be the most cost-effective option with a .40 probability of being cost-effective amongst the remaining 10 options. EMDR, parent training and group TF-CBT occupied middle cost-effectiveness rankings. Family therapy and supportive counselling were less cost-effective than other active interventions. There was limited evidence for some interventions, in particular cognitive therapy for PTSD and parent training. Conclusions Individual forms of TF-CBT and, to a lesser degree, play therapy appear to be cost-effective in the treatment of children and young people with PTSD. Family therapy and supportive counselling are unlikely to be cost-effective relative to other interventions. There is a need for well-conducted studies that examine the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of a range of psychological treatments for children and young people with PTSD.
