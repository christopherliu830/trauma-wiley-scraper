AB  - Objective To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Seldinger technique by non-urology trained (NUT) doctors for difficult male indwelling urinary catheter (IDC) insertions. Patients and Methods In all, 115 patients and 57 participating NUT doctors were recruited by the urologist or urology registrar, when contacted in regards to failed IDC insertion. The successful passage of an IDC by the NUT doctors using the Seldinger technique with a straight, hydrophilic guidewire was assessed in our prospective, multicentre evaluation. Instruction of this technique was via bedside teaching by the urology registrar or via video media. Results The 115 patients, involving 57 NUT doctors, were prospectively evaluated across four sites; 93% (107/115) of cases had successful placement of an IDC with the Seldinger technique by a NUT doctor. No complications with the Seldinger technique were recorded. In 80 patients (69.6%), the technique was successfully performed by a NUT doctor without attendance by a urologist or urology registrar, with instruction provided from video media or prior bedside teaching by the urology registrar. Conclusions Our study is the first to validate the safety and effectiveness of the Seldinger technique for difficult male IDC insertion performed by NUT doctors. This technique can be taught via video education and thus has important implications for health services where urological support is not readily available.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of childhood disability, and is associated with elevated risk for long-term social impairment. Though social (pragmatic) communication deficits may be among the most debilitating consequences of childhood TBI, few studies have examined very long-term communication outcomes as children with TBI make the transition to young adulthood. In addition, the extent to which reduced social function contributes to externalizing behaviors in survivors of childhood TBI remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the extent of social communication difficulty among young adult survivors of childhood TBI (n = 34, injury age: 1.0?7.0 years; M time since injury: 16.55 years) and examine relations among aspects of social function including emotion perception, social communication and externalizing behaviors rated by close-other proxies. Compared to controls the TBI group had significantly greater social communication difficulty, which was associated with more frequent externalizing behaviors and poorer emotion perception. Analyses demonstrated that reduced social communication mediated the association between poorer emotion perception and more frequent externalizing behaviors. Our findings indicate that socio-cognitive impairments may indirectly increase the risk for externalizing behaviors among young adult survivors of childhood TBI, and underscore the need for targeted social skills interventions delivered soon after injury, and into the very long-term.

AB  - Summary Sleep disturbances are a hallmark feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have examined sleep quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), a technique able to detect subtle differences that polysomnography does not capture. We hypothesized that greater high-frequency qEEG would reflect ?hyperarousal? in combat veterans with PTSD (n?=?16) compared to veterans without PTSD (n?=?13). EEG power in traditional EEG frequency bands was computed for artifact-free sleep epochs across an entire night. Correlations were performed between qEEG and ratings of PTSD symptoms and combat exposure. The groups did not differ significantly in whole-night qEEG measures for either rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep. Non-significant medium effect sizes suggest less REM beta (opposite to our hypothesis), less REM and NREM sigma and more NREM gamma in combat veterans with PTSD. Positive correlations were found between combat exposure and NREM beta (PTSD group only), and REM and NREM sigma (non-PTSD group only). Results did not support global hyperarousal in PTSD as indexed by increased beta qEEG activity. The correlation of sigma activity with combat exposure in those without PTSD and the non-significant trend towards less sigma activity during both REM and NREM sleep in combat veterans with PTSD suggests that differential information processing during sleep may characterize combat-exposed military veterans with and without PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Work-related traumatic psychological injuries are a significant health problem that can result in distress and disability. To improve outcomes following a workplace trauma, the Workers' Compensation Board of Alberta (WCB-AB) has developed and implemented an evidence-based care model (CM) to assist its staff to manage these claims. A CM acts as a disability management ?road map? that illustrates typical recovery patterns, treatment best practices, and checkpoints where decisions for further service provision can be made. The model was developed from a recent literature review, and the opinions of local and international experts in the field of traumatic psychological injury. A formal evaluation of the effectiveness of this model is being planned.

These are the first known infanticides and forced copulation in spider monkeys. Data were gathered from four neighboring communities of spider monkeys in Manu National Park at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station, Peru and two communities in the Otoch Ma'ax Yetel Kooh Reserve at Punta Laguna, Mexico, during intensive field studies of over 2,000?hr each. These are rare behaviors, but results suggest that mating history and sexual coercion are important in spider monkey social relationships. Am. J. Primatol. 70:485?489, 2008. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives. This study investigated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and illness perceptions in people who suffered the acute medical trauma of a myocardial infarction (MI) or a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The study tested hypotheses regarding changes in PTSD symptoms and illness perceptions over time, associations between PTSD and illness perceptions and cognitive predictors of PTSD. Design and method. The study employed a longitudinal design and measured the illness perceptions and PTSD symptoms of an MI group (N = 17) and a SAH group (N = 27). Data were collected within 2 weeks of admission (T1), 6 weeks after admission (T2) and 3 months after admission (T3). Statistical analysis was undertaken to examine associations between illness perceptions and PTSD and to examine cognitive predictors of PTSD. Results. The prevalence of PTSD within the total acute medical trauma sample was 16% at 2 weeks, 35% at 6 weeks and 16% at 3 months. Illness perception factors of identity, timeline (acute/chronic), consequences and emotional representation were strongly correlated with PTSD at all three time points. PTSD symptoms and illness perceptions were shown to have changed over time. The results also showed that several illness perception factors are significant predictors of PTSD. Conclusions. Both PTSD symptoms and illness perceptions changed significantly over time following an MI or SAH. Illness perception factors are significant predictors of PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Aims To examine the efficacy of using fibrin glue (FG) as an interpositioning layer in the repair of complicated vesioovaginal fistulae (VVFe) as compared to the classical repair using martius flaps (Ml?). Methods The study was conducted in 3 African institutions. Forty female patients with complicated VVFs were randomized into 2 groups. Group A were repaired anatomically using PG as interpositioning layer. Group B were repaired anatomically using MF as an interpositioning layer. FG used in this study was prepared from patients own blood. Complicating factors were recurrence, local moderate lo severe fibrosis, fistula location involving the bladder neck, and or size of the fistola being more than 1.5 cm in its largest diameter. Patients were evaluated after 2 weeks, one month and 3 months postoperatively. Results Thirty eight patients were evaluable as 2 patients, one from each group, lost to follow-up. Patient demographics were not different between the two study groups. The frequency of occurrence of complicating factors was not different between the 2 groups. Thirteen of group A and eleven from group B were rendered dry and that was maintained for as long as they were followed-up. The difference in the outcome was not statistically significant. Conclusion The use of FG as an interpositioning layer during the vaginal anatomical repair of complicated VVF appears to be of great value as an alternative to the use of MF interpositioning. Decreasing the operative time and adding simplicity to the already complicated procedure are additional values of using this procedure. Neurourol. Urodynam. 28:438?441, 2009. ? 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND Blood platelets (PLTs) are a valuable commodity. Management of their inventory has implications both for patient care and for the cost of health care delivery. There are a variety of different methods of managing PLT inventory currently in practice and multiple theoretical models aimed at improving PLT inventory metrics. In this study we evaluate the ability of a novel electronic dashboard system that monitors and displays both PLT inventory and patient data to improve transfusion metrics at a quaternary health care center. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The Capital District Health Authority is a quaternary health care center that transfuses approximately 2500 PLT units annually. To improve PLT discard rates a novel, low-overhead system that interfaces with the laboratory information system and displays real-time data between transfusion sites on PLT inventory and orders was implemented in November 2011. This study examines the transfusion quality metrics data from the 24 months before and after implementation. RESULTS A significant reduction in mean monthly PLT outdate rate was observed after the implementation of the PLT dashboard suite from 24.5% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%) to 15.1% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%; p?<?0.001). PLT age at time of transfusion was also reduced from 3.60 days (n?=?4796, SD?±?0.97 days) to 3.46 days (n?=?4881, SD?±?1.00 days; p?<?0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study describes the implementation of a novel PLT dashboard suite. This suite significantly reduced PLT outdate rates at our institution over the 48-month study period.

AB  - Abstract Brain age prediction using machine-learning techniques has recently attracted growing attention, as it has the potential to serve as a biomarker for characterizing the typical brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet one long-standing problem is that the predicted brain age is overestimated in younger subjects and underestimated in older. There is a plethora of claims as to the bias origins, both methodologically and in data itself. With a large neuroanatomical dataset (N?=?2,026; 6?89 years of age) from multiple shared datasets, we show this bias is neither data-dependent nor specific to particular method including deep neural network. We present an alternative account that offers a statistical explanation for the bias and describe a simple, yet efficient, method using general linear model to adjust the bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of bias adjustment with a large multi-modal neuroimaging data (N?=?804; 8?21 years of age) for both healthy controls and post-traumatic stress disorders patients obtained from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. Procedure This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m2/day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m2/day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Results Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m2/day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10?3 by polymerase chain reaction?based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Conclusions Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m2/day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To examine the prospective associations among peer victimization and somatic symptoms across 5 years of adolescence using multiple informants and disaggregating effects at the within-person and between-person level. Methods From age 13?17 years, 612 Canadian children (54% girls; 76% White) completed measures of peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Parents (89% mothers) reported on their child's somatic symptoms. We built autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals, controlling for diagnosed medical and psychiatric conditions, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results Within-person, self-reported somatic symptoms were stable across time and there were bidirectional associations between peer victimization and somatic symptoms across the 5-year period. The magnitude of effect was strongest from somatic symptoms to peer victimization. Between-person, being a girl or having a psychiatric diagnosis predicted higher mean levels and rising trajectories of somatic symptoms and higher mean levels of peer victimization. The level of peer victimization among non-White participants increased over time. In the parent-reported model, somatic symptoms were less stable and did not predict peer victimization. Conclusions The results highlight the dynamic processes between peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Increased effort is needed to protect adolescents with psychiatric problems, girls, and ethnic minorities from peer abuse.

AB  - The aim of this study was to prove the effectiveness of MatriDerm? combined with skin grafting versus skin grafting alone in post-traumatic wounds treatment. At the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, we treated 60 patients: 30 patients with dermal substitutes (MatriDerm?) combined with autologous skin graft and 30 with skin graft alone. Two weeks after the first treatment, 95% of wounds treated with MatriDerm? and skin graft showed a re-epithelisation, whereas it was 75?80% in the control group. We used the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and patient's self-estimation scale to assess the outcomes. Mann?Whitney U test was performed for the five items of the MSS and the results were combined to those of patient's self-estimation scale and the re-epithelialisation percentage to test the significance between the two groups. These data confirm the evidence of the clinical use of MatriDerm? technology in the healing of soft tissue wounds and prove the effectiveness of combining MatriDerm? and skin grafting for the first time. Furthermore, we observed a percentage reduction of wound contraction and in the same time an improvement of elasticity, quality of scars tissue and dermal architecture.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of death and dismal outcome among children and young adults. The morbidity and mortality differ but more aggressive monitoring and more designated neuro intensive care units have improved the results. Studies have demonstrated a connection between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and outcome after TBI, but few are prospective and none is from northern Europe. APOE has three alleles: ?2, ?3 and ?4. Methods: A total of 96 patients with Glasgow coma score (GCS) ≤8 were prospectively and consecutively included. APOE genotypes were all analyzed at the same laboratory from blood samples by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: All patients were assessed at 1 year with Glasgow outcome scale extended (GOSE), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Barthel daily living index. The genotype was available in all patients. Twenty-six patients expressed APOE ?4 while 70 patients did not. Outcome demonstrated that patients with APOE ?4 had worse outcome vs. those lacking this allele. When subdividing patients into gender, males with APOE ?4 did worse, a difference not detected among female patients. Conclusions: APOE ?4 correlated to worse outcome in TBI patients. We also found that males with APOE ?4 had poor outcome while females did not. Thus, the results indicate that genetic polymorphism may influence outcome after TBI.

AB  - Abstract The unconscious impact of differences in culture and social class is discussed from the perspective of an analyst practising in London whose ?foreign accent? prevents patients from placing her within the social stratifications by which they feel confined. Because she is seen by them as an analyst from both ?inside? and ?outside? the British psycho-social fabric and cultural complex, this opens a space in the transference that enables fuller exploration of the impact of the British social class system on patients? experience of themselves and their world. The paper considers this impact as a trans-generational trauma of living in a society of sharp socio-economic divisions based on material property. This is illustrated with the example of a patient who, at the point of moving towards the career to which he aspired, was unable to separate a sense of personal identity from the social class he so desperately wanted to leave behind and walk the long avenue of individuation. The dearth of literature on the subject of class is considered, and the paper concludes that not enough attention is given to class identification in training.

AB  - Abstract 1. Wildlife tourism can be prone to unmitigated development to promote visitor satisfaction that is all too often progressed at the cost of ecological integrity. A manager is thus faced with the dual task of enhancing the tourist experience and protecting the wildlife species. Accordingly, this mandate requires research into how tourists would respond to proposed wildlife-management plans. 2. This study examines the heterogeneity of tourist preferences for wildlife management at a stingray-feeding attraction in the Cayman Islands, using a latent class stated preference choice model. A sample of visitors to Stingray City Sandbar (SCS) evaluated hypothetical wildlife viewing experiences in a discrete choice experiment. Its scenarios were characterized by seven attributes such as animal-feeding and handling rules, ecological outcomes, social crowding, and management cost (defined as a conservation access fee). 3. The latent class segmentation identified two groups in the population: approximately 68% preferred the implementation of fairly strict management rules, while the other 32% valued more the maintenance of status quo with its intensive human ? wildlife interactions. Despite the differences between the ?pro-management? and the ?pro-current? segments, both exhibited a preference for the continuation of feeding and handling the stingrays (albeit at different levels of intensity) suggesting that one effective way to implement any management actions is to alter the promotional and marketing strategies for SCS. Other survey questions on trip experience, conservation values, and socio-demographics were used to define these classes further, with the main distinguishing trait being the level of concern for potential impacts occurring at SCS. The discrepancies between the two segments became most obvious when calculating their respective market shares of support for alternative management strategies. 4. This approach to determining visitor preferences can help explain how the various segments will be affected by management options, and therefore can provide the basis for developing feasible strategies that will assist wildlife managers in maximizing tourist satisfaction while achieving wildlife-protection goals.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multi-faceted, often chronic syndrome that may develop following an exposure to a highly-traumatic event. Given the complexity, heterogeneity, and incomplete theoretical description of this disorder, computational models of PTSD are an important tool to help understand the mechanisms, and course, of symptom presentation and maintenance in PTSD. This chapter reviews several computational modeling approaches and their implications for PTSD, including models focused on fear learning and expression, changes in arousal and reactivity, avoidance, changes in cognition and mood and intrusive recollection. It also discusses the limitations of each approach, and suggests possible directions for future research that could both advance our understanding of PTSD and help move toward a comprehensive computational account of this disorder.

AB  - The provision of adequate nutrition support for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a clinical challenge for decades. The primary and secondary injuries create unique metabolic derangements along with accompanying issues such as optimal timing and route of nutrition, appropriate fluid and electrolytes, drug administration, rehabilitation, and dysphagia. Enteral nutrition is clearly established as the preferential route of nutrition support for this population vs parenteral nutrition. There appears to be a consensus on early initiation of enteral nutrition, but less definitive are recommendations on advancement timing and formula components. Nutrition therapies should include exact fluid resuscitation goals specific for TBI and strict electrolyte monitoring to avoid extreme fluid, electrolyte, or glucose shifts that could be detrimental to the patient. While the critical care patient often tolerates small bowel feeding, the long-term rehabilitation patient should transition to and tolerate gastric feeding. Drug-nutrient and adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea should be routinely evaluated in patients receiving enteral nutrition. Monitoring for dysphagia is critical to avoid the costly negative aspects associated with aspiration and to capitalize on quality of life and appropriate oral nutrition. Emphasizing the priority of early nutrition support within a multi-disciplinary team may be the critical key for successful provision and tolerance of nutrition support in the TBI population.
