AB  - Abstract Controversy exists as to the utility of the MMPI in diagnosing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies of an empirically developed PTSD Subscale for the MMPI have had conflicting results. In this study 84 MMPI clinical and research scales, including the PTSD Subscale, of 234 Vietnam War veterans (+PTSD = 117, -PTSD = 117) were compared to determine the clinical usefulness of the scales for differential diagnosis of PTSD. The veterans were all inpatients applying for admission to a PTSD treatment program. The MMPI clinical profile for PTSD was corroborated, though it had little statistically significant difference than the average profile of the -PTSD group. The PTSD Subscale was slightly better than chance in classifying veterans. A number of research scales were found to be as or more accurate than the PTSD Subscale in terms of true hit rates.

AB  - Background A common national MTP was jointly implemented in 2011 by the national blood service (Blood Services Group) and seven participating acute hospitals to provide rapid access to transfusion support for massively haemorrhaging patients treated in all acute care hospitals. Methods Through a systematic clinical workflow, blood components are transfused in a ratio of 1:1:1 (pRBC: whole blood-derived platelets: FFP), together with cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen replacement. The composition of components for the MTP is fixed, although operational aspects of the MTP can be adapted by individual hospitals to suit local hospital workflow. The MTP could be activated in support of any patient with critical bleeding and at risk of massive transfusion, including trauma and non-trauma general medical, surgical and obstetric patients. Results There were 434 activations of the MTP from October 2011 to October 2013. Thirty-nine per cent were for trauma patients, and 30% were for surgical patients with heavy intra-operative bleeding, with 25% and 6% for patients with gastrointestinal bleeding and peri-partum haemorrhage, respectively. Several hospitals reported reduction in mean time between request and arrival of blood. Mean transfusion ratio achieved was one red cell unit: 0·8 FFP units: 0·8 whole blood-derived platelet units: 0·4 units of cryoprecipitate. Although cryoprecipitate usage more than doubled after introduction of MTP, there was no significant rise in overall red cells, platelet and FFP usage following implementation. Conclusion This successful collaboration shows that shared transfusion protocols are feasible and potentially advantageous for hospitals sharing a central blood provider.

AB  - Serial MRI facilitates the in vivo analysis of the intra- and intersubject evolution of traumatic brain injury lesions. Despite the availability of MRI, the natural history of experimental focal contusion lesions in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) rat model has not been well described. We performed CCI on rats and MRI during the acute to chronic stages of cerebral injury to investigate the time course of changes in the brain. Female Wistar rats underwent CCI of their left motor cortex with a flat impact tip driven by an electromagnetic piston. In vivo MRI was performed at 7?T serially over 6?weeks post-CCI. The appearances of CCI-induced lesions and lesion-associated cortical volumes were variable on MRI, with the percentage change in cortical volume of the CCI ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side ranging from 18% within 2?h of injury on day 0 to a peak of 35% on day 1, and a trough of ?28% by week 5/6, with an average standard deviation of ±14% at any given time point. In contrast, the percentage change in cortical volume of the ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side in control rats was not significant (1?±?2%). Hemorrhagic conversion within and surrounding the CCI lesion occurred between days 2 and 9 in 45% of rats, with no hemorrhage noted on the initial scan. Furthermore, hemorrhage and hemosiderin within the lesion were positive for Prussian blue and highly autofluorescent on histological examination. Although some variation in injuries may be technique related, the divergence of similar lesions between initial and final scans demonstrates the inherent biological variability of the CCI rat model.

AB  - Purpose? This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of solid intra-abdominal organ injuries in Central Australia, with focus on the mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score (ISS), distribution of injury, role of surgical intervention and their outcome. It aimed to assess if difference exists in the above perimeters between the indigenous and non-indigenous population. Methodology? This is a retrospective analysis of a selected group of patients as identified by ICD Codes. Database has been created for patients admitted with renal, pancreatic, hepatic and splenic trauma over a five-year period (2001?2005). Data on demographics, mechanism of injury, distribution of injury, length of stay and ISS has been collected. Results? Seventy-one patients has been identified, with 51 (72%) indigenous and 20 (28%) non-indigenous. 29 patients (41%) were involved in a Motor Vehicle Accident and 33 (46%) were assaulted. There is no statistical difference with the distribution of injury and ISS amongst indigenous and non-indigenous populations. However there appears to have a higher incidence of surgical intervention associated with the indigenous group (28.8% versus 12.5%). This may be explained by the compliance rate as 29.4% of indigenous patients left against medical advice as compared with 0% with the non-indigenous group. Conclusion? The mechanism, pattern and severity of injury appear to be comparable amongst the indigenous and non-indigenous population in Central Australia. However there is a difference in their incidence of surgical intervention. ISS may not be as useful in prediction for need for intervention in this group and a different approach to trauma management may need to be tailored to this population.

AB  - Abstract Background Most research on women experiencing stillbirth relies on online user group surveys or qualitative interviews. The objective of this study was to investigate the experience of women who are at a higher risk of stillbirth, living in areas of greatest deprivation, and are commonly not well represented. Methods This study used birth and death registrations in 2012-2013 to identify a sample of mothers whose babies had died as a result of stillbirth. These women were sent a survey 6-9 months after the stillbirth. We undertook descriptive analysis of quantitative data and used binary logistic regression with the Index of Multiple Deprivation as a measure of disadvantage. We used thematic analysis to describe free text responses. Results The survey response rate was 30% (N = 473). Ethnic minority, younger age, and single parenthood were associated with disadvantage. Women residents in the most deprived areas perceived care more negatively: during labor they were significantly less likely to be spoken to by medical staff so they could understand (73% compared with 90%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.33 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.18-0.65]), or treated with respect by midwives (79% compared with 90%, aOR 0.41 [95% CI 0.22-0.77]). The qualitative themes identified were: ?Difficulty in accessing care,? ?More could have been done,? ?Ineffective communication,? and ?Cared for and not cared for? which support the quantitative findings. Conclusion Women living in the most deprived areas reported poorer experiences of care compared with more advantaged women. All women need compassionate and sensitive care around the time of a stillbirth.

AB  - Two groups of children, one able-bodied and the other with physical disabilities, explored a symmetrical three-tiered virtual building that contained six distinctive target objects, two on each storey. In a subsequent test, the target objects were removed and participants were asked to make judgments of the directions to the former target locations from each floor in turn. At each test site, judgments were required for targets that were formerly on the same floor and for those on higher and lower floors. Relative tilt error scores suggested a bias for both groups, in that targets that were higher than the test location were judged as consistently lower than their actual position, whereas targets that were lower than the test location were judged as higher than their actual position. Absolute tilt errors revealed an asymmetry in both groups, with more accurate tilt errors for judgments directed to lower than higher floors. The relevance of these results for the source of the asymmetry is discussed.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the extent of visual recovery after multi-disciplinary approach of treatment in serious ocular injuries; to determine the prognostic factors associated with poor final visual outcome and suggest adequate precautionary measures. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 325 consecutive patients with direct ocular trauma who were examined and treated at a tertiary eye care centre in South India over a 3-year period was undertaken. Results: Males (86.8%) outnumbered the females (13.2%) and children (<16 years) constituted 46.8% of the total affected population. Anterior segment was involved in 51.1%, the posterior segment in 8.9% and both anterior and posterior segments were involved in 31.4% of patients. Prompt and meticulous surgical treatment restored useful vision (better than or equal to 6/18) in 60.5% of patients. Post-treatment, a reduction in blindness and visual impairment rates in the affected eye with respect to WHO classification was 66.7 and 54.1% respectively (P < 0.0001). Two eyes needed prompt enucleation. The factors associated with visual impairment (visual acuity less than 6/18) were poor initial visual acuity, full chamber hyphema, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and vitreous haemorrhage. Conclusions: Direct ocular trauma remains an important potentially preventable cause of ocular morbidity, but the advent of modern surgical techniques can often restore useful vision in such situations. Mandatory use of protective eye wear at work, public health education including awareness on the part of parents to the potential dangers of some childrens? toys can to an extent help reduce ocular morbidity due to direct ocular trauma.

AB  - Abstract There is growing recognition that traumatic brain injury is a highly variable and complex systemic disorder that is refractory to therapies that target individual mechanisms. It is even more complex in elderly persons, in whom frailty, previous comorbidities, altered metabolism, and a long history of medication use are likely to complicate the secondary effects of brain trauma. Progesterone, one of the few neuroprotective agents that has shown promise for the treatment of acute brain injury, is now in national and international phase 3 multicenter trials. New findings show that vitamin D hormone (VDH) and VDH deficiency in the aging process (and across the developmental spectrum) may interact with progesterone and treatment for traumatic brain injury. In this article we review the use of progesterone and VDH as biologics-based therapies along with recent studies demonstrating that the combination of progesterone and VDH may promote better functional outcomes than either treatment independently.

Factors contributing to the functioning of collaborative OOHC systems are reviewed from theoretical and contextual perspectives. The authors posit that secondary traumatic stress and vicarious trauma are central to understanding the impact of relational trauma and the experience of individuals, families, teams, and the wider ecology of collaborative care systems. Given the challenges of working collaboratively across interpersonal, family, and systems boundaries to support traumatised children in OOHC, further research is required.

AB  - Background: Unplanned readmissions serve as a marker for health care quality. Risk factors associated with unplanned readmission after microvascular free tissue transfer have never been examined. In this study, we sought to identify perioperative predictors of 30-day unplanned readmission in free flap patients. Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients who underwent microvascular free tissue transfer in 2011. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate independent predictors of unplanned readmission. Results: Among free flap patients, unplanned readmission rate was 7.9%. In multivariate analysis, the only factor that significantly predicted unplanned readmission (P?<?0.05) was open wound/wound infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.71). Postoperative variables significantly associated with unplanned readmission included surgical complications (OR 5.43), medical complications (OR 5.62), and unplanned reoperation (OR 3.94). Flap failure was not associated with unplanned readmission. Conclusions: In our study, the presence of either open wound/wound infection, development of surgical complications, medical complications, and unplanned reoperations were associated with unplanned readmissions. Further research in predictive factors is suggested to avoid costly, unnecessary, and preventable readmissions. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 35:13?20, 2015.

The mechanism and control of vergence eye movements involves complex neurological processes that may be compromised in individuals with traumatic brain injury, thus frequently resulting in a wide range of vergence dysfunctions and related near-work symptoms, such as oculomotor-based reading problems. This paper presents a review of the vergence system and its anomalies in mild traumatic brain injury, as well as their diagnostic and therapeutic clinical ramifications. Implications related to brain imaging and human neuroplasticity are also considered.

AB  - Abstract Background: Bleeding is a major concern in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), as it may impede surgical progress and is often associated with complications. To improve the study and management of intraoperative bleeding, a standardized method of recording bleeding during ESS is needed. The aim of this study was to develop a standardized method of documenting bleeding in ESS and of grading the surgical field. Methods: Bleeding after endoscopic sinus surgery was recorded using video-endoscopy. Standardized and non-standardized video-endoscopies of 20 patients were graded using a previously published grading scale (the Boezaart scale) in randomized order on two different occasions. Effects of standardization on intra- and interrater reliability were evaluated. Based on this experience, a new 11-point surgical field grading scale was developed and simultaneously compared with the six-point Boezaart scale via means of a DVD in three international centers. Results: Inter and intrarater reliability of the Boezaart and new Wormald scales significantly improved by employing a standardized video-endoscopy technique. The Wormald scale had significantly higher interrater (0.80 vs. 0.74, P < .001) and intrarater (0.89 vs. 0.83, P < .001) reliability than the Boezaart scale. Linear regression analysis revealed the Wormald scale to be more sensitive to changes in the most common surgical fields experienced in ESS. Conclusion: Standardized video-endoscopy has been demonstrated to significantly improve reliability and reproducibility of results and is recommended for future work evaluating bleeding in ESS. The new Wormald grading scale has been shown to be an inexpensive, reliable, and sensitive tool to rapidly evaluate intraoperative bleeding in ESS. It overcomes several limitations of the Boezaart scale, enabling us to analyze currently employed and newly developed hemostatic methods and agents.

AB  - Psychological theorizing about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has developed considerably since early behavioural formulations (Brewin, Dalgleish,  Mowrer, 1960) and there have been parallel developments in biological understanding (Yehuda, 1998). However clinical practice has not been affected by the new psychobiology. It is suggested that it is possible to translate this new understanding into a clinically useful analogy that will help circumvent the difficulties of forming a therapeutic alliance with trauma victims which have been reported (Pitman et al., 1991; Scott & Stradling, 1997).

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a major disease that threatens human health. Neurotransmitters and the amygdala are found to be critical in the development and maintenance of PTSD. We aim to investigate the role of glycyrrhizin in treating PTSD. Contextual fear extinction and elevated plus maze test were applied to evaluate the anxiety and fear memory. Microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to analyze the expression of amygdala neurotransmitters in PTSD animal models and to verify the effects of glycyrrhizin on major neurotransmitters. The protein levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) were examined by western bolt. Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly reduced anxiety and fear memory after 1 and 7 days of PTSD modelling. In addition, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the circadian rhythm changes of serotonin and TPH2. The present study found a significant circadian rhythm change of serotonin in the amygdala in PTSD rats. Besides, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the altered serotonin diurnal fluctuations, which raises important implications for PTSD treatment.

With substantial numbers of veterans returning from Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts with PTSD, it is important to characterize the extent of SGA use and identify associated factors. Methods We determined time trends and patient characteristics associated with the use of SGAs in veterans with PTSD, without comorbid schizophrenia or bipolar disorders, using the Department of Veterans Affairs national administrative data 2003?2010. Results Among 732?085 veterans with PTSD, 27.6% received an intentional trial of an SGA in 2003?2010. The annual number treated with SGAs almost doubled (45?268 to 84?197, p?<?0.001), while prescribing rates decreased (28.6% to 21.5%, p?<?0.001). In multivariate analyses, African Americans (odds ratio (OR)?=?1.07, 95%confidence interval (CI)?=?1.06?1.09) and Hispanics (OR?= 1.13, 95%CI?=?1.10?1.17) were more likely to receive SGAs than Whites. Strongest clinical associations were with prior diagnosis of depression (OR?=?1.96; 95%CI?=?1.94?1.99), substance use disorders (OR?=?1.86; 95%CI?=?1.84?1.88), and other anxiety disorders (OR?=?1.27; 95%CI?=?1.26?1.29) (all p???<?0.0001) as well as cardiovascular risk factors. Veterans previously deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan had lower likelihood of SGA receipt. Substantial regional differences were demonstrated (South?>?Northeast; Midwest and West?<?Northeast; p?<?0.0001); regional administrative units (veterans integrated service networks) contributed minimally to regional differences. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress disorder population growth is driving substantial increases in SGA use. Decreasing rates of the Department of Veterans Affairs prescribing may be due to integrated system-wide mechanisms (e.g., national practice guidelines), although regional variations remain prominent. These analyses provide foundational steps for identifying modifiable provider-level and organization-level determinants of SGA prescription in this growing population. Published 2013.

AB  - Abstract Background The first year of prosthetic loading is crucial to peri-implant bone levels; however, contributing factors are yet barely understood. Purpose The purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of patient-, implant-, and prosthetic-related parameters on marginal bone resorption in partially edentulous patients within the first year of prosthetic loading. Materials and Methods This retrospective multifactorial analysis involved the following influencing factors: patient gender and age, implant diameter, implant location and neck design, insertion torque, insertion depth, splinted versus single-tooth restorations, crown height space, and crown-to-implant ratio. Results Mean peri-implant bone resorption around 200 dental implants was 0.98?±?0.76?mm and significantly correlated to higher implant insertion depth (p?<?.001), whereas no association to prosthetic parameters could be observed. Conclusions Within the limits of the present analysis, it can be concluded that apical implant positioning may constitute a relevant determinant of early peri-implant bone resorption.
