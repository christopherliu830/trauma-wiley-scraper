AB  - Abstract The purpose of the present report is to evaluate the outcome of subacute and delayed period microsurgical reconstructions of traumatic extremity defects of the pediatric patients. Eighteen free tissue transfers had been performed in 18 patients. Patients ranged in age from 5 to 17 years of age and had a median age of 12.05 years. The time between trauma and free flap transfer varied between 8 and 86 days (mean, 30.8 days). Hospital stay ranged from 8 to 90 days, with a mean stay of 38.7 days. Postoperative complications were seen in 8 of 18 patients (44.4%). Re-exploration for venous thrombosis was necessary in two patients, and total flap loss occurred in one case. The average follow-up time was 34 months. One could conclude from our report and the reference literature that the frequently quoted dogma of a definitive defect closure within 7 days may have lost much of its justification. The final results obtained after delayed definitive soft tissue reconstruction compare favorably with results previously reported in the literature from patient groups whose wounds could be closed in the early period within 7 days. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Although individual HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) show good performance in evaluations conducted by WHO, reports from several African countries highlight potentially significant performance issues. Despite widespread use of RDTs for HIV diagnosis in resource-constrained settings, there has been no systematic, head-to-head evaluation of their accuracy with specimens from diverse settings across sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a standardized, centralized evaluation of eight HIV RDTs and two simple confirmatory assays at a WHO collaborating centre for evaluation of HIV diagnostics using specimens from six sites in five sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Specimens were transported to the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Antwerp, Belgium for testing. The tests were evaluated by comparing their results to a state-of-the-art reference algorithm to estimate sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Results: 2785 samples collected from August 2011 to January 2015 were tested at ITM. All RDTs showed very high sensitivity, from 98.8% for First Response HIV Card Test 1?2.0 to 100% for Determine HIV 1/2, Genie Fast, SD Bioline HIV 1/2 3.0 and INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Test kit. Specificity ranged from 90.4% for First Response to 99.7% for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK with wide variation based on the geographical origin of specimens. Multivariate analysis showed several factors were associated with false-positive results, including gender, provider-initiated testing and the geographical origin of specimens. For simple confirmatory assays, the total sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 98.8% for ImmunoComb II HIV 12 CombFirm (ImmunoComb) and 99.7% and 98.4% for Geenius HIV 1/2 with indeterminate rates of 8.9% and 9.4%. Conclusions: In this first systematic head-to-head evaluation of the most widely used RDTs, individual RDTs performed more poorly than in the WHO evaluations: only one test met the recommended thresholds for RDTs of ≥99% sensitivity and ≥98% specificity. By performing all tests in a centralized setting, we show that these differences in performance cannot be attributed to study procedure, end-user variation, storage conditions, or other methodological factors. These results highlight the existence of geographical and population differences in individual HIV RDT performance and underscore the challenges of designing locally validated algorithms that meet the latest WHO-recommended thresholds.

AB  - Abstract Objective To characterize the effects of caregiver mental health and coping strategies on interactions with an injured adolescent acutely after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design Multi-site, cross-sectional study. Setting Outpatient setting of 3 tertiary pediatric hospitals and 2 tertiary general medical centers. Participants Adolescents (N = 125) aged 12-17 years, 1-6 months after being hospitalized with complicated mild to severe TBI. Methods Data were collected as part of a multi-site clinical trial of family problem-solving therapy after TBI. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of caregiver and environmental characteristics to the dimensions of effective communication, warmth, and negativity during caregiver-adolescent problem-solving discussions. Main Outcomes Measures Adolescent and caregiver interactions, as measured by the Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scales. Results Caregivers who utilized problem-focused coping strategies were rated as having higher levels of effective communication (P < .01), as were those with higher socioeconomic status (P < .01). Problem-focused coping style and higher socioeconomic status were also associated lower levels of negative interactions (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Female gender of the adolescent and fewer children in the home were associated with increased parental warmth during the interaction (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). Neither adolescent TBI severity nor caregiver depression significantly influenced caregiver-teen interactions. Conclusions Problem-focused coping strategies are associated with higher levels of effective communication and lower levels of caregiver negativity during the initial months after adolescent TBI, suggesting that effective caregiver coping may facilitate better caregiver-adolescent interactions after TBI.

AB  - Abstract ? Trauma to the teeth is a common reason for emergency room visits among children, with the maxillary anterior teeth being mostly affected. The consequences of dental trauma include disfigurement, speech defects and psychological effects. This is a cross-sectional study comprising 1039 students, with 47% being males and 53% females. Teeth were examined for physical evidence of trauma. The prevalence of incisal fracture was 2.4% with no significant gender difference (2.9% and 2.0% among males and females, respectively). The male to female prevalence ratio was 1.45 to 1.0. The maxillary incisors accounted for 96% of fractured teeth. Among children with traumatized incisors, 86% had one tooth affected, while 14% had two traumatized teeth. The prevalence of incisal trauma was significantly higher among children of low socioeconomic status (?2=5.86, P=0.02, df=1). Though African American and Hispanic children had higher prevalence than White children, the differences were not statistically significant. The study reports a low prevalence of incisal trauma among Harris County children and a socioeconomic difference. This study recommends further investigation of incisal trauma in this region as well as educational programs to prevent dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Findings from a longitudinal study are presented on the relationships between the problems and stresses resulting from Hurricane Andrew and posthurricane minor deviant behavior. The sample (N = 4,978) included Hispanic, African-American, and White non-Hispanic middle school students enrolled in Dade County, Florida public schools. Two waves of data were collected prior to the hurricane; a third was obtained approximately 6 months following the storm. Results indicated that females were likely to report higher levels of hurricane-related stress symptoms than males. After controlling for prehurricane levels of minor deviance, family support, and race/ethnicity, hurricane stress symptom level remained a significant predictor of posthurricane minor deviant behavior. The findings lend support to stress theories of social deviance.

Conversations between the author and ?Gabrielle? explore two areas not regarded as priorities by Winnicott: the transgenerational transmission of pathology/trauma, and the ways that language, in general ? and given names, in particular ? organize individual subjectivity. The question raised is to what degree Winnicott ? who described the treatment as ?psychoanalysis partagé [shared]? due to the parents? involvement ? thought of the pathology itself as ?shared.? The goal is not to supplant but to expand Winnicott's understanding of the case, borrowing insights from the work of Lacan and others.

AB  - Purpose? Prospective validation of recently established independent predictors for postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was performed. Methodology? All trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission, ISS?>?15, Base Deficit (BD)?>?5, or resuscitation with >5?L crystalloids) were prospectively monitored. Patients with isolated head injuries were excluded. Demographics, ISS, resuscitation fluids, physiological parameters, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the independent predictors in two time windows ?ED discharge?[SBP, crystalloids, Time-to OR, transfusions] and ?ICU admission?[crystalloids, urine output (UO), Hb, Temperature, BD] were collected. Data are presented as mean ?±? SEM, p?<?0.05 considered significant. Results? Twenty-two blunt trauma patients were monitored (Age 39?±?5 years, 77% males, ISS 32?±?2, SBP 107?±?5 mmHg, BD 7?±?1). No patients developed ACS. Seven patients developed IAH (IAP?>?20?mmHg). IAH and non-IAH patients had the same age (41?±?7 vs 37?±?5?yrs) and admission BD (7.5?±?1.3 vs 6.3?±?1.2). IAH patients had higher ISS than non-IAH patients (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2). Outcomes (IAH vs non-IAH): ICU LOS (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2), Mortality (0% vs 7%), MOF (29% vs 0%). ?ED-discharge predictors?: The IAH and non-IAH patients had similar admission SBP, ED crystalloid volume, transfusions and ED time. ?ICU-admission predictors?: IAH and non-IAH patients had similar UO, crystalloid infusions, BD, temperature but the IAH group had lower Hb (99?±?5 vs 111?±?3?g/dl) than the non-IAH patients. Conclusions? The incidence of ACS decreased from 14% to 0% in a comparable population. The predictors for ACS did not predict IAH. After the elimination of the lethal ACS, the clinical importance of postinjury IAH has to be defined.

AB  - ABSTRACT: One of the major sequelae following traumatic brain injury is a change in employment status. This poses significant challenges for rehabilitation services. Several studies have investigated the longer-term outcome after traumatic brain injury. Longer-term outcome in an economically disadvantaged rural environment with limited rehabilitation services has not been studied extensively. A group of individuals (n =65) who sustained a traumatic brain injury were compared regarding pre- and post-employment status. The moderate and severely injured sub-groups showed a significant change in employment status. Ideally rehabilitation programs should target re-employment as an outcome. Limited employment opportunities in rural areas may make this more difficult to achieve.

AB  - The extent and kind of personal change experienced by newcomers during organizational socialization has not been thoroughly addressed. Studies have concentrated on increases in knowledge and adjustment and neglected the influence of starting work on sense of self. Multiple methods are used to explore graduates? accounts of change in early career. Questionnaires were sent to graduates in eight different organizations on two occasions one year apart (Time 1 N = 906; Time 2 N = 936). Graduates rated the amount of change they experienced highest in competence (median: Quite a lot), followed by career (median: A little), personality (median: A moderate amount/A little), values (median: Not at all/A little) and lowest in attitudes (median: Not at all). Content analysis of open-ended comments showed that changes were generally positive or neutral rather than negative. Discourses of personal change were explored in interviews with nine graduates who were selected as most likely to have experienced change. The criteria were that they were women in sex atypical occupations with high self-ratings of personal change. Accounts demonstrated the complexity and contradictions in defining and discussing change and the dilemma in both describing change and maintaining continuity. Narratives presented change as a response to adversity involving emotional control, increased self-knowledge and increased confidence. A further theme was the personal dilemma inherent in maintaining balance between the contested identities of self at work and outside. This research contributes to our understanding of newcomers? experiences of organizational socialization by emphasizing the importance of multiple methods to understand the ambiguity and ambivalence in complex developmental processes. It highlights the elusive nature of change and the complex negotiations in establishing the sense of self in different contexts.

The migration from the more narrow and specific use of research-based practice to the broader and encompassing use of evidence on which to base guidance and care decisions is explored. Weaknesses and strengths of adopting a culture of EBP nursing are addressed along with how to develop a search question, find and appraise the evidence, make sense of it and then apply the findings.

AB  - Abstract Fascia in the veterinary sciences is drawing attention, such that physiotherapists and animal practitioners are now applying techniques based on the concept of fascia studies in humans. A comprehensive study of fascia is therefore needed in animals to understand the arrangement of the fascial layers in an unguligrade horse and a digitigrade dog. This study has examined the difference between the horse and the dog fascia at specific regions, in terms of histology, and has compared it with the human model. Histological examinations show that in general the fascia tissue of the horse exhibits a tight and dense composition, while in the dog it is looser and has non-dense structure. Indeed, equine fascia appears to be different from both canine fascia and the human fascia model, whilst canine fascia is very comparable to the human model. Although regional variations were observed, the superficial fascia (fascia superficialis) in the horse was found to be trilaminar in the trunk, yet multilayered in the dog. Moreover, crimping of collagen fibers was more visible in the horse than the dog. Blood vessels and nerves were present in the loose areolar tissue of the superficial and the profound compartment of hypodermis. The deep fascia (fascia profunda) in the horse was thick and tightly attached to the underlying muscle, while in the dog the deep fascia was thin and loosely attached to underlying structures. Superficial and deep fascia fused in the extremities. In conclusion, gross dissection and histology have revealed species variations that are related to the absence or presence of the superficial adipose tissue, the retinacula cutis superficialis, the localization and amount of elastic fibers, as well as the ability to slide and glide between the different layers. Further research is now needed to understand in more detail whether these differences have an influence on the biomechanics, movements and proprioception of these animals.

AB  - Abstract A topical trend in clinical research has been the study of repeat trauma, referred to by clinicians as ?injury recidivism,? which lends itself to the assessment of accumulated injuries among ancient people. The present investigation examined the healed injuries among two archaeological skeletal samples from the Kerma period (ca. 2500?1500 BC) of Sudanese Nubia. Both groups were known to have a high prevalence of multiple trauma?80% of 54 adults from the rural sites (O16 and P37) located near Dongola and 42% of 212 adults from the urban site of Kerma sustained nonfatal injuries. It was observed that a higher frequency of multi-injured adults displayed one or more violence-associated injury (cranial trauma, parry fracture). When all injuries were considered 38% of individuals with violence-related injuries had other traumatic lesions in contrast to 22% of individuals who experienced injuries associated with accidental falls (e.g., Colles', Smiths', Galeazzi, and paired forearm fractures), although this difference was not significant. When only the skulls and long bones were evaluated 81% of adults with multiple injuries to these major bones bore one or more violence-related injuries, while 60% of adults with single injuries sustained violence-related injuries. Most individuals with multiple injuries were male and less than 35 years of age; there was no significant difference in the frequency of violence- or accident-related multiple injury between the rural and urban communities. Although it cannot be established whether or not some of an individual's injuries were experienced during simultaneous or independent incidents, the pattern of multiple injury among these two ancient Nubian skeletal samples reflected the profile of injury recidivism observed by modern clinicians cross-culturally.

Schwannoma cells within tumours no longer express myelin markers, and show increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. We have shown previously that several signalling pathways are activated in schwannoma cells in situ, in particular the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo we have demonstrated that c-Jun and Sox-2 are co-regulated in Schwann cells and evidence shows that both these proteins regulate myelination negatively. In this study, we aimed to characterize the expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in schwannoma and traumatic neuroma. Methods and results Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to c-Jun and Sox-2 was applied to six schwannomas, and the results were compared with those seen in traumatic neuroma and normal nerve. Increased expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 was seen in schwannoma. Conclusions We have demonstrated increased expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in schwannoma compared to traumatic neuroma. There was no expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in a histologically normal peripheral nerve.

AB  - Rationale Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the recovery process post-stroke is essential; however, longer-term recovery studies are lacking. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) can image biological recovery processes, but is limited by spatial resolution and its targeted nature. Untargeted mass spectrometry imaging offers high spatial resolution, providing an ideal ex vivo tool for brain recovery imaging. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to image a rat brain 48 h after ischaemic stroke to locate the infarcted regions of the brain. PET was carried out 3 months post-stroke using the tracers [18F]DPA-714 for TSPO and [18F]IAM6067 for sigma-1 receptors to image neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, respectively. The rat brain was flash-frozen immediately after PET scanning, and sectioned for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging. Results Three months post-stroke, PET imaging shows minimal detection of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, indicating that the brain has stabilised. However, MALDI-MS images reveal distinct differences in lipid distributions (e.g. phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) between the scar and the healthy brain, suggesting that recovery processes are still in play. It is currently not known if the altered lipids in the scar will change on a longer time scale, or if they are stabilised products of the brain post-stroke. Conclusions The data demonstrates the ability to combine MALD-MS with in vivo PET to image different aspects of stroke recovery.

AB  - Highlights The experiences of detained youth may rest predominantly in their interactions with detention staff. This study examined rehabilitative practices infused within the daily activities of detention staff. We found evidence for three categories of rehabilitative practices embedded in staff activities. Our findings can be used to build staff members? capacity to bridge service gaps in detention.
