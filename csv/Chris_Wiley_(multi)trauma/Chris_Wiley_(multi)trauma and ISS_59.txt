AB  - Highlights The experiences of detained youth may rest predominantly in their interactions with detention staff. This study examined rehabilitative practices infused within the daily activities of detention staff. We found evidence for three categories of rehabilitative practices embedded in staff activities. Our findings can be used to build staff members? capacity to bridge service gaps in detention.

AB  - Background: The incidence of awareness in patients undergoing general anesthesia is 0.1?0.2% in Western countries. The medical literatures about awareness during general anesthesia are still rare in China, but some previous studies have reported a higher incidence (1.4?6%) of intra-operative awareness. To find out the reason why the incidence reported in China is much higher than that in Western countries, we performed a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized observational study to determine the true incidence of intra-operative awareness in China. Methods: This is a prospective, non-randomized descriptive cohort study that was conducted at 25 academic medical centers in China. Eleven thousand one hundred and eighty-five patients were interviewed by research staff for evaluation of awareness at the first and fourth day after general anesthesia with muscle relaxation. An independent blinded committee evaluated the responses and determined whether awareness occurred. Necessary data were collected for a binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 11,101 patients were presented. Forty-six cases (0.41%) were reported as definite awareness and 47 additional cases (0.41%) as possible awareness. Three hundred and fifty-five patients (3.19%) had dreams during general anesthesia. Awareness was associated with increased American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, a previous anesthesia, and anesthesia methods of total intravenous anesthesia. Conclusion: The incidence of intra-operative awareness in China is approximately 0.41%, two to three times higher than that widely cited in Western countries. Inappropriately light anesthesia, and the population proportion of surgery and general anesthesia in China may account for the difference. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT00693875.)

AB  - Aim:? Functional neuroimaging studies to date have indicated prefrontal dysfunction in late-onset major depression (LOD). The relationships between prefrontal dysfunction and clinical characteristics including social functioning, however, have been unclear. The objective of the present study was to evaluate prefrontal hemodynamic response related to an executive task in LOD and to assess the relationship between activation in the prefrontal regions and clinical characteristics including social functioning. Methods:? Twenty-four subjects with LOD and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects were recruited for the present study. Hemoglobin concentration changes in the prefrontal and superior temporal cortical surface area were measured during verbal fluency task (VFT) using 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which enables real-time monitoring of cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the cortical surface area. Results:? The two groups had a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of oxy-hemoglobin concentration change; LOD patients had less activation in a broad area covering both prefrontal and superior temporal cortices than healthy controls. In addition, reduced activation of the frontopolar region had a significant positive correlation with lower self-assessment of social functioning scores in the patient group. Conclusion:? Reduced frontopolar cortical activation was associated with social functioning impairment in patients with LOD, and NIRS may be an efficient clinical tool for monitoring these characteristics.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of social support and coping strategies in enhancing post-traumatic growth (PTG) in cancer patients. The study focused on both avoidance and approaching coping and on four distinct types of social support: (a) perceived availability, (b) actual received, (c) satisfaction with received support, and (d) the competence of caregiver to satisfy the patient's basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted with a group of 41 cancer patients currently in the treatment and management phase of their illness. Data were collected by means of a written questionnaire, at two time points (T1 and T2) that were 6 months apart. Social support was assessed using the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and the Need Satisfaction in Relationship Scale. Coping strategies were assessed using the Brief COPE questionnaire. Social support and coping strategies were assessed only at T1. PTG was assessed using the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory at T1 and T2. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the association between social support and coping strategies with short-term reports of post-traumatic growth. Results: Regression analyses showed that autonomy-supportive caregivers and a problem-focused strategy of coping significantly predicted greater PTG at T2. Conclusions: This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the type of social support that may specifically aid cancer patients in experiencing PTG. Furthermore, findings confirm the important role of problem-focused coping strategies in growing psychologically. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Aim: The aim of this study was to describe a service operating in Milan, Italy, that provides early intervention for young people aged 17?30?years at the onset and at high risk of psychosis. Method: Following 2?years of preliminary study and organization, Programma2000 was launched in Milan in 1999. This programme was targeted at early detection and intervention in subjects at the onset of, at risk of, or showing ?prodromal? signs of psychosis. This paper contains data on the organization and activities of Programma2000. Results: The service has been active since its launch and has received 378 referrals as of March 2009, 342 of which were thoroughly evaluated. At entry, patients undergo a detailed evaluation of their psychopathology, personal and social role functioning, and cognitive status, with repeated testing over time in order to multidimensionally assess outcome. Treatment involves cognitive?behavioural psychotherapy, structured and unstructured psychosocial interventions, and pharmacotherapy when deemed necessary. Treatment appears effective in reducing morbidity and improving social functioning. Conclusion: A team dedicated to the early identification and treatment of young people with early psychosis is a feasible and sustainable extension of the traditional methods of care for people with mental disorders in Italy.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim A previous cross-sectional study found that young adults with depression were more likely to have traumatic dental injuries (TDIs). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms during early and middle adolescence, and TDIs at age 15-16 years. Method This study used longitudinal data from phases 1 and 3 of the Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey (RELACHS), a school-based survey following a representative, multi-ethnic sample of adolescents attending public schools in East London (England). Information on depressive symptoms was collected using the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) during early (age 11-12 years) and middle adolescence (age 15-16 years). TDIs were identified during clinical examinations in phase 3 when pupils were 15-16 years old. Logistic regression was used to test the association between depressive symptoms at different stages of adolescence and TDIs adjusting for confounders (age, gender, ethnicity, parental employment and overjet). Results Depressive symptoms were reported by 24% and 32% of adolescents in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Evidence of TDIs was found in 18% of adolescents at age 15-16 years. Adolescents with depressive symptoms, either in early or middle adolescence, had greater odds of experiencing TDIs. However, these estimates were not statistically significant. In regression models adjusted for confounders, the odds of having TDIs were 1.23 (95% CI: 0.77-1.96) and 1.23 (95% CI: 0.76-1.95) among pupils with depressive symptoms in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Conclusion There was no association between depressive symptoms and TDIs in early and middle adolescents.

AB  - Objective:? To examine associations between exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and clinical patterns of symptoms and disorders in preschool children. Method:? Two hundred and thirteen referred and non-referred children, ages 24 to 48 months (MN = 34.9, SD = 6.7 months) were studied. Lifetime exposure to PTEs (family violence and non-interpersonal events) and recent stressful life events were assessed with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) and Child Life Events Scale. Child psychiatric symptoms and disorders were assessed with parent-reports in the PAPA, a comprehensive, developmentally sensitive interview. Sociodemographic risk, parental anxiety and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression, Beck Anxiety Inventory), and child developmental level (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) also were assessed. Results:? Violence exposure was broadly associated with psychiatric status in the areas of depression, separation anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and conduct problems, whereas potentially traumatic non-interpersonal exposure was associated with phobic anxiety. The majority of the associations between violence exposure and preschoolers? symptoms were significant even when other key factors, including economic disadvantage and parental mood and anxiety symptoms, were controlled statistically. However, parental depressive/anxious symptoms may have partially or fully mediated the relationships between violence exposure and depressive and conduct symptoms. Conclusions:? Evidence of robust associations between violence exposure and early childhood internalizing and externalizing disorders and symptoms highlights the need for longitudinal prospective research concerning neurodevelopmental mechanisms and pathways. Findings underscore the relevance of assessing trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence, to identify young children at risk.

AB  - Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) show varying degrees of response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. This randomised phase III study in patients with CIDP (ProCID trial) will compare the efficacy and safety of 3 different doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg) of IVIg 10% (panzyga) administered every 3 weeks for 24?weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of treatment response, defined as a decrease in adjusted inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment disability score of ≥1 point, in the IVIg 1.0 g/kg arm at week 24. Patients with definite or probable CIDP according to European Federation of Neurological Sciences/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria with IVIg or corticosteroid dependency and active disease are eligible. All potentially eligible patients will undergo IVIg or corticosteroid dose reduction (washout phase) over ≤12?weeks or until deterioration of CIDP (active disease). Patients with deterioration during the washout phase will be randomised to receive study treatment during a dose-evaluation phase starting with a loading dose of IVIg 2.0 g/kg followed by maintenance treatment with IVIg 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g/kg every 3 weeks. Rescue medication (2 doses of IVIg 2.0 g/kg given 3 weeks apart) will be administered to patients in the IVIg 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg groups who deteriorate after week 3 and before week 18 or who do not improve at week 6. Safety, tolerability and quality of life will be assessed. The ProCID study will provide new information on the best maintenance dose of IVIg for patients with CIDP.

AB  - Abstract Inhibitory control describes a number of distinct processes. Effortless inhibition refers to acts of control that are automatic and reflexive. Effortful inhibition refers to voluntary, goal-directed acts of control such as response flexibility, interference control, cancellation inhibition, and restraint inhibition. Disruptions to a number of inhibitory control processes occur as a consequence of childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI). This paper reviews the current knowledge of inhibition deficits following childhood TBI, and includes an overview of the inhibition construct and a discussion of the specific deficits shown by children and adolescents with TBI and the factors that mediate the expression of these deficits, including injury-related variables and the expression of pre- and post-injury attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The review illustrates that inhibitory control processes differ in terms of measurement, assessment, and neurological underpinnings, and also that childhood TBI may selectively disrupt particular forms of inhibition.

AB  - Patients with burn shock can be challenging to resuscitate. Burn shock produces a variety of physiologic derangements: Patients are hypovolemic from volume loss, have a increased systemic vascular resistance, and may have a depressed cardiac output depending on the extent of the thermal injury. Additionally, the burn wound produces a significant inflammatory cascade of events that contributes to the shock state. Fluid resuscitation is foundational for the initial treatment of burn shock. Typical resuscitation is with intravenous lactated Ringer's in accordance with well-established formulas based on burn wound size. In the past century, as therapies to treat thermal injuries were being developed, plasma was the fluid used for burn resuscitation; in fact, plasma was used in World War II and throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Plasma was abandoned because of infectious risks and complications. Despite huge strides in transfusion medicine and the increased safety of blood products, plasma has never been readopted for burn resuscitation. Over the past 15 years, there has been a paradigm shift in trauma resuscitation: Less crystalloid and more blood products are used; this strategy has demonstrated improved outcomes. Plasma is a physiologic fluid that stabilizes the endothelium. The endotheliopathy of trauma has been described and is mitigated by transfusion strategies with a 1:1 ratio of RBCs to plasma. Thermal injury also results in endothelial dysfunction: the endotheliopathy of burns. Plasma is likely a better resuscitation fluid for patients with significant burn wounds because of its capability to restore intravascular volume status and treat the endotheliopathy of burns.

AB  - Abstract Background Steady increase in computed tomography (CT) utilisation in the ED was observed in countries such as the USA, Canada, China and Korea; however, limited empirical data are available regarding Taiwan. Objective The objective of the present study is to quantify and compare trends in CT utilisation in the ED over a 5 year period in a medical centre in Taiwan. Methods Electronic chart review was performed in a medical centre with an annual ED census of 80 000 patients. Subjects >20 years of age who underwent CT scans during ED visits from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009 were identified. Results Among the 333 673 adult ED visits, 43 635 received CT scans, with a utilisation rate of 131 per 1000. Within the 5 year span, patient volume increased by 7.7%, whereas CT utilisation increased by 42.7%. The rates of increase in patient volume and CT utilisation were 5.0% and 32.4% in non-trauma; 19.7% and 97.8% in trauma. CT scans were mostly performed on the head (47%), abdomen (36%), followed by chest (10%) and miscellaneous (7%). An increase of 168% in spinal CTs for trauma patients was observed. An increase in CT utilisation was found in all age groups with a proportionate increase with increasing age in both trauma and non-trauma. Conclusion ED CT utilisation has increased at a rate far exceeding the growth in ED patient volume. This may be attributed to the improved utility of CT in diagnosing serious pathology, more diagnostic indications for CT, ready availability and the necessity for diagnostic certainty in the ED.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and permanent disability. Systemic hypothermia, a treatment used in TBI for many decades, has recently been found to be associated with neutral or unfavourable clinical outcomes despite apparently promising preclinical research. Systematic review and meta-analysis is a tool to summarize literature and observe trends in experimental design and quality that underpin its general conclusions. Here we aim to use these techniques to describe the use of hypothermia in animal TBI models, collating data relating to outcome and both study design and quality. From here we intend to observe correlations between features and attempt to explain any discrepancies found between animal and clinical data. This protocol describes the relevant methodology in detail.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To analyse and evaluate the correlation between traumatic head injuries (THIs) and maxillofacial fractures (MF). Age, gender and trauma mechanism correlated with THI were also investigated. Patients and Methods We conducted a hospital-based retrospective case?control study at Stomatology College and Hospital, Wuhan University. From January 2000 to December 2009, a total of 1131 patients with MF were enrolled in the statistical study to evaluate the association of THI and other risk factors with MF. Among these patients, 86 presented with THI. We utilized binary logistic regression and risk analysis to investigate the associations among MF and other risk factors with HI. Results Head injuries (103 injuries) were sustained by 86 patients (7.6%), with male-to-female ratio of 4.1:1.0. Most of the patients (52 patients, 50.5%) also exhibited cranial bone fractures. The age group with most patients was the 30?39 years age group (26 patients, 30.2%), followed by the 19?29 years age group (22 patients, 25.6%). Motor vehicle accident (MVA) was the most common mechanism of injury (49 patients, 74.1%). Patients older than 50 years showed the highest risk for head injury (OR, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1?3.7; P = 0.025). MVA had a sixfold risk of head injury (OR, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5?26.1; P = 0.013). Head injuries were more prone to occur in patients who had combined fracture of the mid-face and mandible (OR = 4.6, P < 0.001), and only a 0.3-fold risk of multimandible fractures (P < 0.001), 0.5-fold risk of single mandibular fracture (P = 0.017) and 0.3-fold risk of patients who sustained only single mandibular condylar fracture (P = 0.019). Conclusions The occurrence of head injuries is significantly related to age, aetiology and the pattern and position of maxillofacial fractures.

AB  - Aims To develop and validate a scoring method for assessing ?-amyloid precursor protein (APP) staining in cerebral white matter and to investigate the occurrence, amount and deposition pattern based on the cause of death in infants and young children. Methods Archival cerebral tissue was examined from a total of 176 cases (0 to 3 years of age). Each of the APP-stained sections was graded according to a simple scoring system based on the number and type of changes in eight anatomical regions. Results Examination of the sections revealed some degree of APP staining in 95% of the cases. The highest mean APP scores were found in cases of head trauma, and the lowest scores were found in the cases of drowning. APP staining, although sometimes minimal, was found in all 48 cases of and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Patterns of APP staining (the amount and distribution) were different in cases of head trauma, infection and SIDS but were similar in the SIDS and asphyxia groups. Conclusion This study demonstrates the use of an integrated scoring system that was developed to assess APP staining in the brain. APP staining was seen in a high proportion of cases, including relatively sudden deaths. The amount of APP was significantly higher in cases of trauma than in nontraumatic deaths. However, APP was detected within all groups. The pattern of APP staining was similar in infants who had died of SIDS and from mechanical asphyxia.

AB  - Translations of summary A case study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of psychoanalysis and the persistence of its benefits 20 years later in a young woman with severe depression, professional inhibition, and difficulties in partner selection due to transgenerational mandate (TGM). The investigation was carried out with psychoanalytic interviews with the patient and analyst, which were evaluated by both psychoanalytic and non-psychoanalytic judges following a methodology based on one tested in Germany by Leuzinger-Bohleber et al. (2003). The psychoanalytic treatment began in the early 1980s in Monterrey, Mexico. The study concludes that the psychoanalysis was effective in assisting with the patient's character disorder and partner selection, mainly because of the therapeutic alliance, the analysis of transference and character, and the patient's increased capacity for mentalization as a result of the interpretation of the TGMs.

AB  - Abstract Although the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high among those with severe mental illness, little is known about the use of interventions to lessen the burden of PTSD in this population. Currently, there are limited data about safe and effective interventions to treat these individuals. This systematic published work review presents the scientific published work reporting studies of psychological treatment approaches for individuals with comorbid PTSD and severe mental illness. A secondary aim of this study was to identify the specific models implemented and tested, and their impact upon patient outcomes. A review of the published work from January 2001 through January 2012 of English-language publications retrieved from the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, and the American Psychological Association generated abstracts (PsycINFO) databases was conducted. Six studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The treatment programs described were cognitive?behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, exposure-based cognitive?behavioural therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Evidence of the effectiveness of these programs is examined. Data to support the use of these interventions are limited, indicating the need for further research and efficacy trials. Future areas of research and implications for nursing are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT The integrity of the fornix using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in adolescent participants with acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) compared to a demographically matched control group was examined. Fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix was elevated in the mild traumatic brain injured group. Performance on the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) was lower in the group with mTBI. A relation was found between lower performance on cognitive tasks and higher FA. The potential role of fornix injury as a basis of memory and processing speed deficits in mTBI is discussed.
