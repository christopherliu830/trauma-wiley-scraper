AB  - Oral Diseases (2010) 16, 188?192 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and psychological characteristics of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients with trauma history. Materials and methods:? The clinical and psychological characteristics of 34 TMD patients with trauma history were compared with those of 340 TMD patients without trauma history. Craniomandibular index (CMI) was used for clinical characteristics of TMD patients. Symptom severity index (SSI) was used to assess the multiple dimensions of pain. Symptom checklist-90-revision (SCL-90-R) was used for psychological evaluation. Results:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed significantly higher CMI and palpation index. TMD patients with trauma history also exhibited higher values in duration, sensory intensity, affective intensity, tolerability, scope of symptom, and total SSI score. In addition, these patients showed significantly higher values in symptom dimensions of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation. Among the symptom dimensions of SCL-90-R, somatization showed the most significant correlations with CMI and SSI. Conclusions:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed more severe subjective, objective, and psychological dysfunction than those without trauma history. Pain of myogenous origin, history of physical trauma, and psychosocial dysfunction were all closely related.

AB  - Abstract The current project is a study of craniofacial trauma in a large sample (n?=?896) of Prehispanic Canary Islanders (PCIs). The possible causes and social implications of the trauma found are considered, with reference to archaeological and historical data. Variables include the island, period and ecology, the sex and age of the individuals, the distribution of lesions across the skull (by side and by individual bone) and ante-mortem tooth loss. The results show a fairly high trauma rate (16%), a low prevalence of peri-mortem trauma (3.8% of all lesions), higher prevalence of trauma in males than in females (25% vs. 13% of all individuals), more cranial than facial lesions (8.9% vs. 3.5% of all elements) and more lesions on the left side of the skull (6.7% vs. 4.5% of all elements) which suggests that the lesions were sustained through intentional rather than accidental agency. There was no correspondence between trauma prevalence and ecology. The archaeological and historical data support the assertion that the lesions may be the result of skirmishing between groups, using weapons such as slingshots, stones and staves. The presence of edged-weapon lesions on some individuals suggests that these may have been the victims of contact-period European groups. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Trauma to the permanent teeth involves not only the teeth but also the pulp, the periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, gingiva and other associated structures. There are many variations in the types of injuries with varying severity and often a tooth may sustain more than one injury at the same time. In more severe trauma cases, there are many different cellular systems of mineralized hard and unmineralized soft tissues involved, each with varying potential for healing. Furthermore, the responses of the different tissues may be interrelated and dependent on each other. Hence, healing subsequent to dental trauma has long been known to be very complex. Because of this complexity, tissue responses and the consequences following dental trauma have been confusing and puzzling for many clinicians. In this review, the tissue responses are described under the tissue compartments typically involved following dental trauma: the pulp, periradicular and associated soft tissues. The factors involved in the mechanisms of trauma are analysed for their effects on the tissue responses. A thorough understanding of the possible tissue responses is imperative for clinicians to overcome the confusion and manage dental trauma adequately and conservatively in order to minimize the consequences following trauma.

AB  - Background Death after injury with low energy has gained increasing focus lately, and seems to constitute a significant amount of trauma-related death. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of deaths from low-energy trauma in a rural Norwegian cohort. Methods All deaths from external causes in Finnmark County, Norway, from 1995 to 2004 were identified retrospectively through the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Deaths caused by hanging, drowning, suffocation, poisoning, and electrocution were excluded. Trauma was categorised as high energy or low energy based on mechanism of injury. All low-energy trauma deaths were then reviewed. Results There were 262 cases of trauma death during the period. Low-energy trauma counted for 43% of the trauma deaths, with an annual crude death rate of 13 per 100,000 inhabitants. Low falls accounted for 99% of the injuries. Fractures were sustained in 89% of cases and head injuries in 11%. Ninety per cent of patients had pre-existing medical conditions, and the median age was 82 years. Death was caused by a medical condition in 85% of cases. Fifty-two per cent of the patients died after discharge from the hospital. Conclusion In this cohort, low-energy trauma was a significant contributor to trauma related death, especially among elderly and patients with pre-existing medical conditions.

AB  - Objective To detail the 9-year experience of renal trauma at a modern Level 1 trauma centre and report on patterns of injury, management and complications. Patients and methods We analysed 338 patients with renal injuries who presented to our institution over a 9-year period. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, management and complications were recorded. Results Males comprised 74.9% of patients with renal injuries and the highest incidence was amongst those aged 20?24 years. Blunt injuries comprised 96.2% (n = 325) of all the renal injuries, with road trauma being the predominant mechanism accounting for 72.5% of injuries. The distribution of injury grade was; 21.6% grade 1 (n = 73), 24.3% grade 2 (n = 82), 24.9% grade 3 (n = 84), 16.6% grade 4 (n = 56), and 12.7% grade 5 (n = 43). Conservative management was successful in all grade 1 and 2 renal injuries, and 94.9%, 90.7% and 35.1% of grade 3, 4 and 5 injuries respectively. All but one of the 13 patients with penetrating injuries were successfully managed conservatively. Conclusions Road trauma is the greatest cause of renal injury. Most haemodynamically stable patients are successfully managed conservatively.

AB  - Abstract Background The Trauma Pod (TP) vision is to develop a rapidly deployable robotic system to perform critical acute stabilization and/or surgical procedures, autonomously or in a teleoperative mode, on wounded soldiers in the battlefield who might otherwise die before treatment in a combat hospital could be provided. Methods In the first phase of a project pursuing this vision, a robotic TP system was developed and its capability demonstrated by performing selected surgical procedures on a patient phantom. Results The system demonstrates the feasibility of performing acute stabilization procedures with the patient being the only human in the surgical cell. The teleoperated surgical robot is supported by autonomous robotic arms and subsystems that carry out scrub-nurse and circulating-nurse functions. Tool change and supply delivery are performed automatically and at least as fast as performed manually by nurses. Tracking and counting of the supplies is performed automatically. The TP system also includes a tomographic X-ray facility for patient diagnosis and two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic data to support interventions. The vast amount of clinical protocols generated in the TP system are recorded automatically. Conclusions Automation and teleoperation capabilities form the basis for a more comprehensive acute diagnostic and management platform that will provide life-saving care in environments where surgical personnel are not present.

AB  - Summary Comorbidity of trauma and PTSD with addictive disorders is common in adolescents. The interrelationship between the two conditions is complex with addictive behaviors following the trauma, as well as preceding it. While there are established treatments for each of the conditions separately, few treatments addressing the comorbidity have been developed and tested. Little is known about the impact of the comorbid addictive disorders and trauma-related disorders on the adolescent developmental trajectory, the ability of the adolescents to acquire crucial psychosocial skills in the face of these twin disorders. In view of the adolescent tendency not to self-disclose, pro-active screening for trauma in the population of addicted adolescents, as well as screening for substance abuse in those who had experienced trauma, is highly indicated.

AB  - Abstract Homelessness is recognised to be a traumatic event in itself and is often preceded by the experience of violence. More recent research has indicated that homelessness can function to enact growth and resilience in women with dependent children. This review paper draws together findings from a series of studies involving women with dependent children who experience homelessness. It identifies key psychosocial and health priorities in this population and how findings related to resilience and growth can be harnessed in therapeutic work. Pragmatic service developments and examples of good practice in therapeutic and multi-agency interventions from the domestic violence and homelessness literature are described and recommendations are made for developing services and working therapeutically with marginalised and transient populations. Therapists need to work in a flexible and integrated way with other key services, so that the crisis and long term needs of this population are met.

AB  - Abstract Title.? Professional nursing culture on a trauma unit: experiences of patients and staff Aim.? This paper is a report of a study to explore the day-to-day experiences of patients and staff on a unit dedicated to the care of adult patients who have sustained an injury. Background.? With the numbers of people suffering traumatic injury increasing, provision of their acute care and rehabilitation is also of increasing concern. Staff have the potential to optimize recovery but the factors that facilitate or inhibit this in practice are unclear. Method.? This ethnographic study took place on a trauma unit in the United Kingdom between November 2004 and January 2006. Sixteen periods of observation, qualitative interviews with 40 patients and 19 staff, and four focus groups with staff were undertaken. Thematic analysis was conducted and data were analysed by sentence. Findings.? The dynamic process of patient-centred care was expressed through the themes of closeness, therapeutic care and working as a team. Closeness conveyed the sudden and devastating nature of injury, and the necessity for staff to let go of feelings to maintain a positive momentum. Therapeutic care highlighted the social connection between the staff and the patients, combined with a proactive dynamic approach to care. Working as a team identified the importance of maintaining expertise and making the system work for patients to ensure the best possible care. Conclusion.? By identifying the context and processes that facilitate recovery, it becomes possible to provide a framework for individuals and units to develop and improve practice that enhances recovery. These findings may be useful for other similar areas of care.

AB  - Abstract Much of the theoretical focus in post-traumatic stress disorder has been on the role of the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Crucially, in unresolved traumatic experiences that underlie clinical presentations, this focus misses the brain areas key to the defence responses of fight, flight and freeze?and the associated affects of anger, fear and grief. The periaqueductal gray in the midbrain, with the hypothalamus, is essential for these somatic and emotional responses to traumatic experiences. We argue that when treatment approaches thought to work at the higher brain levels have been ineffective, it is because they have failed to engage the midbrain and hypothalamic sources of the affective responses to the trauma and to the memory of it. Basic affects have been so overwhelming that dissociation, or a similarly protective neurochemical capping mechanism, has prevented full resolution of the affective content of the adversity. Treatment with the Comprehensive Resource Model? (CRM) aims to clear the clinically relevant residues of adverse experiences by resolving the emotional responses accessed through the body memories. When the trauma has led to overwhelming distress, and/or dissociation, there is a necessity for robust resourcing to be in place before the emotional intensity of that distress is accessed. Resourcing needs to be as proximal to the re-experience as possible to promote complete resolution and in some psychotherapy modalities, the supports provided are somewhat remote from the crucial moments of processing. Therefore, we describe how the CRM seeks to have robustly resourced states present concurrently with traumatised states to avoid overwhelming emotional distress. This allows safe entry into the deepest pain residual from the traumatic event so that it is not overwhelming during processing of the memory, and does not lead to further dissociation, allowing the individual to remain fully present throughout. This ?stepping into the affect? can then be so rapidly effective that we also argue that CRM is not an exposure treatment; re-orientation to the deepest content of the experience resolves the residual distress quickly and permanently through memory reconsolidation. Re-learning at upper brain levels will then follow from the revoking of the affective power, which has previously driven stimulus/context and response learning in the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Owing to the potentially devastating effects of trauma-induced depression, explaining the relationship between trauma and depressive symptoms is important. In this study, we measured lifelong exposure to potentially traumatic events and depressive symptoms in 370-female undergraduates. We also measured anxiety, past negative time perspective and dissociation as potential mediators. Trauma exposure and depressive symptoms were related with a small but significant effect size (r = .16). Trauma was not associated with dissociation. We found that past negative time perspective and anxiety were full statistical mediators of this trauma-depressive symptoms relationship. These two mediators combined accounted for all of the variance in that association. Anxiety accounted for more of the variance than past negative time perspective. A proposed explanation is that trauma both affectively elevates anxiety and cognitively creates an enduring focus on the events. Chronic anxiety and a past negative time perspective may lead to depression over time. The clinical implications are possible explanations as to why some treatments work.

AB  - Abstract??? Maxillofacial and dental injuries are not uncommon. These injuries may cause morbidity and demand meticulously planned treatment. Part 1 of this study focused on the incidence of general trauma injuries, as well as facial or dental trauma. The aim of part 2 is to evaluate the severity and location of the dento-alveolar and maxillofacial injuries over 5?years. A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on data from the Israel National Trauma Registry. Patients admitted and hospitalized due to trauma injuries during the years 2000?2004, totaled 111?010 in which 5886 (5.3%) were maxillofacial or dental injuries. Most of these injuries were traffic-related (54.5%), followed by events at home (18.7%). Facial injuries combined with injuries to other organs involved occurred in 3721 (63.2%) of the patients. Most minor injuries were noted when no other organs were involved, while severe injuries were more common when multiple organs were involved. More than 25% of facial injuries required surgery. Meticulous epidemiologic studies are needed to support the leading role, extent, and severity of maxillofacial trauma.

AB  - SUMMARY HLA-DR expression on monocytes as marker for monocytic function is severely depressed after major trauma. The membrane enzyme aminopeptidase N/CD13 can trigger help in antigen processing by MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells. We determined the simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and CD13 on peripheral blood monocytes of patients with major trauma (injury severity score of ≥16). 1?: 1 conjugates of phycoerythrin (PE)-to-monoclonal antibody were used in combination with QuantiBRITETM PE beads for a standardized quantification in terms of antibodies bound per cell (ABC). The very low expression of HLA-DR antigen on monocytes of patients at day 1 after major trauma confirmed previous results in the literature. Monocytic HLA-DR expression increased slowly to reach values in the lower range of healthy volunteers at day 14. Monocytic CD13 expression at day 1 showed values in the range of healthy volunteers, and a strong rise afterwards. Fourteen days after trauma, the monocytic expression of CD13 was still much higher than in the control group. Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 have been shown to be involved in the depressed HLA-DR expression on monocytes in trauma patients, we studied the in vitro effects of LPS and interleukin (IL)-10 on the expression of CD13 on monocytes prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Whereas a 3-day IL-10 treatment resulted in a down-regulation of both HLA-DR and CD13 expression on monocytes, LPS caused a down-regulation of HLA-DR but a rapid up-regulation of CD13 levels. Therefore we suggest that, with respect to monocytic CD13 expression, LPS rather than IL-10 could well be the explanation for monocytic surface molecules after severe injury, although other mediators with a CD13 regulating function have to be considered.

AB  - Objective To describe the technique and findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? protocol in dogs suffering from trauma. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study on a new point-of-care ultrasound protocol on 64 dogs suffering from trauma and comparison of findings with radiology. Results Comparison of the results of this new ultrasound protocol for trauma patients with radiography findings for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, alveolar-interstitial syndrome and abdominal effusion revealed positive agreement of 89, 83, 100 and 87% and negative agreement of 76, 83, 76 and 92%, respectively. Novel findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? exam, which were not previously reported for dogs undergoing focused assessment with sonography for trauma, included alveolar-interstitial syndrome (suggestive of pulmonary contusions), diaphragmatic hernia, retroperitoneal effusion and tracheal injury. Our new technique may also help identify increased intracranial pressure via changes in optic nerve sheath diameter and haemodynamic instability through the evaluation of the caudal vena cava and cardiac function. Clinical Significance The described ultrasound examination protocol can be rapidly performed on dogs suffering from trauma during resuscitation and it may detect injuries previously undetectable using other veterinary point-of-care ultrasound protocols.

AB  - Australia?s population is ageing. Statistics predict that by the year 2021, 17.8% of our population will be over the age of 65 years.1 These statistics are reflected in most Western nations. The elderly represent an increasing proportion of emergency department patients. They are generally more acute on presentation, they get admitted more frequently, and account for an increasing proportion of admissions to intensive care units.2 The elderly trauma patient will increasingly consume more resources than patients from any other age group. There are significant differences in physiology and response to trauma between the elderly patient and the young. Airway compromises, a decrease in lung compliance, a change in cardiovascular haemostasis and the prevalence of pre-existing disease all contribute to increase morbidity and mortality in a patient with an already limited physiological reserve. Many studies demonstrate an increased mortality in hospitalized elderly trauma patients. For those who die from traumatic insult, death is mainly due to multi- organ system failure.3 The long-term functional outcome of the elderly trauma patient has been investigated by a number of authors. One study showed that only 8% of survivors returned to independent living 1 year post-polytrauma.4 Another more encouraging study showed that 89% of survivors of blunt multiple trauma after 38 months were independent and living at home.5 Ethical issues have been raised regarding the appropriateness of care for the severely injured elderly patient given today?s ever-shrinking hospital finances and bed shortages. Today?s environment is very challenging as frequently, the clinician is forced to make an economic decision on who will take the last critical care bed, which is a far from optimal situation.

AB  - Objective:? To review the research addressing the relationship of childhood trauma to psychosis and schizophrenia, and to discuss the theoretical and clinical implications. Method:? Relevant studies and previous review papers were identified via computer literature searches. Results:? Symptoms considered indicative of psychosis and schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations, are at least as strongly related to childhood abuse and neglect as many other mental health problems. Recent large-scale general population studies indicate the relationship is a causal one, with a dose-effect. Conclusion:? Several psychological and biological mechanisms by which childhood trauma increases risk for psychosis merit attention. Integration of these different levels of analysis may stimulate a more genuinely integrated bio-psycho-social model of psychosis than currently prevails. Clinical implications include the need for staff training in asking about abuse and the need to offer appropriate psychosocial treatments to patients who have been abused or neglected as children. Prevention issues are also identified.

AB  - Background: Most studies on trauma and trauma systems have been conducted in the United States. We aimed to describe the factors predicting mortality in European trauma patients, with focus on triage. Methods: We prospectively registered all trauma patients in Eastern Denmark over 12 consecutive months. We analysed the flow of trauma patients through the system, the time spent at different locations, and we assessed the risk factors of mortality. Results: We included 2875 trauma patients, of whom 158 (5.5%) died before arrival at the hospital. Most patients (75.3%) were brought to local hospitals and patients primarily (n=82) or secondarily triaged (n=203) to the level I trauma centre were the most severely injured. Secondarily transferred patients spent a median of 150?min in the local hospital before transfer to the level I trauma centre and 48?min on transportation. Severe injury with an injury severity score >15 was seen in 345 patients, of whom 118 stayed at the local hospital. They had a significantly higher mortality than 116 of those secondarily transferred [45/118, 38.1% vs. 11/116, 9.7% (P<0.0001)]. Mortality within 30 days was 4.3% in admitted patients, and significant risk factors of death were violence [odds ratio (OR)=5.72], unconsciousness (OR=4.87), hypotension (OR=4.96), injury severity score >15 (OR=27.42), and age. Conclusions: Around 50% of all trauma deaths occurred at the scene. Increased survival of severely injured patients may be achieved by early transfer to highly specialised care.

AB  - Summary Traumatic accidents are responsible for almost half of deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 14 years. Motor vehicles are most commonly involved, with pedestrian accidents being a leading cause in the 5?9-year age group. Injuries to the urinary tract and associated complications remain a source of significant morbidity following trauma in the pediatric age group. The kidney is also the most commonly injured abdominal organ in children. This chapter reviews the presentation and evaluation of pediatric traumatic injuries of the kidney and evaluates current treatment options. The current evolving literature on nonoperative management of even high-grade renal injuries is reviewed. Ureteral and bladder trauma will also be reviewed.

AB  - Summary Treatment paradigms for bleeding and major vascular injury have evolved with the rise of endovascular surgery. Just over 2% of trauma patients suffer a vascular injury. The decision for endovascular or open intervention should be guided by the patient's clinical status, anatomy of the injury, and the resources available. Early endovascular procedures for solid organ injury are independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk after controlling for major confounders, including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival. In all-comers, the arterial injuries are transection (35%), occlusion (17%), partial transection/flow limiting defect (25%), pseudoaneurysm (9.0%), and other injuries including intimal defects (23%). Over half of the patients can be managed with non-operative management with a low 4% failure rate and conversion to intervention. Definitive endovascular and open repair were used in <10% and <25% of all patients, respectively, presenting to level 1 trauma centers.
