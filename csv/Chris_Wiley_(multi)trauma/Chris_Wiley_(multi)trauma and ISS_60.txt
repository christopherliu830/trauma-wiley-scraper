AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and socioeconomic problem throughout the world. It is a complicated pathological process that consists of primary insults and a secondary insult characterized by a set of biochemical cascades. The imbalance between a higher energy demand for repair of cell damage and decreased energy production led by mitochondrial dysfunction aggravates cell damage. At the cellular level, the main cause of the secondary deleterious cascades is cell damage that is centred in the mitochondria. Excitotoxicity, Ca2+ overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Bcl-2 family, caspases and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) are the main participants in mitochondria-centred cell damage following TBI. Some preclinical and clinical results of mitochondria-targeted therapy show promise. Mitochondria- targeted multipotential therapeutic strategies offer new hope for the successful treatment of TBI and other acute brain injuries.

AB  - Background: Several studies have shown that GTR therapy of intrabony defects results in significantly better outcomes than access flap alone. Most of the available data, however, have been produced in highly controlled research environments by a small group of investigators. Generalizability of results to different clinicians and different subject populations has not been evaluated so far. Methods: This parallel group study involved 143 patients recruited in a practicebased research network of 11 offices in 7 countries. It was designed to evaluate: 1) the applicability of the documented added benefits of GTR in the treatment of intrabony defects to different populations, and 2) the generalizability of the expected results to different clinicians. GTR was compared to access flap alone. Defects, one in each patient, were accessed with a previously described papilla preservation flap in both the test and control group. In addition, GTR sites received application of a bioabsorbable poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide membrane. A stringent plaque control regimen was enforced in all patients during the 1-year observation period. Outcomes included gains in clinical attachment (CAL) and reductions in probing depth. Results: Observed gains in CAL were 2.18 ± 1.46 mm for access flap and 3.04 ± 1.64 mm for the GTR-treated group. The treatment-associated difference was statistically significant (P = 0.03) after correcting for both center effect and defect anatomy. Among the various centers, a 1.73 mm difference in CAL gain was observed. This is a clinically relevant amount, which underlines the significance of center variability in the outcome of periodontal surgical procedures. A frequency distribution analysis of the obtained CAL gains indicated that GTR treatment of deep intrabony defects decreased, with respect to the access flap control, the probability of obtaining only a modest attachment gain at 1 year. Conversely, CAL gains of 4 mm or more were observed in more than 40% of GTR-treated defects and in less than 20% of the controls (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: These data indicate that GTR therapy of deep intrabony defects performed by different clinicians on various patient populations resulted in both greater amounts and improved predictability of CAL gains than access flap alone.

AB  - Abstract Views differ on how far the subject of death has ever been taboo in Western Society. Walter (1991) criticised the way the ?taboo thesis? has been presented, arguing that it has often been ?grossly overdrawn and lacking in subtlety?. Research suggests that suicide and other traumatic death may be particularly difficult for people to talk about or even acknowledge. We interviewed 80 people bereaved due to suicide, or other traumatic death and used interpretative thematic analysis to consider whether the ?death taboo? is evident in these bereavement narratives. People referred to suicide as a different, even stigmatised, death but we also found that those bereaved through other traumatic death felt that their reactions had to be contained and relatively silent. The exception was those bereaved through terrorism or train crash, who were encouraged to grieve openly and angrily: reactions to deaths which are seen as ?private troubles? differ from reactions to deaths which are seen as ?public issues?. Using a symbolic interactionist approach we conclude that the shock and suddenness of the death is tied up both with the circumstances of the death (suicide, murder, accident, terrorism) and the attendant consequences for the social acceptance of public displays of mourning.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric critical care. The Transfusion Requirements in Pediatric Intensive Care Units study randomized to either transfusion threshold 9.5?g/dL or 7?g/dL using leukocyte-reduced packed red blood cells (PRBC). Deaths, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), adverse events, ventilator days, and nosocomial infections were not significantly different in the two groups. When split into subgroups of pediatric cardiac surgery patients and pediatric general surgery patients, the restrictive PRBC transfusion strategy showed no increase in MODS. PRBC transfusions appear to be independently linked to increased risk of morbidity and mortality in critically ill pediatric patients. Pediatric intensivists have recognized that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children is different from ARDS in adults. Recurrent hypotension in a pediatric trauma patient occurs late and may be an ominous sign.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of ezetimibe/simvastatin (EZE/SIMVA) tablet and SIMVA monotherapy. This was an extension study of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. Protocol-compliant patients who completed the 12-week base study were eligible to enter a randomised, double-blind, 14-week extension study and were administered 1 of 8 daily treatments: EZE/SIMVA 10/10-, 10/20-, 10/40- or 10/80-mg, or SIMVA 10-, 20-, 40- or 80-mg. Patients receiving these treatments during the base study remained on the same treatment in the extension. Patients administered placebo or EZE 10-mg monotherapy during the base study were re-randomised to EZE/SIMVA 10/10?mg or SIMVA 80?mg. The primary analysis was mean per cent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline to extension study end-point. Mean changes from baseline in LDL-C of ?38.8% and ?53.7% were observed for pooled SIMVA and pooled EZE/SIMVA respectively. The between treatment difference of ?14.9% (95% confidence interval: ?16.4, ?13.3) was statistically significant (p?<?0.001). The incremental LDL-C lowering effect of EZE/SIMVA compared with the corresponding dose of SIMVA alone was consistent across the dose range (p?<?0.001 for each between-group comparison). More patients receiving EZE/SIMVA than SIMVA achieved LDL-C concentrations <?100?mg/dl and <?70?mg/dl (p?<?0.001 for both goals). EZE/SIMVA was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to SIMVA monotherapy. There were no significant between-group differences in the incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver transaminase or creatine kinase levels. In conclusion, EZE/SIMVA had a comparable safety and tolerability profile and was more efficacious than SIMVA monotherapy for up to 6?months.

AB  - Abstract Productivity is one of the components of occupational performance in occupational therapy. Thus, work status is an important area to address after head injury. Many studies on long-term outcomes after head injury document return to work post injury but often do not report the nature of employment after injury. The aim of this study was to examine change in vocational status 10 years after head injury and explore participants' perception of how this injury affected career plans. Eighty-three out of 100 subjects were traced 10 years post injury from a large trauma centre in Canada. Of these, 59 agreed to participate in a telephone interview where data on employment were collected. Occupations before and after injury were coded using three indices (Hollingshead Index, Blishen Socioeconomic Index for Occupations, and the Pineo Socioeconomic Classification of Occupations). The study shows that, on average, subjects who are employed before and after injury stay at the same level of vocational status or improve slightly. Younger age (p<0.05) and being male (p<0.10) were associated with an increase in status. Six major themes on how injury affected career plans emerged. It is recommended that greater attention be given to coding occupations in research, clinical work and follow-up studies of head injured subjects. Copyright ? 1997 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a very attractive tool in the context of repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue damaged by trauma. The most common source of MPCs to date has been the bone marrow, but aspirating bone marrow from the patient is an invasive procedure. In an attempt to search for alternative sources of MPCs that could be obtained with minimal invasion, we looked into traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. In this study, we determined whether a population of multipotent MPCs could be isolated from acute traumatic knee hemarthrosis in the absence of intra-articular fractures. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the aspirated hemarthrosis by density gradient separation, and cultured. We were able to obtain plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells from the mononuclear cell fractions. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the adherent fibroblast-like cells were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and were negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. These were similar to control bone marrow stromal cells. These cells could differentiate in vitro into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells in the presence of lineage-specific induction factors. In conclusion, acute unfractured traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee contains MPCs with multipotentiality. Because knee hemarthrosis is easy to harvest with minimal pain and without unnecessary invasion, we regard hemarthrosis-derived cells as an additional progenitor cell source for future tissue engineering and cell-based therapy in knee injuries.

AB  - Abstract Methamphetamine abuse and dependence, frequently accompanied by schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms [methamphetamine-associated psychosis (MAP)], is a serious public health problem worldwide. Few studies, however, have characterized brain dysfunction associated with MAP, nor investigated similarities and differences in brain dysfunction between MAP and schizophrenia. We compared prefrontal cortical activity associated with stop-signal inhibitory task in 21 patients with MAP, 14 patients with schizophrenia and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls using a 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. Both the MAP and the schizophrenia groups showed significantly reduced activation in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared with controls; however, only the MAP group showed reduced activation in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex. The MAP group demonstrated significant positive correlations between task performance and hemodynamic responses in the bilateral ventrolateral, polar and left dorsolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex. The MAP and schizophrenia groups demonstrated a significant difference in the relationship of impulsivity to hemodynamic changes in the bilateral premotor cortex. These findings characterize similarities and differences in prefrontal cortical dysfunction between psychosis associated with methamphetamine and schizophrenia. The reduced hemodynamic changes in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex suggest a common underlying pathophysiology of MAP and schizophrenia, whereas those in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex point to an impaired state that is either inherent or caused specifically by methamphetamine use.

AB  - Objective To compare cost-effectiveness of integrated care with therapeutic assertive community treatment (IC-TACT) versus standard care (SC) in multiple-episode psychosis. Method Twelve-month IC-TACT in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar I disorders were compared with a historical control group. Primary outcomes were entropy-balanced cost-effectiveness based on mental healthcare costs from a payers? perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a measure of health effects during 12-month follow-up. Results At baseline, patients in IC-TACT (n = 214) had significantly higher illness severity and lower functioning than SC (n = 56). Over 12 months, IC-TACT had significantly lower days in inpatient (10.3 ± 20.5 vs. 28.2 ± 44.9; P = 0.005) and day-clinic care (2.6 ± 16.7 vs. 16.4 ± 33.7; P = 0.004) and correspondingly lower costs (??55 084). Within outpatient care, IC-TACT displayed a higher number of treatment contacts (116.3 ± 45.3 vs. 15.6 ± 6.3) and higher related costs (?+1417). Both resulted in lower total costs in IC-TACT (mean difference = ??13 248 ± 2975, P < 0.001). Adjusted incremental QALYs were significantly higher for IC-TACT versus SC (+0.10 ± 0.37, P = 0.05). The probability of cost-effectiveness of IC-TACT was constantly higher than 99%. Conclusion IC-TACT was cost-effective compared with SC. The use of prima facies ?costly? TACT teams is highly recommended to improve outcomes and save total cost for patients with severe psychotic disorders.

AB  - Abstract:? In oncology, quality of care is a major issue for patients and providers. Significant variations in care, including nonreceipt of adjuvant systemic therapy, nonadherence to therapy, and/or early discontinuation of therapy, occur frequently and may impact survival. Reasons for these variations are not well understood, but may play a role in the prominent disparity in breast cancer survival between blacks and whites. Since May 2006, the Breast Cancer Quality of Care Study (BQUAL) has recruited 1158 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer from several centers across the country, with completed data on 1057 participants to date. Detailed information on demographic, behavioral, biomedical, and emotional factors related to chemotherapy use was collected on each participant at baseline and at two follow-up interviews during the first 6?months. In addition, for women with ER+ tumors, further questionnaires were completed every 6?months regarding hormonal therapy use. Each participant was also asked to provide a DNA sample, and to allow medical record review. We surveyed physicians providing care to the study participants regarding attitudes toward adjuvant treatment. The mean age of participants was 58?years (SD 11.6), and 15% (n?=?160) were black. The majority had an annual household income <$90,000 (n?=?683), had college education or higher (n?=?802), 55.9% were married, and 57.9% were not currently employed. Seventy-six percent had hormone-receptor-positive tumors, 49.9% initiated chemotherapy and 82.7% started hormonal therapy. Blacks were more likely to have lower annual household income (p?<?0001), less education (p?=?0.0005), ER negative tumor status (p?=?0.02), and poorly differentiated cancer (p?=?0.0002). The main endpoints of the study are noninitiation of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, nonadherence to therapy and early discontinuation of therapy. Treatment and outcomes will be compared on the 15% of participants who are black versus other participants. The BQUAL Study will be a rich ongoing source of information regarding reasons for differences in receipt of both adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. This information may be useful in planning interventions to improve quality of care.

AB  - Abstract Trauma surgery lack, substitute, for the reconstruction of large defects of the long bones. Encouraged by the promising results of bone allotransplantation in animal models, we successfully performed vascularized bone transplantation in humans. Vascularized femoral diaphyses were allogenically transplanted into three patients suffering from chondrosarcoma or post-traumatic osteomyelitis with postoperative immunosuppression. The bone segments were harvested from multi-organ donors and perfused with UW solution. After back-table preparation, the grafts were transplanted into the defect zone. Interlocking devices were used in these operations. Vascular anastomoses were performed in end-to-side technique. The early clinical course of the patients was not free of anatomical, technical, or immunological complications. However, all patients are currently free of malignancy and infection. They are also free of pain and full weight bearing. We conclude that allogenic grafting of vascularized bone segments has the potential to become an alternative for the replacement of large bone defects.

AB  - Abstract Background The intranasal (IN) route for rapid drug administration in patients with brain disorders, including status epilepticus, has been investigated. Status epilepticus is an emergency, and the IN route offers a valuable alternative to other routes, especially when these fail. Objectives To compare IN versus IV midazolam (MDZ) at the same dosage (0.2?mg/kg) for controlling status epilepticus in dogs. Animals Client-owned dogs (n = 44) with idiopathic epilepsy, structural epilepsy, or epilepsy of unknown origin manifesting as status epilepticus. Methods Randomized parallel group clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated to the IN-MDZ (n = 21) or IV-MDZ (n = 23) group. Number of successfully treated cases (defined as seizure cessation within 5?minutes and lasting for ≥10?minutes), seizure cessation time, and adverse effects were recorded. Comparisons were performed using the Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests with statistical significance set at α?<?.05. Results IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ successfully stopped status epilepticus in 76% and 61% of cases, respectively (P = .34). The median seizure cessation time was 33 and 64?seconds for IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ, respectively (P = .63). When the time to place an IV catheter was taken into account, IN-MDZ (100?seconds) was superior (P = .04) to IV-MDZ (270?seconds). Sedation and ataxia were seen in 88% and 79% of the dogs treated with IN-MDZ and IV-MDZ, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Both routes are quick, safe, and effective for controlling status epilepticus. However, the IN route demonstrated superiority when the time needed to place an IV catheter was taken into account.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to determine those factors which contribute to a poor outcome and to propose a management plan that is complementary to trauma systems in common use. Methods: A prospective study of 110 consecutive patients with moderate head injury (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 9?13) was carried out. Results: A total of 75% of the patients sustained multisystem trauma, generally of minor or moderate grade according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However, the death rate increased with the severity of the injury as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The initial cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was abnormal in 61% and no patient with a normal scan developed a delayed intracranial haematoma or neurological worsening. Those patients who developed a delayed intracerebral haematoma had a worse outcome. Sixteen patients underwent craniotomy for haematoma. The intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured selectively in 20 patients and exceeded 20 mmHg in half, requiring treatment. Nine patients died, four as a result of head injury and all those had an intracranial haematoma. As a group, those who died were older and had a higher ISS. Conclusions: A plan for care of patients with moderate head injury is proposed, complementary to the Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) protocol and the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia guidelines for neurotrauma management in rural and remote locations.

AB  - Summary Aim Peri-operative hyperglycaemia is associated with an increased incidence of adverse outcomes. Communication between primary and secondary care is paramount to minimise these harms. National guidance in the UK recommends that the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) should be measured within 3 months prior to surgery and that the concentration should be less that 69 mmol/mol (8.5%). In addition, national guidance outlines the minimum dataset that should be included in any letter at the time of referral to the surgeons. Currently, it is unclear how well this process is being carried out. This study investigated the quality of information being handed over during the referral from primary care to surgical outpatients within the East of England. Methods Primary care referrals to nine different NHS hospital Trusts were gathered over a 1-week period. All age groups were included from 11 different surgical specialties. Referral letters were analysed using a standardised data collection tool based on the national guidelines. Results A total of 1919 referrals were received, of whom 169 (8.8%) had previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM). However, of these, 38 made no mention of DM in the referral letter but were on glucose-lowering agents. Only 13 (7.7%) referrals for patients with DM contained a recent HbA1c, and 20 (11.8%) contained no documentation of glucose-lowering medication. Conclusion This study has shown that the quality of referral letters to surgical specialties for patients with DM in the East of England remain inadequate. There is a clear need for improving the quality of clinical data contained within referral letters from primary care. In addition, we have shown that the rate of referral for surgery for people with diabetes is almost 50% higher than the background population with diabetes.

AB  - Abstract Brewin's dual representation theory, Ehlers and Clark's cognitive appraisal model, and Dalgleish's schematic, propositional, analogue and associative representational systems model are considered in the light of recent evidence on the neural substrates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The models' proposals about the cognitive mechanism of memory dysfunction in PTSD are described and evaluated against current knowledge about the neural pathways and functions disrupted in PTSD. A dual pathway model of memory is consistent with neuroscience of memory. The appraisal model also provides an account of the top-down modulation of memory and arousal problems consistent with current neuroscientific evidence of PTSD. Dalgleish's model is less consistent with the evidence because it relies upon assumptions that cannot yet be tested neuroscientifically. All three models under-specify the causal and maintaining influence of hyperarousal relative to the role it plays in current neuroscientific models of PTSD. Implications of the evidence for improving treatment and prevention are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Much research has shown that reports of stressful life events are related to a wide variety of psychiatric and physical health outcomes. Relatively little research exists, however, on the distribution of the events according to gender, age, racial/ethnic background, and socioeconomic status (SES). Such information would help identify groups at greatest risk for further investigation. This paper presents a review of the relevant studies. We find that traumatic (e.g., life threatening) events appear to be more frequent for men, while men and women differ more consistently on types rather than on overall numbers of stressful events other than traumatic. Traumatic and other stressful events tend to be more frequent in low SES and racial/ethnic minorities groups, and finally, both traumatic and other stressful events are reported more by younger age groups in samples 18 years of age and older. The limitations and implications of these findings for further research and preventive interventions are discussed, especially the need for more detailed information about individual events.
