AB  - Abstract This article reviews in both directions the recent literature on the relationship between Eating Disorders (ED) and chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to shed some light on an area of comorbidity for too long overlooked. PTSD may be the commonest anxiety disorder in ED but it seems to be independent from ED. Clinicians should be aware that PTSD might represent more than just an occasional occurrence in ED clinical work and should know how to approach it.

AB  - Abstract Much research has shown that reports of stressful life events are related to a wide variety of psychiatric and physical health outcomes. Relatively little research exists, however, on the distribution of the events according to gender, age, racial/ethnic background, and socioeconomic status (SES). Such information would help identify groups at greatest risk for further investigation. This paper presents a review of the relevant studies. We find that traumatic (e.g., life threatening) events appear to be more frequent for men, while men and women differ more consistently on types rather than on overall numbers of stressful events other than traumatic. Traumatic and other stressful events tend to be more frequent in low SES and racial/ethnic minorities groups, and finally, both traumatic and other stressful events are reported more by younger age groups in samples 18 years of age and older. The limitations and implications of these findings for further research and preventive interventions are discussed, especially the need for more detailed information about individual events.

AB  - ABSTRACT Pelvic bone segmentation is a vital step in analyzing pelvic CT images, which assists physicians with diagnostic decision making in cases of traumatic pelvic injuries. Due to the limited resolution of the original CT images and the complexity of pelvic structures and their possible fractures, automatic pelvic bone segmentation in multiple CT slices is very difficult. In this study, an automatic pelvic bone segmentation approach is proposed using the combination of anatomical knowledge and computational techniques. It is developed for solving the problem of accurate and efficient bone segmentation using multiple consecutive pelvic CT slices obtained from each patient. Our proposed segmentation method is able to handle variation of bone shapes between slices there by making it less susceptible to inter-personal variability between different patients' data. Moreover, the designed training models are validated using a cross-validation process to demonstrate the effectiveness. The algorithm's capability is tested on a set of 20 CT data sets. Successful segmentation results and quantitative evaluations are present to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed algorithm, well suited for pelvic bone segmentation purposes.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among young adults. Substance abusers constitute a disproportionate percentage of these patients. A history of substance abuse predicts increased disability, poorer prognosis, and delayed recovery. While consensus in the literature indicates that substance-abuse rates decline following injury, conflicting literature shows a significant history of brain injury in addicts. We reviewed the literature on substance abuse after TBI to explore the state of knowledge on TBI as a risk factor for substance abuse. While recent reviews regarding substance abuse in TBI patients concur that substance-abuse rates decline even after mild TBI, an emerging literature suggests mild TBI may cause subtle impairments in cognitive, executive, and decision-making functions that are often poorly recognized in early diagnosis and treatment. When combined with difficulties in psychosocial adjustment and coping skills, these impairments may increase the risk for chronic substance abuse in a subset of TBI patients. Preliminary results from veterans indicate these patterns hold in a combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder population with TBI. This increasingly prevalent combination presents a specific challenge in rehabilitation. While this comorbidity presents a challenge for the successful treatment and rehabilitation of both disorders, there is sparse evidence to recommend any specific treatment strategy for these individuals. Mild TBI and substance abuse are bidirectionally related both for risks and treatment. Further understanding the neuropsychiatric pathology and different effects of different types of injuries will likely improve the implementation of effective treatments for each of these two conditions.

AB  - Summary Despite reports of successful pregnancies in heart transplant (HTx) recipients, many centers recommend their patients against maternity. We reviewed our provincial experience of pregnancy in HTx recipients by performing charts review of all known gestations following HTx in the province of Quebec (Canada), stratified between planned and unplanned pregnancies. Long-term survival was compared to HTx recipient women of childbearing age who did not become pregnant. Eighteen pregnancies, 56% unplanned, occurred in eight patients, 10.1 (2.6?27.0) years after HTx. Immunosuppression was CNI-based, with a mean dose increase of 48.3% (tacrolimus) and 26.5% (cyclosporine), without rejection. Cardiometabolic complications were high compared to the general Canadian population, including preeclampsia (15.4% vs. 5.5%), hypertension (38.5% vs. 4.6%), and diabetes (15.4% vs. 5.6%). Mean gestational age was 35.1 (23.4?39.6) weeks (72.2% live births; 53.8% prematurity). Mean birthweight was 2418 (660?3612) g. Serum creatinine increased during pregnancy, becoming significant after delivery (P = 0.0239), and returning to preconception level in all but three patients within a year. After 4.6 (1.2?17.2) years of follow-up, two rejection episodes occurred in one patient. Long-term mortality was similar to overall HTx women (Kaplan?Meier; P = 0.8071). Pregnancy in HTx carries high cardiometabolic complications and decreased kidney function, but is feasible with acceptable outcomes and no impact on mother's survival.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at a high incidence, involving millions of individuals in the U.S. alone. Related to this, there are large numbers of litigants and claimants who are referred annually for forensic evaluation. In formulating opinions regarding claimed injuries, the present review advises experts to rely on two sets of information: TBI outcome and neuropsychological dose?response studies of non-litigants and non-claimants, and response bias literature that has demonstrated the relatively high risk of invalid responding among examinees referred within a secondary gain context, which in turn has resulted in the development of specific assessment methods. Regarding prospective methods for detecting possible response bias, both symptom validity tests, for measuring over-reporting of symptoms on inventories and questionnaires, and performance validity tests, for measuring insufficient effort on ability tests, are considered essential.

AB  - This article describes the Summer Institute in Global Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, a brief immersion training program for mental health, health, and allied professionals who work with populations that have endured severe adversities and trauma, such as domestic and political violence, extreme poverty, armed conflict, epidemics, and natural disasters. The course taught participants to apply collaborative and contextually sensitive approaches to enhance social connectedness and resilience in families, communities, and organizations. This article presents core training principles and vignettes which illustrate how those engaging in such interventions must: (1) work in the context of a strong and supportive organization; (2) appreciate the complexity of the systems with which they are engaging; and (3) be open to the possibilities for healing and transformation. The program utilized a combination of didactic presentations, hands-on interactive exercises, case studies, and experiential approaches to organizational team building and staff stress management.

AB  - Abstract Background Women are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than men. Limited research exists evaluating the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) among military women with PTSD. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using US Department of Defense (DoD) data comprised of all active-duty women giving birth to their first, liveborn singleton infant using DoD-sponsored health insurance from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008 (n = 34 176). Birth hospitalisation records, maternal mental health visits, and Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) and Reassessment (PDHRA) screenings were included. The HDP outcome (yes vs no) was defined using ICD-9-CM codes in the maternal birth hospitalisation record. Women fit into one of four PTSD exposure categories (confirmed, probable, possible, none). Confirmed cases had a PTSD ICD-9-CM diagnosis code. Probable/possible cases were classified using PDHA screening items. We used multiple log-linear regression to assess PTSD (confirmed, any vs none) and the risk of HDP overall, and then explored effect modification by military service and demographic variables. We assessed the risk of HDP among deployed mothers with PTSD (confirmed, probable/possible vs none) who completed a PDHA, and explored effect modification by race/ethnicity. We also assessed risk of HDP with differing PTSD lead times. Results Overall, PTSD was not associated with HDP except among mothers whose PTSD was diagnosed ≥1 year prior to conception (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06, 1.90). Conclusions Post-traumatic stress disorder preceding conception by at least a year appeared to confer an increased risk of HDP, but further research is needed using more thorough PTSD assessment.

AB  - Abstract Any discussion of the regulation of effector class must include feedback control on the magnitude of the response. The induced effector activities are biodestructive and ridding. They are, in and of themselves, unspecific with respect to self and nonself. Consequently all responses include some level of innocent bystander pathology. The regulation of magnitude is essential to keeping this level of pathology at an evolutionarily acceptable level. This is my postulated role of suppressor T-cells, more popularly referred to as Treg. In order to perform this function they must be somatically selected to be anti-nonself like all other T/B-cells. If correct, any role that they might play in determining normal tolerance is excluded. As the commentary of Ellestad illustrates, their function to regulate autoimmunity is the consensus view today and, therefore, this competing concept and my analysis of suggested papers should invite a wide ranging debate.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder is a long-lasting psychiatric disease after the traumatic experience of severe fatal stress with the consequence of hippocampal atrophy. Freezing behaviors were more than quintupled on the fear-conditioning test in mice previously subjected to water immersion restrain stress (WIRS) with metronome tones when determined 1?28?days after WIRS, while these mice exhibited the increased immobility time on the forced swimming test with the increased spontaneous locomotion. Prior experience of WIRS led to a transient decrease in subsequent 5-bromo-2?-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into proliferating cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. These behavioral and neurochemical alterations were significantly prevented by the daily injection of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, respectively. Moreover, WIRS significantly decreased the number of cells holding BrdU without affecting the differentiation ratio to astroglial and neuronal lineages 28?days later. Prior administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist significantly prevented the aforementioned changes by WIRS. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may play a role in mechanisms underlying the crisis of a variety of psychiatric symptoms relevant to post-traumatic stress disorder through transient suppression of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the murine hippocampal dentate gyrus.

This article briefly describes the winding journey of three investigators, two Kuwaitis, a sociologist and the other asocial work researcher, and one American psychologist. Their goal was to tale the emotional pulse of Kuwait in the shadows of fifteen years of Iraq-induced trauma. Along the way they adopt an indigenous focus that lead them to invent a measure of Raha (wellbeing) especially suited for studying Kuwaitis. The latter portion of the paper describes the procedures and results of the development of the Kuwaiti Raha Scale, ending with a discussion of the implications for international research in the social sciences. This study was funded by the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science (KFAS).

AB  - Abstract We treated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) and evaluated the effect of treatment on white matter reorganization using MRI. We subjected male Wistar rats (n?=?17) to controlled cortical impact and either withheld treatment (controls; n?=?9) or inserted collagen scaffolds containing hMSCs (n?=?8). Six weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and MRI revealed selective migration of grafted neural progenitor cells towards the white matter reorganized boundary of the TBI-induced lesion. Histology confirmed that the white matter had been reorganized, associated with increased fractional anisotropy (FA; p?<?0.01) in the recovery regions relative to the injured core region in both treated and control groups. Treatment with hMSCs increased FA in the recovery regions, lowered T2 in the core region, decreased lesion volume and improved functional recovery relative to untreated controls. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral cortex at the boundary of the lesion. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging confirmed the immunohistological data and provided information on axonal rewiring. The apparent kurtosis coefficient (AKC) detected additional axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed by immunohistological staining, compared with FA. Our data demonstrate that AKC, FA, FT and T2 can be used to evaluate treatment-induced white matter recovery, which may facilitate restorative therapy in patients with TBI.

AB  - Abstract Aims and objectives Adults with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have immediate and chronic cognitive impairments that require use of specific nursing strategies. Nurses must be knowledgeable about strategies to use to accommodate these impairments. However, available clinical guidelines and research lack information to direct nonacute nursing management of cognition, limiting guidance for nurses when developing their care plans. The purpose of this study was to investigate strategies nurses use when caring for patients with moderate-to-severe TBI who have cognitive impairments. Design Cross-sectional, exploratory study. Methods A total of 692 nurses from three hospitals answered the following open-ended question via electronic survey: ?Imagine you are caring for a patient with moderate-to-severe TBI who has problems with cognition (e.g., issues with memory, attention, and executive function). Please state your typical nursing routine to care for this type of patient.? Data were analysed using summative content analysis. Methods are reported using COREQ guidelines (See File S1). Results Most respondents were female (89%), middle-aged (40.3 years), staff registered nurses (77%) practicing on an inpatient unit (51%) with prior experience caring for patients with moderate-to-severe TBI (95%). Nurses described 189 strategies used in their care plan when caring for patients with TBI who have cognitive impairments, including the following: (a) cognitive techniques; (b) communication techniques; (c) patient safety techniques; (d) agitation and behaviour management techniques; and (e) education techniques. Conclusions Findings have implications for education and training of nurses, direction for future research aimed at determining the effectiveness of nursing strategies with this patient population, and for development of clinical guidelines for nonacute nursing management of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI who have cognitive impairments. Relevance to clinical practice Findings provide foundational knowledge on strategies nurses use when caring for patients with TBI who have cognitive impairments, which could be used to direct evidence-based nursing care of this patient population.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes how the systematic ACCEPT approach enables movements of ill and injured patients between or within hospitals. Centralisation of specialist services means more transfers for clinical reasons. Many of these transfers will be time critical, some will be intensive, and some will be both. The chapter provides an overview of the patient groups that typically will need to be transferred to specialist centres, some of their characteristics and associated specific clinical management. Some of these broad categories of patients includes: neurosurgery (traumatic brain injury, cerebral bleeds), trauma, burns, vascular surgery (abdominal aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic dissection, acute limb ischaemia), interventional radiology, cardiology (primary coronary intervention), nephrology (acute renal failure), obstetric, and level 3 transfers. However, early and effective communication between centres is essential to ensure that any specific treatments are administered before or during the transfer to optimise patient care.

AB  - Abstract Background Few prospective studies about early loading of short implant have been available and very little evidence exists on the outcomes longer than 3 years. Purpose To assess clinical and radiographic outcomes of 6 mm-short implants placed in the posterior maxilla and mandible applying an early loading protocol. Materials and methods Ninety-five short implants (6 mm-short, ? 4 mm) were placed in 45 subjects at 3 study sites, 2 or 3 implants per subject, using a one-stage surgical procedure and loaded with a screw-retained splinted fixed prosthesis 6 weeks later. Follow-up took place at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after loading. Marginal bone level changes, implant survival, clinical variables, and adverse events were assessed. Results The survival rate for all implants placed was 95.8%. From implant loading to 3 years follow-up, mean marginal bone level changes were minimal (0.07?±?0.49 mm) and the peri-implant soft tissue status was healthy. No major technical or biological complications occurred except for the 4 early implant losses. Conclusion Three-year data indicates that the use of splinted 6 mm-short implants is a viable treatment in posterior regions with low marginal bone resorption. Early loading after 6 weeks should be taken cautiously in patients with known risk factors.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand?s disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficient levels of or dysfunctional von Willebrand factor (VWF). This phase II/III open-label, multicentre study evaluated the efficacy and safety of BIOSTATE?, a high purity plasma-derived double-virus inactivated FVIII/VWF concentrate, when used in non-surgical bleeds, surgical procedures and prophylactic therapy in VWD patients for whom desmopressin treatment was deemed ineffective, inadequate or contraindicated. Twenty three patients (7 type 1, 9 type 2 and 7 type 3; 12 male, 11 female), who received FVIII/VWF concentrate as part of their VWD management, were recruited prospectively between December 2004 and May 2007 from eight centres in Australia and New Zealand. BIOSTATE dosing was based on pre-treatment FVIII:C and/or VWF:RCo plasma levels and a predetermined dosing guide. Haemostatic efficacy of BIOSTATE was rated as excellent or good for all major and minor surgery events, long-term prophylaxis, and for four of the six assessable non-surgical bleeding events. Blood transfusions were required by two major surgery patients as well as one patient with a non-surgical bleed. The median overall exposure to BIOSTATE across all groups was 8?days, greater in the prophylactic group (range 53?197) compared with major surgery (3?24), minor surgery (1?8) and non-surgical bleeds (1?10). BIOSTATE was shown to be efficacious and well tolerated when treating patients with VWD. This study also provides important insights into dosing regimens with BIOSTATE and the role of monitoring therapy with FVIII:C and VWF:RCo.

AB  - Severe variants of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) affect <2% of all FOP patients worldwide, but provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the phenotype?genotype relationships that propel the pathology of this disabling disease. We evaluated two unrelated children who had severe reduction deficits of the hands and feet with absence of nails, progressive heterotopic ossification, hypoplasia of the brain stem, motor and cognitive developmental delays, facial dysmorphology, small malformed teeth, and abnormal hair development. One child had sensorineural hearing loss, microcytic anemia, and a tethered spinal cord and the other had a patent ductus arteriosus and gonadal dysgenesis with sex reversal (karyotype 46, XY female). Both children had an identical mutation in ACVR1 c.772A>G; p.Arg258Gly (R258G), not previously described in FOP. Although many, if not most, FOP mutations directly perturb the structure of the GS regulatory subdomain and presumably the adjacent αC helix, substitution with glycine at R258 may directly alter the position of the helix in the kinase domain, eliminating a key aspect of the autoinhibitory mechanism intrinsic to the wild-type ACVR1 kinase. The high fidelity phenotype?genotype relationship in these unrelated children with the most severe FOP phenotype reported to date suggests that the shared features are due to the dysregulated activity of the mutant kinase during development and postnatally, and provides vital insight into the structural biology and function of ACVR1 as well as the design of small molecule inhibitors. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury is the predominant risk factor for post-traumatic osteoarthritis development (PTOA). Several non-invasive mouse models mimicking human PTOA investigate molecular mechanisms of disease development; none have characterized the inflammatory response to this acute traumatic injury. Our aim was to characterize the early inflammatory phase and later degenerative component in our in vivo non-invasive murine model of PTOA induced by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Right knees of 12-week-old C57Bl6 mice were placed in flexion at a 30° offset position and subjected to a single compressive load (12N, 1.4?mm/s) to induce ACL rupture with no obvious damage to surrounding tissues. Tissue was harvested 4?h post-injury and on days 3, 14, and 21; contralateral left knees served as controls. Histological, immunohistochemical, and gene analyzes were performed to evaluate inflammatory and degenerative changes. Immunohistochemistry revealed time-dependent expression of mature (F4/80 positive) and inflammatory (CD11b positive) macrophage populations within the sub-synovial infiltrate, developing osteophytes, and inflammation surrounding the ACL in response to injury. Up-regulation of genes encoding acute pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17, and the matrix degrading enzymes, ADAMTS-4 and MMP3 was detected in femoral cartilage, concomitant with extensive cartilage damage and bone remodelling over 21-days post-injury. Our non-invasive model describes pathologically distinct phases of the disease, increasing our understanding of inflammatory episodes, the tissues/cells producing inflammatory mediators and the early molecular changes in the joint, thereby defining the early phenotype of PTOA. This knowledge will guide appropriate interventions to delay or arrest disease progression following joint injury. ? 2018 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

AB  - Summary Head injury is one of the major causes of trauma-related morbidity and mortality in all age groups in the United Kingdom, and anaesthetists encounter this problem in many areas of their work. Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes following traumatic brain injury and a wealth of research, there is currently no specific treatment. Outcome remains dependant on basic clinical care: management of the patient?s airway with particular attention to preventing hypoxia; avoidance of the extremes of lung ventilation; and the maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion, in an attempt to avoid exacerbating any secondary injury. Hypertonic fluids show promise in the management of patients with raised intracranial pressure. Computed tomography scanning has had a major impact on the early identification of lesions amenable to surgery, and recent guidelines have rationalised its use in those with less severe injuries. Within critical care, the importance of controlling blood glucose is becoming clearer, along with the potential beneficial effects of hyperoxia. The major improvement in outcome reflects the use of protocols to guide resuscitation, investigation and treatment and the role of specialist neurosciences centres in caring for these patients. Finally, certain groups are now recognised as being at greater risk, in particular the elderly, anticoagulated patient. You can respond to this article at http://www.anaesthesiacorrespondence.com
