AB  - Abstract Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffer from a failure of cognitive control over emotional distracters. The physiological substrates of cognitive-emotional interactions and their breakdown in disease are, however, unknown. Here, we studied brain activity in PTSD patients and healthy controls in response to emotion-provoking pictures using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrate that in healthy individuals, emotion-induced frontal theta rhythm modulates activity in the beta rhythm mainly in sensory-motor regions. In contrast, in PTSD patients, beta activity is elevated irrespective of emotion, and is not modulated by frontal theta activity in response to negative emotion. EEG source localization and fMRI findings suggest that theta activity is localized to the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices while beta activity is localized to sensory-motor regions. We further found that beta activity in sensory-motor regions is related to the emotion-induced slowing of the motor response in healthy controls while the excess frontal theta activity in PTSD is related to the intensity of negative emotional experience. These findings reveal for the first time the importance of brain electrical oscillations and coherence in emotional top-down modulation and point to specific failure of these mechanisms in PTSD.

AB  - Objective: To determine the attributable risk for suicidal ideation of depression and psychosocial and traumatic events in a random and representative population. Method: Data were gathered from a random and representative sample of 2501 South Australians. Suicidal ideation and clinical depression were determined by the general health questionnaire (GHQ-28) and the short-form health survey (SF-12) respectively, and information regarding psychosocial stressors and traumatic events was collated. These data were subjected to univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the population-attributable risks for suicidal ideation. Results: Overall, 5.6% of men and 5.3% of women had suicidal ideation. Univariate analyses demonstrated a significant attributable risk for suicidal ideation for depression and the majority of the psychosocial and traumatic events. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that clinical depression remained significantly associated with suicidal ideation, with a population-attributable risk of 46.9%. Because of the small number of people in the population who experience both suicidal ideation and specific events, multivariate analysis could not be applied to individual events. However, even when the psychosocial events were summed, they no longer remained significantly associated with suicidal ideation, whereas the summation of traumatic events remained significant, with a population-attributable risk of 38.0%. Conclusions: These results confirm the importance of traumatic events as significant factors in contributing to suicidal ideation. However, of even greater importance is that they indicate, unequivocally, the magnitude of the contribution of clinical depression to suicidal ideation, with the population-attributable risk of depression indicating that elimination of mood disorders would reduce suicidal ideation by up to 46.9%.

AB  - This article examines 3 contexts in which moderate or severe traumatic brain injury can be approached. The epidemiologic background of moderate and severe traumatic brain injury is presented, with particular attention paid to new findings from the study of a national hospital inpatient database. We review aspects of neuroimaging and how new imaging modalities can reveal fine detail about traumatic brain injury. Finally we examine the current state of neuropathologic evaluation of, and recent developments in, understanding of the neural disruptions that occur following traumatic brain injury, together with cellular reactions to these disruptions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of serum fibronectin and serum somatomedin-C as nutritional markers during enteral nutrition support (ENS) of critically ill, traumatized patients using an enteral product containing high concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Twelve critically injured patients received a standard enteral formula with 30 g of a 44% branched-chain amino acid supplement added to each liter of formula. Fibronectin concentration, somatomedin-C concentration, and nitrogen balance were measured on study days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 or until adequate oral intake began. Both fibronectin and somatomedin-C concentrations increased significantly from baseline by day 7 of ENS. Nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline by day 4. On days 14 and 21, only somatomedin-C and nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline. Nitrogen balance was significantly correlated with somatomedin-C concentration (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01), cumulative caloric intake (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01), and cumulative nitrogen intake (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that serum somatomedin-C is useful and serum fibronectin has potential in monitoring nutrition support response in critically ill, traumatized patients.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly associated with working-age adults and remains largely unrecognised in the elderly. In this review, Clara Martinez-Clavera et al consider three examples of delayed-onset PTSD and its frequent association, or misdiagnosis, as one of the numerous manifestations of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Finally, recommendations for pharmacological and psychological interventions are suggested.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To use a new approach which provides, based on the widely used three-dimensional double-echo steady-state (DESS) sequence, in addition to the morphological information, the generation of biochemical T2 maps in one hybrid sequence. Materials and Methods: In 50 consecutive MRIs at 3.0 Tesla (T) after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) of the knee, by the use this new DESS-T2d approach, the morphological Magnetic resonance Observation of CArtilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score, as well as biochemical T2d values were assessed. Furthermore, these results were correlated to standard morphological sequences as well as to standard multi-echo spin-echo T2 mapping. Results: The MOCART score correlated (Pearson:0.945; P < 0.001) significantly as assessed with standard morphological sequences (68.8 ± 13.2) and the morphological images of the DESS T2d sequence (68.7 ± 12.6). T2 and T2d relaxation times (ms) were comparable in between the control cartilage (T2: 52.5 ± 11.4; T2d: 46.6 ± 10.3) and the repair tissue (T2: 54.4 ± 11.4; T2d: 47.5 ± 13.0) (T2: P = 0.157; T2d: P = 0.589). As expected, T2d values were lower than the standard-T2 values, however, both functional relaxation times correlated significantly (Pearson:0.429; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The presented hybrid approach provides the possibility to combine morphological and biochemical MRI in one fast 3D sequence, and thus, may attract for the clinical use of biochemical MRI.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of small intestine, appendix, and colorectal. Carcinoid tumors are rare gastrointestinal tumors, the majority of which are found on the appendix. These tumors may appear as a dense mass on CT imaging, resembling a fecolith, and thus are often found incidentally on pathology when the suspected diagnosis is appendicitis. Cecal volvulus occurs in younger patients who are less-debilitated than those presenting with sigmoid volvulus. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is successful in over 50% of cases of sigmoid volvulus, but decompressive colonoscopy is almost never successful in cecal volvulus. Routine diversion of extraperitoneal rectal injury such as with a loop colostomy is recommended in an attempt to avoid pelvic sepsis. New techniques for using trans-anal endoscopic placement of vacuum assisted closure sponge devices have been described for management of prolonged colorectal anastomotic leaks, but not for acute rectal trauma.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine if object relations deficits in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (i.e., schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder) are related to co-morbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Design Cross-sectional and correlational. Method Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, and Bell Object Relations Inventory were administered to 60 people with schizophrenia in an outpatient setting. With four hierarchical regressions, we hypothesized that, controlling for schizophrenia symptoms, diagnosis type, and potential demographic features, PTSD symptoms would correlate with each of the four types of object relations deficits. Results All participants reported experiencing at least one traumatic experience. As predicted, PTSD symptoms were a significant predictor of alienation, insecure attachment, and egocentricity controlling for schizophrenia symptoms, diagnosis type, and demographic features. Against prediction, PTSD was not associated with Social Incompetence. Conclusion If PTSD symptoms contribute to object relations deficits in persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, then interventions such as psychotherapy need to be developed to address PTSD symptoms in the treatment of these interpersonal deficits. Practitioner points Clinical implications Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, rather than schizophrenia itself, may explain increased problems with schizophrenia patients' alienation, egocentricity, and insecure attachment. Interventions such as psychotherapy need to be further developed to address PTSD symptoms as well as schizophrenia symptoms in this patient population. Limitations Participants were primarily male and middle-aged, and many years had passed since the onset of their illness. Replication is needed with diverse settings and participants, including women and persons in earlier phases of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. One self-report measure was used to estimate object relations deficits, a complex construct that may be difficult to measure accurately. This research is correlational and causation cannot be presumed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine current clinical practices for managing behavioural emergencies within Victorian public hospital EDs. Methods A multi-centre retrospective study involving all patients who attended ED in 2016 at the Alfred, Ballarat, Dandenong, Geelong and Royal Melbourne Hospitals. The primary outcome was the rate of patient presentations with at least one restrictive intervention. Secondary outcomes included the rate of security calls for unarmed threats (Code Grey), legal status under the Mental Health Act at both the time of ED arrival and the restrictive intervention, and intervention details. For each site, data on 100 patients who had a restrictive intervention were randomly extracted for indication and methods of restraint. Results In 2016, 327?454 patients presented to the five EDs; the Code Grey rate was 1.49% (95% CI 1.45?1.54). Within the Code Grey population, 942 had at least one restrictive intervention (24.3%, 95% CI 23.0?25.7). Details were extracted on 494 patients. The majority (62.8%, 95% CI 58.4?67.1) were restrained under a Duty of Care. Physical restraint was used for 165 (33.4%, 95% CI 29.3?37.8) patients, 296 were mechanically restrained (59.9%, 95% CI 55.4?64.3), median mechanical restraint time 180?min (IQR 75?360), and 388 chemically restrained (78.5%, 95% CI 74.6?82.0). Conclusions Restrictive interventions in the ED largely occurred under a Duty of Care. Care of patients managed under legislation that covers assessment and treatment of mental illness has a strong clinical governance framework and focus on minimising restrictive interventions. However, this is not applied to the majority of patients who experience restraint in Victorian EDs.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic injury to the brain is one of the leading causes of injury-related death or disability, but current therapies are limited. Previously it has been shown that the antioxidant proteins metallothioneins (MTs) are potent neuroprotective factors in animal models of brain injury. The exogenous administration of MTs causes effects consistent with the roles proposed from studies in knock-out mice. We herewith report the results comparing full mouse MT-1 with the independent α and ? domains, alone or together, in a cryoinjury model. The lesion of the cortex caused the mice to perform worse in the horizontal ladder beam and the rota-rod tests; all the proteins showed a modest effect in the former test, while only full MT-1 improved the performance of animals in the rota-rod, and the α domain showed a rather detrimental effect. Gene expression analysis by RNA protection assay demonstrated that all proteins may alter the expression of host-response genes such as GFAP, Mac1 and ICAM, in some cases being the ? domain more effective than the α domain or even the full MT-1. A MT-1-to-MT-3 mutation blunted some but not all the effects caused by the normal MT-1, and in some cases increased its potency. Thus, splitting the two MT-1 domains do not seem to eliminate all MT functions but certainly modifies them, and different motifs seem to be present in the protein underlying such functions. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Subjects with lower limb amputation develop new motor control strategies to preserve balance when they experience unexpected perturbations. Most studies performed thus far have not aimed to discuss the possible differences in postural control between subjects with vascular unilateral transtibial amputation (UTA) and subjects with traumatic UTA. Objective To analyze the automatic postural reaction in response to unexpected surface perturbations in a sample of subjects with traumatic and vascular UTA and to compare these observations with those for a group of healthy subjects. Setting University department. Design Observational study. Participants A total of 9 men with traumatic UTA, 7 men with vascular UTA, and 10 control subjects without amputation. Intervention Computerized dynamic posturography Smart EquiTest System version 8.0 was used to measure automatic postural responses in both groups. Main Outcome Measures The motor control test was used to assess the participants' automatic postural responses to unexpected surface perturbations. Results Latency scores showed that subjects with traumatic UTA coped with faster latencies under their sound limb than did the subjects with vascular UTA in medium backward and forward perturbations (medium-backward: P = .004; medium-forward: P = .037). In addition, the subjects with traumatic UTA also managed faster responses to medium-backward (P = .017 versus right control limb; P = .046 versus left control limb) and large-backward (P = .021 versus right control limb) and medium-forward (P = .012 versus right control limb; P = .043 versus left control limb) perturbations in their sound limb in contrast to control subjects. Weight symmetry showed that the subjects with traumatic UTA bore significantly more weight through their sound limb compared with the control subjects during medium and large backward translations (P = .028 and P = .045, respectively). Conclusions The subjects with traumatic UTA had a greater reliance on their sound limb, and they had faster latencies and more weight in the sound limb upon experiencing unexpected perturbations compared with the control subjects. Conversely, persons with vascular UTA experienced slower latency responses in the sound limb compared with persons with traumatic UTA.

AB  - Abstract Writing from experiences in the consulting room in private practice in Australia, the author refers to the layered complexity of a conflict of ethical duty which has legal and social implications. The paper explores how the ethics that are congruent with creating a safe vas bene claustrum can be diametrically opposed to the social and legal structures and processes on which we all rely. It is suggested that within the vas, analysts and analysands engage in a shared process of emotionally connected, layered, symbolic thinking. Subpoenas directed at analysts are seeking concrete evidence that will stand up in court. The paper argues that this is a category error based on ignorance and misconceptions of what analytic work entails. The intrusion of a subpoena into the vas has the potential to cause havoc in the mental health and the lives of already vulnerable, possibly traumatized and isolated individuals. It can undermine a fundamental human right and undermine the profession of psychotherapy as a whole. The paper proposes that analysts have an ethical obligation to protect the work contained within the vas from these category errors and to educate other professionals as to why we cannot provide the kind of evidence that the courts require.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Penetrating injuries to the thoraco-abdominal region are rare in New Zealand. Most are low velocity wounds and are managed by general surgeons. However, injuries to major vascular structures and the heart are best managed by a multidisciplinary approach. Methods:? In Auckland, the cardiothoracic service was located at a different site to Auckland City Hospital (ACH) prior to December 2003. In December 2003, the cardiothoracic unit relocated to ACH. To determine what changes in practice eventuated from having an on-site cardiothoracic service, we reviewed all patients who had thoraco-abdominal injuries between 1998 and 2003 and subsequently. Results:? There were 60 patients with thoraco-abdominal penetrating injury between December 1998 and December 2003 (Group A), and 42 patients between December 2003 and September 2008 (Group B). Twelve patients in Group A and 13 patients in Group B underwent thoracotomy. Twenty-two patients in Group A and 27 patients in Group B required operations other than thoracotomy for their injuries. There was a trend of increasing involvement of cardiothoracic surgeons post-2003, in those patients undergoing thoracotomy, but not in the non-thoracotomy patients. There were six re-explorations in thoracotomy patients in the pre-2003 era: done for bleeding (3), air leak following lung resection (1) and missed cardiac injuries (2), but none in post-2003 period. There was one death in Group A but none in Group B. Conclusions:? Our study demonstrates that a properly trained general surgeon can make appropriate decisions and perform life-saving surgery in thoraco-abdominal stab wounds. However, the on-site availability of cardiothoracic surgeons leads to surgery with fewer complications.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study evaluates trepanations from five well-contextualized prehistoric sites in the south-central highlands of Andahuaylas, Peru. The emergence of trepanation in this region coincides with the collapse of the Wari Empire, ca. ad 1000. Thirty-two individuals from Andahuaylas, AMS radiocarbon dated to the early Late Intermediate Period (ca. ad 1000?1250), were found to have 45 total trepanations. Various surgical techniques were being employed concurrently throughout the region. Scraping trepanations evinced the highest survival rate; circular grooving, drilling and boring, and linear cutting were far less successful. Evidence of perioperative procedures like hair shaving, poultice application, and possible cranioplasty use aimed to ensure the survival of a trepanation recipient. Postmortem trepanations, also present in Andahuaylas, were likely executed on corpses as a means of better understanding cranial anatomy and improving techniques. Similarities in trepanation patterns throughout the region attest to common motivations to engage in surgery. Although moderate physical head trauma seems to be the impetus for intervention in many cases of trepanation, other motivations included physiological and possibly psychosomatic factors. Nevertheless, treatment was not for everyone. In Andahuaylas, trepanations were withheld from subadults, females, and those individuals who practiced cranial modification.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine in vivo high-resolution morphological and biochemical gender related differences in cartilage repair tissue (MACT). Forty patients were examined clinically and by MR scans at 3T-MRI (coronal 3D True-FISP sequence for morphologic assessment and multi-echo spin-echo T2-mapping for biochemical assessment of healthy cartilage and MACT cartilage). Mean T2 values in repair tissue in the deep zone showed significantly shorter T2 times in females (p?=?0.009, female 43.5?±?9.8 vs. male 48.2?±?7.7?ms). The superficial zone showed higher T2 values than the deep zone in both the groups (female 48.5?±?9.8, males 52.6?±?11.0?ms) without significant difference between female and male patients. Native control cartilage showed no statistically significant differences for T2 between females and males. The subdivisions ?structure of the repair tissue? and ?subchondral bone? of the MOCART score showed statistically significant differences between females and males (p?=?0.026 and p?=?0.007) as well as the Lysholm score (p?=?0.03). Our investigations revealed differences between female and male patients after MACT of the knee in clinical outcome and advanced morphological and biochemical MRI. The presented imaging biomarkers can depict subtle changes after cartilage regeneration procedures and might help to understand gender related differences after cartilage repair procedures. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - SUMMARY The incidence of HIV and AIDS is increasing in Britain. Many of those affected are subjected to, and subject others to, powerful psychological pressures. Hitherto, the psychological care of such patients has been much influenced by cognitive-behavioural approaches and only more recently have psychodynamic insights been brought into focus. This paper reports psychotherapeutic work undertaken both directly with HIV and AIDS patients, their partners and families and with clinical teams providing medical care. The paper attempts to begin to sketch out a map of the psychodynamics of HIV and AIDS to encourage a better understanding of how clinicians can be helped to understand how psychosocial attitudes can be passed on to patients in the form of unconscious attacks and how patients can cause severe acting out on the part of clinicians as they try to resolve their own unconscious conflicts over their illness.

AB  - Summary? Putty form graft materials may have additional favourable effects when compared with particulate ones in periodontal bone defects. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical and also radiographic changes following application of (i) putty form demineralized bone matrix (DBM), (ii) particulate form DBM and (iii) open flap debridement (control), using modified curtain suturing technique in the treatment of interproximal suprabony (horizontal) defects. Twenty-five chronic periodontitis patients with 125 sites (radiologically ≥4?mm horizontal bone defect) were selected to participate in this triple-blind, split mouth, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Putty and particulate form DBM grafts were placed at experimental sites. Clinical measurements included probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL), gingival recession and bone probing depth (BPD) were made at baseline and repeated 12?months after the operations. Standardized digital radiographs were also taken to measure radiographic bone level (RBL) at baseline and 12?months later to be compared in a software. Probing depth reductions and RAL gains were significantly improved in all treatment groups (P?<?0·001). No significant differences in soft tissue parameters were found among three groups (P?>?0·05). Bone probing depth measurements indicated comparable significant bone gain in graft applied groups (P?<?0·01) and a significant bone resorption in open flap debridement group (P?<?0·01). Radiographic evaluation did not show any significant bone gain or resorption in all treatment groups (P?>?0·05). The results of this study indicate that either putty or particulate DBM demonstrates similar enhancements in soft and hard tissue parameters. Applying putty or particulate form DBM results with slight bone formation when compared with open flap debridement in horizontal bone defects at 1-year post-operative examination according to BPD measurements.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate the utility of a multi-echo sequence at 7 Tesla (T) for simultaneous time-of-flight (TOF) MR-angiography (MRA) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) of radiation-induced cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), intracranial arteries, and veins. Methods A four-echo gradient-echo sequence was implemented on a 7T scanner. The first echo was used to create TOF-MRA images, while the remaining echoes were combined to visualize CMBs and veins on SWI images. The sequence was evaluated on eight brain tumor patients with known radiation-induced CMBs. Single-echo images were also acquired to visually and quantitatively compare the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of small- and intermediate-vessels between acquisitions. The number of CMBs detected with each acquisition was also quantified. Statistical significance was determined using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results Compared with the single-echo sequences, the CNR of small and intermediate arteries increased 7.6% (P?<?0.03) and 9.5% (P?=?0.06), respectively, while the CNR of small and intermediate veins were not statistically different between sequences (P?=?0.95 and P?=?0.46, respectively). However, these differences were not discernible by visual inspection. Also the multi-echo sequence detected 18.3% more CMBs (P?<?0.008) due to higher slice resolution. Conclusion The proposed 7T multi-echo sequence depicts arteries, veins, and CMBs on a single image to facilitate quantitative evaluation of radiation-induced vascular injury. J. Magn. Reson.
