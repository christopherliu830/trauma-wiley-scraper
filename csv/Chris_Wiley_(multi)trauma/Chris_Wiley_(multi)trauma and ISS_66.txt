AB  - Abstract There is growing evidence of the brain's ability to increase its reliance on alternative metabolic substrates under conditions of energy stress such as starvation, hypoxia and ischemia. We hypothesized that following traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in immediate changes in energy metabolism, the adult brain increases uptake and oxidation of the alternative substrate ?-hydroxybutyrate (?HB). Arterio-venous differences were used to determine global cerebral uptake of ?HB and production of 14CO2 from [14C]3-?HB 3?h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Quantitative bioluminescence was used to assess regional changes in ATP concentration. As expected, adult sham and CCI animals with only endogenously available ?HB showed no significant increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production. Increasing arterial ?HB concentrations 2.9-fold with 3?h of ?HB infusion failed to increase cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production in adult sham animals. Only CCI animals that received a 3-h ?HB infusion showed an 8.5-fold increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB and greater than 10.7-fold increase in 14CO2 production relative to sham ?HB-infused animals. The TBI-induced 20% decrease in ipsilateral cortical ATP concentration was alleviated by 3?h of ?HB infusion beginning immediately after CCI injury.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the documentation of security interventions in ED presentations between clinical notes and security records. Methods Presentations (n?=?680) were randomly selected from all ED presentations to a public tertiary referral hospital in Queensland, Australia between April 2016 and August 2017 that were perceived by the treating clinician as alcohol-related. Retrospective data, manually extracted from clinical notes and the security service database, were compared for the documentation of any security interventions. Security interventions were defined as observation without physical contact, verbal de-escalation or physical restraint by security officers. Results Forty-one presentations had security interventions documented in the security services database and, of those, 20 (48.8%) had documentation in the clinical notes. Patients who required security interventions were admitted to hospital in higher proportions compared with those who did not (73.2% vs 26.8%, respectively, P?<?0.0001). Conclusion The rate of documentation of security interventions in clinical notes was less than 50%. Documentation of critical information, including alerts and risks, in the clinical notes is an essential component of communication that the multi-disciplinary team use to ensure patient safety. Strategies aimed at improving the documentation of security interventions in clinical notes will help to optimise risk management and the safety of patients, staff and visitors along the continuum of care.

AB  - Abstract Aim To explore assessment on a hospital ward for older people from the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals. Design A qualitative study drawing on grounded theory was undertaken between February 2015 - January 2016. Methods Interviews with 15 patients and 22 healthcare professionals, a focus group with six healthcare professionals, 45 hr of observation and review of 18 sets of patient notes. Analysis was conducted using initial and focused coding, continuously comparing data, emerging codes and themes. Findings The core category was navigating, constructed through three themes: containing complexity, networking, and situating the process. Navigating assessment was a complex, flexible, context dependent, and social process where healthcare professionals used a combination of formal, informal, visible, and invisible ways of working. Registered nurses were at the centre of networking and focused on gathering and sharing information in the multi-disciplinary team, whilst patients had a passive role despite a variety of preferences about their involvement. Conclusions Navigating the assessment of older people is contextually situated, includes networking and a professional focus on containing complexity. This process may be enhanced by: (a) making informal assessment visible to others; (b) developing the nurses? role beyond chasing information towards coordinating care; and (c) asking patients and acting on how they would like to be involved in decision-making. Impact Acknowledging that navigating assessment is a social, flexible and complex process, including different ways of working to meet patient needs, may enhance the usability of current assessment guidelines and their development.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of splenectomy on cellular immunity. We studied the cellular phenotype and type 1 [interferon-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and type 2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine-producing peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 22 healthy adults who had undergone post-traumatic splenectomy about 1 to 35 years ago. Splenectomy resulted in a long-term reduction of the percentage of CD4+CD45RA+ cells and a late increase of the percentage and absolute numbers of T-cell receptor ?/δ cells. Stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in normal IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells, indicating that the naïve cells were not anergic. Splenectomy also resulted in long-term priming of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. During the first 8 years, both type 1 and type 2 CD4+ T cells were primed to varying degrees. About 8 years later, the percentage of primed type 2 CD4+ T cells subsided, but that of type 1 CD4+ T cells, although decreased, remained detectable over a longer period. Priming of CD8+ T cells persisted throughout the study period. The long-term priming of type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which may result in partial impairment of T-cell functions, may explain reported defects of immune responses to recall antigens in splenectomized individuals. In addition, changes in the profile of primed CD4+ T cells with time may be clinically relevant to relapses in autoimmune thrombocytopenia after splenectomy.

AB  - Background and purpose Treatments to facilitate recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are urgently needed. We conducted a 9-month pilot, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the safety and potential effects of the herbal supplement MLC901 (NeuroAiD II?) on cognitive functioning following TBI. Methods Adults aged 18?65 years at 1?12 months after mild or moderate TBI were randomized to receive MLC901 (0.8 g capsules 3 times daily) or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was cognitive functioning as assessed by the CNS Vital Signs online neuropsychological test. Secondary outcomes included the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the Rivermead Post-concussion Symptom Questionnaire (neurobehavioral sequelae), Quality of Life after Brain Injury, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (physical disability). Assessments were completed at baseline and at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted, with the primary outcome time-point of 6 months. Results A total of 78 participants [mean age 37.5 ± 14.8 years, 39 (50%) female] were included in the analysis. Baseline variables were similar between groups (treatment group, n = 36; control group, n = 42). Linear mixed-effects models controlling for time, group allocation, repeated measurements, adherence and baseline assessment scores revealed significant improvements in complex attention (P = 0.04, d = 0.6) and executive functioning (P = 0.04, d = 0.4) at 6 months in the MLC901 group compared with controls. There were no significant differences between the groups for neurobehavioral sequelae, mood, fatigue, physical disability or overall quality of life at 6 months. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions MLC901 was safe and well tolerated post-TBI. This study provided Class I/II evidence that, for patients with mild to moderate TBI, 6 months of MLC901 improved cognitive functioning.

AB  - Abstract Background: Non-operative management (NOM) of blunt splenic injuries is nowadays considered the standard treatment. The present study identified selection criteria for primary operative management (OM) and planned NOM. Methods: All adult patients with blunt splenic injuries treated at Berne University Hospital, Switzerland, between 2000 and 2008 were reviewed. Results: There were 206 patients (146 men) with a mean(s.d.) age of 38·2(19·1) years and an Injury Severity Score of 30·9(11·6). The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma classification of the splenic injury was grade 1 in 43 patients (20·9 per cent), grade 2 in 52 (25·2 per cent), grade 3 in 60 (29·1 per cent), grade 4 in 42 (20·4 per cent) and grade 5 in nine (4·4 per cent). Forty-seven patients (22·8 per cent) required immediate surgery. Transfusion of at least 5 units of red cells (odds ratio (OR) 13·72, 95 per cent confidence interval 5·08 to 37·01), Glasgow Coma Scale score below 11 (OR 9·88, 1·77 to 55·16) and age 55 years or more (OR 3·29, 1·07 to 10·08) were associated with primary OM. The rate of primary OM decreased from 33·3 to 11·9 per cent after the introduction of transcatheter arterial embolization in 2005. Overall, 159 patients (77·2 per cent) qualified for NOM, which was successful in 143 (89·9 per cent). The splenic salvage rate was 69·4 per cent. In multivariable analysis age at least 40 years was the only factor independently related to failure of NOM (OR 13·58, 2·76 to 66·71). Conclusion: NOM of blunt splenic injuries has a low failure rate. Advanced age is independently associated with an increased failure rate. Copyright ? 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis To describe the acoustic characteristics of voice in individuals with motor speech disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Study Design Prospective study of 100 individuals with TBI based on consecutive referrals for motor speech evaluations. Methods Subjects were audio tape-recorded while producing sustained vowels and single word and sentence intelligibility tests. Laryngeal airway resistance was estimated, and voice quality was rated perceptually. Results None of the subjects evidenced vocal parameters within normal limits. The most frequently occurring abnormal parameter across subjects was amplitude perturbation, followed by voice turbulence index. Twenty-three percent of subjects evidenced deviation in all five parameters measured. The perceptual ratings of breathiness were significantly correlated with both the amplitude perturbation quotient and the noise-to-harmonics ratio. Conclusions Vocal quality deviation is common in motor speech disorders after TBI and may impact intelligibility.

To summarize and synthesize research that explored the experience of surviving life-threatening injury in adolescents, young persons and adults. Methods:? Informed by systematic literature review strategies, a description of the experience of individuals who survived life-threatening injury was sought by reviewing 13 studies with qualitative data on the phenomena. Data were managed using NVivo software and synthesized using thematic analysis to elicit meaning. Results:? The review synthesized a substantial number (n?=?273) of participant experiences of traumatic surviving life-threatening injury and revealed that during the initial 3 years following life-threatening injury, the individual goes through a shifting, iterative process in order to reconstruct various aspects of their injury and themselves, including mental, emotional, spiritual, physical and relational facets. Three major themes were illuminated: a time of chaos, negotiating injury and reconciling injury. In order to navigate through the experience of injury, family members were key sources of affirmation and support in anchoring the person to their life, in reconstructing themselves in the aftermath of injury and in coming to terms with the impacts of injury. Conclusion:? This qualitative synthesis describes the iterative process individuals go through following life-threatening injury and the overwhelming need to reconstruct aspects of self as a way to create meaning. It demonstrates the need to gain further understanding of the influence of the family in recovery from injury and indicates that education is required to provide practical strategies to assist clinicians to develop appropriate and relevant patient goals and expectations.

AB  - Summary Aims This study aimed at understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with inattention induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI). To eliminate the potential confounding caused by the heterogeneity of TBI, we focused on young adults postsports-related concussion (SRC). Methods Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data were collected from 27 young adults post-SRC and 27 group-matched normal controls (NCs), while performing a visual sustained attention task. Task responsive cortical activation maps and pairwise functional connectivity among six regions of interest were constructed for each subject. Correlations among the brain imaging measures and clinical measures of attention were calculated in each group. Results Compared to the NCs, the SRC group showed significantly increased brain activation in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and increased functional connectivity between right inferior occipital cortex (IOC) bilateral calcarine gyri (CG). The left MFG activation magnitude was significantly negatively correlated with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in the NCs, but not in the patients. The right hemisphere CG-IOC functional connectivity showed a significant positive correlation with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in patients, but not in NCs. Conclusion The current data suggest that abnormal left MFG activation and hyper-communications between right IOC and bilateral CG during visual attention processing may significantly contribute to behavioral manifestations of attention deficits in patients with TBI.

AB  - Abstract Results from efforts to develop and validate PTSD measures are promising, but a ?gold standard? has not been achieved. Keane, Malloy, and Fairbank (1984) have developed an MMPI PTSD subscale that has been crossvalidated with clinicians' classification of PTSD at acceptable levels of agreement, specificity, and sensitivity. There is, however, room for improvement. Empirical evidence is presented that indicates that the next round of efforts to increase reliability and validity of PTSD measures must account for the presence/abence of co-morbidity (i.e., the simultaneous occurrence of other psychiatric disorders). For example, differences are noted in MMPI group profiles and PTSD scales between psychiatric patients and substance abusers. Second, different MMPI items emerge as indicative of PTSD; these vary as a function of the presence of other Axis I disorders among groups of Vietnam combat veterans who seek treatment for substance abuse. Results substantiate that different MMPI items for classifying PTSD occur with groups that differ in co-morbidity. Improvements in PTSD scale development are more likely when the contributions of pre-existing or subsequently co-occurring psychiatric disorders are taken in account, as well as variations in level of personality maturity. The evidence suggests that a ?family? of PTSD scales need to be developed that take into account co-morbidity differences.

AB  - Abstract. The authors have recently demonstrated that increased gene expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase) in hemorrhagic hypotension (HH) and following lactated Ringer's resuscitation (LR) is associated with a decrease in insulin and an increase in corticosterone concentrations. Objective: To evaluate the in-vivo role of hormones the authors used insulin (IN), phentolamine and propranolol (PP) as an adrenergic blocker, and cyclic somatostatin (CS) as a glucagon blocker to prevent the induction of Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney following HH and LR. Methods: Hemorrhage was induced in fasted anesthetized rats, and the reduction of blood pressure to 40 mm Hg for a duration of 30 minutes was accomplished by withdrawal or infusion of shed blood. The resuscitated group underwent hemorrhage followed by fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. Results: Neither PP nor CS treatment could block the induction of Glu-6-Pase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) following either HH or LR. However, the administration of IN significantly prevented the increase of Glu-6-Pase mRNA level and activity in both liver and kidney following HH and LR. This was associated with a normalization of plasma glucose, corticosterone, and glucagon levels and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in liver and kidney toward prehemorrhage levels. Conclusions: These results indicate that in-vivo treatment with insulin during hemorrhagic hypotension and resuscitation is capable of preventing the increase in Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney responsible for the observed hyperglycemia.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a possible link between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obesity risk, which would have implications for the development of obesity-related diseases in this population. The present study examined the association between PTSD and obesity and whether this association differed by sex in a representative sample of the US population. A secondary objective was to determine whether the association between PTSD and obesity was mediated by binge eating disorder (BED). Data were from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), which comprises three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys that were conducted between 2001 and 2003. Logistic regression analyses weighted to represent the general US adult population were performed. In the total sample of 20,013 participants, rates of obesity were 24.1% for persons without a lifetime history of PTSD and 32.6% among persons with PTSD in the past year. Adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, depression, substance and alcohol abuse/dependence, and psychotropic medication status, past year PTSD was associated with greater likelihood of obesity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18, 1.95), with no differences by gender. BED did not statistically mediate the relationship between PTSD and obesity. The present study provides support for a link between PTSD and obesity. Findings further existing literature by indicating that the association is consistent across sexes and is not statistically mediated by BED.

AB  - Abstract??? One of the commonly encountered dental emergencies is dentoalveolar traumatic injuries (DTIs). Unfortunately, DTIs result in fractured, displaced, or lost anterior teeth and this could have significant negative functional, esthetic, speech, and psychological effects on children thus affecting their quality of life. Although it is impossible to guarantee permanent retention of a traumatized tooth, patient age, severity of injury, and timely treatment and follow up of the tooth using recommended procedures can maximize the chances for success. This review examines the recent trends in the management of DTI to primary and young permanent teeth. Electronic search of scientific papers written in English from 1990s to 2009 was accomplished using Pub Med search engine. Dental practitioners should follow current literature and consider carefully evidenced-based recommendations that may enhance periodontal healing and revascularization of avulsed permanent teeth.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate a systemic induction of bone formation in rats by immunosuppression with FK506 (1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally [ip]) in a model of osteoinduction of isogeneic and xenogeneic demineralized bone matrix (DBM) for a period of 28 days. In particular, alterations of in vitro cytokine synthesis and changes of lymphocyte subsets were studied. DBM was implanted intramuscularly in the abdominal wall of Lewis rats (seven per group). Blood was sampled on days ?7, 0, 7, and 28 for determination of in vitro tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) synthesis and lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, ED9+, and Ia+ antibodies). Ossicles of de novo formed bone and the tibias were removed on day 28 after double tetracycline labeling for histomorphometric analysis. Immunosuppression with FK506 significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated in vitro cytokine synthesis after 7 days and 28 days (p < 0.05). Compared with control animals FK506 treatment significantly increased the volume of induced bone in isogeneic (2.1 ± 0.3 mm3 vs. 10.8 ± 0.9 mm3) and xenogeneic (0 mm3 vs. 4.7 ± 0.8 mm3) DBM. Bone histomorphometry of the tibias revealed that immunosuppression increased both bone formation and bone resorption, accompanied by a significant reduction in the relative trabecular area (Tb.Ar). FK506 caused a decrease in the counts of CD8+ T cells probably because of destruction or dislocation of these cells. This suggests that the amount of CD8+ cells and the degree of T cell activation in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) may be associated with bone metabolism. In support of this, statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between parameters of bone formation as well as bone resorption and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. There was a significant negative correlation between parameters of remodeling of the metaphysis of the tibia and induced bone volume (BV), respectively, and MFI values of CD3+/Ia+ cells. These findings suggest an important role of T lymphocytes in bone formation and bone resorption in vivo. FK506 caused a marked increase of bone formation in DBM. However, the conclusion that immunosuppression increases fracture healing warrants further investigation.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? To study the efficacy and complications of uterine tamponade using condom catheter balloon in non-traumatic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Material and Methods:? This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. Eighteen patients with non-traumatic PPH not responding to medical management were included in the study. Uterine tamponade was achieved by a condom catheter balloon filled with saline and kept in situ for 8?48?h. The main outcome measures were success rate in controlling hemorrhage, time required to stop bleeding, subsequent morbidity and technical difficulties. Data was analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Results:? The success rate of condom catheter balloon in controlling hemorrhage was 94%. The mean amount of fluid filled in the condom catheter balloon was 409?mL. The average time taken to control bleeding was 6.2?min. The mean duration for which condom catheter balloon was left in situ was 27.5?h. The average amount of blood loss was 1330?mL. Five patients (28%) had infective morbidity. Conclusion:? Condom catheter balloon is effective in controlling non-traumatic PPH in 94% cases. It is effective, simple to use, easily available and is a cheap modality to manage non-traumatic postpartum hemorrhage, especially in limited resource settings.

AB  - Background:? We examined the prevalence and nature of comorbid post-traumatic stress reactions and depressive symptoms, and the impact of exposure to traumatic events on both types of psychopathology, among Palestinian children during war conflict in the region. Methods:? The 403 children aged 9?15 years, who lived in four refugee camps, were assessed by completing the Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI), and the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Results:? Children reported experiencing a wide range of traumatic events, both direct experience of violence and through the media. CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were significantly correlated. Both CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were independently predicted by the number of experienced traumatic events, and this association remained after adjusting for socioeconomic variables. Exposure to traumatic events strongly predicted MFQ scores while controlling for CPTSD-RI scores. In contrast, the association between traumatic events and CPTSD-RI scores, while controlling for MFQ scores, was weak. The CPTSD-RI items whose frequency was significantly associated with total MFQ scores were: sleep disturbance, somatic complaints, constricted affect, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration. However, not all remaining CPTSD-RI items were significantly associated with exposure to traumatic events, thus raising the possibility that the association between depression and PTSD was due in part to symptom overlap. Conclusions:? Children living in war zones are at high risk of suffering from PTSD and depressive disorders. Exposure to trauma was not found to have a unique association with PTSD. The relationship between PTSD and depressive symptomatology requires further investigation.

AB  - Abstract Traumatized muscle, such as that debrided from blast injury sites, is considered a promising and convenient tissue source for multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs), a population of adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells. The present study aimed to assess the regenerative therapeutic potential of human traumatized muscle-derived MPCs, e.g., for injury repair in the blast-traumatized extremity, by comparing their pro-angiogenic potential in vitro and capillary recruitment activity in vivo to those of MSCs isolated from human bone marrow, a widely-used tissue source. MPCs were tested for their direct and indirect effects on human microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. The findings reported here showed that MPC-conditioned culture medium (MPC-CM), like MSC-CM, promoted EC-cord network branching. Silent (si)RNA-mediated silencing of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in MPCs attenuated this effect. In a chick embryonic chorioallantoic membrane in vivo angiogenesis assay, MPCs encapsulated in photocrosslinked gelatin scaffold recruited blood vessels more efficiently than either MSCs or human foreskin fibroblasts. Together, these findings support the potential application of traumatized muscle-derived MPCs in cell-based regenerative medicine therapies as a result of their influence on EC organization.
