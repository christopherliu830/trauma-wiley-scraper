AB  - To review the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults after moderate to severe TBI. A systematic literature search was conducted on literature published up to December 2018 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and PsychInfo. A systematic review of the identified literature was based on PRISMA guidelines. Risk of Bias was evaluated based on the aspects of Risk of Bias assessment described by the Agency of Health Research and Quality. Seven studies were deemed eligible and information on the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults (age 13?35) after moderate to severe TBI was extracted. Depression was assessed at 12 months (n = 2), >12 months (n = 2) or at varying times (n = 3) after TBI. The identified studies reported a prevalence proportion of depression from 1.6% to 60%. The Risk of Bias assessment showed a range of study quality with the selection of subjects and analysis of attrition being problematic. Although literature is sparse and of varying quality, depression was found to be common among adolescents and young adults with moderate to severe TBI which implies a need to focus on depression in the rehabilitation process and calls for further research.

AB  - We present a clinical case of treatment and neurorehabilitation of a patient with severe neurological deficit due to extensive traumatic lesion of the left hemisphere of the brain. Until recently, such cases were considered incurable and remained marginalized throughout their lives. This clinical case illustrates the compensatory brain possibilities under long-term integrated multidisciplinary treatment and neurorehabilitation with mandatory application of medical, medico-psychological, medico-pedagogical, and medico-social methods, the importance and intensity of which vary at different stages of the disease. This process is addressed in the individual patient. The greatest efficiency of the neurorehabilitation treatment of patients with severe consequences of a stroke and traumatic brain injury can be reached under the following conditions: the earliest possible start of rehabilitation with a sufficient duration and intensity; interdisciplinary and integrative rehabilitation process at various stages of rehabilitation treatment; systematic clinical and neuropsychological diagnostics; systematic monitoring of somatic, neurological, psychiatric, and psychological condition of the patient; assistance with sociopsychological and labor issues; and problem-solving support.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background The tendency to respond with fear and avoidance can be seen as a shared vulnerability contributing to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Although several studies have examined which specific symptoms of PTSD (re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal) are associated with chronic pain, none has considered this association within the framework of fear-avoidance models. Methods Seven hundred fourteen patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain were assessed. Of these, 149 patients were selected for the study based upon the following inclusion criteria: exposure to a traumatic event before the onset of pain (with scores equal to or higher than 8 points on the fear and hopelessness scales of the Stressful Life Event Screening Questionnaire Revised) and scores equal to or higher than 30 on the Davidson Trauma Scale. Results Structural equation modelling was used to test the association between PTSD symptoms and pain outcomes (pain intensity and disability) using the mediating variables considered in the fear-avoidance models. The results show that emotional numbing and hyperarousal symptoms, but neither re-experiencing nor avoidance, affected pain outcome via anxiety sensitivity (AS), catastrophizing and fear of pain. PTSD symptoms increased the levels of AS, which predisposes to catastrophizing and, in turn, had an effect on the tendency of pain patients to respond with more fear and avoidance. Conclusions This study provides empirical support for the potential role of PTSD symptoms in fear-avoidance models of chronic pain and suggests that AS is a relevant variable in the relationship between both disorders.

AB  - The cognitive and behavioral deficits caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the immature brain are more severe and persistent than injuries to the adult brain. Understanding this developmental sensitivity is critical because children under 4 years of age of sustain TBI more frequently than any other age group. One of the first events after TBI is the infiltration and degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in the brain, releasing a range of immunomodulatory substances; inhibition of these cells is neuroprotective in other types of neonatal brain injury. This study investigates for the first time the role of MCs in mediating injury in a P7 mouse model of pediatric contusion-induced TBI. We show that various neural cell types express histamine receptors and that histamine exacerbates excitotoxic cell death in primary cultured neurons. Cromoglycate, an inhibitor of MC degranulation, altered the inflammatory phenotype of microglia activated by TBI, reversing several changes but accentuating others, when administered before TBI. However, without regard to the time of cromoglycate administration, inhibiting MC degranulation did not affect cell loss, as evaluated by ventricular dilatation or cleaved caspase-3 labeling, or the density of activated microglia, neurons, or myelin. In double-heterozygous cKit mutant mice lacking MCs, this overall lack of effect was confirmed. These results suggest that the role of MCs in this model of pediatric TBI is restricted to subtle effects and that they are unlikely to be viable neurotherapeutic targets. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract One hundred and six consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer were studied before and after surgery with a clinical psychiatric interview and questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale, General Health Questionnaire and Clinical Global Impression scale). The traumatic stress response after six weeks was related to sociodemographic factors, premorbid health problems, negative life events and clinical-oncological parameters. Symptoms of traumatic distress were significantly reduced post-surgery compared to acutely, and most so among patients with no premorbid health problems and negative life events according to pre-surgery interview and self-report data. Eighteen percent of the patients reported a high level (>19) of intrusive symptoms and 14%, avoidance symptoms. Patients with premorbid impairment in work, family and social functioning and patients who during the last year had experienced the death of a close relative or a serious illness other than cancer showed the greatest distress. Previous consultations for nervous problems, age, marital status, stage of disease, type of surgery (breast-conserving versus mastectomy) and adjuvant cytostatic treatment did not influence the traumaticstress response six weeks after surgery. The level of acute posttraumatic stress response to breast cancer surgery seems best predicted by premorbid variables.

AB  - Objectives. To compare levels of depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst immigration detainees with a comparison group of asylum seekers living within the community. Design. A cross-sectional questionnaire study. Method. Sixty-seven detained asylum seekers, 30 detainees who had previously been imprisoned within the UK for criminal offences, and 49 asylum seekers living in the community completed the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and the impact of event scale-revised (IES-R). Demographic information was collected. Results. High levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were reported by all three groups. Detained asylum seekers had higher scores than asylum seekers living within the community for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. There was an interaction between length of detention period and prior exposure to interpersonal trauma (IP trauma) on depression scores. Conclusions. Immigration detainees are highly vulnerable to psychological distress. A review of detention policies is recommended in light of this. Immigration detention may have an independent adverse effect on mental health. It is also possible that individuals with mental health problems may be more likely to be detained. Further research is required to investigate this.

AB  - 1. The compensation of fluid loss from the circulation after an LD50 period of bilateral hind-limb ischaemia in a thermoneutral environment has been studied in the rabbit from birth until young adulthood. 2. The fluid loss from the circulation was calculated from the increase in the great vessel haematocrit value as the red cell volume and Fcells were unchanged after limb ischaemia. This ?apparent? fluid loss was compared with the ?actual? fluid loss calculated from the increase in water content of the injured limbs. 3. The 0- to 1-day-old rabbit was better able to restore fluid, and protein, to the circulation than the older animal and suffered a smaller percentage reduction in arterial blood pressure after an LD50 period of ischaemia. 4. The better compensation of post-traumatic fluid loss during the first 48 hr of life may be explained by the high capillary filtration coefficient and the post-traumatic increase in plasma protein osmotic pressure found at that age. 5. The more efficient restoration of the plasma volume by the 0- to 1-day-old rabbit may account for the increased ability to withstand post-traumatic fluid loss at that age.

AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with tibial pilon fractures have a higher incidence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis than those with fractures of the tibial plateau. This may indicate that pilon fractures present a greater mechanical insult to the joint than do plateau fractures. We tested the hypothesis that fracture energy and articular fracture edge length, two independent indicators of severity, are higher in pilon than plateau fractures. We also evaluated whether clinical fracture classification systems accurately reflect severity. Seventy-five tibial plateau fractures and 52 tibial pilon fractures from a multi-institutional study were selected to span the spectrum of severity. Fracture severity measures were calculated using objective CT-based image analysis methods. The ranges of fracture energies measured for tibial plateau and pilon fractures were 3.2?33.2?Joules (J) and 3.6?32.2?J, respectively, and articular fracture edge lengths were 68.0?493.0?mm and 56.1?288.6?mm, respectively. There were no differences in the fracture energies between the two fracture types, but plateau fractures had greater articular fracture edge lengths (p?<?0.001). The clinical fracture classifications generally reflected severity, but there was substantial overlap of fracture severity measures between different classes. Similar fracture energies with different degrees of articular surface involvement suggest a possible explanation for dissimilar rates of post-traumatic osteoarthritis for fractures of the tibial plateau compared to the tibial pilon. The substantial overlap of severity measures between different fracture classes may well have confounded prior clinical studies relying on fracture classification as a surrogate for severity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Since the advent of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes in 1980, they have become the device of choice for providing long-term enteral nutrition. Despite their overall safety, a number of complications can occur after PEG placement. Bleeding is usually a minor complication associated with PEG placement that occurs soon after the procedure and is most often caused by puncture of an abdominal wall vessel. More severe bleeding can occur when a branch of one of the gastric arteries is punctured. There are only a few case reports of traumatic gastric ulceration secondary to the internal bolster of a PEG. The internal bolsters are either balloons or dome shaped, and are 1.5?2.0 cm in height. We report a case in which a patient developed hemorrhage from a gastric ulcer induced by a balloon-type PEG tube that was resolved only after replacement with a tube manufactured with a low-profile internal bolster that was only 0.3 mm in height. The protruding tip of a balloon-type gastrostomy tube was believed to have caused traumatic injury to the gastric mucosa in our patient, causing ulceration. Usually, removal of the tube and placement in a different location may solve the problem. However, we believe that the PEG tube fashioned with a low-profile internal bumper is a safer option.

AB  - Accessible summary What is known on the subject: The physical and psychological trauma that can occur as a result of physical restraint is increasingly highlighted in the media and literature across the globe. Despite this, the use of physical restraint continues without a strong evdience base for its value or efficacy. What this paper adds to existing knowledge: A number of common defences for the use of physical restraint are outlined and considered in light of existing research in this area. The potential for adopting restrictive intervention minimization programmes of work is highlighted as a way forward. What are the implications for practice: The implementation of approaches to prevent and reduce physical restraint is required. A combination of factors including the use of advance planning tools, recognition of potential injury and death, and the importance of trauma informed care is necessary. Patients can be severely traumatized by the use of restraint, and there is an increasing drive to examine, reflect upon, and to reduce the use and impact of these. Abstract Aggression is reported to be prevalent in psychiatric inpatient care and its frequency towards healthcare professionals is well documented. While aggression may not be entirely avoidable, its incidence can be reduced through prevention and the minimization of restrictive practices such as physical restraint. This paper aims to explore three common ?defences? to account for the use of physical restraint; to challenge each defence with regard to the evidence base; and to identify how services are responding to the challenge of reducing the use of restrictive interventions. Following a number of investigations to highlight serious problems with the use of physical restraint, it seems timely to examine its efficacy in light of the evidence base. A combination of interventions to minimize the use of restraint including advance planning tools, and recognition of potential trauma is necessary at an organizational and individual level. Patients can be traumatized by the use of restrictive practices and there is a growing momentum to promote models that incorporate trauma informed care (TIC) and person centredness.

AB  - Abstract The authors examined the effectiveness of narrative exposure therapy for children (KIDNET) in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugee children living in exile. Twenty-six children traumatized by organized violence were randomly assigned to KIDNET or to a waiting list. Significant treatment by time interactions on all PTSD-relevant variables indicated that the KIDNET group, but not the controls, showed a clinically significant improvement in symptoms and functioning. Success of the KIDNET group remained stable at 12-month follow-up. This study confirms previous findings that, if left untreated, PTSD in children may persist for an extended period. However, it also shows that it is possible to effectively treat chronic PTSD and restore functioning in traumatized refugee children in only 8 treatment sessions.

In all cases, traumatic neuromas were incidentally detected at neck sonography for evaluation of suspected recurrence of well-differentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. All sonograms and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results. This study covered 8 cases in which traumatic neuromas were diagnosed by clinical, laboratory, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and other imaging modalities. None of the patients had clinical signs of neuromas, which were, incidentally, discovered by neck sonography. A noticeable sonographic feature in all cases was an isoechoic mass with internal parallel heterogeneous hyperechogenicity. All patients complained of severe pain during FNAB. The cytological results of 2 patients showed fragments of nerve tissue. The remaining 6 FNABs were nondiagnostic. Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels in washout fluids from FNAB of all patients were <0.2 ng/mL, indicating nonthyroidal origin. Conclusion. Distinctive sonographic features, sharp pain during FNAB, and low Tg levels in FNAB washout fluid can help to diagnose traumatic neuromas without surgery. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper examines risk factors for the development of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and its severity and chronicity, in a group of 217 young adults who survived a shipping disaster in adolescence. The survivors were followed up 5 to 8 years after the disaster. Risk factors examined fell into three main categories: pre-disaster child and family vulnerability factors, including childhood psychopathology; objective and subjective disaster-related experiences; and post-disaster factors, including results from screening questionnaires administered 5 months post-disaster, coping mechanisms adopted subsequently, life events, and availability of social supports. Developing PTSD following the disaster was significantly associated with being female, with pre-disaster factors of learning and psychological difficulties in the child and violence in the home, with severity of exposure to the disaster, survivors' subjective appraisal of the experience, adjustment in the early post-disaster period, and life events and social supports subsequently. When all these factors were considered together, measures of the degree of exposure to the disaster and of subjective appraisal of life threat, and ratings of anxiety obtained 5 months post-disaster, best predicted whether survivors developed PTSD. For those survivors who developed PTSD, its duration and severity were best predicted not by objective and subjective disaster-related factors, but by pre-disaster vulnerability factors of social, physical, and psychological difficulties in childhood together with ratings of depression obtained 5 months post-disaster, and whether survivors received post-disaster support at school. The implications of these findings are considered for targeting assessment and intervention efforts at survivors most at risk of developing difficulties in adjustment following similar traumatic experiences.

AB  - Abstract Anecdotally critical incident debriefing (CID) is an important topic for staff in paediatric ED. The present study aimed to determine current baseline CID practices and perceived needs of ED staff. A questionnaire regarding CID practice was circulated to all 13 Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) sites in Australia and New Zealand (including all tertiary paediatric ED), and completed by 1 senior doctor and 1 senior nurse. All PREDICT sites participated (13 nurses, 13 doctors). Seventy per cent did not currently have a hospital protocol on debriefing and 90% did not have ED-specific guidelines. The most commonly debriefed topics were death of a patient, multi-trauma and sudden infant death syndrome, also ranked highest in importance for debriefing. The median reported debriefs per department were 4 per year (range 0?12), all conducted within a week of the CI with half within 24?h. ED workers most likely to be invited to the CID session were doctors, nurses and social workers (96%). Debriefing was mostly conducted internally (62%) and most likely facilitated by a doctor (81%) or nurse (54%). Debriefing addressed both clinical and emotional issues (89%) within the same session (69%). Debriefing was rated as very important, median of 8/10 by doctors and 10/10 by nurses. Almost 90% of those surveyed indicated that they would like a CID programme and guidelines for their department. Debriefing is perceived as important by senior ED clinicians, yet few ED have formalized guidelines or programmes. Best-practice guidelines should be developed.

AB  - Background Smaller hippocampal volume in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents the most consistently reported structural alteration in the brain. Subfields of the hippocampus play distinct roles in encoding and processing of memories, which are disrupted in PTSD. We examined PTSD-associated alterations in 12 hippocampal subfields in relation to global hippocampal shape, and clinical features. Methods Case-control cross-sectional studies of U.S. military veterans (n = 282) from the Iraq and Afghanistan era were grouped into PTSD (n = 142) and trauma-exposed controls (n = 140). Participants underwent clinical evaluation for PTSD and associated clinical parameters followed by MRI at 3 T. Segmentation with FreeSurfer v6.0 produced hippocampal subfield volumes for the left and right CA1, CA3, CA4, DG, fimbria, fissure, hippocampus-amygdala transition area, molecular layer, parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, and tail, as well as hippocampal meshes. Covariates included age, gender, trauma exposure, alcohol use, depressive symptoms, antidepressant medication use, total hippocampal volume, and MRI scanner model. Results Significantly lower subfield volumes were associated with PTSD in left CA1 (P = 0.01; d = 0.21; uncorrected), CA3 (P = 0.04; d = 0.08; uncorrected), and right CA3 (P = 0.02; d = 0.07; uncorrected) only if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume was included as a covariate. A trend level association of L-CA1 with PTSD (F4, 221 = 3.32, P = 0.07) is present and the other subfield findings are nonsignificant if ipsilateral whole hippocampal volume is not included as a covariate. PTSD-associated differences in global hippocampal shape were nonsignificant. Conclusions The present finding of smaller hippocampal CA1 in PTSD is consistent with model systems in rodents that exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior from repeated exposure to acute stress. Behavioral correlations with hippocampal subfield volume differences in PTSD will elucidate their relevance to PTSD, particularly behaviors of associative fear learning, extinction training, and formation of false memories.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - ABSTRACT Based on data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,149), the current article provides the first large-sample investigation of associations between different forms of infant attachment insecurity and dissociative symptomatology from childhood through midadolescence as measured by scales based on the mother, teacher, and youth self-report versions of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments. Findings did not replicate the previously reported and highly cited evidence that infant attachment disorganization is associated with dissociative symptomatology. In contrast, correlations of small magnitude were observed between infant avoidance and dissociative symptomatology, as assessed by teachers and mothers (but not self-report). Results were not moderated by contextual risk. Limitations of the study included the absence of measures of maltreatment and interpersonal trauma, leaving open the possibility that infant attachment disorganization is a diathesis for later dissociation in the context of severe and/or chronic trauma. Nevertheless, the present results strongly indicate the need for additional research exploring the possible role of environmental factors in the development of dissociative symptomatology.

AB  - Although the general surgeon who takes emergency call may be confronted with a patient who has sustained a blunt liver injury, the decrease in road trauma and work-place accidents has meant that this will be an infrequent occurrence. Minimal exposure will, of necessity, extrapolate to difficulty in coping with a catastrophic event which comes unheralded, at an inconvenient time and usually when there is less than ideal support. During the past 15 years, there has been an evolution in the treatment of liver injuries which is exemplified by a non-operative approach in selected patients and more conservative procedures in those who require operative intervention. At present, ?damage control? is in vogue; do the least possible to control life-threatening injuries and come back another day. This is a cogent and admirable philosophy, provided that the pendulum does not swing too far and that a planned course of action is in place. This paper reviews the present status of managing blunt liver injuries, with an emphasis on the general surgeon who has little cause to be involved with surgery of the liver.
