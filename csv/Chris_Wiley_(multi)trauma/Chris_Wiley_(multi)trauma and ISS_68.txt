AB  - Abstract Damage control resuscitation (DCR) has become a more widely adopted acute management strategy over the past decade. A cornerstone of this strategy is the performance of an initial limited surgical intervention for the control of active bleeding and contamination. This technique is indicated where significant physiological compromise exists and immediate surgical intervention is required. This damage control surgery itself is completed judiciously to allow a period of resuscitative stabilisation before later definitive surgical solutions. This discussion describes the three further principles of DCR and then explores the rationale and drivers behind the development of this approach.

AB  - Abstract Diseases that jeopardize the musculoskeletal system and cause chronic impairment are prevalent throughout the Western world. In Germany alone, ~1.8 million patients suffer from these diseases annually, and medical expenses have been reported to reach 34.2bn Euros. Although musculoskeletal disorders are seldom fatal, they compromise quality of life and diminish functional capacity. For example, musculoskeletal disorders incur an annual loss of over 0.8 million workforce years to the German economy. Among these diseases, traumatic skeletal muscle injuries are especially problematic because they can occur owing to a variety of causes and are very challenging to treat. In contrast to chronic muscle diseases such as dystrophy, sarcopenia, or cachexia, traumatic muscle injuries inflict damage to localized muscle groups. Although minor muscle trauma heals without severe consequences, no reliable clinical strategy exists to prevent excessive fibrosis or fatty degeneration, both of which occur after severe traumatic injury and contribute to muscle degeneration and dysfunction. Of the many proposed strategies, cell-based approaches have shown the most promising results in numerous pre-clinical studies and have demonstrated success in the handful of clinical trials performed so far. A number of myogenic and non-myogenic cell types benefit muscle healing, either by directly participating in new tissue formation or by stimulating the endogenous processes of muscle repair. These cell types operate via distinct modes of action, and they demonstrate varying levels of feasibility for muscle regeneration depending, to an extent, on the muscle injury model used. While in some models the injury naturally resolves over time, other models have been developed to recapitulate the peculiarities of real-life injuries and therefore mimic the structural and functional impairment observed in humans. Existing limitations of cell therapy approaches include issues related to autologous harvesting, expansion and sorting protocols, optimal dosage, and viability after transplantation. Several clinical trials have been performed to treat skeletal muscle injuries using myogenic progenitor cells or multipotent stromal cells, with promising outcomes. Recent improvements in our understanding of cell behaviour and the mechanistic basis for their modes of action have led to a new paradigm in cell therapies where physical, chemical, and signalling cues presented through biomaterials can instruct cells and enhance their regenerative capacity. Altogether, these studies and experiences provide a positive outlook on future opportunities towards innovative cell-based solutions for treating traumatic muscle injuries?a so far unmet clinical need.

AB  - Summary The majority of esthetic emergencies involve fracture of the clinical crown. Traumatic conditions such as avulsion, bony fracture, extrusive and lateral luxation, and root fracture are considered to be acute and demand immediate treatment. Subacute conditions, including intrusion, subluxation, pulpal concussion, and crown fracture with pulp exposure, necessitate treatment within 24?h. In most cases, the emergency-bonded composite restoration will be the definitive restorative treatment. In the case of an esthetic emergency shortly before a social engagement, a dislodged crown or fixed dental prosthesis can be temporarily retained through the application of a little denture adhesive. Although replacement of the prosthesis may ultimately be recommended, patients may need an immediate interim repair. The responsibility of the dentist is to facilitate the long-term preservation of the natural dentition, the supporting periodontium and bone, and the surrounding soft gingival tissues.

AB  - The preset response surface designs often lack the ability to adapt the design based on the characteristics of application and experimental space so as to reduce the number of experiments necessary. Hence, they are not cost effective for applications where the cost of experimentation is high or when the experimentation resources are limited. In this paper, we present an adaptive sequential methodology for n-dimensional response surface optimization (n-dimensional adaptive sequential response surface methodology (N-ASRSM)) for industrial experiments with high experimentation cost, which requires high design optimization performance. We also develop a novel risk adjustment strategy for effectively considering the effect of noise into the design. The N-ASRSM is a sequential adaptive experimentation approach, which uses the information from previous experiments to design the subsequent experiment by simultaneously reducing the region of interest and identifying factor combinations for new experiments. Its major advantage is the experimentation efficiency such that, for a given response target, it identifies the input factor combination in less number of experiments than the classical response surface methodology designs. We applied N-ASRSM to the problem of traumatic brain injury modeling and compared the result with the conventional central composite design. Also, through extensive simulated experiments with different quadratic and nonlinear cases, we show that the proposed N-ASRSM method outperforms the classical response surface methodology designs and compares favorably with other sequential response surface methodologies in the literature in terms of both design optimality and experimentation efficiency.

AB  - Abstract This paper will review issues in clinical assessment of minority combat veterans who served in Vietnam. We will specify differences and similarities for assessing minorities within the context of evaluating the larger combat veteran population. As a way of introducing a need for specialized diagnosis and treatment, we will present data demonstrating that minorities may be characterized as a distinct group among Vietnam combat veterans; data demonstrating differential rates of PTSD and other psychological disorders; as well as differences in vocational, social, educational, physical and health adjustment along with differential rates of health services utilization. Throughout this paper, we will attempt to give a historical perspective to the role of the minority soldier before, during, and after military service in Vietnam, as well as inter-related civilian events that impacted minority veterans. We will review pertinent theories that explain higher PTSD rates among minority veterans-considering the special nature of the Vietnam War and its impact on young minority soldiers. We will frankly discuss problems we have observed about clinician prejudice that adversely affect clinical assessment and treatment. We emphasize that every combat veteran, regardless of racial background, is a unique individual with his or her own unique story to tell. We are aware, though, that cross-cultural interactions, because of factors internal to both client and clinician, can impede, if not preclude, effective therapeutic encounter. We recognize that providing information about minorities may do relatively little to alter deeply rooted prejudice of an unconscious nature. We hope to address the issues of ethnicity in ways that do not stir clinical resistance but rather that enhance clinician sensitivity, curiosity, and confidence.

AB  - Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI) frequently report symptoms of increased distractability and sensory disturbances during mutisensory stimulation. These common post-concussive symptoms could putatively result from dysfunction within the cognitive control network (CCN; top-down) or from unisensory cortex (bottom-up) itself. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-resolution structural data were therefore prospectively collected during a multisensory (audio-visual) cognitive control task from 46 mTBI patients within 3 weeks of injury and 46 matched healthy controls (HC), with a subset of participants returning at 4 months. Multisensory stimuli were presented at two frequencies to manipulate cognitive and perceptual load. Patients self-reported more cognitive, emotional, somatic, vestibular and visual symptoms relative to HC, which improved, but did not entirely resolve, over the 4 month follow-up period. There were no group differences in behavior or functional activation during cognitive control (incongruent ? congruent trials). In contrast, patients exhibited abnormal activation within different regions of visual cortex that depended on whether attention was focused on auditory or visual information streams. Patients also exhibited increased activation within bilateral inferior parietal lobules during higher cognitive/perceptual loads, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to achieve similar levels of behavioral performance. Functional abnormalities within the visual cortex and inferior parietal lobules were only partially resolved at 4 months post-injury, suggesting that neural abnormalities may take longer to resolve than behavioral measures used in most clinical settings. In summary, current results indicate that abnormalities within unisensory cortex (particularly visual areas) following mTBI, which likely contribute to deficits commonly reported during multisensory stimulation.

AB  - Objective This longitudinal study investigated the temporal relationship patterns between disability and mental health after injury, with a focus on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Method We conducted a multi-sited longitudinal cohort study with a large sample of hospital patients admitted after injury (N = 1,149, mean age = 37.9, 73.6% male). Data were collected prior to discharge from hospital, and follow-up assessments took place 3 and 12 months postinjury. A cross-lagged structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the prospective relationship between posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms and disability while controlling for demographic characteristics and objective measures of injury severity. Results Acute depression significantly predicted 3-month disability, and 3-month PTSD severity significantly predicted 12-month disability. Premorbid disability had a significant effect on acute anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, and 3-month depression but disability after the injury did not predict 12-month psychopathology. Conclusions We did not find a reciprocal relationship between disability and psychopathology. Rather we found that depression played a role in early disability while PTSD played a role in contributing to long-term delays in the recovery process. The results of this study highlight the need for mental health screening for symptoms of PTSD and depression in the acute aftermath of trauma, combined with early intervention programs in injury populations.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study investigated the incidence and determinants of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) in a general surgical patient population. Design This is a prospective cross-sectional study at a university-affiliated clinic/level 1 trauma center. Patients were followed at least 1 year postoperatively. By surgical discipline, procedures were 50% orthopedic/trauma, 33% general (abdominal/visceral), and 17% vascular. Setting All patients admitted during one year (N?=?3020) were eligible. Exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment, communication/language barrier, nonoperative treatment, and refusal to participate. A CPSP questionnaire was completed. Step-by-step analysis followed with a 2nd questionnaire to detect CPSP with numeric rating scale (NRS) pain intensity â‰¥3. Finally, individual follow-up examinations were performed. Results 911 patients responded (30.2%). 522 complained of pain intensity â‰¥3 on NRS (scale 0?10). The second step identified 214 patients with chronic pain (NRS â‰¥3, mean 29 months postoperatively). On final examination, 83 CPSP patients (14.8%) were identified. By surgical discipline, 28% were general, 15% vascular, and 57% trauma/orthopedic surgery. Most oftenly cited pain sites were joint (49.4%), incisional/scar (37.7%), and nerve pain (33.7%). By procedure, patients underwent pelvic surgery, colon surgery, laparoscopies, inguinal herniorrhaphies, arthroscopies, and hardware extractions. All patients in the ?laborer? and ?unemployed? categories reported chronic pain. Conclusion Bias due to study design and/or heterogeneity of patients is possible, but there was a high CPSP rate after 2 years both generally and particularly in orthopedic/trauma (57%) patients. Both ?major? and ?minor? surgical procedures led to CPSP.

AB  - Abstract Patients with supraventricular tachycardia commonly present to the ED. There is a lack of consensus regarding assessment of these patients. Our aim was to determine the utility of troponin and four other investigations (full blood examination, electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests and chest X-rays) commonly requested for these patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1992?March 2017) were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies (of sample size greater than 10). Our search strategy yielded no randomised controlled trials and seven observational studies with significant statistical heterogeneity among selected studies (I2 87.3%, P < 0.001). Included studies investigated a total of 1155 patients. All studies reported on the utility of troponin testing in this patient population. The pooled proportion of patients investigated with troponin was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.44?0.88). The pooled proportion of positive troponin tests was 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.23?0.41). Only one study reported on the utility of the remaining four investigations with abnormal results as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone 14%, haemoglobin 6%, white cell count 19% and chest X-ray 22%. Investigations are commonly requested for patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardia. Troponin testing is commonly performed with a high proportion of positive findings although these results did not appear to be associated with major adverse cardiac events. Heterogeneity among studies and low levels of evidence precluded conclusions on full blood examinations, electrolyte levels, thyroid testing and utility of chest X-rays in this patient population.

Donation after cardiac death is one effective way to decrease the organ shortage and has contributed the largest recent increase in abdominal organ allografts. Currently, donation after cardiac death organs confer an increased risk of ischemic cholangiopathy after liver transplant and of delayed graft function after kidney transplant. As this field matures, risk factors for donation after cardiac death organ transplant will be further identified and clinical outcomes will improve as a result of protocol standardization and ongoing research.

AB  - Aim In this observational study using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor, we investigated the differential effects of pathology, stage of disease, state of consciousness, and aetiology on the modifications of supra- and infra-tentorial white matter tracts and their correlations with clinical scales in paediatric patients with severe non-traumatic brain injury. Method Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) was obtained from seven children with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; five males, two females; age at event 5y; standard deviation [SD] 2y 1mo), six children in a minimally conscious state (MCS; three males, three females; age at event 5y 10mo; SD 5y), and 10 healthy children as controls(two males, eight females; age at study 10y 10mo; SD 2y 10mo). Fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were calculated for the corpus callosum, inferior, middle (MCP), and superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP). Results DT-MRI parameters from corpus callosum and SCP differed between patients and controls. MCP abnormalities were detected in patients presenting non-traumatic composite aetiology (n=4) versus those suffering from pure anoxia (n=9). The supra-tentorial compartment was more damaged (i.e. decreased fractional anisotropy and increased diffusivities) than the infra-tentorial one. Correlations were found between DT-MRI abnormalities and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. Interpretation In paediatric UWS/MCS, the severity of clinical disability correlates with white matter tract abnormalities.

We review three pediatric traumatic temporal bone fractures with pneumolabyrinth, confirmed radiologically by the presence of air within the cochlea (pneumocochlea) or vestibule (pneumovestibule). Patients were treated conservatively with complete resolution of vestibulopathy. Hearing outcome was variable and worse in two patients with pneumocochlea. A pneumolabyrinth on radiologic imaging confirms a PLF and obviates the need for exploration to reach a diagnosis. We suggest exploration be reserved for patients with persisting cerebrospinal fluid leakage, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, or vestibular symptomatology. Laryngoscope, 2011

AB  - Understanding dentinogenesis and pulp regeneration during physiological and pathological conditions represents a real challenge in the provision of a suitable treatment that ideally leads to the induction of the pulp regenerative potential. This paper focusses on the early steps of dentin?pulp regeneration that appear to be critical after pulp capping procedures. Different models are described in this paper where the interactions between different cell types in vitro illustrate their role in maintaining pulpal homeostasis. After traumatic injuries, the cells modify the local pulpal microenvironment by secreting growth factors that orchestrate and induce the processes required for dentin?pulp regeneration. Applying dental materials onto the injured pulp modifies this local microenvironment and affects the potential for pulpal regeneration. The paper also describes the added value of developing an entire human tooth culture model for understanding these early steps and discusses the interest of its use in evaluating newly developed pulp capping materials through the example of BiodentineTM, developed as a dentin substitute. The growth factors sustained release simulating the local microenvironment is also discussed. Simulating the pulp local environment with a continuous growth factors release is also a basic requirement for establishing future pulp tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract:? Traumatic experiences of violence like those that were brought about by the communist regime of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) are still present as if they happened yesterday, causing severe disadvantages in everyday life even after all those years. Consequently, in cases of extreme traumatization induced by political imprisonment, persecution and applied psychological methods of disintegration, regressive processes take place which corrode the ego. The breakdown of cathexis, i.e., the failure of empathic connection at the time of the trauma, is the strongest characteristic of severe traumatization. As a result of this destruction for the traumatized there is an inability to keep upright an inner empathic, emotional connection. As we try to grasp, from a Jungian point of view, the psychodynamics of severe traumatization, we can speak of a powerful pathogenous complex, which I call the ?Prometheus-complex?. Gustav Bovensiepen speaks of this complex as a sub-network, aÂ limited fragment of the matrix of all internalized experiences, consisting of internal working models, feelings and patterns of anticipation which interact mutually. The human being, captured in such isolation and paralysis of the mind, can find himself ?in the therapist? on a mental level.

AB  - Summary: Thirty-three patients whc had had prosthetic valves inserted in the preceding four years were investigated to estimate the value of various laboratory tests in the assessment of traumatic red cell destruction. A combination of the findings of an elevation in serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and a fall in serum haptoglobir levels, was found to be a reliable and accurate pointer to the presence of red cell damage. This study indicates that the commonly used parameters of an increased reticulocyte count, a rise it serum bilirubin levels, the presence ol methaemalbumin (positive Schumm's test) and fragmented red cells in the peripheral blood, although very valuable in more severe cases, are not sufficiently accurate to be used as indicators ol minor degrees of red cell damage. Milc and clinically insignificant red cell destruction is very common in patients with artificial valves and only one case of the thirty-three studied showed no laboratory evidence of traumatic haemolysis.

AB  - In the aftermath of a disaster like Hurricane Katrina, remote-sensing methods are often employed in an effort to assess damage. However, their utility may be limited by the aerial perspective and image resolution. The Spatial Video Acquisition System (SVAS), in conjunction with a Geographic Information System (GIS), has the potential to be a complementary methodology for obtaining damage assessment information as well as capturing recovery related geographies associated with post-traumatic stress. An example is provided from the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans with data that could be used to predict neighborhood post-traumatic stress. Results reveal six dimensions in which a SVAS can improve existing disaster-related data collection approaches: organization, archiving, transferability, evaluation, objectivity, and feasibility.

AB  - Summary As compared with European practice, the American approach to resuscitation from traumatic haemorrhage de-emphasises pre-hospital interventions in favour of rapid transport to definitive care; limits initial surgical interventions under the damage control model; uses crystalloid as the initial fluid of choice; and follows an empiric 1:1:1 approach to transfusion with red cells, plasma and platelets in hemodynamically unstable and actively bleeding patients. The use of bedside visco-elastic testing to guide coagulation support is not as widespread as in Europe, while the early administration of tranexamic acid is more selective.

AB  - Abstract The child welfare court system wrestles consistently with how to measure success. Preventing child deaths, ensuring child safety, enhancing child well-being, and faster permanency are some of the metrics used to assess the effectiveness of our system. This article proposes measuring child welfare courts on their principle-driven expression of values that promote the existence of resilience in families, professionals, and the system itself. It is critical to understand that trauma is not a necessary result of adversity, and the existence of protective factors can make us resilient against the triggering and onset of trauma. Child welfare court systems exist in complexity, and need to be managed for innovation and adaptability. The experience of poverty shared between families and the system is often the curse that weighs against performance, but could be the link that opens expanded capacity. The Court Improvement Training Academy at the University of Washington School of Law provides a framework of values, principles, and examples of work aimed at building resilience-oriented child welfare court systems.
