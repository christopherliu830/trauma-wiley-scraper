AB  - Abstract The child welfare court system wrestles consistently with how to measure success. Preventing child deaths, ensuring child safety, enhancing child well-being, and faster permanency are some of the metrics used to assess the effectiveness of our system. This article proposes measuring child welfare courts on their principle-driven expression of values that promote the existence of resilience in families, professionals, and the system itself. It is critical to understand that trauma is not a necessary result of adversity, and the existence of protective factors can make us resilient against the triggering and onset of trauma. Child welfare court systems exist in complexity, and need to be managed for innovation and adaptability. The experience of poverty shared between families and the system is often the curse that weighs against performance, but could be the link that opens expanded capacity. The Court Improvement Training Academy at the University of Washington School of Law provides a framework of values, principles, and examples of work aimed at building resilience-oriented child welfare court systems.

AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Variability in clinical presentation among patients with neck pain disorders, in relation to symptom severity and the effect of the disorder on their physical and psychological function, has not been well documented. The present study examined the variability in pain intensity, physical and emotional or cognitive function in patients with non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain, and the extent to which these factors are associated at the time of referral for physiotherapy treatment. Method The study utilized a survey of patients referred for physiotherapy treatment for non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain. Seventy-two patients (mean age 58 years; SD 15.5 years) with a symptom duration ranging from four weeks to 30 years were recruited. Each completed measures of pain intensity using a visual analogue scale, and neck-pain related disability by use of the ?Neck Pain and Disability? scale (NPAD). Frequency distributions were calculated to examine variability in pain intensity, the total NPAD score and the effect of the disorder on different aspects of physical and emotional or cognitive function. Relationships between pain intensity, and physical and psychological function, were also examined. Results Pain intensity was normally distributed with a mean score of 6.3 cm (SD 2.5 cm). NPAD scores were normally distributed (mean 54.8%; SD 18%). Similar variability was noted in each of the NPAD factor scores for neck function, pain intensity, emotional or cognitive function and activities of daily living. Pain intensity was significantly (p<0.01) correlated with the total NPAD score (r = 0.55) and with each of the four effects of neck pain represented in the NPAD sub-domains (r = 0.42?0.63). Symptom duration was not significantly correlated with pain intensity, or with the severity of disability, as reflected in the total NPAD score. Conclusions The results highlight the variability between patients with neck pain, in relation to pain intensity and the effect of the disorder on physical and psychological function. Identifying the specific effects of the neck pain disorder in individual cases is important when defining the treatment objectives and selecting measures of treatment response.

AB  - Abstract The phrase ?back of house? often refers to art gallery processes that are rarely seen by visitors. These include the processes of acquisition, cataloging, conservation, the development and production of exhibitions, and the planning of related public programs. This paper proposes that a psychoanalytic consideration of ?back of house? art gallery processes can provide important insights into the nature of trauma that is manifested through creative efforts. It explores some of the psychoanalytic aspects of a unique project concerning the art by survivors of the Holocaust. It highlights transgenerational trauma and how a thoughtful process of acquisition and exhibition can facilitate the working through of a collectively painful experience in a traumatized community.

AB  - Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure prior to traumatic injury, such as a burn, elevates systemic and local inflammatory responses and increases morbidity and mortality. Adipose is a large tissue mass that is often inflamed during obesity or other stresses, which disturbs metabolic homeostasis. To date, there has been little investigation into the inflammatory response of adipose tissue after combined EtOH exposure and burn injury. Methods Two EtOH exposure regimens were utilized to examine the role of inflammation in adipose tissue after EtOH and burn injury. Mice were either given a single or episodic binge exposure to EtOH or saline followed by scald (burn) or sham injury 30Â minutes later. Twenty-four hours post injury, serum and adipose tissue were collected for assessment of inflammatory mediators. Results Single binge EtOH alone induced no inflammation in adipose when compared with sham vehicle-treated mice. However, single binge EtOH followed by burn injury induced significant elevations in mRNA and protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 compared with either insult alone or sham vehicle group. Additionally, EtOH exposure and burn injury significantly blunted inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating a complex inflammatory response. Episodic binge EtOH exposure followed by burn injury exacerbated the postburn adipose inflammatory response. The magnitude of the episodic binge-induced inflammatory parameters postburn were 2- to 5-fold greater than the response detected after a single exposure of EtOH, indicating EtOH-induced potentiation of burn-induced inflammatory response. Finally, inflammatory loci and crown-like structures in adipose were significantly increased by episodic binge EtOH and burn injury. Conclusions This is the first report of binge and burn-induced crown-like structure formation. Evidence presented herein suggests an important role for alcohol and burn as an additional mediator of adipose inflammation in postburn injury, a common complication in burn patients.

AB  - Objective Agonism of protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuro- and vasculoprotection in experimental neuroinjury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A-APC, reduces neurological injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A-APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A-APC in ischemic stroke patients. Methods The NeuroNEXT trial, RHAPSODY, used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360, and 540 ?g/kg of 3K3A-APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates. Results Between January 2015 and July 2017, we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest-dose 3K3A-APC tested, 540 ?g/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A-APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (p = 0.046) and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1 Â± 5.8 ml in placebo to 0.8 Â± 2.1 ml in the combined treatment arms (p = 0.066). Interpretation RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540 ?g/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant, 3K3A-APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Penile amputation is a rare type of external genital trauma. It may arise from accidental trauma, assault or self-inflicted mutilation. As with all trauma, initial management focuses on assessment and resuscitation of the patient. When available, hypothermic preservation of the detached penis should be undertaken. Aim This review serves to compile the current available information on etiology and management of penile amputation injuries, with focus on functional and cosmetic results. Main Outcome Measures Main outcome measures were penile cosmetics, viability, and sensation; urethral patency and graft survival, functionality. Methods A literature search using Medline, PubMed (U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health), and abstracts from scientific meetings was performed from 1980?2013. Results Due to the rarity of penile amputation injuries, no randomized trials exist. Likewise, available published series on management of this condition are comprised of a small number of patients. Conclusions Penile amputation is rare but challenging. Current microreplantation procedures have a uniformly good result with a minimum number of post-operative complications. When microreplantation cannot be performed, older corporal reattachment techniques may be offered. When phallic reconstruction is required, a microsurgical free forearm flap phalloplasty may be performed to restore the patient with an acceptable cosmetic and functional phallus.

AB  - Aim Hip fracture as a result of bone fragility is characterized by poor health outcomes in the medium and long term. Our goal was to compare a new orthogeriatric model with the old trauma model and evaluate improvements in clinical management. Methods We carried out a comparative unicentric study, a historical sample (trauma model) collected from 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2010, versus a prospective sample (orthogeriatric model) collected from 1 June 2010 until 31 May 2013. We included all patients aged >69 years with hip fracture as a result of bone fragility. Results A total of 792 patients were evaluated (mean age 84.3 years). The surgical waiting period went from 2.70 days in the trauma model to 1.86 days in the orthogeriatric model (P < 0.001); the average stay was 15.76 days in the trauma model, and for the orthogeriatric model was reduced to 5.90 days (P < 0.001); mortality went from 4.5% to 1.3% (P â¤ 0.010); 1 month readmission for hip dislocation was reduced from 2.3% to 0.5% (P = 0.032). After a 6-month follow up, we had 302 trauma model patients and 287 orthogeriatric model patients. After 1 year, we had 288 patients in the trauma model and 264 patients in the orthogeriatric model. The main cause of abandonment was death, 108 patients (27.3%) in the trauma model and 100 patients (27.5%) in the orthogeriatric model (P = 0.951). Conclusions When we compared the two models, we found statistically significant better results in the preoperative waiting period, average stay, hospital mortality and 1 month readmission as a result of hip prosthesis luxation in favor of the orthogeriatric model.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Despite a policy of zero tolerance towards workplace violence (WPV) in Australian public hospital EDs, the incidence of WPV continues to increase. The aim of this study was to characterise security responses to WPV within an adult level 4 ED. Methods A retrospective single-centre review of episodes of WPV perpetrated by adults occurring within the ED was conducted between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015. Cases were identified using a prospectively recorded security register that records all events of security personnel attendance. The presence of police officers on initial presentation was the primary exposure variable. Results There were 1853 violent episodes committed by 1224 patients requiring security intervention during the study period, with half the episodes (n =?916; 49%) involving perpetrators who had committed at least two or more violent acts during the study period. Most cases (n =?1057, 57%; 95% CI: 55?59) occurred in the absence of police presence. Only 144 (7.8%) cases were managed by the presence of security personnel without physical security interventions. Conclusions EDs should not rely on police response to prevent or handle violence. The finding of a high proportion of events being perpetrated by repeat offenders indicate that data sharing between EDs for identification of perpetrators of WPV can be useful for prevention of future episodes. ACEM policy for WPV in EDs should encompass further details on security credentialing and preventive strategies towards minimisation of WPV in the Australian EDs.

AB  - Abstract Closed incision negative pressure wound therapy (CINPWT) has been shown to be clinically effective compared with the traditional gauze dressing, reducing surgical site infections and wound complications. We evaluated the effect of CINPWT compared with gauze dressing on the need for revision surgery and survival after non-traumatic major lower amputation. We included 309 patients undergoing 403 major lower amputations in a retrospective study from January 1, 2010 to November 23, 2017. A total of 139 patients received CINPWT, and 170 patients received stump bandage. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the need for revision surgery (P =?.45). Fourteen stump bandage patients and 15 CINPWT patients died in hospital (P =?.57). One year after amputation, 55 CINPWT patients and 66 stump bandage patients had died (P =?.82). Survival probabilities adjusted for age and gender 2?years after amputation were .52 (.43-.61) and .49 (.42-.58), respectively, and 3?years after amputation were .36 (.25-.50) and .39 (.32-.47), respectively. We also found no significant difference in the need for revision surgery in survival probabilities up till 3?years after amputation between patients treated with CINPWT and patients treated with gauze bandage postoperatively.

AB  - Abstract A correct diagnosis and an understanding of the aetiology and dynamics of the processes involved in tooth resorption is critical to effective management. Tooth resorptions can be classified as: (1) trauma induced; (2) infection induced; or (3) hyperplastic invasive. Some transient trauma induced resorptions require no treatment but must be carefully monitored to check that there are no complicating issues such as infection. In cases of trauma induced replacement resorption, a multidisciplinary approach is usually necessary to ensure an optimal long-term solution. Infection induced tooth resorptions require the removal of the invading micro-organisms by endodontic therapy including intra-canal medication which can also facilitate repair of the resorbed tooth structure. The hyperplastic invasive tooth resorptions pose considerable challenges in management due to the complexity and aggressive nature of the resorptive process. With careful case selection and complete inactivation of resorptive tissue successful management can be achieved.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis is increasingly applied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). However, there are a few long-term survival data of the inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) over 10 years. Aim.? To determine the long-term mechanical reliability of AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis in patients with ED. Methods.? A total of 438 consecutive patients with ED received implantation of an AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis at our institution from January 1991 to April 2009. In 397 patients (90.7%), the medical records were available and current status of penile prosthesis could be obtained by a direct telephone interview. The overall and mechanical survival rates of penile prosthesis were evaluated using Kaplan?Meier method. Main Outcome Measures.? Assessing the mechanical and overall survival rates of the AMS 700CX/CXM penile prosthesis using Kaplan?Meier analysis, and looking for clinical factors related to survival of the CX/CXM using log-rank test. Results.? Mean age of 397 patients was 63.1 years (range, 24-93) and follow-up duration was 113 months (range 1-219). Eighty-two patients (20.6%) experienced mechanical failure at a median follow-up of 82 months. Mechanical survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 97.6%, 93.2% and 78.2% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. 12 patients (3.0%) experienced nonmechanical failure including infections, tissue erosion resulting in cylinder protrusion at the meatus and chronic discomfort. Overall survival rate of the penile prosthesis was 95.0%, 91.0% and 75.5% at 3, 5, and 10 years after implantation, respectively. Patients with neurogenic cause for ED showed lower median overall survival of penile prosthesis compared with patients with non-neurogenic cause. Patient age, obesity, and diabetes mellitus had no association with overall survival of penile prosthesis after implantation. Conclusions.? The AMS 700CX/CXM could be accepted and applied in more patients as a reliable treatment alternative of ED. Kim DS, Yang KM, Chung HJ, Choi HM, Choi YD, and Choi HK. AMS 700CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis has high mechanical reliability at long-term follow-up. J Sex Med 2010;7:2602?2607.

AB  - This article is underpinned by the premise that for recovery, healing and post-traumatic growth to occur after traumatic events such as technological and natural disasters, massacres and terrorist attacks, effective therapeutic services need to be offered at both the individual and community level. Frequently, responses to such traumatic instances have been conceptualised as discrete, polarised interventions offered by various groups of health and welfare professionals at various points post the traumatic event. Traditionally when therapeutic interventions are considered, many practitioners assume that the response would, and should, focus primarily and narrowly, on individuals or their families and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Conversely, the perceived role of community wide interventions has been unnecessarily limited to disaster relief or organised emergency responses most usually offered at the time of the crisis. The consequence of these limited understandings is an apparent failure to explore fully the therapeutic or mediating role of social or community support in surviving trauma. Interventions encompassing the level of community might be therapeutic in two fundamental ways. First, if practitioners embraced ideas from systemic family therapy literature, ideas that acknowledge the importance of social networks, this would encourage a more holistic vision of resilience and recovery. Second, if practitioners recognised that whole communities and social networks might also be traumatised, they could provide support and interventions oriented toward healing at this broader level.

AB  - A three-year-old neutered female Labrador cross was presented for investigation of two corneal epithelial inclusion cysts affecting the left eye. The aetiopathogenesis of the cyst formation was suspected to be traumatic. The cysts were removed successfully by superficial keratectomy, followed by a third eyelid flap. Histologically, both lesions were represented by cystic formations lined with multi-layered squamous epithelium, consistent with stromal inclusion of surface corneal epithelium. Complete recovery was achieved, and there was no recurrence at six month follow-up.

AB  - Abstract The outcomes of posterolateral multilevel spine fusion in difficult clinical settings, such as in an aged multi-diseased osteoporotic patient, remain unpredictable. The osteoprogenitor cells in bone marrow decrease with ageing without losing their osteogeneic potential. Autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) from iliac crest aspirate can be concentrated in the operating room and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) can be obtained from a peripheral blood as a source of autologous osteoprogenitor cells and growth factors, respectively. We present the case of an 88 year-old multi-diseased osteoporotic patient affected by cervical stenosis and subjected to C3?C7 posterior decompression, instrumentation and posterolateral fusion, using an intraoperative ?tissue-engineered? composite made of corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from iliac crest aspirate enriched with PRF from peripheral blood. Lateral dynamic X-rays and CT scan showed consolidation signs at 3 months follow-up, with solid C3?C7 fusion at 6 months follow-up. This paper describes a simple and effective method for potentially improving the fusion rate in aged osteoporotic patients by using corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from the iliac crest, enriched with PRF from peripheral blood, rapidly obtained before the surgical procedure.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation is usually the pathological consequence of skin trauma. And hypertrophic scars (HSs) frequently occur in people after being injured deeply. HSs are unusually considered as the result of tissue contraction and excessive extracellular matrix component deposition. Myofibroblasts, as the effector cells, mainly differentiated from fibroblasts, play the crucial role in the pathophysiology of HSs. A number of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of HS occurrence. Currently, with in-depth exploration and clinical research of HSs, various creative and effective treatments budded. In here, we summarize the progress in the molecular mechanism of HSs, and review the available biotherapeutic methods for their pathophysiological characteristics. Additionally, we further prospected that the comprehensive therapy may be more suitable for HS treatment.

AB  - Massive transfusion protocols became common practice between 2006 and 2010. The terminology of ?massive transfusion protocol? was improved to ?massive haemorrhage protocol (MHP)? with the astute recognition that at the start of such a protocol, it is unclear which patients will meet the definition of massive transfusion (10Â U/24Â h). Despite the majority of the literature being reported from the trauma population, hospitals have generally adopted a single MHP for all patients. It remains unclear whether the same protocol can be used for all patients. MHPs assist with the prevention and management of the acute coagulopathy of trauma/shock (ACOTS). The goals of a MHP are to improve haemostasis, communication and patient outcomes. The protocol must be specific for an individual hospital, depending on factors such as prehospital transport times, distance from laboratory to trauma and operating rooms, patient populations served and types of tests available. The key components of a MHP are the 6Ts: triggering of the protocol, laboratory testing, tranexamic acid, temperature maintenance, transfusion support and termination of the protocol when haemostasis is achieved. The evidence and importance of each of these steps will be discussed in detail. It is also critical that a quality assurance programme supports the MHP. Poor compliance with the institutional MHP is associated with inferior survival. Each MHP activation should be followed by a formal debrief by the team. Audits should be performed to determine compliance and to inform annual update of the MHP. Formal training and/or simulation should be a core part of the policy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Melorheostosis is a rare non-hereditary condition characterized by dense hyperostotic lesions with radiographic ?dripping candle wax? appearance. Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 have recently been identified as a cause of melorheostosis. However, little is known about the development, composition, structure, and mechanical properties of the bone lesions. We performed a multi-method phenotype characterization of material properties in affected and unaffected bone biopsy samples from six melorheostosis patients with MAP2K1 mutations. On standard histology, lesions show a zone with intensively remodeled osteonal-like structure and prominent osteoid accumulation, covered by a shell formed through bone apposition, consisting of compact multi-layered lamellae oriented parallel to the periosteal surface and devoid of osteoid. Compared with unaffected bone, melorheostotic bone has lower average mineralization density measured by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (CaMean: ?4.5%, p?=?0.04). The lamellar portion of the lesion is even less mineralized, possibly because the newly deposited material has younger tissue age. Affected bone has higher porosity by micro-CT, due to increased tissue vascularity and elevated 2D-microporosity (osteocyte lacunar porosity: +39%, p?=?0.01) determined on quantitative backscattered electron images. Furthermore, nano-indentation modulus characterizing material hardness and stiffness was strictly dependent on tissue mineralization (correlation with typical calcium concentration, CaPeak: r?=?0.8984, p?=?0.0150, and r?=?0.9788, p?=?0.0007, respectively) in both affected and unaffected bone, indicating that the surgical hardness of melorheostotic lesions results from their lamellar structure. The results suggest a model for pathophysiology of melorheostosis caused by somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1, in which the genetically induced gradual deterioration of bone microarchitecture triggers a periosteal reaction, similar to the process found to occur after bone infection or local trauma, and leads to an overall cortical outgrowth. The micromechanical properties of the lesions reflect their structural heterogeneity and correlate with local variations in mineral content, tissue age, and remodeling rates, in the same way as normal bone. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research
