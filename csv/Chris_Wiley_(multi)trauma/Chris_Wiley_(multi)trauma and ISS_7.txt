AB  - Abstract Introduction The effectiveness of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) has been assumed from low quality studies with multiple biases. This review aimed to (i) evaluate the association between the institution of an MTP and mortality and (ii) determine the effect of MTPs on transfusion practice post trauma. Methods A systematic review of studies that examined patient outcomes before and after the institution of an MTP in the same centre was conducted. The design and results of each study were described. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes from each study were pooled. Results There were eight studies that satisfied inclusion criteria with marked heterogeneity in study populations (I2 = 72.1%, P = 0.001). Two studies showed significantly improved mortality following implementation of an MTP, and six studies showed no significant change. Pooled OR for the effect of an MTP on short-term mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.48?1.11). The effect of MTPs on transfusion practice was varied. Conclusion Despite the popularity of MTPs and directives mandating their use in trauma centres, in before?after studies, MTPs have not always been associated with improved mortality. Evidence-based standardization of MTPs, improved compliance and analysis of broader endpoints were identified as areas for further research.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic trauma is uncommon, but carries high morbidity and mortality rates, especially when diagnosis is delayed or inappropriate surgery is attempted. Although the retroperitoneal position of the pancreas confers it some immunity to injury, the force required to do so often results in severe associated injuries to other organs, which may be life threatening. Diagnosis may be difficult and surgery can be a considerable technical challenge. Methods: All patients with pancreatic trauma who attended one of three Melbourne teaching hospitals from 1977 to 1998 were identified. Injuries were graded and the method of diagnosis and treatment studied. The incidence and causation of postoperative morbidity and mortality was identified. Results: Thirty-eight patients (26 men and 12 women) were studied. Blunt trauma was responsible in 30 patients, stab wounds in five, gunshot wounds in two and iatrogenic injury in one. Injuries to other organs occurred in 30 patients. Surgical procedures were undertaken in 34 patients, resulting in the death of five and complications in 25. Conclusion: Complications and death are related to the associated injuries, as much as to the pancreatic injury itself. In this study, we review the experience of the management of pancreatic trauma in three large teaching hospitals in Melbourne over a 21-year period, and suggest a strategy for dealing with these difficult patients. Adherence to the basic concepts of control of bleeding from associated vascular injury, minimization of contamination, accurate pancreatic assessment, judicious resection and adequate drainage can diminish the risk. By approaching the problem in a systematic way and adopting a generally conservative management plan, complications and deaths can be minimized in these complex cases.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients a blunt chest trauma is an important trigger of the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response. There is clinical evidence that fracture healing is delayed in such patients, however, experimental data are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the influence of a thoracic trauma on fracture healing in a rat model. Male Wistar rats received either a blunt chest trauma combined with a femur osteotomy or an isolated osteotomy. A more rigid or a more flexible external fixator was used for fracture stabilization to analyze whether the thoracic trauma influences regular healing and mechanically induced delayed bone healing differently. The blunt chest trauma induced a significant increase of IL-6 serum levels after 6 and 24?h, suggesting the induction of a systemic inflammation, whereas the isolated fracture had no effect. Under a more rigid fixation the thoracic trauma considerably impaired fracture healing after 35 days, reflected by a significantly reduced flexural rigidity (three-point-bending test), as well as a significantly diminished callus volume, moment of inertia, and relative bone surface (µCT analysis). In confirming the clinical evidence, this study reports for the first time that a blunt chest trauma considerably impaired bone healing, possibly via the interaction of the induced systemic inflammation with local inflammatory processes. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background? Flail chest in thoracic trauma is associated with significant complications and carries high morbidity and mortality. At present there is no standardized management plan for flail chest. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors affecting morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in the hospital. Methods? We evaluated all patients admitted to our trauma centre between January 2002 and December 2004. Age, presence of pneumothorax, trauma severity score (ISS), length of stay, lung contusion and deaths were recorded. Results? There were 100 patients with a mean age of 52 (SD 19.8, range 17?90). The median length of stay was 17 days, and the average ISS score was 30 (SD 13.2). 74% had flail chest and lung contusion, 2 patients had pneumothorax, and 7 (7%) patients died 3 (5.4%) patients with 1?4 fractured ribs died, compared with 4 (8.9%) patients with 5 or more fractured ribs (p?=?0.70, Fisher?s exact test). The mean ISS score was 32.3 (SD 19.5) for those who died compared with 29.8 (SD 12.7) in those who did not die (p?=?0.63, t-test). There was a moderate positive correlation between ISS score and length of stay (r?=?0.36, p?=?0.0002, Pearson correlation coefficient). Conclusion? ISS score was found to be a moderate potential predictor on outcome regarding length of stay in the hospital. There is an apparent increased risk of death with more fractured ribs and therefore a standadised surgical management plan for ribs fixation may reduce the risk of death in this patient group.

AB  - Objectives:? This study examined: (i) the prevalence of trauma in a bipolar disorder (BD) sample, and (ii) how trauma histories mediated by interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence impact on the severity of BD. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its relationship to outcomes in BD were also examined. Methods:? Sixty participants were recruited from a geographically well-defined mental health service in Northern Ireland. Self-reported trauma histories, PTSD, interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence and were examined in relation to illness severity. Results:? A high prevalence of trauma was found. Trauma predicted the frequency of hospital admissions (R2?=?0.08), quality of life (R2?=?0.23) and inter-episode depressive symptoms (R2?=?0.13). Interpersonal difficulties, but not alcohol dependence, appeared to play an important role in mediating these adverse effects. While only 8% of the sample met criteria for active PTSD, this comorbid disorder was associated with BD severity. Conclusions:? This study indicates that awareness of trauma is important in understanding individual differences in bipolar presentations. The theoretical and clinical implications of evidence that trauma is related to more adverse outcomes in BD are discussed. The finding that interpersonal difficulties mediate the relationship between trauma and BD severity is novel. The need for adjunctive evidence-based treatments targeting interpersonal difficulties is considered.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims In 2005 the American College of Surgeons passed a mandate requiring that level I trauma centers have mechanisms to identify and intervene with problem drinkers. The aim of this investigation was to determine if a multi-level trauma center intervention targeting both providers and patients would lead to higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) when compared with trauma center mandate compliance without implementation enhancements. Design Cluster randomized trial in which intervention site (site n?=?10, patient n?=?409) providers received 1-day workshop training on evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) alcohol interventions and four 30-minute feedback and coaching sessions; control sites (site n?=?10, patient n?=?469) implemented the mandate without study team training enhancements. Setting Trauma centers in the United States of America. Participants A total of 878 blood alcohol-positive in-patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI). Measurements MI skills of providers were assessed with fidelity coded standardized patient interviews. All patients were interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months post-injury with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Findings Intervention site providers consistently demonstrated enhanced MI skills compared with control providers. Intervention patients demonstrated an 8% reduction in AUDIT hazardous drinking relative to controls over the course of the year after injury (relative risk?=?0.88, 95%, confidence interval?=?0.79, 0.98). Intervention patients were more likely to demonstrate improvements in alcohol use problems in the absence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (P?=?0.002). Conclusion Trauma center providers can be trained to deliver higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) than untrained providers, which is associated with modest reductions in alcohol use problems, particularly among patients without TBI.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To assess the effect of esmolol vs lidocaine to attenuate the detrimental rise in heart rate and blood pressure during intubation of patients with isolated head trauma. Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized study, performed at an urban, county teaching emergency department. Participants were 30 patients with isolated head trauma. Each underwent a standardized intubation protocol including esmolol or lidocaine, both at 2 mg/kg. Results: Esmolol was used in 16 patients and lidocaine in 14. Mechanisms of injury included 12 assaults, 6 motor vehicle collisions, 6 falls, 4 auto-vs-pedestrian crashes, and 2 bicycle incidents. Mean ethanol level was 0.116 ± 0.133 SD (range 0-0.482). Mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7.9 ± 4.0 SD. Cranial computed tomography (CT) hemorrhagic findings included 9 subdural/epidural hematomas, 6 cortex hemorrhages, and 2 multi-hemorrhages. Eleven patients received surgical intervention: 9 patients received a craniotomy, and 2 a ventricular catheter. The 2-minute time interval around intubation was used to assess each drug's efficacy. The mean difference change between groups for heart rate was 4.0 beats/min (95% CI = -17.7 to 9.7 beats/min), for systolic blood pressure was 1.3 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.8 to 30.4 mm Hg), and for diastolic blood pressure was 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.1 to 21.9 mm Hg). The power of this study was 90% to detect a 20-beat/min difference in heart rate, a 35-mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure, and a 20-mm Hg difference in diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Esmolol and lidocaine have similar efficacies to attenuate moderate hemodynamic response to intubation of patients with isolated head trauma.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the role of levator ani trauma in anal incontinence (AI), whilst controlling for anal sphincter injury. Methods The records of 1273 patients who had attended a tertiary urogynaecology unit between 1st of January to 31st December 2016 were reviewed. AI was assessed using St Mark's score and visual analogue scale (VAS). Levator muscle and anal sphincter trauma were examined by translabial ultrasound using tomographic imaging, with archived data sets investigated blinded against all clinical data. A complete avulsion was diagnosed if at least three central tomographic slices showed an abnormal muscle insertion, rated separately for each side. A significant anal sphincter defect was diagnosed if at least four out of six slices showed a defect of ≥ 30°. Results Avulsion was associated with St Mark's score (P = 0.005) and VAS bother of AI (P = 0.022) both on univariate analysis and when controlling for external anal sphincter (EAS) trauma on translabial imaging, forceps, body mass index (BMI) and age (P = 0.011 and P = 0.04, respectively). AI expressed as a binary variable was significantly associated with avulsion on univariate analysis (P = 0.011), although the association became nonsignificant after controlling for anal sphincter trauma, age, BMI and forceps delivery (P = 0.084). Conclusion In this retrospective observational study, we found a weak association between levator ani avulsion and measures of AI, which largely remained significant when controlling for anal sphincter trauma. However, given the large data set, any clinical effect of levator trauma on AI is likely to be minor.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and is a leading cause of presentations to emergency departments. Understanding the epidemiology of TBI can aid in improving overall management and identifying opportunities for prevention. Currently, there is a paucity of data on paediatric TBI in NSW. The purpose of this study was to determine the demographics, causes, treatment and outcome of TBI at The Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW), a large trauma referral paediatric hospital. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients admitted to CHW emergency from 2006 to 2011 with a TBI. Patients who presented to the emergency department and had a history of TBI with either symptoms of concussion and/or positive computed tomography (CT) findings of head injury were selected. Information regarding demographics, injury pattern, CT findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved. Results Over the 6-year period, there were 1489 presentations at the CHW. Of these, 65% were male and 35% were female. The mean age was 7 years. A total of 93% were classified as mild, 1.5% as moderate and 5.5% as severe. Sports and recreational injuries accounted for 26% of all TBI presentations, while motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) accounted for 77% of all TBI deaths. Sixty-two per?cent of children underwent a CT brain, and of those, 40% were normal. Conclusion The majority of TBI are mild in nature, with younger children and males at greatest risk. There was a low rate of operative intervention and a high rate of good outcomes. Many injuries may be preventable with the adaptation of better public health education programmes, particularly in very young children and those related to MVAs.

AB  - Summary An animal trauma triage (ATT) scoring system was devised to provide stratification of veterinary trauma patient populations based upon severity of injury. A retrospective population of 101 trauma patients and a prospective population of 88 patients were used to evaluate the predictive power of the ATT scoring system for survival seven days after initial presentation of the emergency service. In Both groups, the mean ATT score for survivors was significantly lower than the mean ATT score for non-survivors. In a logistic regression mode, the ATT score was found to be a significant predictor of the likelihood of survival seven days after initial presentation for both populartions. Each point increase in the ATT score resulted in a 2.3?2.6 times decreased likelihood of survival. The ATT scoring system is a useful objective classification scheme for predicting the likelihood to survive a traumatic incident and can serve as prototype for severity of injuroy scoring systems for the veterinary trauma patient.

AB  - As with all areas of medicine, high-quality clinical research is essential to improving the care of trauma patients. This research is crucial in developing evidence-based treatments that decrease cost, decrease morbidity, and improve mortality. Trauma continues to extract a significant toll on society and is the single largest cause of years of life lost in the United States. The need to conduct high-quality clinical research in trauma is not disputed. However, significant challenges and barriers unique to the field of trauma make performing this research more difficult. It is critical to be aware of these challenges and barriers to performing clinical research involving trauma patients so these challenges can be accounted for and solutions implemented to minimize their impact on research. This review will focus on the barriers and challenges that are encountered while performing clinical research in trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background The rate of hospitalization in elderly patients because of falls is increasing. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term trends in injury profiles of low-energy falls and to identify injuries associated with need for in-patient rehabilitation. Methods A single-centre retrospective study was performed at an inner city Major Trauma Centre in Sydney. Trauma registry data were obtained from patients who were 65 years of age or over with low-energy falls (trip and fall from height ≤1?m, including falls from standing) from the trauma registry between January 2000 and December 2011. Demographic data, time and date of presentation and injury characteristics were collected. Outcomes of interests were proportions of hip fractures, head injuries and discharge to in-patient rehabilitation facilities. Results A total of 4964 cases were identified. There was a 6.5% per annum decrease in the proportion of elderly patients with low-energy falls who sustained hip fractures compared with a relative increase in severe head injuries, 5.7% per annum. Around 25% of patients were transferred to in-patient rehabilitation. Severe head injuries and lower-limb injuries were the two injuries most associated with transfer to in-patient rehabilitation. Conclusion In elderly patients with low-energy falls, a significant decrease in hip fractures was associated with a rise in severe head injuries over the past decade.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - Objectives To analyse the contemporary management of renal injuries in a UK major trauma centre and to evaluate the utility and value of re-imaging. Patients and methods The prospectively maintained ?Trauma Audit and Research Network? database was interrogated to identify patients with urinary tract injuries between January 2014 and December 2017. Patients? records and imaging were reviewed to identify injury grades, interventions, outcomes, and follow-up. Results Renal injury was identified in 90 patients (79 males and 11 females). The mean (sd; range) age was 35.5 (17.4; 1.5?94) years. Most of the renal traumas were caused by blunt mechanisms (74%). The overall severity of injuries was: 18 (20%) Grade I, 19 (21%) Grade II, 27 (30%) Grade III, 22 (24%) Grade IV, and four (4%) Grade V. Most patients (84%) were managed conservatively. Early intervention (<24 h) was performed in 14 patients (16%) for renal injuries. Most of these patients were managed by interventional radiology techniques (nine of 14). Only two patients required an emergency nephrectomy, both of whom died from extensive polytrauma. In all, 19 patients underwent laparotomy for other injuries and did not require renal exploration. The overall 30-day mortality was 13%. Re-imaging was performed in 66% of patients at an average time of 3.4 days from initial scan. The majority of re-imaging was planned (49 patients) and 12% of these scans demonstrated a relevant finding (urinoma, pseudoaneurysm) that altered management in three of the 49 patients (6.1%). Conclusion Non-operative management is the mainstay for all grades of injury. Haemodynamic instability and persistent urine leak are primary indications for intervention. Open surgical management is uncommon. Repeat imaging after injury is advocated for stable patients with high-grade renal injuries (Grade III?V), although more research is needed to determine the optimal timing.

AB  - Abstract Objective School mental health workers are ideally placed to respond to student trauma based on their mental health expertise and the impact of childhood trauma on learning, classroom behaviour, and school relationships. The current study aimed to explore the experiences, and support and training needs of school mental health workers regarding student trauma. Method Thirteen school mental health workers, including school counsellors and wellbeing staff, participated in semi-structured interviews and their responses were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Although participants identified helpful factors, such as consistency in routines and procedural support from colleagues, the most prominent themes in participants? narratives reflected the challenges of providing optimal training for staff, and support to students and staff regarding student traumatic exposure. Conclusions The findings suggest a need for further research regarding the development and ongoing implementation of multi-tiered trauma-informed support, training practices and protocols for school staff and school mental health workers.

AB  - Abstract Individuals with spinal cord injury are at risk of sacral pressure ulcers due to, among other reasons, prolonged immobilisation. The effectiveness of a multi-layer foam dressing installed pre-operatively in reducing sacral pressure ulcer occurrence in spinal cord injured patients was compared to that of using a gel mattress, and stratified analyses were performed on patients with complete tetraplegia and paraplegia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from 315 patients admitted in a level-I trauma centre following a spinal cord injury between April 2010 and March 2016. Upon arrival to the emergency room and until surgery, patients were transferred on a foam stretcher pad with a viscoelastic polymer gel mattress (before 1 October 2014) or received a multi-layer foam dressing applied to their sacral-coccygeal area (after 1 October 2014). The occurrence of sacral pressure ulcer during acute hospitalisation was similar irrespective of whether patients received the dressing or the gel mattress. It was found that 82% of patients with complete tetraplegia receiving the preventive dressing developed sacral ulcers as compared to only 36% of patients using the gel mattress. Although multi-layer dressings were suggested to improve skin protection and decrease pressure ulcer occurrence in critically ill patients, such preventive dressings are not superior to gel mattresses in spinal cord injured patients and should be used with precaution, especially in complete tetraplegia.

AB  - Severely injured patients are at a risk of acute traumatic coagulopathy contributing to high mortally rates. The early use of tranexamic acid in this setting has been shown to be safe and improves survival. Optimal FFP: Red cell ratios needed with respect to outcomes are yet to be defined. Slow turnaround times associated with the use of laboratory based coagulation testing can lead to delays in appropriate component support with a need for validated algorithms for near patient global tests of haemostasis. Multidisciplinary protocols are required for managing traumatic haemorrhage with emphasis on good communication supported by training, audit and on-going review of cases to optimise patient care.
