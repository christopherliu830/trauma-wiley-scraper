AB  - Abstract This is a population-based prospective study to identify the long-term outcome of children with inflicted traumatic brain injury (ITBI). Twenty-two survivors were identified and followed up. Only 2 of 22 had no developmental problems at follow-up, 20 of 22 children were having different developmental problems, among them 3 of 22 were severely handicapped. Psychological tests passed 17 of 22, 5 did not pass due to severe handicap (3 children) or were too young (2 patients). Epilepsy was found in 7 of 22, being intractable in 3 cases. Serious motor problems were identified in 5 of 22. Ophthalmologic problems were found in 4 of 22. The most important predictor of adverse outcome was young age at the time of the insult. Conclusion: the outcome of these potentially healthy children is poor. The key question is prevention. Health care professionals should be more concerned about these problems.

AB  - Abstract In the last two decades it has become apparent that thrombin has many extravascular effects that are mediated by a family of protease-activated receptors (PARs). PAR-1, -3 and -4 are activated via cleavage by thrombin. The importance of extravascular thrombin in modulating ischemic, hemorrhagic and traumatic injury in brain has recently become clear. Thus, in?vitro, thrombin at low concentration protects neurons and astrocytes from cell death caused by a number of different insults. In?vivo, pretreating the brain with a low dose of thrombin (thrombin preconditioning), attenuates the brain injury induced by a large dose of thrombin, an intracerebral hemorrhage or by focal cerebral ischemia. Thrombin may also be an important mediator of ischemic preconditioning. In contrast, high doses of thrombin kill neurons and astrocytes in?vitro and cause disruption of the blood?brain barrier, brain edema and seizures in?vivo. This review examines the role of thrombin in brain injury and the molecular mechanisms and signaling cascades involved.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was to explore the degree (and type) of burnout and trauma symptoms, personal histories and coping strategies retrospectively reported by those who work with maltreated children and their families. A self-selected sample of workers (N = 44) completed a self-report questionnaire assessing childhood maltreatment, family background characteristics, current adjustment, coping strategies and burnout. Workers reported high levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, and a low to moderate sense of personal accomplishment. Family background characteristics predicted the occurrence of maltreatment and current adjustment, and a personal history of maltreatment predicted current trauma symptoms, but not burnout. Workers most frequently used problem-focused coping strategies and sought social support; however, coping strategies were not associated with the level of either trauma symptoms or burnout. Despite employing positive coping strategies, their efficacy may be affected by other interpersonal, intra-individual and job resource issues. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - Objectives Following a paediatric burn, parents commonly experience high levels of acute psychological distress, which has been shown to increase child psychological distress as well as child procedural distress. The influence of psychological stress and perceived pain on wound healing has been demonstrated in several laboratory and medical populations. This paper investigates the influence of parental acute psychological distress and procedural behaviour on the child's rate of re-epithelialization, after controlling for child procedural distress. Design A prospective observational study with longitudinal outcome. Methods Eighty-three parents of children 1?6 years old reported acute psychological distress (post-traumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], guilt, pre-procedural fear, general anxiety/depression symptoms) in relation to their child's burn. A researcher observed parent?child behaviour at the first dressing change, and parents and nurses reported child procedural distress (pre-, peak-, and post-procedural pain and fear). These variables, along with demographic and injury information, were tested for predicting time to re-epithelialization. Date of re-epithelialization was determined by the treating consultant. Results Days to re-epithelialization ranged from 3 to 35 days post-injury. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis found wound depth and size significantly accounted for 28% of the variance in time to re-epithelialization. In Block 2, child peak-procedural pain significantly accounted for 6% additional variance. In Block 3, parental PTSS significantly accounted for 5% additional variance. Conclusions Parental PTSS appears to be an important but under-recognized factor that may influence their child's burn re-epithelialization. Further investigation is required to understand the mechanisms contributing to this association. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Psychological stress delays wound healing, and this relationship has been found in paediatric burn populations with procedural pain. Parental psychological stress is often present after a child's burn and is related to the child's procedural coping and distress. What does this study add? Parental post-traumatic stress is related to delayed child burn re-epithelialization. This association is in addition to procedural pain delaying re-epithelialization.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if phenytoin protein binding and metabolism were altered in prepubescent pediatric patients within the first 10 days following severe, acute traumatic brain injury. Patients (n = 10) received phenytoin loading doses (15?20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance regimen (7 mg/kg/day) initiated within 12 hours of the loading dose. Phenytoin serum concentrations were measured serially on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 at 1, 6, and 12 hours. Time-invariant and time-variant Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetic models were fit to the unbound phenytoin concentration-time data (ADAPT II?). Albumin concentrations significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001) and were predictive of the phenytoin binding ratio (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.0001). The time-variant model provided a superior fit of the data in 7 patients with no difference between models in 3 patients. Rapid inhibition of metabolism (Vmaxbaseline = 2.82 ± 2.35 mg/kg/day) was observed initially following injury. This was followed by induction of metabolism as reflected by a Vmaxinduced of 20.79 ± 13.71 mg/kg/day, which was approximately twofold higher than reported values for nonstressed children. Children with severe, acute neurotrauma were found to have markedly altered protein binding and phenytoin metabolism.

AB  - Background:? A growing number of studies indicate that low income, African American men and women living in urban environments are at high risk for trauma exposure, which may have intergenerational effects. The current study employed psychophysiological methods to describe biomarkers of anxiety in children of traumatized mothers. Methods:? Study participants were recruited from a highly traumatized urban population, comprising mother?child pairs (n?=?36) that included school-age children. Mothers were assessed for childhood abuse with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, as well as symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The children were measured for dark-enhanced startle responses and heart-rate variability. Results:? Dark-enhanced startle was found to be higher in children whose mothers had high levels of childhood physical abuse, as compared to children whose mothers had low levels of physical abuse. During the habituation phase of the startle experiment, children whose mothers had high levels of childhood emotional abuse had higher sympathetic system activation compared to children of mothers with low emotional abuse. These effects remained significant after accounting for maternal symptoms of PTSD and depression, as well as for the child?s trauma exposure. Conclusion:? These results demonstrate that children of mothers who have history of childhood physical and emotional abuse have higher dark-enhanced startle as well as greater sympathetic nervous system activation than children of mothers who do not report a history of childhood physical and emotional abuse, and emphasize the utility of physiological measures as pervasive biomarkers of psychopathology that can easily be measured in children.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the influence of supracondylar femoral derotation osteotomy (FDO) on hip abduction muscle force and frontal hip moments in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Method For this retrospective cohort study 79 children (36 females, 43 males; mean age at surgery 11y [SD 3y]; range 4?17y) with bilateral cerebral palsy and preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively documented frontal hip moments who received supracondylar FDO in 134 limbs were included. The control group consisted of eight children (two females, six males; mean age 11y [SD 4y]; range 5?17y) who received single-event multi-level surgery without FDO. Results Hip joint impulse (p<0.001) and the first peak of frontal hip moments (p=0.003) increased, whereas the second peak decreased (p<0.001) from preoperatively to postoperatively. Hip abductor strength improved (p=0.001) from preoperatively to postoperatively. Interpretation Despite the compensatory mechanism, frontal hip moments are decreased preoperatively. Supracondylar FDO results in increased frontal hip moments. Changes in anteversion directly influence hip kinetics, although no direct change of the proximal bony geometry is performed. What this paper adds Internal rotation gait cannot fully restore the frontal hip moment. Supracondylar femoral derotation osteotomy (FDO) influences frontal hip kinetics in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Supracondylar FDO changes the curve progression of frontal hip moments. Supracondylar FDO restores the hip abductor moment arm. Supracondylar FDO leads to an increase in hip abductor muscle force.

AB  - Abstract Background:? To assess pediatric bicycle-related traumatization in view of types of injuries, incidence and modes of prevention. Methods:? Retrospective study of pediatric cases admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of a university-affiliated level II trauma hospital in Israel over 12 consecutive years. Results:? Forty-six patients (three girls, 43 boys) with bicycle-related injuries formed 1% of the total pediatric intensive care unit admissions during the study period. The number of patients with bicycle-related injuries increased significantly during recent years (1996?2001 vs 2002?07: P= 0.003). Most of the cases presented abdominal injuries (54.4%) followed by head (32.6%) and chest (13%) injuries. The median age of patients with abdominal trauma was significantly lower in comparison to patients with other types of injuries (P= 0.002). Abdominal cases required longer hospitalization compared with other patients (P= 0.003). Falling from a bicycle was the main mechanism of injury in abdominal cases (88%) (P= 0.003). Motor vehicle impacts were the main mechanism of injury in patients with head (60%) and chest (66.6%) trauma. Conclusion:? The incidence of severe bicycle-related injuries requiring intensive care hospitalization is increasing and abdominal trauma forms the main portion of those injuries. We suggest introducing a trunk-protective measure for young bicyclists. Exact information on the mechanism of the injury is important for evaluating the injured patient more accurately.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Objective Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is the most commonly employed surgical technique for treating cervical spondylosis. Although autologous bone grafts are considered the gold standard in achieving fusion, associated short- and long-term morbidities have led to a search for alternative materials. These have included carbon-fiber, titanium alloy (Ti) and ceramic and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) based implants. Recent attempts to optimize cage implants through using composite designs have combined Ti and PEEK. However, there are few published reports on the clinical and radiological outcomes of commercially available composite cages. Our study aimed to provide and evaluate initial outcomes of a composite Ti/PEEK cage. Methods In this prospective single senior surgeon cohort study, 31 consecutive patients underwent a modified Smith?Robinson technique under general anesthesia and relevant data were collected. The study patients were aged between 18 and 75 years and underwent surgery from November 2013 to May 2014. Indications for surgery included traumatic and degenerative cervical disease that was unsuitable for or unresponsive to conservative management. All cages were between 5 and 8 mm and packed with super critical fluid sterilized allograft and bone marrow aspirate before insertion. Patients were followed-up for a minimum of 12 months. Fusion was assessed using fine cut CT and anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Clinical outcomes were measured using a Visual Analogue Scale, Neck Oswestry Disability Index and Patient's Satisfaction Index. Results Six of the original cohort were unavailable for adequate follow-up. The remaining 25 patients (17 men, 8 women; 33 operative levels) were observed for a mean of 14.6 months (range, 12?16 months). All operation levels were between C4 and C7. Single-level operations were performed in 19 patients and additional plating in 14 patients. A fusion rate of 96% was achieved. Patients in both plated and non-plated groups experienced statistically significant improvements; good to excellent outcomes being seen in 92% of patients. There was one complication, namely recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, which had partially resolved at 6 months follow-up. Conclusion The present study shows that enhancement of PEEK cages with Ti endplates is a safe and effective treatment with the potential for early osseointegration and early radiological evidence of fusion.

Methods From July 2004 to February 2007, 29 consecutive patients (mean age, 22.8 years; range, 20?43 years) with blunt scrotal trauma who underwent scrotal sonography were enrolled. Ten ruptured testes and 6 intact testes were confirmed by surgery, and an additional 13 intact testes were confirmed by a physical examination. The sonographic findings were recorded with respect to contour irregularity, the presence of intratesticular and extratesticular heterogeneous echoes, loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography, and engorgement of the pampiniform plexus by consensus between 2 radiologists. The sonographic findings used to diagnose testicular rupture were analyzed by the Fisher exact test, and significant predictors were determined by multiple regression analysis. Results The ruptured testes showed contour irregularity (P = .0002), a heterogeneous intratesticular echo pattern (P = .0077), and loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography (P = .0093). Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus was seen in most nonruptured testes (P = .0178). Contour irregularity was the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture (P = .0002). On the basis of this single predictor, diagnostic predictive values for sonography were calculated; the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all 90%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 82% and 94%, respectively. Conclusions Among the useful sonographic criteria, contour irregularity is the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma.

AB  - Abstract An inquiry into child welfare protective services workers? perceptions and experiences in the United States was conducted in order to examine their perceptions of crisis and crisis intervention, and the emotional impact of working with children who endured significant maltreatment. As there is presently little research that has explored these issues specifically from the point of view of the workers, a qualitative grounded theory approach was utilized. Four themes emerged from the data: workers perceived crisis as a result of biopsychosocial breakdown; workers routinely triage when faced with crises; workers are subject to vicarious traumatization; and workers? personal lives are affected by their work. The findings add to an existing body of knowledge about secondary trauma in child welfare by providing information about the investigative workers? subjective experience of it. This research adds a unique contribution to understanding workers? subjective experience of crisis on the job, how it manifests, and whether they feel knowledgeable in the area of crisis intervention.

AB  - Objectives The current study examined whether various types of rumination are distinguishable and the effects of personal growth initiative (PGI) on posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress, and depression through adaptive and maladaptive rumination. Method Sample included 292 college students who experienced a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Results Intrusive and deliberative rumination were found to be distinct factors. However, brooding and reflection, thought to be separate aspects of depression, were a single factor. PGI was positively associated with growth and negatively associated with depression for both genders, and a negative relationship was found between PGI and posttraumatic stress among women. Indirect effects of PGI were found on posttraumatic stress and growth through different forms of rumination. These relations did not change after including the covariates (i.e., time since the trauma, direct exposure, and intentional harm). Conclusion The study provides new insight integrating rumination from the depression literature in the context of trauma and a potential benefit in applying PGI in alleviating pathology after a PTE and facilitating growth.

AB  - In this single case study, I will address the question of how incestuous sexual abuse causes doubt of three distinct types: (1) honest doubt that is essential to the pursuit of knowledge; (2) inherent doubt that can result from a trauma that leaves the victim's mind fragmented and confused; and (3) the sadistic imposition of doubt intended to deceive, disorient and attack unbearable knowledge in the victim or another person familiar with the abuse (in this case, the analyst and the victim's later victims). During the course of my psychoanalysis of a paedophile, it became clear that this third form of doubt played an integral role in the patient's sexual abuse of children, a role I will link to the nature and function of paedophilia and to the experience of working psychoanalytically with a paedophile.

AB  - Part 2: Goal Directed Resuscitation ? Which Goals? Perfusion Targets will follow in the next issue. Abstract The use of appropriate resuscitation targets or end-points may facilitate early detection and appropriate management of shock. There is a fine balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, and when this is perturbed, an oxygen debt is generated. In this narrative review, we explore the value of global haemodynamic resuscitation end-points, including pulse rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure and mixed/central venous oxygen saturations. The evidence supporting the reliability of these parameters as end-points for guiding resuscitation and their potential limitations are evaluated.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical staff in EDs are subject to a range of stressors. The objective of this study was to describe and compare clinical staff perceptions of their ED?s working environment across two different Australian EDs. Methods This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, research design that included distribution of three survey tools to clinical staff in two Australian EDs in 2016. Descriptive statistics were reported to characterise workplace stressors, coping styles and the ED environment. These data were compared by hospital and the employee?s clinical role (nurse or physician). Results In total, 146 ED nurses and doctors completed the survey (response rate: 67%). Despite geographical variation, the staff at the two locations had similar demographic profiles in terms of age, sex and years of experience. Staff reported moderate levels of workload and self-realisation but low levels of conflict or nervousness in the workplace. Nurses and physicians reported similar perceptions of the work environment, although nurses reported slightly higher median levels of workload. Staff rated the death or sexual abuse of a child as most stressful, followed by workplace violence and heavy workload. Staff used a large range of coping strategies, and these were similar across both sites. Conclusion These findings are the first multi-site and multidisciplinary examinations of Australian ED staff perceptions, improving our understanding of staff stressors and coping strategies and highlighting similarities across different EDs. These data support the development and implementation of strategies to improve ED working environments to help ensure professional longevity of ED staff.

AB  - Abstract In hospitalized patients, lipid emulsions are an integral part of balanced parenteral nutrition. Traditionally, a single lipid source, soybean oil, has been given to patients and was usually regarded as just a source of energy and to prevent essential fatty-acid deficiency. However, mixtures of different lipid emulsions have now become widely available, including mixtures of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Fish oil is high in the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is a growing body of evidence that these ?-3 fatty acids can exert beneficial immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and inflammation-resolution effects across a wide range of patient groups including surgical, cancer, and critically ill patients. At least in part, these effects are realized via potent specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). Moreover, parenteral nutrition including ?-3 fatty acids can result in additional clinical benefits over the use of standard lipid emulsions, such as reductions in infection rates and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Clinical and experimental evidence is reviewed regarding lipid emulsion use in a variety of hospitalized patient groups, including surgical, critically ill, sepsis, trauma, and acute pancreatitis patients. Practical aspects of lipid emulsion use in critically ill patients are also considered, such as how to determine and fulfill energy expenditure, how and when to consider parenteral nutrition, duration of infusion, and safety monitoring.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the population-based incidence and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalised traumatic brain injury (TBI) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods: One-year statewide hospital admission data from the NSW Department of Health were analysed. TBI cases were identified using a combination of TBI-related diagnostic and external cause codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10th Revision). Sociodemographics, causes, associated factors, severity and medical details of hospitalisation were examined. Results: There were 6,827 hospitalised TBI cases that met review criteria. Incidence rate was 99.1/100,000 population. Incidence in persons older than 75 years of age and residents in remote areas was three times higher. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were 1.7 times more likely to sustain a TBI than the general population, and risk was greater for all NSW residents from areas that were remote and disadvantaged-socioeconomically. Older adults and those with severe injuries showed prolonged hospitalisation, higher morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: Overall TBI incidence in NSW is lower than international estimates. Nevertheless, groups with higher incidence rates and/or poor in-hospital outcomes were identified, highlighting directions for prevention and future research. Implications for public health: There is a need for identifying risk factors/barriers and assessing the impact of recent policies on these population groups.
