AB  - Abstract In hospitalized patients, lipid emulsions are an integral part of balanced parenteral nutrition. Traditionally, a single lipid source, soybean oil, has been given to patients and was usually regarded as just a source of energy and to prevent essential fatty-acid deficiency. However, mixtures of different lipid emulsions have now become widely available, including mixtures of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Fish oil is high in the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is a growing body of evidence that these ?-3 fatty acids can exert beneficial immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and inflammation-resolution effects across a wide range of patient groups including surgical, cancer, and critically ill patients. At least in part, these effects are realized via potent specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). Moreover, parenteral nutrition including ?-3 fatty acids can result in additional clinical benefits over the use of standard lipid emulsions, such as reductions in infection rates and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Clinical and experimental evidence is reviewed regarding lipid emulsion use in a variety of hospitalized patient groups, including surgical, critically ill, sepsis, trauma, and acute pancreatitis patients. Practical aspects of lipid emulsion use in critically ill patients are also considered, such as how to determine and fulfill energy expenditure, how and when to consider parenteral nutrition, duration of infusion, and safety monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To describe the presentation, diagnosis, cause, complications and outcome in 14 dogs that presented with a parotid sialocoele and that were treated by complete parotidectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-institutional retrospective study. RESULTS Each dog presented with a non-painful, fluctuant, soft tissue mass over the lateral aspect of the face in the region of the parotid salivary gland. Diagnosis was made by sialoradiography (3/14), CT (3/14), ultrasound (11/14) and MRI (2/14). The cause of the sialocoele could be determined in 8 of 14 patients and included: foreign body (2/14), sialolithiasis (1/14), neoplasia (3/14), salivary gland lipomatosis (1/14) and trauma (1/14). Treatment incurred one anaesthetic complication (regurgitation) and seven postoperative surgical complications [self-limiting seroma formation (2/14), haemorrhage (1/14), wound dehiscence (1/14), abscessation 7 months postoperatively (1/14) and facial nerve paralysis (2/14)]. Sialocoele did not recur in any dog during a median follow-up time of 14 months. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Parotidectomy has been considered a technically challenging procedure but can have a good success rate with long-term resolution of the clinical symptoms. Intra- and postoperative complications are reasonably common.

AB  - Abstract Haemodynamic targets, such as cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure and central venous oxygen saturations, remain crude predictors of tissue perfusion and oxygen supply at a cellular level. Shocked patients may appear adequately resuscitated based on normalization of global vital signs, yet they are still experiencing occult hypoperfusion. If targeted resuscitation is employed, appropriate use of end-points is critical. In this review, we consider the value of directing resuscitation at the microcirculation or cellular level. Current technologies available include sublingual capnometry, video microscopy of the microcirculation and near-infrared spectroscopy providing a measure of tissue oxygenation, whereas base deficit and lactate potentially provide a surrogate measure of the adequacy of global perfusion. The methodology and evidence for these technologies guiding resuscitation are considered in this narrative review.

AB  - Background:? The results of intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures from Australian institutions have not been widely reported. This study examines a consecutive group of patients treated at a major metropolitan trauma centre and reports on the injury statistics and outcome data, and compares this to previously reported results from the literature. Methods:? A total of 101 fractures in 97 consecutive adult patients were included in the study. Nine patients were excluded. At a minimum of 6?months post injury, 54 patients were interviewed by telephone and 35 patients presented for clinical review and underwent physical examination, computed tomography (CT) scanogram of the lower limbs and Short Form 36 questionnaires. Results:? Road trauma accounted for 81% of injuries and 15% of fractures were open. Of the 54 patients reviewed, 13 (23%) required further surgery for delayed or non-union. Of the 35 who presented for physical examination, there was poor correlation between perceived leg length discrepancy and measured leg length discrepancy on examination or scanogram. Presence of a limp correlated with measured leg length discrepancy of more than 1?cm but did not correlate with rotational abnormality measured on CT scanogram. Pain at the hip, thigh or knee was present in 60% of patients. The Short Form 36 scores for physical functioning, role ? physical, bodily pain, general health and vitality were all significantly lower than population norms with P values ranging from <0.001?0.05. Subgroup analysis comparing isolated femur fracture to multi-trauma patients for all five of these parameters revealed significant differences only in the multi-trauma group. Conclusion:? The incidence of pain, limp, leg length discrepancy and delayed or non-union is higher in this study than in previously reported results of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures. This may be due to differences in the patient population, the skill level of the operating surgeon, or incomplete follow up.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the extent that acute asthma is inappropriately treated with antibiotics in Japanese emergency departments (EDs). Objectives: We examined the proportion and predictors of inappropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute asthma in the Japanese EDs. Methods: We conducted a chart review study in 23 Japanese EDs. Subjects were ED patients aged 18 to 54 years with acute asthma between 2009 and 2011. To examine predictors of inappropriate antibiotic use, we performed multi-level logistic regression analysis at both the patient- and ED-level modeling EDs as a random variable. Results: Among 1380 patients in the overall study, the analytic cohort comprised 1311 patients. Overall, antibiotics were inappropriately prescribed for 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4%?5.7%). In the multi-level logistic regression analysis, higher annual ED asthma visit volume was significantly associated with a lower proportion of inappropriate antibiotic use (odds ratio per 100-visit increase, 0.3 ; 95%CI, 0.2?0.6). Conclusions: In this large multicenter study in Japan, we found that approximately 4% of ED patients with acute asthma were inappropriately treated with antibiotics. We also demonstrated that the inappropriate use of antibiotics largely differed across the EDs and was less common in EDs with a more annual ED asthma visits. Organized knowledge translation initiatives are warranted to address this gap in emergency asthma care.

AB  - People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to extreme weather in unique ways. The entrenched inequalities that underpin disaster vulnerability are compounded by extreme isolation and the stress of transient living on mental and physical health. However, the impacts of extreme weather on the homeless in Australia are largely undocumented and rarely incorporated in emergency planning. Interviews with and surveys of emergency and homeless services and service users revealed that the primary ramifications of losing shelter and worsening mental health deepen the cycle of homelessness and trauma. Consequently, homeless shelter losses, such as tents, should be included in pre- and post-event impact statistics and subsequent recovery support. Extreme weather response plans should include early triggers and strategies for ?non-severe? weather events, as the homeless community is affected earlier and by a wider range of meteorological conditions. Moreover, this study also explores the benefits of a trauma-informed response to extreme weather when working with the homeless.

AB  - Abstract The concept of freestanding EDs is a popular operational model of emergency care in the USA. This model has been described as an emergency physician-created innovative solution in resolving ongoing overcrowding issues in EDs. A decentralised community-based emergency care model may be a solution to meet the increasing demand for emergency and unscheduled acute care in Australia. It may also help to reduce the number of acute hospital admissions through EDs. The aim of freestanding EDs should be to manage and discharge a cohort of patients, mainly in Australasian Triage Scale 3 and 4 categories, currently seen in hospital-based EDs. This article briefly examines the potential merits and issues if this concept is considered in Australia. It also provides an early proposed model for such EDs.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.

AB  - Emergency medical teams (EMTs) have provided surgical care in sudden-onset disasters in low- and middle-income countries. General surgeons have been heavily involved in many EMTs due to their traditional broad set of surgical skills and experience. With the increased subspecialization of general surgical training in many high-income countries, including Australia and New Zealand, finding general surgeons with adequately broad experience is becoming more challenging. Furthermore, it is now considered standard for EMTs deploying to a sudden-onset disaster to have undergone credentialing, demonstrating sufficient training of their deployed members. The purpose of this review was to highlight the challenges and potential solutions facing those involved in training and recruiting general surgeons for EMTs in Australasia.

AB  - Summary The transition of care for adolescents and young adults from a pediatric, family-centered model to an adult, patient-centered model marks an important milestone in the lives of patients with chronic disorders managed from a young age. The timing and tempo of transition require special consideration to physical, psychological and social changes occurring during young adulthood. Poor glycemic control is a common finding among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and places these young adults at increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, knowledge that should alert clinicians to carefully manage diabetes during concurrent acute illnesses. Other chronic endocrine disorders, such as primary adrenal deficiencies, congenital or autoimmune hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and hypopituitarism may follow a similar model of care. In addition to continued management of existing defects, patients with disorders such as autoimmune polyglandular syndromes will require continued surveillance for manifestations of new endocrinopathies through adulthood. The onset of adrenal insufficiency with adrenoleukodystrophy, x-linked adrenal hypoplasia and triple A syndrome is variable and patients may present in adrenal crisis as the initial manifestation of adrenal insufficiency during an acute illness. Endocrine causes account for a high proportion of cases of secondary hypertension, including acute onset of hypertension due to hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytomas, ganglioneuromas, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperthyroidism. Head trauma is common in young adults associated with risky behaviors and motor vehicle accidents. Patients with traumatic brain injuries are at risk for developing anterior and posterior pituitary defects. This chapter discusses transitional care of diabetes and chronic and evolving endocrine disorders, as well as the management, including emergency care, of endocrine disorders that commonly present in young adulthood.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the association between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and combat exposure with the socioeconomic status of 2210 male monozygotic veteran twin pairs in 1987. In the unadjusted analysis on individuals, modest correlations indicated that those with PTSD were more likely to have been divorced, and less likely to be currently employed or to achieve high status in income, education or occupation. In the crude analysis of veterans not suffering from PTSD, there were small positive correlations between combat level experienced and the likelihood of ever being married, ever being divorced, and the number of years employed at the current job. However, when we examined identical twins discordant for PTSD, and adjusted for pre-military and military service factors, only unemployment remained significant. Likewise, in combat-discordant twins, no significant effects on the socioeconomic indicators were seen. We conclude that PTSD and combat experience in Southeast Asia have not had a major impact on the socioeconomic status of veterans.

AB  - Abstract Maltreatment of children is a major public-health and social-welfare problem but socio-demographic variability has received little attention. This work addresses such variability in a general population cohort and associations with depression. Analyses were based on the cross-sectional SHIP-LEGEND examination among 2265 adults (29?89 years). Childhood maltreatment was multi-dimensionally assessed with the German 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ): emotional neglect; emotional abuse; physical neglect; physical abuse; sexual abuse. Non-linear associations between CTQ responses and age were assessed with fractional polynomials and cubic splines. Scale properties were analysed with confirmatory factor analyses and item response models. Associations between childhood maltreatment domains and depression [Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)] were assessed. The majority (58.9%) reported events indicative of at least mild levels of childhood maltreatment. CTQ subscales showed characteristically different non-linear associations to age across the five studied domains, indicating methodological issues like recall bias and the influence of seminal events. Psychometric scale properties were acceptable to good for all subscales except for physical neglect. Associations to depression measures varied systematically across socio-demographic strata. We conclude that socio-demographic variability is a major issue when studying self-reported childhood maltreatment in a community sample. This needs to be taken into account for the study of associations to psychiatric key outcomes. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are rarely due to fungal agents and if so they are mainly caused by Candida strains. This case represents a PJI caused by a multi-drug resistant Pseudallescheria apiosperma, with poor in vivo response to itraconazole and voriconazole. This case differs also by the way of infection, since the joint infection did not follow a penetrating trauma. In the majority of cases, Scedosporium extremity infections remain local in immunocompetent individuals. We report a persistent joint infection with multiple therapeutic failures, and subsequent amputation of the left leg. Detailed clinical data, patient history, treatment regime and outcome of a very long-lasting (>4?years) P. apiosperma prosthetic knee infection in an immunocompetent, 61-year-old male patient are presented with this case. The patient was finally cured by the combination of multiple and extensive surgical interventions and prolonged antifungal combination therapy with voriconazole and terbinafine.

AB  - Abstract: This study investigated family factors and processes involved in Bosnian refugees engaging in multiple-family support and education groups in Chicago. Families that engaged experienced more transitions, more traumas, and more difficulties in adjustment. Engagement strategies for multiple-family groups should correspond with the underlying family processes by which refugee families manage transitions, traumas, and adjustment difficulties.

AB  - Summary We here report the results of a programme of AMS dating and stable isotope analysis on human remains from the chambered tomb of Le Déhus, Guernsey. An early use-phase in the range 4100?3900 BC is indicated, confirming the monument's attribution to the Middle Neolithic II as defined in western France. Late Neolithic burial activity is also identified. Stable carbon isotope measurements provide little or no evidence for the consumption of marine foods, although stable nitrogen isotope values are unusually high. These results are situated in the wider context of Neolithic mortuary monuments of the Channel Islands and Normandy.

AB  - Abstract Implant-related infections are often devastating situations in orthopaedic trauma surgery particularly if multiresistant bacteria are involved. Protection of the implant surface by an antimicrobial coating exhibiting activity against multiresistant bacterial strains is of high interest. Aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of an Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating for fracture fixation devices, such as nails, plates, and external fixators, including tests against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its biocompatibility. The antimicrobial activity of the coating deposited onto 12 ? 3 mm2 stainless steel implants was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and MRSA using different testing methods (ASTM E-2810, JIS Z 2801, proliferation assay). Additionally, the coated devices were implanted into the paravertebral muscle of rabbits and explanted after 2, 7, 14, and 28 days to test the remaining ex vivo antimicrobial activity. For biocompatibility assessment the Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating was tested in vitro according to ISO 10993-5. The Ag/SiOxCy coating exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against all tested bacterial strains in all three in vitro tests. Ex vivo testing proved suppression of more than 99.9 % of bacterial proliferation by the coating compared to non-coated samples even after 28 days. ISO 10993-5 showed good biocompatibility of the coating without any indications of cytotoxic effects. In summary, Ag/SiOxCy plasma polymer coating showed excellent antimicrobial activity including effectiveness against MRSA and good in vitro biocompatibility. Therefore, it possesses high potential as a prophylactic agent in orthopaedic trauma surgery. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 2010.

AB  - Abstract Susceptibility to PTSD is determined by both genes and environment. Similarly, gene-expression levels in peripheral blood are influenced by both genes and environment, and expression levels of many genes show good correspondence between peripheral blood and brain. Therefore, our objectives were to test the following hypotheses: (1) pre-trauma expression levels of a gene subset (particularly immune-system genes) in peripheral blood would differ between trauma-exposed Marines who later developed PTSD and those who did not; (2) a predictive biomarker panel of the eventual emergence of PTSD among high-risk individuals could be developed based on gene expression in readily assessable peripheral blood cells; and (3) a predictive panel based on expression of individual exons would surpass the accuracy of a model based on expression of full-length gene transcripts. Gene-expression levels were assayed in peripheral blood samples from 50 U.S. Marines (25 eventual PTSD cases and 25 non-PTSD comparison subjects) prior to their deployment overseas to war-zones in Iraq or Afghanistan. The panel of biomarkers dysregulated in peripheral blood cells of eventual PTSD cases prior to deployment was significantly enriched for immune genes, achieved 70% prediction accuracy in an independent sample based on the expression of 23 full-length transcripts, and attained 80% accuracy in an independent sample based on the expression of one exon from each of five genes. If the observed profiles of pre-deployment mRNA-expression in eventual PTSD cases can be further refined and replicated, they could suggest avenues for early intervention and prevention among individuals at high risk for trauma exposure. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
