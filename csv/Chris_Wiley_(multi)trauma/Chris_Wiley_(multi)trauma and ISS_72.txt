AB  - Background Child mental health services and related agencies are faced with an increasing challenge in responding to the influx of refugee children around the world. There is strong evidence on the prevalence and complexity of these children's mental health problems and broader needs. Aims To review the research literature on risk and protective factors, and associated mental health interventions for refugee children. Methods Peer-reviewed studies were included for the period 2004?2017; if they included refugee, asylum-seeking or internally displaced children under 18 years; and adopted a quantitative design. Vulnerability and protective factors for refugee children were considered in this context, followed by the respective types of interventions at pre-, peri- and postmigration stage, and across high- and low-/middle-income countries. Eighty-two peer-reviewed studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Results The existing body of literature is largely based on identifying risk factors among children with mental health problems and predominantly designing trauma-focused interventions to reduce their symptomatic distress. Recent research and services have gradually shifted to a broader and dynamic resilience-building approach based on ecological theory, that is at child, family, school, community and societal level. There is increasing evidence for the implementation and effectiveness of multimodal interventions targeting all these levels, despite the methodological constraints in their evaluation. Conclusions In high-income countries, child mental health services need to collaborate with all agencies in contact with refugee children, establish joint care pathways, and integrate trauma-focused interventions with family and community approaches. In low- and middle-income countries, where specialist resources are sparse, resilience-building should aim at maximising and upskilling existing capacity. A six-dimensional psychosocial model that applies to other children who experience complex trauma is proposed.

AB  - Abstract Cell viability is crucial for effective cell-based cartilage repair. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of handling the membrane during matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation surgery on the viability of implanted chondrocytes. Images were acquired under five conditions: (i) Pre-operative; (ii) Handled during surgery; (iii) Cut edge; (iv) Thumb pressure applied; (v) Heavily grasped with forceps. Live and dead cell stains were used. Images were obtained for cell counting and morphology. Mean cell density was 6.60???105 cells/cm2 (5.74?7.11???105) in specimens that did not have significant trauma decreasing significantly in specimens that had been grasped with forceps (p?<?0.001) or cut (p?=?0.004). Cell viability on delivery grade membrane was 75.1%(72.4?77.8%). This dropped to 67.4%(64.1?69.7%) after handling (p?=?0.002), 56.3%(51.5?61.6%) after being thumbed (p?<?0.001) and 28.8%(24.7?31.2%) after crushing with forceps (p?<?0.001). When cut with scissors there was a band of cell death approximately 275?µm in width where cell viability decreased to 13.7%(10.2?18.2%, p?<?0.001). Higher magnification revealed cells without the typical rounded appearance of chondrocytes. We found that confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) can be used to quantify and image the fine morphology of cells on a matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) membrane. Careful handling of the membrane is essential to minimise chondrocyte death during surgery. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 32:1495?1502, 2014.

AB  - Objectives: We devised a method of irradiating a fresh traumatic tattoo with long pulse alexandrite laser in conjunction with the use of a dynamic cooling device (DCD) to minimize the injury of the epidermal layer before the occurrence of pigmentation in the deep layer of the skin, when the wound is not completely epithelialized. Methods: A 4-year-old girl suffered a burn injury and deposition of fuel residues in a diameter of 5?cm on the left cheek by backfire of a motorcycle muffler. The patient was treated with an ointment at a hospital for about 10 days, and then referred to our hospital. On initial visit, removal of foreign bodies was attempted by brushing but with little success. Accordingly, long pulse alexandrite laser treatment was performed four times in total at intervals of about one week. On the initial irradiation DCD was not used, but was used on all subsequent treatments thereafter for the protection of the epidermal layer. Results: Since remarkable pigment reduction was observed after the laser irradiation, the treatment was stopped. Follow-up was performed while the lesion was shielded from light. Conclusion: Since the long pulse alexandrite laser with the DCD conveniently enables continuous irradiation of pigments in a short time while minimizing damage to the epidermis, its therapeutic effect can be expected. However, great care is needed during the treatment to prevent scarring.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the psychological effects of violence and disaster in both adults and children, although much remains to be understood. Siblings of children who have undergone such experiences have been little studied. Such siblings may be bereaved or may experience changes in family circumstances, or may develop psychological sequelae. They may be affected by legal procedures and media coverage. This new understanding of the needs of siblings may have implications for service development, including health and education.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health issue that often causes enduring cognitive deficits, in particular memory dysfunction. The hippocampus, a structure crucial in learning and memory, is frequently damaged during TBI. Since long-term potentiation (LTP) is the leading cellular model underlying learning and memory, this study was undertaken to examine how injury affects area CA1 LTP in mice using lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI). Brain slices derived from FPI animals demonstrated an inability to induce LTP in area CA1 7 days postinjury. However, area CA1 long-term depression could be induced in neurons 7 days postinjury, demonstrating that some forms of synaptic plasticity can still be elicited. Using a multidisciplined approach, potential mechanisms underlying the inability to induce and maintain area CA1 LTP were investigated. This study demonstrates that injury leads to significantly smaller N-methyl-D-aspartate potentials and glutamate-induced excitatory currents, increased dendritic spine size, and decreased expression of α-calcium calmodulin kinase II. These findings may underlie the injury-induced lack of LTP and thus, contribute to cognitive impairments often associated with TBI. Furthermore, these results provide attractive sites for potential therapeutic intervention directed toward alleviating the devastating consequences of human TBI. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods Retrospective cohort study using data from three acute care hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Adult patients admitted from the ED to a non-monitored ward within 8 h. Patients were sub-grouped by EDLOS; EDLOS 3.5?4 h compared to 0?3.5 h and 4?8 h. In-hospital mortality, number of medical emergency team (MET)/cardiac arrest team (CAT) events. Results A total of 24?746 patients were included: 4396 patients with EDLOS <210?min; 4090 patients with EDLOS of 210?240?min; and 16?260 patients with EDLOS >240?min. Mortality overall was 2.2% (n =?545), highest mortality was seen with EDLOS >4 h (2.4%, n =?399) and lowest in patients with EDLOS 3.5?4 h (1.5%, n =?63, OR 0.67 [95% CI: 0.47?0.93, P = 0.02]). Time from bed request to transfer of >240?min was associated with increased odds of death at hospital discharge (adjusted OR 1.39 [95% CI: 1.08?1.78]). There was no difference in rate of MET calls within 24?h between groups (3.5?4 h?=?64 [1.5%], <3.5 h =?60 [1.5%], 4?8 h?=?235 [1.4%]). Conclusions Both shorter time in ED and shorter time between bed request and ward transfer were independently associated with improved outcomes. Whole of hospital measures to reduce length of stay in the ED should focus on shorter ward transfer times after bed request.

AB  - This systematic literature review examined the clinical utility of the construct of self-disgust in understanding mental distress. Specifically, the review assessed whether there is a shared conceptual definition of self-disgust, the face and construct validity of the quantitative assessment measures of self-disgust, and the predictive validity of self-disgust in formulating the development of a range of psychological difficulties. A systematic database search supplemented by manual searches of references and citations identified 31 relevant papers (27 quantitative, 3 qualitative, and 1 mixed). Analysis of qualitative papers indicated a number of shared features in the definition of self-disgust, including a visceral sense of self-elicited nausea accompanied by social withdrawal and attempts at cleansing or suppressing aspects of the self. Quantitative assessment measures appeared to capture these dimensions and evidenced good psychometric properties, although some measures may have only partially captured the full self-disgust construct. Strong relationships were observed between self-disgust and a range of mental health presentations, in particular, depression, body-image difficulties, and trauma-related difficulties. However, these relationships are smaller when the effects of other negative self-referential emotions were controlled, and stronger conclusions about the predictive validity of self-disgust are limited by the cross-sectional nature of many of the studies.

AB  - Summary For a continuous treatment, the generalised propensity score (GPS) is defined as the conditional density of the treatment, given covariates. GPS adjustment may be implemented by including it as a covariate in an outcome regression. Here, the unbiased estimation of the dose?response function assumes correct specification of both the GPS and the outcome-treatment relationship. This paper introduces a machine learning method, the ?Super Learner?, to address model selection in this context. In the two-stage estimation approach proposed, the Super Learner selects a GPS and then a dose?response function conditional on the GPS, as the convex combination of candidate prediction algorithms. We compare this approach with parametric implementations of the GPS and to regression methods. We contrast the methods in the Risk Adjustment in Neurocritical care cohort study, in which we estimate the marginal effects of increasing transfer time from emergency departments to specialised neuroscience centres, for patients with acute traumatic brain injury. With parametric models for the outcome, we find that dose?response curves differ according to choice of specification. With the Super Learner approach to both regression and the GPS, we find that transfer time does not have a statistically significant marginal effect on the outcomes. ? 2015 The Authors.

The theoretical position of social dreaming and its historical development is described. Two examples are given for the practical application of social dreaming, a professional meeting of psychotherapists and an experiential workshop dealing with the aftermath of trauma. It is suggested that social dreaming is complementary to individual dreaming and offers insights and explanations, as well as guidance on various levels for applications in clinical, organizational, institutional and social settings.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aims Fragment reattachment is a procedure that offers advantages, such as preservation of tooth structure and maintenance of color, shape, and translucency of the original tooth. The aim of this study was to analyze the reattachment techniques used to restore anterior teeth fractured by trauma. Materials and Methods The PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases were searched in October 2016, and the search was updated in February 2017. A search of the gray literature was performed in Google Scholar and OpenGrey. Reference lists of eligible studies were evaluated to identify additional studies. Two authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted the data. In vitro studies that evaluated permanent human teeth fractured by trauma were included. Results Twenty-one studies remained after screening. The bond strength between the fragment and the crown was evaluated in 119 experimental groups. Ten different techniques were evaluated as follows: no preparation, chamfer, bevel, anchors, overcontour, internal groove, no preparation associated with chamfer after reattachment, fragment dentin removal associated with chamfer after reattachment, bevel associated with overcontour, and groove associated with shoulder. Five different materials were used to reattach the fragment: bonding system, luting composite resin, flowable composite, microhybrid composite, and nanocomposite. Conclusion Fragment reattachment using a technique with no preparation and an adhesive system associated with an intermediate composite with good mechanical properties can restore part of the resistance of the fractured tooth.

Numerous recent efforts to address this growing concern have focused on the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS). In the current study, we explored the relationships among reexperiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and the three components of the IPTS in a sample of deployed military personnel examined for traumatic brain injury. Results indicated that reexperiencing symptoms were directly related to the acquired capability for suicide, but their relationships to perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were statistically explained by general mental health distress. Results indicate that mental rehearsal of painful and provocative experiences may have an impact on suicide risk. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 67:1?10, 2011.

AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of a chronic illness is described as an upsetting event that implies an emotional crisis for parents. Some are able to come to terms with their child's chronic condition and feel a sense of resolution, but for others, strong negative emotions persist through time. The present study examines diagnostic resolution among parents of teenagers with a transplant. The design was qualitative and involved individual interviews with nine parents. Five were donor to their child. Data were analyzed according to the principles of IPA. Early reactions to the diagnosis suggest that parents with an unresolved status experienced trauma. Many factors seem to contribute to diagnostic resolution such as good communication between spouses, positive relationship with the medical staff, and being the parent donor. For all parents, concerns over adherence are central to their relationship with their youth. Results call attention to the support needs of all parents and particularly those with an unresolved status.

AB  - Summary Jaw fractures occur commonly in cats and dogs as a result of vehicular trauma, falls from heights, or by, objects, dog fights, and/or an altercation with another animal. With jaw fracture repair it is essential to maintain normal occlusion. The goal of the jaw fracture repair is to return the patient's mouth to normal function as soon as possible. Multi-modal analgesia must be applied to prevent pain in the patient. The use of tape muzzles or commercial nylon muzzles is suitable and sufficient for certain jaw fractures in some patients. Nylon or tape muzzles are also a nice additional support for other types of jaw fracture repair. Interdental bonding, interdental wiring, and acrylic reinforcement are other options for jaw fracture repair that are relatively inexpensive and not as technically challenging as some of the more invasive methods of jaw fracture repair, and are considered adequate in many jaw fracture cases.

AB  - Abstract Each year, numerous children testify in the United States in either criminal, civil, or juvenile court cases. Typically, children who testify are alleged victims of sexual or physical abuse or neglect, witnesses to violent crime, or subjects in custodial hearings in civil court. As more maltreatment cases are prosecuted and child custody is contested, an increasing number of children are being called as witnesses in court. Many of these children have already been traumatized by the experiences that led to their need to testify, and participation in the court process can have additional negative effects. This article describes the development and recent formative evaluation of a court preparation program that provides psychoeducation and utilizes components of evidence-based trauma treatment approaches, such as relaxation and in vivo exposure, to support child witnesses and reduce the risk of retraumatization. Children and adolescents participating in the program attend group sessions conducted by mental health clinicians and complete a court-related anxiety measure before and after each session. Results from 175 participants are reported. Findings indicated significant decreases in court-related anxiety with large program effects. Challenges encountered by the program and future directions are discussed.

Data was collated from the NBS database and directly from the hospitals involved. All data was collected immediately following the event and included: all blood components requested, issued and transfused in relation to the bombings, blood stock levels at the time and the injury profiles of the casualties transfused. The total NBS order from hospitals for the event was 1455 units of blood components. All requests were fulfilled, this included: 978 units of red cells (RC), 36 doses of platelets, 141 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 300 doses of cryoprecipitate. The amount of blood ordered was three times that initially used and the total number of RC transfused in treating all victims from admission to discharge was approximately 440 units. The greatest use of blood components was for those casualties who had sustained traumatic amputations amongst their injury profile. Published data with which to compare these results is lacking, although the RC use was similar to the initial mean individual usage described in previous military and civilian bombings. The overall implication for any blood service remains, there is now likely to be a far greater demand for plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate in any future incidents involving victims suffering major haemorrhage.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Opioids are an important component of multi-modal analgesia techniques. Different classes of analgesic drugs, when used concurrently, will modulate the pain pathway at different anatomical sites and receptor and transmitter systems, thereby providing more effective analgesia than a single class of drug alone. With few exceptions, combing different classes of analgesic drugs is not associated with increased risk of side effects, making multi-modal analgesia a safe and effective strategy to improve pain relief.

AB  - Background The ability to drive is a core function supporting independent living. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may impair driving capacity in numerous ways. Previous research has documented that individuals with TBI have more driving-related problems than other people and has identified predictors of driving status or capacity, mostly among civilians; however, no research has examined the implications of driving limitations for the well-being of individuals with TBI. Objective To examine the association between self-reported difficulty in driving with important domains of psychological well-being in veterans with TBI, with adjustment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and years since most recent TBI. Design Cross-sectional. Setting Veterans' homes. Participants A total of 61 veterans of the Global Wars on Terrorism diagnosed with TBI, all outpatients at a Veterans Affairs medical center rehabilitation service. Methods Home interviews as a baseline assessment for a larger randomized controlled trial. Main Outcome Measures Community reintegration (extent of social participation), depressive symptomatology, and role limitations due to physical health problems and those due to emotional problems. Self-rated competence in driving was the predictor, and sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis of PTSD, severity of TBI, and time since most recent TBI were covariates. Results Self-rated driving difficulty was associated with decreased community reintegration (? = .280, P =.028), greater depressive symptomatology (? = ?.402, P < .001), and greater role limitations due to physical problems (? = ?.312, P =.011) and to emotional problems (? = ?.324, P = .006), after we adjusted for PTSD and other variables. Discussion The self-reported ability to drive seems to be central to psychological well-being in veterans with TBI, showing clear associations with depression, community reintegration, and health-related role limitations. These associations cannot be attributed to comorbid PTSD. Conclusion Rehabilitation specialists should view driving difficulty as a risk factor for poor psychosocial outcomes in veterans with TBI and seek ways to compensate for the veteran's loss of driving if it is no longer advisable.
