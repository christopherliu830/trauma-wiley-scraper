AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children results in damage to the developing brain, particularly in severely injured individuals. Little is known, however, of the long-term structural aspects of the brain following childhood TBI. This study investigated the integrity of the brain 10 years post-TBI using magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics in a sample of 49 participants with mild, moderate and severe TBI, evaluated against a normative sample of 20 individuals from a pediatric database with comparable age and gender distribution. Structural integrity was investigated in gray and white matter, and by manually segmenting two regions of interest (hippocampus, amygdala), potentially vulnerable to the effects of childhood TBI. The results indicate that more severe injuries caused a reduction in gray and white brain matter, while all TBI severity levels resulted in increased volumes of cerebrospinal fluid and smaller hippocampal volumes. In addition, enlarged amygdala volumes were detected in severely injured patients compared to their mild and moderate counterparts, suggesting that childhood TBI may disrupt the development of certain brain regions through diffuse pathological changes. The findings highlight the lasting impact of childhood TBI on the brain and the importance of monitoring brain structure in the long-term after early injury.

AB  - Abstract Controlling mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) shape is a novel method for investigating and directing MSC behaviour in vitro. it was hypothesized that specifigc MSC shapes can be generated by using stiffness-defined biomaterial surfaces and by applying cyclic tensile forces. Biomaterials used were thin and thick silicone sheets, fibronectin coating, and compacted collagen type I sheets. The MSC morphology was quantified by shape descriptors describing dimensions and membrane protrusions. Nanoscale stiffness was measured by atomic force microscopy and the expression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker genes (ACTA2, TAGLN, CNN1) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cyclic stretch was applied with 2.5% or 5% amplitudes. Attachment to biomaterials with a higher stiffness yielded more elongated MSCs with fewer membrane protrusions compared with biomaterials with a lower stiffness. For cyclic stretch, compacted collagen sheets were selected, which were associated with the most elongated MSC shape across all investigated biomaterials. As expected, cyclic stretch elongated MSCs during stretch. One hour after cessation of stretch, however, MSC shape was rounder again, suggesting loss of stretch-induced shape. Different shape descriptor values obtained by different stretch regimes correlated significantly with the expression levels of SMC marker genes. Values of approximately 0.4 for roundness and 3.4 for aspect ratio were critical for the highest expression levels of ACTA2 and CNN1. Thus, specific shape descriptor values, which can be generated using biomaterial-associated stiffness and tensile forces, can serve as a template for the induction of specific gene expression levels in MSC.

Using a descriptive qualitative design, 75 Army Nurse Corps officers with deployment experience participated in a focused interview either in person or by telephone. Deployment locations included Bosnia, Honduras, Iraq, Afghanistan and other worldwide locations. Nurses recounted challenges and adjustments made to deliver high quality patient care to soldiers and civilian casualties especially for multi-level traumatic injuries. Specialized skill sets and personal adaptation were necessary for practice under austere conditions in these environments. By understanding the practice of nursing in MOOTW and wartime, nurses can best prepare and train to effectively function and care for patients in these challenging settings.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study was carried out to determine the time and concentration profile required to achieve vancomycin-mediated eradication of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. This information is critical for the identification of performance targets for local antibiotic delivery vehicles that target biofilm infections. S. aureus UAMS-1 biofilms were grown for 7 days on titanium?aluminium?niobium discs in Mueller Hinton broth. After 7 days, the discs were then incubated in Mueller Hinton broth containing vancomycin at concentrations of 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000?mg/L. Biofilm eradication was assessed under both static and shaking conditions. Samples were retrieved at regular intervals for up to 28 days for quantification of residual biofilm. One additional disc was processed per time point for scanning electron microscopy. Progressive and significant reduction of viable bacteria was observed over time at all concentrations compared to unexposed controls. After 28 days under static conditions, the S. aureus biofilm was completely eradicated at 200?mg/L vancomycin and higher concentrations, but not at 100?mg/L. In contrast, bacterial biofilm could not be eradicated under shaking conditions at any concentration. Clinical significance: The present study shows that it is possible to eradicate mature S. aureus biofilm from metal implants by vancomycin alone although the time concentration profile required cannot be achieved by systemic administration or any of the local delivery vehicles currently available. Identifying targets for antibiotic delivery is the first step in developing fit for purpose local antibiotic delivery vehicles that will successfully and predictably treat established biofilm infection. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Important advances in understanding traumatic stress reactions in children and young people have been made in recent years. The aim of this review was to synthesise selected recent research findings, with a focus on their relevance to clinical practice. We therefore address: findings on the epidemiology of trauma exposure and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); recent changes to diagnostic classification; implications for screening and assessment of traumatic stress reactions; and treatment outcome studies including interventions for acute and chronic PTSD, dissemination of effective treatments into community settings, and early interventions. We conclude with recommendations for clinical practice and suggestions for future areas of research.

AB  - Abstract Altered inflammation in the early stage has long been assumed to affect subsequent steps of the repair process that could influence proper wound healing and remodeling. However, the lack of explicit experimental data makes the connection between dysregulated wound inflammation and poor wound healing elusive. To bridge this gap, we used the established rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model for studying the causal effect of dysregulated inflammation. We induced an exacerbated and prolonged inflammatory state in these wounds with the combination of trauma-related stimulators of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and damage-associated molecular patterns from a dermal homogenate. In stimulated wounds, a heightened and lengthened inflammation was observed based on quantitative measurements of IL-6 expression, tissue polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Along with the high level of inflammation, wound healing parameters (epithelial gap and others) at postoperative day 7 and 16 were significantly altered in stimulated wounds compared to unstimulated controls. By postoperative day 35, scar elevation of stimulated wounds was higher than that of control wounds (scar elevation index: 1.90 vs. 1.39, p?<?0.01). Moreover, treatment of these inflamed wounds with Indomethacin (at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.4%) reduced scar elevation but with adverse effects of delayed wound closure and increased cartilage hypertrophy. In summary, successful establishment of this inflamed wound model provides a platform to understand these detrimental aspects of unchecked inflammation and to further test agents that can modulate local inflammation to improve wound outcomes.

AB  - Objectives The validity of the National Adult Reading Test (NART) as a predictor of premorbid IQ when used with patients who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been questioned in recent years. This study examined whether performance on the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) is similarly affected by TBI in the first year after an injury. Design and Method The WTAR scores of participants who had sustained a mild TBI (N=82), moderate TBI (N=73), severe TBI (N=61) or an orthopaedic injury (N=95) were compared (cross-sectional study). A subset of 21 mild TBI, 31 moderate TBI, 26 severe TBI and 21 control group participants were additionally reassessed 6 months later to assess the impact of recovery on WTAR scores (longitudinal study). Results The severe TBI group had significantly lower scores on the WTAR than the mild TBI, moderate TBI and control groups in the cross-sectional study, despite being matched demographically. The findings from the longitudinal study revealed a significant group difference and a small improvement in performance over time but the interaction between group and time was not significant, suggesting that the improvements in WTAR performance over time were not restricted to more severely injured individuals whose performance was temporarily suppressed. Conclusions These findings suggest that reading performance may be affected by severe TBI and that the WTAR may underestimate premorbid IQ when used in this context, which may cause clinicians to underestimate the cognitive deficits experienced by these patients.

AB  - A case of central nervous system protothecosis in a dog is reported. A three-year-old male Maremma sheepdog was referred with a two month history of diarrhoea associated with progressive tetraparesis, depression and right circling. Stupor, severe proprioceptive deficits, bilateral decreased thoracic limb flexor reflexes and bilateral deficit of the menace reaction were detected on neurological examination and a multi-focal neurological localisation was suspected. Histopathological evaluation revealed multi-focal granulomatous foci in the thalamus, hippocampus and caudal brainstem containing numerous oval-rounded organisms with a thick, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and Gomori?s methenamine silver-positive cell wall, a basophilic cytoplasm and one nucleus. Scattered sporangia containing two to four endospores were also observed. Morphological features were consistent with Prototheca species. Ultrastructurally, numerous degenerated algae were present within macrophages mainly lacking nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. Generally, protothecosis in dogs is characterised by systemic signs because of a multi-organ involvement, and haemorrhagic colitis or ophthalmologic signs are the most frequent presenting signs. However, protothecosis should be added, also in Europe, to the list of the differential diagnoses in adult dogs with a multi-focal neurological localisation even in absence of other clinical signs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the efficacy of a piezoelectric instrument (PI) for bone removal during ventral slot surgery. Study Design Ex vivo feasibility study. Sample Population Cadaveric canine cervical spinal specimens (n?=?3; C1?7; C1?T1; C2?T1). Methods The spinal cord of each explanted spinal unit was replaced with a saline-filled latex condom. In 8 disc spaces, ventral slot surgery was performed using a previously reported technique. Bone removal was achieved using a motorized burr (MB). In 8 disc spaces, bone was removed via en bloc ostectomy with a PI that selectively cuts mineralized tissue. Surgical duration and operating field visibility were recorded. Rupture of the fluid filled condom was used as a measure of iatrogenic collateral trauma. Computed tomography was used to measure ventral slot morphometry. Results Mean surgical duration for PI (23.4?minutes) was significantly shorter than for MB (34.1?minutes; P?=?.049). Using a 4 point Likert scale (4?=?excellent, 3?=?good, 2?=?fair, 1?=?poor), median visibility score was significantly higher for PI (2) than for MB (1; P?=?.03). The condom burst twice (1MB, 1PI) during elevation of the dorsal longitudinal ligament; there was no significant difference between techniques for incidence of collateral trauma (P?=?.99). Regardless of surgical technique, there was a bias in slot deviation towards the right (i.e., the surgeon's left; P?=?.021). Conclusions The PI allowed completion of ventral slots in a significantly shorter time, without an increased incidence of iatrogenic trauma. The right-handed surgeon showed a left-sided aiming bias, regardless of surgical technique.

Methods A retrospective study of bicycle-related injury presentations over the 5 year period 2010?2014 to two major metropolitan EDs. Data collected from the emergency presentation database consisted of patient demographics, presenting complaint, discharge diagnosis and details about the circumstances and mechanism of the accident. Results Bicycle injuries (n =?4144) increased from 20.0 to 25.2 per 1000 injury presentations over 5 years. Patients were 80% male across all age groups and 35% of presentations occurred at the weekend. Fractures accounted for one-third (34%) of all injuries, while injuries to the upper extremities and head resulted in 36% and 19% of cases, respectively. Admission rate was 17%. The number of falls exceeded collisions (1611 vs 937), and in the 13.3% of the fall cases where documentation was present for which how the fall occurred, over half were attributed to bike handling errors. Information related to type of bicycle, accident location, type of activity, protective clothing worn (including helmets) and visibility aids was not recorded for over 95% of the cases. Conclusion Bicycle injuries carry a considerable burden to the ED and the incidence of presentations appears to be rising. The current triage data, designed to provide a rapid assessment for medical urgency, are limited to describing broad demographics, trends and causes.

AB  - Abstract This article overviews recent advances in biomedical applications of enzyme-based logic systems, particularly for the analysis of pathophysiological conditions associated with various injuries. Novel biosensors digitally processing multiple biomarker signals produce a final output in the form of YES/NO response through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular systems. The biocomputing approach applied to biosensors leads to high-fidelity biosensing compared to traditional single-analyte sensing devices. By processing complex patterns of multiple physiological biomarkers, such multi-signal digital biosensors should have a profound impact on the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and particularly can provide timely detection and alert of medical emergencies (along with immediate therapeutic intervention). The novel biosensing concept has been exemplified with the systems for logic analysis of various injuries, including soft tissue injury, traumatic brain injury, liver injury, abdominal trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and oxidative stress.

A multi-predictor Poisson regression was performed to identify factors associated with a history of suicide attempt. In addition, an elastic net regularization was used to build a risk calculator to identify students at risk for attempted suicide. Results A total of 4,840 participants were included in the study. Prevalence of suicide attempts in the sample was 8.94%. Risk factors associated with past suicide attempt in the multi-predictor Poisson regression were as follows: female gender (P¬†<¬†0.001); homosexuality (P¬†<¬†0.001); low income (P¬†=¬†0.026); bullying by university peers (P¬†=¬†0.006); childhood (P¬†=¬†0.001) or adult (P¬†=¬†0.001) trauma; family history of suicide (P¬†=¬†0.005); suicidal ideation within the last month (P¬†<¬†0.001); daily tobacco use (P¬†=¬†0.037); and being at severe risk for alcohol abuse (P¬†=¬†0.023). Our elastic net model performed well with an AUC of 0.83. Conclusions This study identifies a number of key factors associated with a history of suicide attempts among medical students. Future longitudinal studies should assess the causal relationship between these factors and suicide attempts. Additionally, these results demonstrate that current available data on suicide attempts among medical students can be used to develop an accurate risk algorithm.

AB  - Objectives To determine if total serum cholesterol concentrations were altered in dogs with osteosarcoma. To evaluate association of total serum cholesterol concentration with clinical outcomes in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective, multi-institutional study on 64 dogs with osteosarcoma. Control population consisted of dogs with traumatic bone fractures (n=30) and healthy patients of similar age and weight as those of the osteosarcoma cases (n=31). Survival analysis was done on 35 appendicular osteosarcoma patients that received the current standard of care. Statistical associations were assessed by univariable and multi-variable analysis. Information about age, sex, primary tumour location, total cholesterol concentration, monocytes and lymphocyte counts and alkaline phosphatase were also included. Results Total cholesterol was elevated above the reference interval (3¬∑89 to 7¬∑12?mmol/L) (150 to 275?mg/dL) in 29 of 64 (45¬∑3%) osteosarcoma-bearing dogs, whereas similar elevations were found in only 3 of 30 (10%) fracture controls (P<0¬∑0001) and 2 of 31 (6¬∑5%) similar age/weight controls (P=0¬∑0002). Elevated total cholesterol was significantly associated with a reduced hazard ratio (0¬∑27, P=0¬∑008) for overall mortality in dogs with osteosarcoma. Clinical Significance These results suggest that elevated total cholesterol is associated with canine osteosarcoma and may have prognostic significance.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the nutrition support in critically ill patients. The negative acute phase proteins are albumin and transferrin. Their serum concentrations fall immediately after the injury, in proportion to its severity. They are used to monitor the nutritional status of acutely ill patients. Areas of intense clinical investigation in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may eventually be shown to be of great value are cancer patients in general, sepsis and trauma, and general perioperative support to prevent or correct malnutrition. Although protein restriction was historically used to reduce risk from hepatic encephalopathy, such a strategy may worsen nutrition status, decrease lean muscle mass, and ironically lead to less ammonia removal. Many interacting biologic and clinical factors are responsible for the development of malnutrition in critically ill and injured hospitalized patients and also the hypercatabolic states associated with trauma, sepsis, cancer, and surgical interventions.

AB  - Abstract Neurotrauma in the form of traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts more Americans annually than Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease combined, yet few researchers have used neuroproteomics to investigate the underlying complex molecular events that exacerbate TBI. Discussed in this review is the methodology needed to explore the neurotrauma proteome?from the types of samples used to the mass spectrometry identification and quantification techniques available. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in neurotrauma, as applied for immediate TBI biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of how the brain responds to trauma. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of neurotrauma on society. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 25:380?408, 2006

AB  - Alcohol misuse remains the single most important contributing factor to road accident deaths and injuries in Australia. The results of compulsory blood alcohol tests on road casualties have shown that probationary licensed drivers have a threefold increased risk of road accident injury compared to fully licensed drivers and are additionally over-represented in alcohol-related crashes. These findings led the Victorian Road Trauma Committee to campaign for a zero blood alcohol limit for learner and probationary drivers and motorcyclists. In May 1984, zero blood alcohol legislation was enacted in Victoria. The present legislation applies to learner and first year probationary licence holders. For the first time we have evidence of a moderate reduction in alcohol-related road trauma in Victoria. Between 1977 and 1983 there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of driver casualties admitted to hospital with illegal blood alcohol concentrations and in the number of driver fatalities with blood alcohol concentrations in excess of 0.15 g%. An evaluation of the following recommended drink driver countermeasures is presented: improved driver education, increased penalties, re-education-rehabilitation programmes for convicted drink drivers, interlock devices and an increase in the legal drinking age.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the features of dissociative schizophrenia and the clinical model and research data supporting its existence. In classical dissociative identity disorder (DID), the characteristic symptoms are due to full switches of executive control between highly structured, personified, and discrete ego states, or alter personalities. Typically, even in DID, much of the personality system is often structured and functions at the level of Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD). Dissociative schizophrenia fits into broader conception of dissociative disorders, as do the Schneiderian first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. The clinical implications of dissociative schizophrenia are the following: dissociative symptoms are common in schizophrenia and must be considered in treatment, some cases of schizophrenia may be treatable with psychotherapy, the environment can be the major aetiological factor in many cases of schizophrenia, and psychological trauma is a major theme in schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract This article examines how U.S large-scale beekeepers explain and resolve the plight of the honey bee. Using in-depth interviews with beekeepers and scientists, field notes, and qualitative online data, I find that while beekeepers invest in and hope for technoscientific developments, they are also sceptical of the promises of technoscience. I describe this paradox as a form of denial. As both agents and victims (with their bees) of industrial agriculture, they turn doubtfully to technoscience, which saves them from deconstructing and reconsidering the system they are an integral part of and benefit from. While technoscientific promises keep beekeepers hopeful and provide them with a sense of agency, they also prevent them from challenging the larger sociocultural mode of food production at the root cause of the plight of managed honey bees. In their attempt to save their bees and their livelihoods, beekeepers? conversations are performed to fit the dominant technoscientific imaginary and fail to seriously consider causes and solutions in the larger eco-social context.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Progesterone (P4) has the potential therapeutic effects for traumatic brain injury (TBI) whose recovery depended on the enhanced angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) plays an essential role in vascular biology. We previously demonstrated that P4 administration improved circulating EPC level and neurological recovery of rat with TBI. Here, we hypothesized that P4 augmented angiogenic potential of EPC and the angiogenesis-related neurorestoration after TBI through classical progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and methods EPC derived from rats were stimulated with graded concentrations (0, 10?10, 10?9, 5¬†?¬†10?9, 10?8, 10?7¬†mol/L) of P4 or 10?6¬†mol/L ulipristal acetate (UPA, a PR antagonist). Male rats were subjected to cortical impact injury and treated with (i) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), (ii) P4 and (iii) P4 and UPA. Results It showed that P4 improved the angiogenic potential of EPC, including tube formation, adhesion, migration and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal effect achieved at 10?9¬†mol/L P4. High concentration (10?7¬†mol/L) of P4 impaired the angiogenic potential of EPC. Notably, 10?6¬†mol/L UPA antagonized the stimulatory effects of 10?9¬†mol/L P4. After administrating P4, a significant improvement of neurological function and the restoration of the leaked blood-brain barrier were observed as well as a reduction of the brain water content. Both vessel density and expression of occludin of vessels were increased. When UPA was administered with P4, the neural restoration and angiogenesis were all reversed. Western blot showed that 10?9¬†mol/L P4 increased the content of PRA and PRB of EPC, while 10?7¬†mol/L P4 reduced the content of both PR isoforms, but there was no change found in the TBI rats. Conclusions It may suggest that P4-mediated angiogenic activity of EPC and angiogenesis in TBI rats were antagonized by PR antagonist.
