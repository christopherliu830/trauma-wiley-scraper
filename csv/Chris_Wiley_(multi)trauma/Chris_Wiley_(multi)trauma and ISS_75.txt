AB  - Objective? To investigate the mechanical characteristics of a nontoxic, low-cost, rigid polymer (RP) and to compare the structural and mechanical properties of a full-frame external skeletal fixator (ESF) with either RP connecting bars, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) connecting bars, or stainless-steel (SS) clamps and connecting bars. Study Design? In vitro mechanical evaluation. Methods? Mechanical properties were assessed using an in vitro bone fracture model with a bilateral uniplanar ESF (type II). Identical ESF were built with connecting bars using RP (n = 8), PMMA (n = 8), and SS connecting bars and clamps (System Meynard; n = 3). Nondestructive mechanical tests were performed in uniaxial compression (AC) and craniocaudal (CC) 4-point bending, as well as fatigue AC. Composite stiffness for each specimen and for each loading mode was calculated from 6 replicate measures using the slope of the load displacement curve at small displacements. Results? RP, PMMA, and SS ESF constructs yielded mean ± SD composite stiffness values of 227 ± 15, 381 ± 30, and 394 ± 9 N/mm in AC and of 35 ± 2, 24 ± 2, and 15 ± 0 N/mm in CC, respectively. Conclusions? Structural and mechanical properties of RP are satisfactorily rigid and fatigue resistant for its use as a connecting bar in ESF. Clinical Relevance? RP connecting bars in an ESF are a reliable, versatile, nontoxic and inexpensive option for the veterinary surgeon.

AB  - Abstract Aim To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the interleukin-1 gene cluster (IL1) are associated with the occurrence and severity of inflammatory external root resorption (IERR) after replantation of avulsed permanent teeth. Methodology Indexes of IERR were radiographically assessed in 182 mature replanted permanent teeth from 146 patients at the onset of endodontic therapy. DNA was extracted from buccal mucosa cells and genotyped using TaqMan probes-based assays for the SNPs IL1A -889C/T (rs 180058), IL1B +3954C/T (rs1143634) and IL1RN +2018C/T (rs419598). Teeth were grouped into two categories: IERR absent to mild (indexes ≤4) and moderate to severe IERR (indexes >4). Genetic variations in the IL1 gene cluster were tested for their effect on the occurrence and extension of IERR using the GEE model (generalized estimation equation). Patient's age at the moment of injury, timing of pulpectomy, extra-alveolar period and storage condition of the avulsed teeth was included as possible confounders. Results No association was found between SNPs IL1A -889C/T, IL1B +3954C/T (rs1143634) and IL1RN +2018C/T (rs419598) and IERR indexes. Timing of pulpectomy (OR 3.5 IC 95% 2.0?6.2 P < 0.001) and patient's age at the moment of trauma (OR 0.29 IC 95% 0.12?0.67 P = 0.004) significantly affected the risk of developing severe IERR. Conclusions While timing of pulpectomy and patient's age at the moment of trauma were confirmed as important risk factors, SNPs within the IL1 gene cluster did not affect the susceptibility for IERR after replantation of permanent teeth.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a method that uses the intrinsic nature of local magnetic fields to enhance image contrast in order to improve the visibility of various susceptibility sources and to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. It is also the precursor to the concept of the use of phase for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Nowadays, SWI has become a widely used clinical tool to image deoxyhemoglobin in veins, iron deposition in the brain, hemorrhages, microbleeds and calcification. In this article, we review the basics of SWI, including data acquisition, data reconstruction and post-processing. In particular, the source of cusp artifacts in phase images is investigated in detail and an improved multi-channel phase data combination algorithm is provided. In addition, we show a few clinical applications of SWI for the imaging of stroke, traumatic brain injury, carotid vessel wall, siderotic nodules in cirrhotic liver, prostate cancer, prostatic calcification, spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc degeneration. As the clinical applications of SWI continue to expand both in and outside the brain, the improvement of SWI in conjunction with QSM is an important future direction of this technology.

AB  - Abstract Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should include derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Azygos vein aneurysm is a rare disease. Surgical resection is usually performed when it ruptures. To avoid the thromboembolism, procedures that do not touch or push the aneurysm are recommended. Herein, we report a case of idiopathic azygos vein aneurysm. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for right lateral chest pain. Chest enhanced multi-detector CT revealed an azygos vein aneurysm in the posterior mediastinal space. No thrombus in the aneurysm was detected before surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed to treat the aneurysm. The patient was discharged from the hospital 4?days after surgery. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was a good option to treat an azygos vein aneurysm, and an enhanced multi-detector CT was useful for performing surgery safely.

AB  - Abstract Objective Soft tissue (ST) dehiscence with graft exposure is a frequent complication of vertical augmentation. Flap dehiscence is caused by failure to achieve tension-free primary wound closure and by the impairment of flap microcirculation due to surgical trauma. Soft tissue expansion (STE) increases ST quality and quantity prior to reconstructive surgery. We hypothesized that flap preconditioning using STE would reduce the incidence of ST complications after bone augmentation and that optimized ST healing would improve the outcome of bone regeneration. Materials and methods Self-filling tissue expanders were implanted in mandibular bone defects in ten beagle dogs. After expansion, alloplastic scaffolds were placed for vertical bone augmentation in STE sites and in control sites without STE pre-treatment. ST flap microcirculation was analysed using laser Doppler flowmetry. The incidence of graft exposures was evaluated after 2 weeks. Bone formation was assessed after 2 months, using histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. Results Test sites showed significantly less impairment of perfusion and faster recovery of microcirculation after bone augmentation. Furthermore, no flap dehiscences occurred in STE sites. Bone regeneration was found in both groups; however, significantly greater formation of new bone was detected in test sites with preceding STE. Conclusions Preconditioning using STE improved ST healing and bone formation after vertical augmentation. The combination of STE and the subsequent placement of alloplastic scaffolds may facilitate the reconstruction of severe bone defects.

AB  - Objectives To determine the underlying disease prevalence in acute feline dyspnoea and to examine whether historical and clinical examination findings can differentiate between acute cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea in cats in primary practice. Materials and Methods We prospectively enrolled cats presenting with dyspnoea for the first time to primary practice between June 1, 2011 and October 31, 2016. We collected signalment, historical and clinical data at presentation using a standard form. Cases were investigated by primary clinicians, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by the authors. Records lacking critical data were excluded. Relationships between historical or clinical variables and dyspnoea aetiology were examined. Diagnostic test performance analyses were used to find optimal cut-off values for select historical or clinical variables that could differentiate cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea. Results Participants included 108 cats. A definitive diagnosis was reached in 92 cases; 60 were cardiac (65%), 15 respiratory (16%), 10 neoplastic (11%) and 7 traumatic (8%). Of cats with cardiac dyspnoea, 25% had a history of cough. A gallop sound, rectal temperature less than 37·5°C, heart rate of greater than 200?bpm and respiratory rate greater than 80 per minute were all useful to predict cardiac-associated dyspnoea. A triage algorithm using these findings in combination was designed to optimise the rapid diagnosis of probable cardiac dyspnoea. Clinical Significance Dyspnoeic cats presenting in practice with hypothermia, tachycardia, gallop sounds or profound tachypnoea are likely to have a cardiac cause underlying their dyspnoea. Although diagnosis requires confirmation, clinicians may be able to stratify risk and prioritise further investigation based on these findings.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims The focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multi-dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risk-taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the item-bank, (2) calibrate the item-bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptom-specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CAT-SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain. Design Item bank construction, item calibration phase, CAT-SUD validation phase. Setting Primary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patient-to-patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles). Participants/cases Calibration phase: the CAT-SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CAT-SUD. Measurements A total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CAT-SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis. Findings Calibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multi-dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168-item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CAT-SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20-fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CAT-SUD (AUC = 0.85). Conclusions We have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multi-dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CAT-SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

AB  - Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) represent a widely used cell source with multi-lineage differentiation capacity in approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Despite the multitude of literature on their differentiation capacity, little is reported about the physiological properties contributing to and controlling the process of lineage differentiation. Direct intercellular communication between adjacent cells via gap junctions has been shown to modulate differentiation processes in other cell types, with connexin 43 (Cx43) being the most abundant isoform of the gap junction-forming connexins. Thus, in the present study we focused on the expression of Cx43 and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in human ASCs, and its significance for adipogenic differentiation of these cells. Cx43 expression in ASCs was demonstrated histologically and on the gene and protein expression level, and was shown to be greatly positively influenced by cell seeding density. Functionality of gap junctions was proven by dye transfer analysis in growth medium. Adipogenic differentiation of ASCs was shown to be also distinctly elevated at higher cell seeding densities. Inhibition of GJIC by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA) significantly compromised adipogenic differentiation, as demonstrated by histology, triglyceride quantification, and adipogenic marker gene expression. Flow cytometry analysis showed a lower proportion of cells undergoing adipogenesis when GJIC was inhibited, further indicating the importance of GJIC in the differentiation process. Altogether, this study demonstrates the impact of direct cell?cell communication via gap junctions on the adipogenic differentiation process of ASCs, and may contribute to further integrate direct intercellular crosstalk in rationales for tissue engineering approaches.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? This article is aimed to review the novel actions of progesterone, which otherwise is considered as a female reproductive hormone. The article focuses on its important physiological actions in males too and gives an overview of its novel perspectives in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system. Key findings? Progesterone may have a potential benefit in treatment of traumatic brain injury, various neurological disorders and male related diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer and osteoporosis. Norethisterone (NETA), a progesterone derivative, decreases bone mineral loss in male castrated mice suggesting its role in osteoporosis. In the future, progesterone may find use as a male contraceptive too, but still needs confirmatory trials for safety, tolerability and acceptability. Megestrol acetate, a progesterone derivative is preferred in prostatic cancer. Further, it may find utility in nicotine addiction, traumatic brain injury (recently entered Phase III trial) and Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathy and crush injuries. Studies also suggest role of progesterone in stroke, for which further clinical trials are needed. The non genomic actions of progesterone may be in part responsible for these novel actions. Summary? Although progesterone has shown promising role in various non-hormonal benefits, further clinical studies are needed to prove its usefulness in conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neuropathy and crush injury. In male related illnesses like BPH and prostatic Ca, it may prove a boon in near future. New era of hormonal male contraception may be initiated by use of progesterone along with testosterone.

AB  - Obligatory nitrogen losses due to paralysis in the spinal cord-injured (SCI) patient prevent positive nitrogen balance (NB) regardless of the calorie and protein intakes. Ten patients with SCI and 20 controls with nonspinal cord injury (NSCI) matched for time, sex, age, and injury severity score (ISS) were admitted to our Level I trauma center. In both groups, total nutritional support was delivered within 72 hours of admission based on predicted energy expenditures (PEE = Harris-Benedict equation x 1.2 x 1.6) and 2 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). Subsequent changes in nutrient delivery were based on NB. No SCI patient established positive NB during the 7-week period following injury despite an average delivery of 2.4 g of protein/kg IBW and 120% of the PEE at the time of peak negative NB (-10.5). In six SCI patients, an average increase of 25% in delivered protein and 12% in delivered calories over a 1-week period effected no change in average NB (-7.4 us -6.8). Indirect calorimetry in five SCI patients showed that calorie intakes were 110% more than average measured energy expenditures. In contrast, 17 of 20 NCSI patients achieved positive NB within 3 weeks of admission. They required an average delivery of 2.3 g of protein/kg IBW and 110% of PEE to reach positive NB. These data demonstrate the phenomenon of obligatory negative NB acutely following SCI. Aggressive attempts to achieve positive NB in these patients will fail and result in overfeeding.

AB  - Abstract Clinicians are charged with the significant task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted head trauma. Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and injury threshold best able to predict IH in 3?5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and injury threshold most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ. However, when predicting IH, the spring connector representation of the PCC had the best predictive capability for IH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% when ≥1% of all spring connectors had at least a peak strain of 0.31 mm/mm. These findings and reported methodology will be used in the development of a human infant FE model to simulate real-world falls and identify injury thresholds for predicting IH in infants.

AB  - Summary Pediatric anesthesiologists care for children with penetrating trauma from nonpowder (BB and pellet) guns. We present the case of a 9-year-old boy who required urgent median sternotomy for cardiac tamponade after sustaining a close-range BB gun injury to the chest. After summarizing the epidemiology of nonpowder gun injuries in children, we clarify the nomenclature, ballistics, and mechanisms of these guns, discuss the tendency to minimize these kinds of injuries, explain bullet embolization, and review (by body area) current clinical management issues.

AB  - Summary In a Swedish nation-wide study, 1196 members of the general public, and 121 physicians and 339 nurses drawn from 29 intensive care units were questioned about the use of ventilator treatment for severely ill patients. Response rates were 64%, 88% and 86%, respectively. Two typical case history scenarios were presented: one describing a conscious and competent patient with pneumonia and severe cancer, and the other describing a patient who had been comatose for 1 month following head trauma. In the case of the cancer patient, 49% of the general public, 63% of the physicians and 59% of the nurses answered that they would wish that the ventilator treatment be discontinued, if they were the patient. In the case of the comatose patient, 48% of the general public, 82% of the physicians and 70% of the nurses answered that they would wish that the ventilator treatment to be discontinued, if they were a relative of the patient. Respondents own preferences, in the three groups, for life support favoured withdrawal of ventilator treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on acute occupational trauma in agriculture resulting from a wound or immediate damage by sudden one-time application of external force. It provides a general description of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries in agriculture and discusses the unique attributes of farm and agriculturally related trauma. Furthermore, the chapter provides: injury statistics and epidemiological data, rescue and medical treatment considerations, and illustrative injury descriptions. It helps to provide an understanding of how agricultural injuries occur and assisting in anticipating medical implications and prevention opportunities. The injury scenarios given in the chapter should enhance understanding of agents, events, causes, treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of acute traumatic injuries. These scenarios are augmented with special considerations for those who are first on the scene, first responders and rescue personnel, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and transport personnel, emergency medical treatment providers, primary care providers, secondary/tertiary care providers, and providers of rehabilitation services.

AB  - Abstract Shoulder injuries are a commonly presenting complaint to the ED. In the absence of an obvious deformity, they can be difficult to assess and definitively diagnose because of the multiple structures that cause shoulder pain, the acuity and severity of pain and the lack of range of motion in the ED setting. The quality of ED care provided to patients with musculoskeletal shoulder pain is crucial to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common shoulder injuries and conditions in the ED. Databases were searched in 2017, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines published in English-language in the past 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management, follow-up plan or prognosis were considered for inclusion. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence. The search revealed 1902 articles, of which 73 were included in the review (n =?12 primary articles, n =?49 systematic reviews and n =?12 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians who manage shoulder dislocations, fractures and soft tissue injuries in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. There is strong evidence to support taking a thorough history and physical examination, with cautious use of special tests because of their poor diagnostic accuracy. Key points regarding the diagnosis and management of these injuries are provided.
