AB  - Summary This chapter highlights similarities and differences between brain changes after adversity, on the one hand, and those found in psychotic and dissociative disorders, on the other, and differences between psychotic and dissociative disorders in these areas. Among the dissociative disorders, it focuses on dissociative identity disorder (DID), dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS), other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The hippocampus is central to functions, including memory, spatial navigation, cognitive maps, negative feedback control of the HPA stress axis, and integrated conscious experience or 'construction' of the external world. The amygdala is composed of many different nuclei and is involved in a variety of functions, including fear conditioning, memory, perception, and attention. Abnormal frontal lobe functioning and structures have been consistently found in psychotic disorders. There is clearly evidence that the extent and severity of abuse in persons with DID is greater than that reported by persons with psychotic disorders.

AB  - Objective To compare the biomechanical properties of single- and two-segment fusion for Denis type B spinal fracture. Methods Two female patients with Denis type B L1 vertebral fractures were studied. Both patients had achieved intervertebral fusion by 1 year postoperatively, at which time CT data were collected, including data of one patient before and after removal of pedicle screws and of another whose pedicle screws were not removed. The data were imported into Mimics software and T11-L2 three dimensional models established. After construction of the models, they were imported into ANSYS software. An axial load (260?N) and 10?Nm torque were loaded to simulate the flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation of the spine, respectively. Results There was no significant difference in the average displacement of the spine motion between the two-segment and single-segment fusion patients without removal of pedicle screws. However, for all motion forms, the average displacement of the single-segment fusion patient' spine after removal of pedicle screws was significantly greater than that before removal of pedicle screws and that of the two-segment fusion patient. The average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of two-segment fusion patient was significantly greater than that of the one-segment fusion patient. Moreover, the average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of single-segment fusion patient was greater before than after removal of pedicle screws. Conclusion Provided there is satisfactory interbody fusion, removal of pedicle screws after one-segment fusion can increase spinal motion, reduce the stress on adjacent intervertebral discs and delay disc degeneration.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Although multi-site pain is common in adolescents, pain conditions are frequently diagnosed and treated in isolation. Little is known about whether there are specific sites in which pain commonly co-occurs. This study examines the patterns of pain in adolescents, and whether these are associated with sports participation, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and sex. Methods In previously collected cohort data (?Adolescent Pain in Aalborg-2011?), adolescents (aged 12?19) completed an online questionnaire, including demographic data, current pain sites, sports participation and HRQoL (assessed by Euro-QoL 5D-3L). Latent class analysis was used to classify spatial pain patterns, based on the pain sites. The analysis included 2953 adolescents. Results Four classes were identified as follows: (1) little or no pain (63% of adolescents), (2) majority lower extremity pain (10%), (3) multi-site bodily pain (22%) and (4) head and stomach pain (3%). The lower extremity multi-site pain group reported highest weekly sports participation (p < 0.001; mean: 2.9 days/week; 95% CI 2.7 to 3.2), while the multi-site bodily pain and the multi-site head and stomach pain groups had lowest EQ-5D scores (p < 0.001). Males were more likely to belong to the little or no pain class, whereas females were more likely to belong to the multi-site bodily pain class. Conclusions Latent class analysis identified distinct classes of pain patterns in adolescents, characterized by sex, differences in HRQoL and sports participation. The class with multi-site bodily pain and reduced quality of life was the largest among adolescents reporting pain, and future research on treatment strategies should consider targeting this group.

AB  - Abstract ???Crown fractures account for the highest percentage of all traumatic injuries in the permanent dentition. This review paper will discuss the different types of crown fracture, from the uncomplicated to complicated, including crown-root fractures. It will focus on two different aspects: the pulp, with an attempt to correlate epidemiological, experimental, histopathological and clinical studies, so that the clinician can better understand the underlying processes accounting for success or failure to maintain pulp vitality. Also, we will consider the restoration: knowledge about bonding to dentin and new material is evolving extremely quickly making it difficult for the clinician to keep up with the developments. If handled properly, prognosis of the pulp, after traumatic crown fracture, is good. Prognosis of the restoration has also improved considerably over the last few years, and it appears that this trend will continue in the future.

AB  - Aims and objectives To investigate uptake of a Chest Injury Protocol (ChIP), examine factors influencing its implementation and identify interventions for promoting its use. Background Failure to treat blunt chest injuries in a timely manner with sufficient analgesia, physiotherapy and respiratory support, can lead to complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure and/or death. Design This is a mixed-methods implementation evaluation study. Methods Two methods were used: (i) identification and review of the characteristics of all patients eligible for the ChIP protocol, and (ii) survey of hospital staff opinions mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. The characteristics and treatment received between the groups were compared using the chi-square test or Fischer's exact test for proportions, and the Mann?Whitney U-test for continuous data. Quantitative survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were coded in NVivo 10 using a coding guide based on the TDF and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Identification of interventions to change target behaviours was sourced from the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy Version 1 in consultation with stakeholders. Results Only 68.4% of eligible patients received ChIP. Fifteen facilitators and 10 barriers were identified to influence the implementation of ChIP in the clinical setting. These themes were mapped to 10 of the 14 TDF domains and corresponded with all nine intervention functions in the BCW. Seven of these intervention functions were selected to address the target behaviours and a multi-faceted relaunch of the revised protocol developed. Following re-launch, uptake increased to 91%. Conclusions This study demonstrated how the BCW may be used to revise and improve a clinical protocol in the ED context. Relevance to clinical practice Newly implemented clinical protocols should incorporate clinician behaviour change assessment, strategy and interventions. Enhancing the self-efficacy of emergency nurses when performing assessments has the potential to improve patient outcomes and should be included in implementation strategy.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare rectal (CR°), coronary band (PCB°) and ear base (PE°) temperatures with pulmonary arterial temperature (CPA°), and to investigate the relationship between core?peripheral temperature difference ([C???P]t°) and cardiac output (Qt) in an acute ovine trauma model (PIL 60/9064). Study design? Observational study. Animals? Thirteen mixed-breed male sheep, body mass (mean?±?SD) 45.50?±?4.21?kg, aged approximately 1?year. Materials and methods? Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous etomidate 0.5?mg?kg?1 and midazolam 0.5?mg?kg?1 and following endotracheal intubation maintained with halothane in a 2:1 N2O:O2 mixture. The lungs were mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnia. Core temperature was measured using a pulmonary arterial thermistor. Rectal temperature and peripheral temperatures at the thoracic limb coronary band and ear base were recorded using themistor probes with a multi-channel recorder. Cardiac output was measured by continuous thermodilution. Recordings were taken hourly over a 24-hour period. After baseline data collection, hypovolaemia was induced by haemorrhage from bilateral femoral fractures. The development of hypovolaemic shock was confirmed by falling Qt, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and urine output. Resuscitation was attempted using intravenous fluids, inotropes and vasoconstrictors. Nine sheep received lumbosacral extradural bupivacaine. Results? The rectal temperature correlated closely with pulmonary arterial temperature in all sheep (rc?=?0.924). There was no consistent statistically significant relationship between Qt and [C???P]t°. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Rectal temperature accurately reflected core temperature in anaesthetized sheep but [C???P]t° was unrelated to Qt, under the conditions described in this study.

AB  - Abstract Aim The aim of this study was to identify the main biological, psychological and sociological problems and potential solutions for patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia by use of Group Problem-Solving Therapy. Background Group Problem-Solving Therapy is a technique for identifying and solving problems, increasing assertiveness, self-esteem and eliminating negative thoughts. Design Qualitative phenomenological interpretive design: Group Problem-Solving Therapy sessions conducted with patients suffering fibromyalgia were studied; participants recruited via the Rheumatology Department at a general hospital and associations in Catalonia, Spain with sessions conducted in nearby university setting. Methods The study included 44 people diagnosed with fibromyalgia (43 female, 1 male) from 6 Group Problem-Solving Therapy sessions. Data collected from March?June 2013. A total of 24 sessions were audio recorded, all with prior informed consent. Data were transcribed and then analysed in accordance with established methods of inductive thematic analysis, via a process of reduction to manage and classify data. Findings Five themes were identified: (1) Current problems are often related to historical trauma; (2) There are no ?one size fits all? solutions; (3) Fibromyalgia is life-changing; (4) Fibromyalgia is widely misunderstood; (5) Statistically Significant impacts on physical, psychological and social are described. Conclusion The majority of patients? problems were associated with their previous history and the onset of fibromyalgia; which may be related to trauma in adolescence, early adulthood or later. The solutions provided during the groups appeared to be accepted by the participants. These findings can improve the self-management of fibromyalgia patients by helping to enhance adaptive behaviours and incorporating the female gender approach.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess outcome of phacoemulsification in cats. Methods Records of 71 cats (82 eyes) from five referral centers were reviewed. Groups were divided by cause of cataract (congenital/juvenile [n = 32], traumatic [n = 33], and secondary to uveitis [n = 6]), and group comparisons were performed for the most common complications: postoperative ocular hypertension (POH), uveitis, corneal ulceration, synechia/dyscoria, and posterior capsular opacity (PCO) in three different time periods: immediately postoperatively, at 1-90 days, and at >90 days. Results Median follow-up was 198 days (interquartile range 64-518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12-month follow-up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%). At 1-90 days, uveitis in 41/81 eyes (50.6%) remained the most common complication, followed by synechia/dyscoria in 21/81 eyes (25.9%), corneal ulceration in 16/81 eyes (19.7%), and PCO in 15/81 eyes (18.5%). At >90 days, PCO in 17/47 eyes (36.1%), followed by synechia/dyscoria in 16/47 eyes (34%), was the most common complications. The number of eyes with synechia/dyscoria in the trauma group was higher (13/33 [39.3%]) than in the congenital/juvenile group (5/31 [16.1%]) at 1-90 days (P = .039). No statistical difference was found for the other group comparisons. Three eyes in total were enucleated owing to endophthalmitis, post-traumatic ocular sarcoma, and secondary glaucoma. Conclusion Uveitis in the short-term and PCO and synechia/dyscoria in the long-term were the most common complications following phacoemulsification in cats.

AB  - Summary Nonheart beating donation (NHBD) of the liver is a relatively new potential source of grafts. Guidelines to indications and contraindications to donation from controlled nonheart beating donors are still being formulated. We report a successful case of transplantation of a liver from a controlled nonheart beating donor who sustained significant injuries following a road traffic accident. Emergency laparotomy with peri-hepatic packing was performed to control haemorrhage from lacerations in segments VI and VII. Forceful packing resulted in an area of focal ischaemia in segment VI. Trauma to the liver should not be considered an absolute contraindication to controlled NHBD.

AB  - Abstract Abstract Recent advances in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery have changed the traditional therapeutic algorithms by altering indications, timing and patterns of referral for subsequent surgical treatment. The traditional longitudinal sternomy incision has been the surgical approach of choice for multi-vessel coronary revascularisation. Drawbacks of this incision include potential postoperative morbidity, which translates to a prolonged postoperative length of stay. The combination of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting (a hybrid approach) is an alternative therapeutic method for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Recent advances in percutaneous interventions have attempted to address the problem of re-stenosis, initially through the deployment of bare metal intra-coronary stents and, more recently, with drug-eluting stents. Developments in coronary revascularisation have focused on reducing both surgical invasiveness and trauma. Patients with significant co-morbid pathologies, the ones undergoing re-interventions, and especially the elderly may benefit from such hybrid procedures by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and midline sternotomy. Minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized cardiothoracic surgery by increasing patient satisfaction and by reducing surgical trauma, hospital stay and consequently overall costs. There are however limitations. Robot assisted surgery endeavours to minimise these technical hindrances and so allow better and more accurate surgical practice whilst minimising surgical trauma.

AB  - Summary Massive haemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency affecting many patient groups. 5?30% of critically ill patients with major blood loss have an accompanying coagulopathy, and this confers a poor prognosis. Successful treatment of severe bleeding is dependent upon many factors, including early identification of any at-risk patient, recognition and treatment of any accompanying coagulopathy, and the proactive delivery of red blood cells (RBC), to maintain tissue oxygenation, and blood components (FFP, platelets), to target the coagulopathy. This chapter will summarize the general haemostatic changes that occur during major blood loss and detail how this information has helped to drive recent changes to transfusion practices. It will focus on the general management of major blood loss and discuss how this may vary according to the different clinical settings.

AB  - Summary Background Early results from the use of neuromodulation by percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in horses were promising but lacked sufficient case numbers and long-term follow-up. The neuromodulatory procedure has since been established as EquiPENS?. Objectives The aim of this study was to report long-term results from a larger number of cases and to investigate for predictors of outcome. Study design Prospective case series using international, multi-centre data. Methods Eligible cases were horses with a veterinary diagnosis of trigeminal-mediated headshaking, which received EquiPENS? neuromodulation at trained centres between August 2013 and November 2017. The standard protocol was an initial three-procedure course, with additional procedures should a horse go into remission but then relapse. Data collected included signalment, history, diagnostic tests performed, details of any complications, whether horses had gone into remission and the length of remission. Results Results were obtained from 168 horses, with 530 procedures. The complication rate was 8.8% of procedures. In all but one case, complications were mild and transient, without self-trauma. Remission of headshaking following the initial course occurred in 53% (72/136) of horses. Median length of time recorded in remission was 9.5 weeks (range 2 days to 156 weeks ongoing). Where signs recurred, most horses went back into remission following additional procedures, usually for longer than from the previous procedure. No predictors for outcome were determined. Main limitations No placebo or control group, owner-assessed results. Conclusions EquiPENS? neuromodulation can be an effective and safe treatment for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in some horses. An increased understanding of neuromodulation could help optimise the technique. Advances in treatment for trigeminal-mediated headshaking will remain limited until there is a greater understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the condition.
