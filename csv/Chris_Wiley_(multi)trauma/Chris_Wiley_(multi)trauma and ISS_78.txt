AB  - Summary Background In patients suffering from epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica (DEB), the most severe form of epidermolysis bullosa, trauma or friction cause separation of the skin from underlying tissue with consecutive painful blisters, scarifications, contractures, and pseudosyndactyly. To retain functionality of the hands surgical procedures are necessary. Anesthesia is challenging as difficult airways make general anesthesia risky. Regional anesthesia is considered controversial in patients with EB as accidental subcutaneous injections can cause severe blisters. As ultrasound-guided procedures became standard of care this might have changed however. Aim In this case series, we describe feasibility, efficacy, and safety of ultrasound-guided plexus axillaris block in DEB patients undergoing hand surgery. Method We performed a retrospective analysis of the charts of all children with DEB undergoing hand surgery under plexus axillaris block and sedation between 2009 and 2013 in our institution. Results Nineteen procedures in nine children were performed. Induction of anesthesia (securing monitoring, sedation, plexus block) took a mean time of 34 min. Perioperative analgesia was adequate in all procedures. No complications such as airway incidents, conversion to general anesthesia, movement during surgery, incomplete block, or formation of new blisters were seen. Conclusion Ultrasound-guided plexus axillaris block in DEB patients undergoing hand surgery in our institution has been feasible, effective, and safe.

AB  - Summary Background Early results from the use of neuromodulation by percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in horses were promising but lacked sufficient case numbers and long-term follow-up. The neuromodulatory procedure has since been established as EquiPENS?. Objectives The aim of this study was to report long-term results from a larger number of cases and to investigate for predictors of outcome. Study design Prospective case series using international, multi-centre data. Methods Eligible cases were horses with a veterinary diagnosis of trigeminal-mediated headshaking, which received EquiPENS? neuromodulation at trained centres between August 2013 and November 2017. The standard protocol was an initial three-procedure course, with additional procedures should a horse go into remission but then relapse. Data collected included signalment, history, diagnostic tests performed, details of any complications, whether horses had gone into remission and the length of remission. Results Results were obtained from 168 horses, with 530 procedures. The complication rate was 8.8% of procedures. In all but one case, complications were mild and transient, without self-trauma. Remission of headshaking following the initial course occurred in 53% (72/136) of horses. Median length of time recorded in remission was 9.5 weeks (range 2 days to 156 weeks ongoing). Where signs recurred, most horses went back into remission following additional procedures, usually for longer than from the previous procedure. No predictors for outcome were determined. Main limitations No placebo or control group, owner-assessed results. Conclusions EquiPENS? neuromodulation can be an effective and safe treatment for the management of trigeminal-mediated headshaking in some horses. An increased understanding of neuromodulation could help optimise the technique. Advances in treatment for trigeminal-mediated headshaking will remain limited until there is a greater understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the condition.

AB  - Summary Intranasal meningoencephaloceles are characterised by protrusion of brain and meninges through a skull-base defect. Nasal intubation or instrumentation may lead to complications such as meningoencephalitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea or fistula formation. A 62 year old lady developed rhinorrhea following failed videolaryngoscopic and nasal fibreoptic intubation, which ultimately necessitated emergency surgical tracheostomy for a ?can't intubation can't ventilate? scenario. This case highlights the diagnosis and management of an unusual complication resulting from difficult airway management.

AB  - Objective To compare surgical trauma, perioperative pain, surgical time, and complication rate in mares undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy by natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopy. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Healthy mares (n = 12). Methods Ovariectomy was performed with a vessel-sealing device by transvaginal NOTES (n = 6) using a flexible endoscope and specialized instruments or by bilateral flank laparoscopy (n = 6). Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background.  Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design.? This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods.? Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21?40?years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results.? Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion.? When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.

AB  - Abstract A three-group quasi-experimental design contrasted the responses of rescue workers to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Interstate 880 freeway collapse (n = 198) with responses to critical incident exposure of Bay Area Controls (n = 140) and San Diego Controls (n = 101). The three groups were strikingly similar with respect to demographics and years of emergency service. The I-880 group reported higher exposure, greater immediate threat appraisal, and more sick days. The three groups did not differ on current symptoms. For the sample as a whole EMT/ Paramedics reported higher peritraumatic dissociation compared with Police. EMT/ Paramedics and California road workers reported higher symptoms compared with Police and Fire personnel. Nine percent of the sample were characterized as having symptom levels typical of psychiatric outpatients. Compared with lower distress responders, those with greater distress reported greater exposure, greater peritraumatic emotional distress, greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater perceived threat, and less preparation for the critical incident.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To examine whether the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) screening tool can satisfy Rasch model expectations and therefore be transformed into an interval level measurement scale, suitable for use as an outcome measure in clinical studies. Design.? Rasch analysis (using the software RUMM2020) of LANSS data from both a random selection of all chronic pain patients and also specific chronic pain diagnostic categories. Patients.? Original LANSS data from a previous study of 2,480 patients with chronic pain were used. Specific diagnostic groups examined included diabetic neuropathy, postsurgical pain, osteoarthritis, posttraumatic injury, and low back pain. Outcome Measures.? The following assessments were made: fit to the Rasch model, scale reliability, scale multi-dimensionality, and differential item functioning. Results.? The overall fit to the Rasch model was only acceptable in two groups; diabetic neuropathy and chronic postsurgical pain. For these groups, the scale is unidimensional (measures a single construct) and there is no evidence of differential item functioning across gender and age groups. The scale only has reliability consistent with use at the group level. Conclusions.? Neuropathic screening tools such as the LANSS have been used as outcome measures in clinical studies. Rasch analysis demonstrates that the LANSS can be used as such in specific populations of patients with neuropathic pain, however it's reliability in this context does not support use at the individual level and it cannot be used as a generalised measurement tool across pain diagnostic groups. The LANSS remains primarily a diagnostic tool.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, the author reframes the self-preservation system and moves it away from the natural vital order to show how it is a vital body set-up derived from the other who regulates the biological processes through attachment and cultural habit. She also identifies how the relation with the other, and therefore also a vital set-up, results in deregulation which is both sexual and related to trauma. A state of Unheimlich can be interpreted as a state of feeling not at home in the hearth of the home; it is used in the discussion of the somatic symptom to suggest feeling radically estranged on somatic sensory states and in one's own body, bringing otherness, which is at the heart of somatic being, to the fore. In the context of the uncanny, it means feeling uncomfortable and strange in one's own body.

AB  - Abstract Neck pain and whiplash injuries are a common presentation to the ED, and a frequent cause of disability globally. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of musculoskeletal neck pain in the ED. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years addressing acute neck pain assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate levels of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2080 articles, of which 51 were included (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?13 systematic reviews and n?=?16 guidelines). Consistent evidence was found to support the use of ?red flags? to screen for serious pathologies, judicious use of imaging through clinical decision rule application and promotion of functional exercise coupled with advice and reassurance. Clinicians may also consider applying risk-stratification methods, such as using a clinical prediction rule, to guide patient discharge and referral plans; however, the evidence is still emerging in this population. This rapid review provides clinicians managing neck pain in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Scaffolds play a key role in the field of tissue engineering. Particularly for meniscus replacement, optimal scaffold properties are critical. The aim of our study was to develop a novel scaffold for replacement of meniscal tissue by means of tissue engineering. Emphasis was put on biomechanical properties comparable to native meniscus, nonimmunogenecity, and the possibility of seeding cells into and cultivating them within the scaffold (nontoxicity). For this purpose, native ovine menisci were treated in vitro in a self-developed enzymatic process. Complete cell removal was achieved and shown both histologically and electron microscopically (n?=?15). Immunohistochemical reaction (MHC 1/MHC 2) was positive for native ovine meniscus and negative for the scaffold. Compared to native meniscus (25.8 N/mm) stiffness of the scaffold was significantly increased (30.2 N/mm, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). We determined the compression (%) of the native meniscus and the scaffold under a load of 7 N. The compression was 23% for native meniscus and 29% for the scaffold (p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Residual force of the scaffold was significantly lower (5.2 N vs. 4.9 N, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Autologous fibrochondrocytes were needle injected and successfully cultivated within the scaffolds over a period of 4 weeks (n?=?10). To our knowledge, this study is the first to remove cells and immunogenetic proteins (MHC 1/MHC 2) completely out of native meniscus and preserve important biomechanical properties. Also, injected cells could be successfully cultivated within the scaffold. Further in vitro and in vivo animal studies are necessary to establish optimal cell sources, sterilization, and seeding techniques. Cell differentiation, matrix production, in vivo remodeling of the construct, and possible immunological reactions after implantation are subject of further studies. ? 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract:? First described in the 1500s, scurvy is infrequently seen in industrialized countries today, although vulnerable patient groups remain. A 15-yr-old girl underwent liver transplantation at age 26?months for a primary diagnosis of biliary hypoplasia, and subsequently developed late allograft failure and progressive renal insufficiency culminating in listing for combined liver retransplantation and kidney transplantation at age 13?yr. She required regular hemodialysis treatment for 12?months prior to deceased donor organ availability, with a complicated clinical course including recurrent septic episodes and severe cachexia. Ten months after initiation of hemodialysis, she presented with severe bone pain, purpura, ecchymoses, gingival hyperplasia, mucosal bleeding, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Serial serum ascorbic acid levels were found to be extremely low (<10??mol/L) despite routine supplementation both in her dialysate and via regular oral supplementation. Histopathology from skin biopsy revealed purpura, hyper- and parakeratosis, and follicular plugging. She had ECG and 2D echocardiogram disturbances, as well as osteopenia and sclerosis of the extremities on radiological evaluations. Therapy with high-dose ascorbic acid (1?g/day orally) led to complete resolution of skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of awareness and recognition of this historic diagnosis, and particularly in children with end-stage organ disease with severely compromised nutrition.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Laryngotracheal stenosis is a complex problem resulting most often from intubation, trauma,or autoimmune disease. Management options include dilation or airway reconstruction including laryngotracheoplasty (LTP), cricotracheal resection (CTR), and tracheal resection (TR). We describe our experience with management of this difficult problem. Study Design: Retrospective chart review of patients treated for laryngotracheal stenosis between January 1995 and July 2005 at an academic, tertiary referral center. Methods: A total of 127 patients were treated during the study period. Patients were followed, and hospital records were reviewed. Results: There were 38 male and 89 female patients with an average age of 55.5 years treated for laryngotracheal stenosis resulting from intubation (64), idiopathic (25) or autoimmune disease (18), radiation (9), trauma (5), prior surgery (4), and relapsing polychondritis (2). Thirty-three percent were treated for grade I stenosis, 44% grade II, 19% grade III, and 4% grade IV. Seventy percent of patients undergoing initial dilation required a subsequent procedure. LTP, CTR, or TR was performed in 43%, 48%, 71%, and 100% of patients with grade I through IV stenosis, respectively. Among 76 patients undergoing LTP, CTR, or TR, 24 (32%) required a subsequent intervention. Among 36 patients treated with primary LTP, CTR, or TR, only 10 (28%) required further therapy. Twenty-two of 35 (63%) tracheostomy-dependent patients were ultimately decannulated. Three patients died in the immediate postoperative period. Conclusions: Patients undergoing dilation for laryngotracheal stenosis require multiple procedures. However, major reconstructive procedures are well tolerated and currently represent a viable primary treatment for laryngotracheal stenosis.
