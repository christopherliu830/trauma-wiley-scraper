AB  - We present a young man who developed fat embolism syndrome following a fractured femoral shaft. By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - SYNOPSISThis study attempts to replicate and synthesize previous headache/MMPI research by investigating scale differences amongst diagnoses and between a control group; re-examining the occurrence of the conversion ?V? pattern; evaluating the Kudrow-Sutkus (1979) classification system; measuring score changes which occur with prognosis; and observing the effect that ?headache items? have on scale score elevations. Several mean scale scores differed from previous studies. A number of these differences were clinically significant. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (sex [370 males and females] and headache diagnosis) for each scale determined that males had higher L scores; the control group had higher K scores than post trauma, mixed, or vascular patients; each headache diagnosis had higher 1, 2, 3, and 7 scores than the control group (scales 1, 2, and 3 were clinically elevated in only the post trauma and mixed conditions); scale 9 scores varied between conditions; and scale 10 scores were higher for migraine, mixed, cluster, and post trauma patients. Chi-square analysis determined that the conversion ?;V? pattern occurred in a significantly greater degree in headache patients. However, the percentage of occurrence ranged from only 12.50 to 31.03 percent. The Kudrow-Sutkus system correctly diagnosed only 40.08 percent of 90 randomly selected subjects. One-way ANOVA determined that no significant change occurred in group scale scores in 20 headache sufferers who received treatment ranging from a multi-disciplinary hospital program to none at all and whose prognosis ranged from excellent to poor. One-way ANOVA determined that the removal of items which inquire about ?headache symptoms? produced significant reductions on scales 1 and 3.The inability of this study to replicate previous empirical investigations raises questions of the MMPI's reliability as a diagnostic classifier in chronic headache. Certain elevations on the MMPI may be the result of symptom measurement and not psychopathology.

AB  - Abstract Young separated refugees are exiled from familiar places and on seeking asylum encounter new, potentially alienating, places. Yet, there is limited research regarding the effects of location on the psychological experiences of young separated refugees. This study explores the relationships that young adults who arrived in the UK as separated refugees have with the spaces that they inhabit and the consequences of these. It draws on qualitative interviews with young men from Iraq and Afghanistan who are living in London. Four key themes emerged from the analysis. Participants felt frustrated in bureaucratic settings where processes of labelling and physical manipulation prevented their sense of subjectivity from being expressed. Certain community spaces offered a rich range of support. Micro-spaces of belonging and embodied processes of exploration in the wider community were also reported to be psychologically beneficial. The themes suggest that considerations of young separated refugees' relations to place may provide alternative psychological understandings of their experiences, particularly in relation to concepts such as trauma. Policy implications related to immigration control and the benefits of community projects are highlighted. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper explores user-driven organizational change in the National Health Service (NHS). The NHS Plan (Department of Health, 2000) created Patient Advice and Liaison Services (PALS) to provide information, solve problems and drive user-led change. Evidence is drawn from a study of PALS in London acute, primary care, mental health and specialist trusts, drawing on discussion forums, interviews with PALS officers and documentation. From context and role profiles, two conclusions are evident. First, organizational instability, boundary disputes, variable management support, resource limitations, financial insecurity and multi-site working characterize the context in which PALS operate, and the officer role is characterized by problem diversity, overlap with complaints systems, monitoring problems, relationship building and ?serial users?. Second, these context and role attributes restrict PALS to ?repair and maintenance?, ensuring that established systems work correctly. While PALS sit on the bottom rung of a ?participation ladder?, their contribution is more than tokenistic. However, a processual perspective demonstrates how a fluid, networked, and diversified context isolates PALS structures from management decision-making, constraining their power base, and inhibiting the promotion of substantive change agendas.

AB  - Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, is now a widely used tool in pre-operative planning, surgical teaching and simulator training. However, 3D printing technology that produces models with accurate haptic feedback, biomechanics and visuals for the training surgeon is not currently available. Challenges and opportunities in creating such surgical models will be discussed in this review paper. Surgery requires proper tissue handling as well as knowledge of relevant anatomy. To prepare doctors properly, training models need to take into account the biomechanical properties of the anatomical structures that will be manipulated in any given operation. This review summarises and evaluates the current biomechanical literature as it relates to human tissues and correlates the impact of this knowledge on developing high fidelity 3D printed surgical training models. We conclude that, currently, a printer technology has not yet been developed which can replicate many of the critical qualities of human tissue. Advances in 3D printing technology will be required to allow the printing of multi-material products to achieve the mechanical properties required.

AB  - Background Various treatments are available for ear mite infestations in dogs. Objective The efficacy of sarolaner was evaluated against ear mite infestation caused by Otodectes cynotis in dogs and compared with topical moxidectin/imidacloprid in a single-masked, multi-centre field study. Animals Client-owned dogs with O. cynotis infestation were treated monthly with oral sarolaner (n = 163) or topical moxidectin/imidacloprid (n = 78). Methods The presence of mites in the ear canals and the clinical signs associated with otoacariasis (including head shaking, pruritus/ear scratching, trauma or alopecia of the pinnae, and erythema, ulceration and debris in the ear canals) was evaluated on days 0, 14 and 30, and, if applicable, on day 60. Dogs were considered cured of mite infestation following one (on day 0) or two (on days 0 and 30) monthly treatments, if no live mites were found in either ear. Non-inferiority was evaluated at days 14 and 30. Results Parasitological cure was achieved in 76.4%, 90.5% and 93.3% of the sarolaner-treated and in 53.9%, 63.5% and 66.7% of the moxidectin/imidacloprid-treated dogs on days 14, 30 and 60, respectively. At study completion, on day 60 at the latest, parasitological cure was achieved overall in 99.4% of sarolaner-treated and 87.8% of moxidectin/imidacloprid-treated cases. The parasitological cure rate for sarolaner was non-inferior to moxidectin/imidacloprid at days 14 and 30. The clinical signs of otoacariasis improved throughout the study in both groups. There were no treatment-related adverse events. Conclusions A single oral administration of sarolaner was safe and highly effective in the treatment of O. cynotis infestation in dogs.

AB  - Abstract ?-Secretase is an aspartyl protease composed of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), APH1, and PEN2. These proteins assemble into a membrane complex that cleaves a variety of substrates within the transmembrane domain. The ?-secretase cleavage products play an important role in various biological processes such as embryonic development and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The major role of ?-secretase in brain pathology has been linked to AD and to the production of the amyloid ?-peptide. However, little is known about the possible role of ?-secretase following acute brain insult. Here we examined by immunostaining the expression patterns of two ?-secretase components, PS1 and Nct, in three paradigms of brain insult in mice: closed head injury, intracerebroventricular injection of LPS, and brain stabbing. Our results show that in naïve and sham-injured brains expression of PS1 and Nct is restricted mainly to neurons. However, following insult, the expression of both proteins is also observed in nonneuronal cells, consisting of activated astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, the proteins are coexpressed within the same astrocytes and microglia, implying that these cells exhibit an enhanced ?-secretase activity following brain damage. In view of the important role played by astrocytes and microglia in brain disorders, our findings suggest that ?-secretase may participate in brain damage and repair processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation and/or function. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Craniocerebral trauma is a serious disease accompanied with mechanical damage, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3), an abundant circRNA, exerts the function in promoting cell growth. Therefore, we aimed to explore the biological roles and mechanism of circHIPK3 on cell damage in craniocerebral trauma. PC-12 cells were cotransfected with PLCDH-cirHIPK3 and microRNA-455 (miR-455) inhibitor and then were treated with H2O2 for 24?hours. Cell viability, apoptosis and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were tested through trypan blue staining, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species assay, respectively. Expression of circHIPK3 and miR-455 were tested through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression of pro-PARP, cleaved-PARP, pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9, ?-actin, beclin-1, p62, light chain 3-I (LC3-I), LC3-II, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), t-extracellular-regulated kinase (t-ERK) and p-ERK were tested via Western blot experiments. The 100??M H2O2-induced cell damage presented as reducing cell viability, increasing apoptosis, autophagy, and MFI. Besides, H2O2 could downregulate circHIPK3. However, overexpression of circHIPK3 attenuated cell damage caused by H2O2 that it increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis, autophagy and MFI through upregulating miR-455. Additionally, circHIPK3 overexpression promoted the activation of Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulating miR-455. Our study demonstrated that circHIPK3 attenuated H2O2-induced cell damage and activated Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulation of miR-455.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Bipolar disorder is marked by progressive symptomatic changes, which have been linked with episode-related structural findings?particularly in the prefrontal cortex. However, few studies have examined neurofunctional and neurochemical effects of disease burden. In this study, we compared first- and multi-episode bipolar individuals. We hypothesized that the latter would demonstrate evidence of neurophysiological differences consistent with a model of progressive functional degradation of these networks. Methods First- and multi-episode manic bipolar subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) including a continuous performance task with emotional distractors, and in single-voxel (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A priori fMRI regions-of-interest (ROI) included structures comprising prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks; (1H)MRS voxels were placed within bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both ROI and voxel-based brain activation in response to emotional stimuli, and neurochemical concentrations derived from (1H)MRS were compared across bipolar groups. Results Multi-episode bipolar subjects showed relatively lower regional activation across prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks, including bilateral VLPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, putamen, caudate, and amygdala. Exploratory whole-brain, voxel-based analysis suggested additional areas of lower activation extending into Brodmann area 22, posterior parietal regions, and right thalamus. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations were also relatively lower in the ACC of multi-episode subjects. Conclusions Disease burden, exemplified by multiple affective episodes is associated with evidence of widespread decrements in affective network activity. Lower ACC NAA concentration is similarly consistent with a model of progressive functional deficits. These findings support the functional significance of previously observed progressive structural changes throughout these regions.

AB  - Abstract A case of complex microsurgical reconstruction of the dorsum of the foot, including tendon transfer following tumor resection, in a 15-week-old male infant is presented. After birth, a 5.5 ? 4 cm large tumor was observed on the dorsum of the right foot. Biopsy showed a congenital malignant fibro sarcoma. After initial chemotherapy a radical excision of the tumor at the age of 14 weeks was followed. To cover the defect a musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap was taken, the cutaneous part being large enough to cover the defect. Extensor tendons were reconstructed with free tendon transplants. Amputation is usually indicated in these cases. To the best of our knowledge, microsurgical reconstruction in infants at this age with congenital malignant tumors has not yet been reported. The case shows that Plastic surgery can play an important role in pediatric oncology and should routinely be integrated into the multi-modal treatment concepts. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The concept that the mammalian glycoprotein vitronectin acts as a biological ?glue? and key controller of mammalian tissue repair and remodelling activity is emerging from nearly 50 years of experimental in vitro and in vivo data. Unexpectedly, the vitronectin-knockout (VN-KO) mouse was found to be viable and to have largely normal phenotype. However, diligent observation revealed that the VN-KO animal exhibits delayed coagulation and poor wound healing. This is interpreted to indicate that VN occupies a role in the earliest events of thrombogenesis and tissue repair. VN is the foundation upon which the thrombus grows in an organised structure. In addition to sealing the wound, the thrombus also serves to protect the underlying tissue from oxidation, is a reservoir of mitogens and tissue repair mediators, and provides a provisional scaffold for the repairing tissue. In the absence of VN (e.g., VN-KO animal), this cascade is disrupted before it begins. A wide variety of biologically active species associate with VN. Although initial studies were focused on mitogens, other classes of bioactives (e.g., glycosaminoglycans and metalloproteinases) are now also known to specifically interact with VN. Although some interactions are transient, others are long-lived and often result in multi-protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes provide several advantages: prolonging molecular interactions, sustaining local concentrations, facilitating co-stimulation of cell surface receptors and thereby enhancing cellular/biological responses. We contend that these, or equivalent, multi-protein complexes facilitate VN polyfunctionality in vivo. It is also likely that many of the species demonstrated to associate with VN in vitro, also associate with VN in vivo in similar multi-protein complexes. Thus, the predominant biological function of VN is that of a master controller of the extracellular environment; informing, and possibly instructing cells ?where? to behave, ?when? to behave and ?how? to behave (i.e., appropriately for the current circumstance). ? 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(10):807-818, 2013

AB  - Abstract The impact of trauma experiences on neurodevelopment (child development in general) appears to be a central component in understanding the etiology of sexual behavior problems and therefore is a key area to address in the treatment of these problems. Research from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network identified the seven most frequent types of developmental insults that contribute to behavioral difficulties in children. These developmental insults are emotional abuse, the loss of important relationships, impaired caregivers, exposure to domestic violence, sexual abuse, neglect, and physical abuse. This chapter suggests that at least five of these 'developmental insults' directly involve disruptions in early attachment relationships and that depending on the circumstances, all seven of these experiences may directly involve the nature of the parent-child interaction and the attachment relationship. Emotional and behavioral regulation, promoted by a sense of safety and parental engagement, are important developmental foundations for pro-social functioning.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Disentangling the putative impact of cannabis on brain morphology from other comorbid substance use is critical. After controlling for the effects of nicotine, alcohol and multi-substance use, this study aimed to determine whether frequent cannabis use is associated with significantly smaller subcortical grey matter volumes. Design Exploratory analyses using mixed linear models, one per region of interest (ROI), were performed whereby individual differences in volume (outcome) at seven subcortical ROIs were regressed onto cannabis and comorbid substance use (predictors). Setting Two large population-based twin samples from the United States and Australia. Participants A total of 622 young Australian adults [66% female; ?age = 25.9, standard deviation SD) = 3.6] and 474 middle-aged US males (?age = 56.1SD = 2.6) of predominately Anglo-Saxon ancestry with complete substance use and imaging data. Subjects with a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury were excluded. Measurements Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and volumetric segmentation methods were used to estimate volume in seven subcortical ROIs: thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Substance use measurements included maximum nicotine and alcohol use, total life-time multi-substance use, maximum cannabis use in the young adults and regular cannabis use in the middle-aged males. Findings After correcting for multiple testing (P = 0.007), cannabis use was unrelated to any subcortical ROI. However, maximum nicotine use was associated with significantly smaller thalamus volumes in middle-aged males. Conclusions In exploratory analyses based on young adult and middle-aged samples, normal variation in cannabis use is unrelated statistically to individual differences in brain morphology as measured by subcortical volume.

AB  - Abstract The task of this paper is to present a message of caution regarding the overgeneralized reliance on the NICE (2005) and CREST (2003) recommendations for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults in the United Kingdom. The socio-political and ethnocultural context of Northern Ireland is used as a foundation to explore the generalizibility of guideline recommendations. It is argued that clinicians should be mindful of the degree to which they generalize from the recommendations of these guidelines to their clinical work because (1) questions regarding the heterogeneity of PTSD raise as yet unaddressed empirical questions about the generalizability of treatments to all PTSD presentations and (2) ethnocultural and socio-political factors have not yet played a dominant role in randomized outcome studies of treatment efficacy.?Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.
