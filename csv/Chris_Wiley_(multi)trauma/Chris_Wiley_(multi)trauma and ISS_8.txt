AB  - ABSTRACT Background? Evidence suggests that brief interventions in the trauma care setting reduce drinking, subsequent injury and driving under the influence (DUI) arrest. However, evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions in ethnic minority groups is lacking. The current study evaluates the efficacy of brief intervention among whites, blacks and Hispanics in the United States. Methods? We conducted a two-group parallel randomized trial comparing brief motivational intervention (BMI) and treatment as usual with assessment (TAU+) to evaluate treatment differences in drinking patterns by ethnicity. Patients were recruited from a level 1 urban trauma center over a 2-year period. The study included 1493 trauma patients, including 668 whites, 288 blacks and 537 Hispanics. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to evaluate ethnic differences in drinking outcomes including volume per week, maximum amount consumed in 1 day, percentage days abstinent and percentage days heavy drinking at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Analyses controlled for age, gender, employment status, marital status, prior alcohol treatment, type of injury and injury severity. Special emphasis was given to potential ethnic differences by testing the interaction between ethnicity and BMI. Results? At 6- and 12-month follow-up, BMI significantly reduced maximum amount consumed in 1 day (P?<?0.001; P?<?0.001, respectively) and percentage days heavy drinking (P?<?0.05; P?<?0.05, respectively) among Hispanics. Hispanics in the BMI group also reduced average volume per week at 12-month follow-up (?2?=?6.8, df?=?1, P?<?0.01). In addition, Hispanics in TAU+ reduced maximum amount consumed at 6- and 12-month follow-up (P?<?0.001; P?<?0.001) and volume per week at 12-month follow-up (P?<?0.001). Whites and blacks in both BMI and TAU+ reduced volume per week and percentage days heavy drinking at 12-month follow-up (P?<?0.001; P?<?0.01, respectively) and decreased maximum amount at 6- (P?<?0.001) and 12-month follow-up (P?<?0.001). All three ethnic groups In both BMI and TAU+ reduced volume per week at 6-month follow-up (P?<?0.001) and percentage days abstinent at 6- (P?<?0.001) and 12-month follow-up (P?<?0.001). Conclusions? All three ethnic groups evidenced reductions in drinking at 6- and 12-month follow-up independent of treatment assignment. Among Hispanics, BMI reduced alcohol intake significantly as measured by average volume per week, percentage days heavy drinking and maximum amount consumed in 1 day.

Management of maxillofacial trauma in this population may be complicated by coexisting medical conditions, requiring multi-disciplinary care. Methods:? This retrospective audit assesses the incidence and pattern of maxillofacial trauma in elderly patients (≥60?years) presented to the Merseyside Regional Maxillofacial Unit. Over the time period of 2003, 2004 and 2005, 7905 trauma patients presented to the accident and emergency department, of whom 757 were elderly (10%). Results:? Results indicated that the male to female ratio was 1:1.4. The commonest cause of injury was a fall (83%) followed by an assault (6%); the majority of falls occurring in the home. Conclusion:? Management of maxillofacial injuries in this population should focus on targeted prevention programmes, which address known risk factors for falling. We believe that this is a public health issue. Members of the maxillofacial team should be aware of common risk factors of falls in elderly. Better collaboration with the Medicine for Elderly team should be considered at an early stage on managing these patients.

AB  - Abstract Aim? An analysis of a multi-centred database of trauma patients was performed. Method? The study used data from a prospective multi-centre trauma database containing details of 52?887 trauma patients admitted to participating Scottish Hospitals over an 11-year period. Results? Three hundred and forty (0.64%) of 52?887 trauma patients (284 male) with colorectal injuries were identified; 43.9% of colorectal injuries occurred following blunt trauma and 56.1% following penetrating injury. Patients in the latter group were younger, had less haemodynamic compromise and were less likely to die than those with blunt trauma (P?<?0.01). The overall mortality rate was 25.6% and after rectal injury it was 21.2% (P?>?0.05). Female gender, increased age, road traffic accidents and those admitted as a result of a blunt traumatic injury were associated with increased mortality. Age?>?65?years (P?=?0.01), increasing injury severity score (ISS) at presentation (P?<?0.001), haemodynamic compromise (P?=?0.045) and decreased Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) (P?<?0.001) had the strongest independent associations with mortality. Conclusion? Colorectal injury after trauma has a high morbidity. Clinical features associated with death allow stratification of mortality risk.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Hundreds of thousands of children are confronted with traumatic experiences each year in the United States. As trauma-informed care begins to take hold in schools, school mental health providers (e.g., school psychologists, counselors, and social workers) desire concrete service-delivery options for students affected by trauma. This article provides examples from the literature via a narrative review of assessment, intervention, and practitioner support options related to childhood trauma. Specific attention is paid to framing concrete school-based trauma service-delivery options within a multitiered systems of support model to align with existing school practices. Given the large amount of literature on this topic, this article aims to reduce the barriers practitioners face when looking to implement trauma services in their schools by organizing example practices from the literature in a commonly used service-delivery framework.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To determine the utility of the ED physical examination and laboratory analysis in screening hospitalized pediatric blunt trauma patients for intra-abdominal injuries (IAIs). Methods: The authors reviewed the records of all patients aged <15 years who sustained blunt traumatic injury and were admitted to a Level 1 trauma center over a four-year period. Patients were considered high-risk for IAI if they had any of the following at ED presentation: decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 15), abdominal pain, tenderness on abdominal examination, or gross hematuria. Patients without any of these findings were considered moderate risk for IAI. The authors compared moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs with regard to physical examination and laboratory findings obtained in the ED. Results: Of 1,040 children with blunt trauma, 559 (54%) were high-risk and 481 (46%) were moderate-risk for IAI. 126 (23%) of the high-risk and 22 (4.6%) of the moderate-risk patients had IAIs. Among moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs, those with IAIs were more likely to have abdominal abrasions (5/22 vs 34/459, p = 0.008), an abnormal chest examination (11/22 vs 86/457, p = 0.01), higher mean serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (604 U/L vs 77 U/L, p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (276 U/L vs 39 U/L, p = 0.002), higher mean white blood cell (WBC) counts (16.3 K/mm3 vs 12.8 K/mm3, p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of >5 RBCs/hpf on urinalysis (7/22 vs 54/427, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs in initial serum concentrations of amylase, initial hematocrit, drop in hematocrit >5 percentage points in the ED, or initial serum bicarbonate concentrations. Conclusion: In children hospitalized for blunt torso trauma who are at moderate risk for IAI, ED findings of abdominal abrasions, an abnormal chest examination, and microscopic hematuria as well as elevated levels of AST and ALT, and elevated WBC count are associated with IAI.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic injury can lead to dysregulation of the normal clotting system, resulting in hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Platelet activation is robust following traumatic injury and one process of platelet activation is to release of extracellular vesicles (PEV) that carry heterogenous cargo loads and surface ligands. Objectives We sought to investigate and characterize the release and function of PEVs generated following traumatic injury. Methods PEV content and quantity in circulation following trauma in humans and mice was measured using flow cytometry, size exclusion chromatography, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. PEVs were isolated from circulation and the effects on thrombin generation, bleeding time, hemorrhage control, and thrombus formation were determined. Finally, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on PEV release and thrombosis were examined. Results Human and murine trauma results in a significant release of PEVs into circulation compared with healthy controls. These PEVs result in abundant thrombin generation, increased platelet aggregation, decreased bleeding times, and decreased hemorrhage in uncontrolled bleeding. Conversely, PEVs contributed to enhanced venous thrombus formation and were recruited to the developing thrombus site. Interestingly, HCQ treatment resulted in decreased platelet aggregation, decreased PEV release, and reduced deep vein thrombosis burden in mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that trauma results in significant release of PEVs which are both pro-hemostatic and pro-thrombotic. The effects of PEVs can be mitigated by treatment with HCQ, suggesting the potential use as a form of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

AB  - Abstract ? Displacement injuries of permanent teeth are an increasing emergency in the dental office. Children and adolescents are particularly prone to dental trauma due to participation in risky activitiess. Repositioning or replantation with subsequent stabilization by a dental splint is the standard of care for most displaced or avulsed permanent teeth. Non-rigid fixation allowing physiologic tooth mobility has been shown to be desirable for periodontal healing. A flexible splint of short duration appears to reduce the risk of dentoalveolar ankylosis or external replacement resorption. Different splinting techniques are currently recommended for stabilization of repositioned or replanted teeth, including a wire-composite splint, an orthodontic bracket splint or a resin splint. Each splinting option has its specific advantages and shortcomings. This paper describes a new splinting technique which offers improved comfort and handling to the patient and dentist alike.

AB  - Summary Tranexamic acid is used both pre-hospital and in-hospital as an antifibrinolytic drug to treat or prevent hyperfibrinolysis in trauma patients; dosing, however, remains empirical. We aimed to measure plasma levels of tranexamic acid in patients receiving pre-hospital anti-hyperfibrinolytic therapy and to build a population pharmacokinetic model to propose an optimised dosing regimen. Seventy-three trauma patients were enrolled and each received tranexamic acid 1 g intravenously pre-hospital. A blood sample was drawn after arrival in the emergency department, and we measured the plasma tranexamic acid concentration using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and modelled the data using non-linear mixed effect modelling. Tranexamic acid was administered at a median (IQR [range]) time of 43 (30?55 [5?135]) min after trauma. Plasma tranexamic acid levels were determined on arrival at hospital, 57 (43?70 [20?148]) min after pre-hospital administration of the drug. The measured concentration was 28.7 (21.5?38.5 [8.7?89.0]) ?g.ml?1. Our subjects had sustained severe trauma; injury severity score 20 (16?29 [5?75]), including penetrating injury in 2.8% and isolated traumatic brain injury in 19.7%. The pharmacokinetics were ascribed a two-compartment open model with body-weight as the main covariate. As tranexamic acid concentrations may fall below therapeutic levels during initial hospital treatment, we propose additional dosing schemes to maintain a specific target blood concentration for as long as required. This is the first study to investigate plasma level and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after pre-hospital administration in trauma patients. Our proposed dosing regimen could be used in subsequent clinical trials to better study efficacy and tolerance profiles with controlled blood concentrations.

AB  - Abstract Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increases the risk of mortality in trauma patients. To decrease the occurrence of VTE, low dose anticoagulants are commonly prescribed. This may be unacceptable in trauma patients who have a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be employed as an alternative strategy to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Insertion of an IVC filter is an invasive procedure that has a range of complications. The benefits of IVC filter insertion must be compared to its risk of complications in each individual patient. A search of the literature since 2005 was conducted on MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The clinical question posed was does prophylactic IVC filter insertion decrease the risk of PE in trauma patients? The available evidence was low level and unable to definitively answer this question. The majority of articles infer that IVC filter insertion is safe and may decrease the risk of PE. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to be conducted in this area.

AB  - This is the first controlled study of an expressive arts group intervention with unaccompanied minor asylum seeking children. The aim of the study was to examine whether such an intervention may alleviate symptoms of trauma and enhance life satisfaction and hope. One hundred forty five unaccompanied minor refugee boys with their stated age between 15 and 18 were allocated into a 10 session 5 weeks manualized expressive arts intervention (EXIT) or a life as usual (LAU) control group. The participants were assessed at onset and 4 times over a period of 25 months with a battery of instruments measuring post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), general psychological distress (HSCL-25A), current life satisfaction (CLS) and expected life satisfaction (ELS). The instruments were presented in the participants? native languages, using touch-screen laptops and the computer program Multilingual Computer Assisted Interview (MultiCASI). There were significant time by group interactions in favor of the EXIT group for PTSS and CLS. At the end of the follow up the EXIT group had higher life satisfaction and hope for the future than the LAU group. A manualized EXIT group intervention can have a beneficial effect on helping minor refugee boys to cope with symptoms of trauma, strengthen their life satisfaction and develop hope for the future. Our findings support previous studies showing that the arts may help people in reconstructing meaning and connection with others by focusing on resources and creativity.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients, second hits are known to potentiate the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response, thus increasing the risk of multi-organ dysfunction. In accordance with ?damage control orthopaedic surgery? principles, fractures are initially treated with external fixators, which are replaced by internal osteosynthesis once the immunological status of the patient is considered stable. Recently, we demonstrated that a severe trauma impaired the healing of fractures stabilized by external fixation during the entire healing period. The question arose, whether switching to intramedullary nailing increases the inflammatory response in terms of a second hit, leading to a further impairment of bone healing. Wistar rats received a femoral osteotomy stabilized by an external fixator. Simultaneously half of the rats underwent an additional thoracic trauma. After 4 days, the external fixator was replaced by an intramedullary nail in half of the rats of the two groups. The inflammatory response was evaluated by measuring serum C5a levels. Fracture healing was determined by three-point-bending, µCT, and histomorphometry. The thoracic trauma significantly increased C5a concentrations 6, 24, and 72?h after the second surgical intervention. After 40 days, conversion to intramedullary nailing considerably decreased the flexural rigidity of the callus, with no significant differences between rats with or without thoracic trauma. After 47 days, flexural rigidity in rats subjected to conversion remained decreased compared to animals solely treated by external fixation, particularly in combination with blunt chest trauma. The results indicate that accumulation of second hits after multiple injuries could lead to aggravation of the fracture healing outcome. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Volumetric studies on deep gray matter structures in bipolar disorder (BP) have reported contrasting results. Childhood trauma, a relevant environmental stressor for BP, could account for the variability of the results, modulating differences in the amygdala and hippocampus in patients with BP compared with healthy controls (HC). Our study aimed to test this hypothesis. Methods We assessed 105 outpatients, diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) or bipolar disorder type II (BP-II) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria, and 113 HC subjects. History of childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was performed on all subjects and volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus were measured using FreeSurfer. Results Patients with BP showed a global reduction of deep gray matter volumes compared to HCs. However, childhood trauma modulated the impact of the diagnosis specifically on the amygdala and hippocampus. Childhood trauma was associated with bilateral decreased volumes in HCs and increased volumes in patients with BP. Conclusions The results suggest that childhood trauma may have a different effect in health and disease on volumes of gray matter in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are brain areas specifically involved in response to stress and emotion processing.

AB  - Existing research suggests that approximately 19% of females experience childhood sexual trauma (CST). Little is known, however, about the parenting behaviour of mothers who have experienced CST. Using propensity-matched controls, the present study examines prenatal psychosocial distress, postnatal depressive symptomatology, and caregiving behaviours of women reporting CST at or before the age of 14. Data for these analyses were obtained from mother reports and from observational protocols from a longitudinal study of low-income, rural families. Propensity score methodology was used to create a contrast group matched on family of origin variables in an effort to isolate and examine the long-term associations of CST beyond the effects of other childhood adversities such as poverty. Study findings provide evidence that women with CST histories report greater prenatal psychosocial distress compared to women without trauma histories. Findings further provide evidence for a spillover process from prenatal distress to the broader caregiving system including less sensitive parenting through postnatal depressive symptoms for women with CST histories. These results highlight the importance of screening for CST and psychosocial distress and depression prenatally. Interventions for women with CST histories and directions for future study are proposed. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Although uncommon, and despite the modern in diagnostic tools and therapeutic alternatives, retrohepatic and main hepatic veins injury remains associated with high mortality rate. Preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, and bullet trajectory may be a helpful sign in penetrating trauma patients. Patients and Methods? Hospital records of patients sustaining retroheptic vena cava (RHVC) injury were retrospectively reviewed as to diagnosis, associated injuries, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcome, last ten years. Results? Eight male, 17 to 45 (mean 27.5) years-old patients sustaining RHVC injury were reviewed. Mean trauma indexes for the 8 cases were: ISS 36.6, RTS 7.55 and TRISS 89.0; and for the group who died: ISS 41.6, RTS 7.18, and TRISS 80.5. Two patients had sustained blunt trauma (one died), and six had penetrating injuries (two died). The injury diagnosis was achieved during surgery in all cases. A transfixing RHV injury occurred in 4 (50% of the) patients, and was found in all the 3 patients who died. An atriocaval shunt was employed in four patients, 3 of them had with transfixing injury with two deaths. The number of associated injuries was higher in the patients who died. Overall mortality rate was 37.5%. Comments? Despite advances in image diagnosis, injuries to RHVC are frequently diagnosed during surgery. Tangential injuries were managed with direct approach and sutures, and to control blending in transfixing injuries, were managed with atriocaval shunts, before suture. Conclusion? Despite improvements in its diagnosis and management, RHVC injuries remain with a high mortality rate, mainly when transfixing, and associated with numerous associated injuries.
