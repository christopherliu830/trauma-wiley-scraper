AB  - Objectives This study investigated the prevalence of, and multi-dimensional factors associated with, unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with regular male sexual partners (?regular partners?) and nonregular male sexual partners (?nonregular partners?) among newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in Chengdu, China. Methods A total of 225 newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM were interviewed using a combined interviewer?computer-assisted method in Chengdu, China. Results The prevalence of UAI with regular and nonregular partners since diagnosis was 27.7% and 33.8% among participants reporting having sex with regular and nonregular partners (n = 159 and 133), respectively. Adjusted analysis showed that: (1) cognitive variables based on the Health Belief Model (perceived susceptibility to HIV transmission and perceived severity of the consequences of HIV transmission, perceived barriers and perceived self-efficacy related to consistent condom use), (2) emotion-related variables (worry about transmitting HIV to others), (3) psychological factors (post-traumatic growth) and (4) socio-structural factors (perceived partners? responsibility for condom use) were significantly associated with UAI with regular and/or nonregular partners. Conclusions Interventions are warranted, and should be designed with consideration of multi-dimensional factors and be partner type-specific.

AB  - Abstract Background A descriptive epidemiologic analysis of the characteristics of workplace-based multiple fatality incidents in China can contribute to a scientific basis for the prevention and control of such fatal incidents as well for as the facilitation of medical assistance during these episodes. Methods We used data on workplace-based multiple fatality incidents spanning January 1, 2001?December 31, 2008 as collected by the National Work Safety Administration of China to analyze event frequency, type, number of deaths, mortality rate (per million persons), and regional distribution. Results A total of 17,277 workplace-based multiple fatality incidents were reported between 2001 and 2008, which were associated with 62,850 deaths and 30,418 injuries. The most common types or settings associated with workplace-based multiple fatality incidents were road traffic accidents (>3 deaths only; total 23,464 deaths), coal mine explosions (23,418 deaths), and incidents involving shipping (3,978 deaths). Conclusion The risk for workplace-based multiple fatality incidents in China is one of the highest in the world. Prevention is critical and should be strengthened. Our results may provide useful information help to improve prevention and control measures. Am. J. Ind. Med. 54:560?564, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Clinical quality registries gather and analyse information to monitor and enhance the quality of care received by patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the attributes of Australian clinical registries to identify their capacity to accurately assess quality of care. Methods:? A survey was distributed to registry custodians managing multi-site clinical outcome registries. They were asked to self-report on general aspects of registries, including coverage, length of operation, data collection process, data management, quality of data and registry governance structures. Results:? A total of 28 registries were identified and all provided responses to the survey. The majority of the registries require modifications to their procedures in order to provide useful and reliable information for quality improvement purposes. Thirteen registries (46%) did not assess or recruited fewer than 80% of the eligible population and 23 (82%) did not formally audit reliability of coding at the clinical level. Five (18%) did not collect the information required for basic risk adjustment of outcome measures. While most registries produced reports for providers and interested parties, the approach to disseminating this information was highly variable. Conclusion:? Clinical registries provide the most credible information about quality of care. However, most key registries in Australia require some adaptation of procedures in order to accomplish this task. Funding should be provided to enable registries to make the necessary changes.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, and interventional radiology. Patients with flow-limiting intimal defects should be explored. Posterior knee dislocation is associated with popliteal arterial injuries. These patients should undergo diagnostic imaging to rule out popliteal artery injury. Good diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) angiographic extremity examinations require careful patient preparation, to give images that will provide the necessary information. The use of abdominal ultrasound for detecting the need for operative intervention in a patient who has sustained a penetrating trauma to the abdomen carries a low sensitivity and a high specificity. A normal ultrasound examination of the thoracic cavity demonstrates the rib, the sliding of the pleura, and the presence of a comet tail artifact. Sternal fracture is a diagnosis that can be made using ultrasound, and some reports suggest that ultrasound is more sensitive and specific for this injury than plain radiology.

AB  - Background: A therapeutic model for supporting families of children with a chronic illness or disability is described. The model presupposes that the chronic illness and/or disability of a child constitutes a trauma for the entire family. Method: This paper describes a therapeutic model currently in practice and links it back to psychological dynamics addressed through the clinical interventions and the principles that underlie the model of service. Results: Service delivery comprises the interventions; counselling, psychological first aid, projects, peer groups, parent mentoring, social events and community education. The model is family centred, non-illness specific, preventative, non-linear and flexible. Conclusions: The interventions offered in the model aim to address the psychological dynamics of hope, empowerment, reconnection, coping/resilience and reframing.

AB  - Summary Musculoskeletal imaging has advanced leaps and bounds from the time Roentgen utilized X-rays to obtain a plain radiograph in 1895. This chapter outlines the modalities commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging, including plain radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound (US). It discusses the applications of the above modalities in the diagnosis and management of traumatic injuries, infection, arthritis, and tumors. Plain radiography is a two-dimensional depiction of three-dimensional structures and as such, evaluation of complex areas such as the foot, pelvis, and spine can be suboptimal. CT is also useful for assessment of nontraumatic pathologies like arthritis. MRI is one of the more commonly used imaging modalities in musculoskeletal imaging. US is also useful in dynamic assessment of tendons, ligaments, and joints. Imaging plays a vital role in assessment of musculoskeletal trauma. Musculoskeletal tumors comprise benign and malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors.

AB  - Summary In order to provide optimal care for the volleyball athlete, it is first necessary to understand the injury pattern. Ankle sprains account for approximately half of all acute time-loss injuries in volleyball. Risk factors for sport-related injuries may be generally classified as either ?intrinsic? or ?extrinsic?. The most important risk factor that has been identified for ankle sprains is a previous ankle sprain injury. Several intervention strategies have been proposed based on the typical injury mechanisms and risk factors for ankle sprains. One of the prevention strategies is to teach proper movement, take-off, and landing techniques. Patellar tendinopathy or ?jumper's knee? is the most common overuse injury in volleyball. Perhaps the most important element in preventing jumper's knee is to load the tendon appropriately. Knee injuries, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in particular, occur more frequently among female than among male volleyball players.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aided by the growing interest in the cultural dimensions of psychology, the experiences of psychologists working with communities under wartime duress and in the immediate post-war context have forced us to re-think our understanding of trauma and psychotherapeutic intervention. Recognizing the role of culture has allowed us to rethink trauma-in-context, how people and communities understand trauma, and how to explore the most effective psychotherapeutic treatments in these post-war cultural contexts. Dawes and Honwana (Children, culture and mental health: Interventions in Conditions of War. In B. Efraime Jr, P. Riedesser, J. Walter, H. Adam, & P. Steudtner (Eds), Children, war and persecution ? rebuilding hope. Maputo: Rebuilding Hope, 1998) suggest a holistic view of the individual-in-context in order to fully understand the meaning an individual brings and gives to a stressful experience. This perspective allows also for an understanding of the healing resources within a community available to the individual, and the psychologist, dealing with a traumatic event. By exploring both the universal and specific cultural dimensions of trauma, while working with former child soldiers on Josina Machel Island, Mozambique, the authors seek to illuminate how these cultural dimensions, and wealth of healing resources, shaped their understanding of culture in the treatment process and the creation of treatment teams. A comprehensive cultural understanding also allowed the author to use and integrate important cultural dimensions of understanding in to the treatment process to aid in the elaboration of traumatic events associated with being a child soldier. These treatment methods are described via a case example, which represents much of the work carried out with the community of Josina Machel. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives To retrospectively evaluate cases presented for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis for associated complications, identify risk factors associated with complications and to assess ultrasonographic findings and relate these to bacterial culture results. Methods Data on 300 patients presented for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis were retrospectively collected and ultrasonographic images were assessed for defined structural changes. The incidence of major complications was determined. Multi-variable multi-level logistic regression was used to investigate the association of ultrasonographic findings with positive bile culture. Results Three hundred percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis procedures performed in 201 dogs and 51 cats were included; 35 patients had the procedure performed more than once. The overall incidence of major complications was 8 of 300 procedures (2·7%). Bile peritonitis occurred in 2 of 300 procedures (0·7%). An ultrasonographically abnormal gall bladder was found in 52% of cases and had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 82, 55·7 and 61·5% respectively, to predict a positive bile culture. Clinical Significance Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis is overall a safe technique when carried out in selected patients. Abnormal ultrasonographic findings are only a fair predictor of a positive bile culture.

AB  - Abstract The establishment of a long-term, low Earth orbiting outpost has long been a goal of space exploration advocates. A variety of orbiting space stations, envisioned by writers, engineers, and scientists for years, have been developed, launched, and deorbited. The Soviet Union and Russia have flown several Salyut stations and only recently terminated operations of the Mir Space Station. The United State flew three missions on the Skylab Space Station that was launched in 1975. The long developmental history of the International Space Station (ISS) includes many lessons and are discussed. The huge scale of the project offers many engineering, policy, and management lessons for our future endeavors in space. Despite the many challenges and the long development period, the project is now demonstrating great success an overview of the configuration of the ISSW given. The segments contributed by the U.S., Russia, Canada, Europe, and Japan are detailed. These partners have formulated a share agreement to allocate all of the critical ISS resources. In November 2000, the first permanent crew docked with and entered the International Space Station. Since then, the International team has continued to outfit and augment the ISS. At this time, the fifth expedition crew is well into their stay on board the ISS. The results of many years of painstaking work are evident as the ISS flies overhead.

AB  - Summary A 5-year-old Rheinlander gelding was evaluated for left hindlimb stifle lameness. The lameness was localised to the stifle, but source of the lameness was not specifically diagnosed from the physical, radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. Computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography were therefore used for further investigation since these imaging techniques image bony structures, cartilage and soft tissues. This examination showed multiple lesions in the stifle: an osteochondrosis dissecans like lesion of the medial femoral condyle, bony fragments, cartilage trauma and caudal cruciate ligament injury. The prognosis for continuing use as a sports horse was regarded as unfavourable. Therefore, the horse was subjected to euthanasia. All CT findings were confirmed by gross pathology. The CT and CT arthrography examination in this case provided a diagnosis not achieved with other conventional imaging techniques.

AB  - Abstract??? The purpose of this report was to describe the diagnosis and dental treatment of a 2-year-old girl that was involved in a suicide bomb attack. A 14-months-old infant was severely injured when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device inside a crowded bus. Her injury was ?multi-system?, mainly burns and fragments in her face, eyes and other parts of the body. Fifteen months later, she was brought to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry of the Hadassah School of Dental Medicine and the clinical and radiographic examination showed that she was caries free but there were dental trauma injuries to many teeth. Due to her non-cooperative behavior and the extent of treatment the girl was scheduled for a one appointment treatment under deep sedation. Three days later, she was brought to the Emergency Room of the Department of Pediatric Dentistry complaining of pain on the lower left side of the mouth and a swollen vestibule and face could clinically be observed. The lower left first molar that apparently revealed only an enamel fracture and cracks at the time of treatment, actually revealed a necrotic pulp as a result of the blast. As this girl was caries free, and with no history of dental trauma due to any accident, the only explanation for the response of the pulp was the impact of the blast. In conclusion, the reaction of the dental pulp to the blast of an explosion is different than the reaction to other kind of insult and this should be taken in consideration when treating children after this kind of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited, progressive, multi-system lysosomal storage disorders. Musculoskeletal manifestations include nerve entrapment syndromes, most commonly carpal tunnel syndrome. Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) has also been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical course of MPS patients with suspected TTS and to conduct a literature review of TTS in MPS. Methods A review of the Medline and EMBASE databases was conducted in accordance with published guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute of Evidence Based Medicine with search strategy developed by a librarian trained in systematic reviews. A medical record review was undertaken for all patients managed in the multi-disciplinary MPS clinic in a tertiary referral paediatric centre, identifying patients with a suspected or established diagnosis of TTS. Data regarding the demographics, investigations, presentation, management, and clinical course were collected. Results The literature review failed to identify any published papers regarding TTS in MPS, with conference proceedings only identified. Within a cohort of 19 MPS patients, four patients with a suspected diagnosis of TTS were identified (MPS I: two patients, MPS VI: two patients). Three patients underwent surgical tarsal tunnel decompression, two with good result. One patient had overlapping symptoms with spinal stenosis and improvement in suspected tarsal tunnel symptoms following spinal decompression and fusion.

AB  - Abstract Background General practitioners' (GP) views about orthopaedic clinical assessment services (OCAS) managed by physiotherapists in the NHS have seldom been sought, yet GPs are likely to be key referrers to such a service. Aim This study aims to review GP views about an OCAS and how they believed the service could be improved. Design of the Study Fifteen consenting GPs were interviewed utilizing semi-structured interviews and a standardized topic guide. Method Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed for emergent themes. Interviews were analysed sequentially by date performed until saturation. Themes were discussed, and disagreements evaluated until agreement was found between the two main authors. The third author then analysed randomly selected interview transcripts and found no additional themes. Results The study found GPs refer to specialist services, including this OCAS, because of wait times, locality, patient experience, GP experience and knowledge of available services. No GP identified they knew all possible orthopaedic referral routes. Conclusion GPs saw OCAS as another referral choice for patients suffering orthopaedic pathologies. GPs identified some difficulty in understanding the different services including the various professional roles involved. To assist with their understanding, they described requesting advertising of the different services and the clinicians involved or streamlining of services by provider services. Further detailed research addressing the limitations in this research design is indicated to investigate GP's thoughts and behaviours in relation to referral patterns especially as GPs in the UK took on commissioning for services from April 2013.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.

This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.

AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) has increasingly focused on the need for high-quality research in emergency medicine (EM). One important initiative was the establishment of the ACEM Foundation, which among other responsibilities, is required to support clinical research through the provision of research funding and other measures. In February 2015, the Foundation held a Research Forum that was attended by the leading EM researchers from Australasia. The Forum aimed to determine how a productive research culture could be developed within the ACEM. Nine key objectives were determined including that research should be a core business of the ACEM and a core activity of the EM workforce, and that EM research should be sustainable and adequately supported. This report describes the background and conduct of the Forum, its recommendations and the way in which they could be implemented.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents various eye diseases of the goat, such as blindness, cyclopia, tumours of the eyelids, and mycoplasma. There is strong evidence that Mycoplasma conjunctivae is a major causal agent of keratoconjunctivitis in the United Kingdom. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) can cause a mucopurulent conjunctivitis in goats. The cornea of goats is commonly traumatised, often by stalks of hay or straw; overlarge tags on the ears of Angora kids may irritate the eye and the eye will also be damaged when entropion is present. Treatment involves correcting or removing the cause of the trauma and then treating the resultant conjunctivitis or corneal damage. Photosensitisation from whatever cause will affect the head, resulting in swelling of unpigmented skin of the muzzle, drooping ears, and swollen eyelids. Affected animals should be removed from exposure to sunlight and any possible photosensitising substance.

AB  - Minors performing commercial sex acts are deemed victims of human trafficking according to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. However, prosecutors and judges continue to charge and adjudicate American minors as prostitution offenders instead of treating them as sexually exploited youths. These victims have typically suffered from sexual abuse, poverty, and other trauma and are especially vulnerable to pimps and traffickers. They suffer from physical and sexual violence, as well as psychological and emotional problems, thus deserving specialized social services in order to recover their lives. In order to stop the perpetuation and revictimization of sexually exploited youth, states should join the movement in passing Safe Harbor laws, modeled on existing New York law. The law presumes that minors charged with prostitution are victims and children in need of social services and allocates discretion in carefully defined circumstances when a judge concludes a minor charged with prostitution is not capable of rehabilitation by services alone. Key Points for the Family Court Community Several states have passed Safe Harbor legislation which functions to identify minors involved in prostitution as victims of commercial sexual exploitation. In order to best protect victims of sex trafficking, states should follow the progress made by New York and pass Safe Harbor statutes that will create a presumption of immunity for prostituted minors, thus providing discretion to allocate social services or order a juvenile delinquency petition depending on the circumstances of the case.
