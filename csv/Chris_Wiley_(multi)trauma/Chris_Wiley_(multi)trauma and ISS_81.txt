AB  - Abstract In recent years, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) has increasingly focused on the need for high-quality research in emergency medicine (EM). One important initiative was the establishment of the ACEM Foundation, which among other responsibilities, is required to support clinical research through the provision of research funding and other measures. In February 2015, the Foundation held a Research Forum that was attended by the leading EM researchers from Australasia. The Forum aimed to determine how a productive research culture could be developed within the ACEM. Nine key objectives were determined including that research should be a core business of the ACEM and a core activity of the EM workforce, and that EM research should be sustainable and adequately supported. This report describes the background and conduct of the Forum, its recommendations and the way in which they could be implemented.

AB  - Abstract??? This clinical case study describes a multidisciplinary modified technique for the treatment of an oblique root fracture. A-38-year old woman with a history of trauma and a broken tooth was referred to our clinic. There was an oblique crown fracture extending the coronal third of the root just underneath the cingulum of the crown. The patient was willing to keep her tooth in function by any means. Two weeks after root canal therapy the flap was raised. The coronal two third of the root canal was enlarged. An impression of the enlarged root canal and tooth surface with surrounding bone was taken. The flap was sutured and the impression was sent to the laboratory for the post-casting preparation. After 7?days, the flap was opened again and casting was cemented. The flap was sutured. Ten days after the second surgery, three anterior teeth were prepared and a final impression was taken for the preparation of porcelain crowns. Restoration was finished 15?days after the second operation. The patient is still under maintenance therapy and the 12?month results are presented in this report. Extraction may not be the only alternative for the root fractures. Even for fractures under the alveolar margin, alternative multidisciplinary approaches can be used to restore and allow the tooth to survive.

AB  - Abstract Environmental over-stimulation is common in the first few months following severe brain injury. The reduced ability to attend coupled with increased impulsivity, confusion and disinhibition leaves the person with a brain injury in a bewildering world. By limiting stimulation and reducing the number of stimuli to which the person has to attend can help the person with a brain injury interact more effectively with his/her environment. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of managing environmental stimulation for the confused person resulting in improved nutritional intake. The eating behaviors of two children aged six and 16 were observed in this study to determine the role of distraction as it interfered with their eating behavior. A multiple baseline, reversal design was used to assess the effectiveness of restricting environmental stimulation. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Psychology pervades all aspects of human life. To better understand the psychology of violence, especially as it is relevant beyond the surface, psychological principles can prove very useful. Psychology can shed light on human violence in terms of different levels of motivation, defenses, and paradoxical thinking. Violence is complex and can be difficult to understand at first glance. It helps to know, therefore, how hidden motives form and how understandable attempts to avoid emotional pain can result in maladaptive behavior and cause pain in return. For this, we cannot reduce psychology to the currently popular neuroscience, cognitivism, or behaviorism. Rather, we will have to understand it in its own right. The branch that deals with deeper motives and unconscious processes, as are helpful to understanding violence, is psychodynamic theory. Psychodynamic theory can be particularly helpful to identifying various defense mechanisms, paradoxical aspects of the mind, and the importance of early experiences in understanding how individuals or groups turn violent. While its scope of intrapsychic events can be a drawback, delving into intimate emotional life is essential to understanding the depths of the mind. More recent concepts in positive psychology can also complement traditional approaches and help us to avert determinism in trauma and violence.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper argues for the use of benzodiazepines as a harm reduction strategy when combined with long-term psychotherapy for high-risk adults with personality disorders resulting from chronic exposure to trauma and current unstable living conditions. This prescribing practice is outlined based on a review of 185 cases in therapy at a community mental health clinic. The careful use of benzodiazepines can increase engagement in therapy in a population often resistant to outpatient treatment. The approach is clearly a harm reduction effort to prevent clients from cycling through the emergency room and county correctional facilities. The risks of benzodiazepine misuse are reviewed and procedures for monitoring risk are detailed. There is a prejudice identified in the use of benzodiazepines that is based on society's condemnation of euphoric experiences rather than on a medical basis alone. Benzodiazepines are suggested as a harm reduction strategy as well as an alternative in the control of serious mental health symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and panic.

AB  - This article describes the difficulties a mainstream family therapy service experienced in working with families from a refugee background. The experience of six therapists and five bicultural workers, who are also the referring agents, was captured in focus groups, and the reflections that emerged shaped a four-part approach for working with families from a refugee background. Live consultation, either by the family therapist or bicultural worker, is suggested as a way to marry the expertise of family therapists who are not cultural ?insiders? with the ?lived experience? and cultural expertise of bicultural support workers. The process of reflecting on therapeutic failure resulted in several principles for working therapeu-tically with families with a history of refugee trauma, unmet resettlement needs and family relationship challenges. These include maintaining a flexible approach to therapy, ascertaining a clear understanding of the referral context, defining an explicit therapeutic contract from the first session, being mindful of the important role that language plays and terminating therapy if it is contra-indicated.

It then discusses lower limb trauma. The annual incidence of open lower limb fractures is approximately 5 per 100,000 population. Most common mechanisms of injury include: (i) Fall from height; (ii) Motor vehicle collision; and (iii) Interpersonal violence. A brief discussion of osteomyelitis, which is inflammation of bone caused by an infecting organism, is then presented. The discussion includes classification, mechanism of infection, pathology, investigation and treatment. The chapter also describes the pathogenesis, classification, staging, clinical diagnosis, and surgical management of lymphoedema. Finally it presents a brief discussion of pressure ulcers.

AB  - In this study, mapping of ultrashort T2 and T2* of acutely isolated porcine menisci at B0?=?9.4?T was investigated. Maps of T2 were measured from a slice through the pars intermedia with a spin echo-prepared two-dimensional ultrashort-TE T2 mapping technique published previously. T2* mapping was performed by two-dimensional ultrashort-TE MRI with variable acquisition delay. The measured signal decays were fitted by monoexponential, biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fitting functions. The occurrence of Gaussian-like signal decays is outlined theoretically. The quality of the curve fits was visualized by mapping the value δ = abs(1 ? ?2red). For T2* mapping, the Gaussian-exponential fit showed the best performance, whereas the monoexponential and biexponential fits showed regionally high values of δ (δ > 20). Interpretation of the Gaussian-exponential parameter maps was found to be difficult, because a Gaussian signal component can be related to mesoscopic (collagen texture) or macroscopic (slice profile, shim, sample geometry) magnetic field inhomogeneities and/or residual 1H dipole?dipole couplings. It seems likely that an interplay of these effects yielded the observed signal decays. Modulation of the T2* signal decay caused by chemical shift was observed and addressed to fat protons by means of histology. In the T2 measurements, no modulation of the signal decay was observed and the biexponential and Gaussian-exponential fits showed the best performance with comparable values of δ. Our results suggest that T2 mapping provides the more robust method for the characterization of meniscal tissue by means of MRI relaxometry. However, mapping of ultrashort T2, as performed in this study, is time consuming and provides less signal-to-noise ratio per time than the mapping of T2*. If T2* mapping is used, pixel-wise monitoring of the fitting quality based on reduced ?2 should be employed and great care should be taken when interpreting the parameter maps of the fits.

AB  - Abstract Childhood sexual abuse is a major aetiological factor in the development of mental health difficulties experienced by women. Although this conclusion is supported by two decades of extensive research, it has had little impact on the provision of mainstream mental health services. It remains exceptional for there to be specialist therapy or counselling provision for women survivors of childhood sexual abuse within statutory mental health services. This represents a serious gap in service provision and, it is argued, results in extended and inappropriate treatment for women survivors using mental health services. In this article, the development of a multi-agency approach to the provision of groupwork for women survivors of childhood sexual abuse within mental health service is described. A women-centred model of groupwork is outlined. Evaluation and funding are discussed. It is argued that, as a time-limited and effective treatment option, groupwork for women survivors of childhood sexual abuse should form a central part of service provision within statutory adult mental health services.

Aim This systematic review (SR) aims to evaluate the effects of physical exercise on pain and the musculoskeletal function of patients with hemophilia. Methods Literature searches of Pubmed, Web of Science, PEDro, Cochrane, Clinical Trials SciELO and Lilacs were performed. The risks of bias were measured using the JADAD scale. Results Nine controlled clinical trials were included in the SR. Conclusion Physical exercise can promote a reduction in the perception of pain and can increase ROM and muscle strength in haemophilia patients. Future RCTs with greater methodological rigor that focus on the parameters used to prescribe exercises are necessary.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate relationships between heart rate and clinical variables in healthy dogs and dogs examined at a referral hospital. Methods Clinical data were extracted from the electronic patient records of a first opinion group (5000 healthy dogs) and a referral hospital (5849 dogs). Univariable and multi-variable general linear models were used to assess associations between heart rate and clinical characteristics. Separate multi-variable models were constructed for first opinion and referral populations. Results In healthy dogs, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0·001) but was higher in Chihuahuas. The mean difference in heart rate between a 5 and 55?kg dog was 10·5 beats per minute. In dogs presenting to a referral hospital, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0·001) and the following breeds; border collie, golden retriever, Labrador retriever, springer spaniel and West Highland white terrier and positively associated with age, admitting service (emergency and critical care, emergency first opinion and cardiology) and the following breeds; Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier and Yorkshire terrier. Clinical Significance Bodyweight, age, breed and disease status all influence heart rate in dogs, although these factors account for a relatively small proportion of the overall variability in heart rate.

AB  - Abstract Objective In order to optimize psycho-oncologic care for patients with severe stressor-related symptomatology, we aimed to provide (a) valid and generalizable prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in oncological patients and (b) the percentage of PTSD cases elicited by cancer-related events. Methods This multi-center study was based on a representative sample of patients across cancer types. A diagnostic interview (CIDI-O) was used to assess PTSD according to DSM-IV. We first describe type and frequency of potentially traumatic events (A1-events) and the degree to which they meet the trauma criteria (A2-events). Subsequently, we present adjusted prevalence rates of PTSD and explore the proportion of patients with cancer-related PTSD. Results Four thousand twenty patients participated (response rate: 68 %), and 2141 completed the diagnostic interview; 1641 patients reported at least one A1-event, of whom 16% (n = 257) reported cancer-related events. Ninety-one percent (n = 232) of theses cancer-related events qualified as A2-events. Across cancer types, the adjusted 4-week prevalence of PTSD was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.5-2.7); 9% (n = 5) of the 4-week PTSD cases were cancer-related. Conclusions Across cancer types and treatment settings, few cancer patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Of those, a mere fraction was attributable to cancer-related events. These robust findings should be taken into account in both research and practice to develop and provide adequate care for cancer patients with severe stressor-related symptomatology.

AB  - Aim Although advanced treatments are provided to improve outcomes after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation, the actual treatments in clinical settings have been insufficiently investigated. The aim of the current study is to describe the actual treatments carried out for out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation patients, including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients, at critical care medical centers. Methods We registered consecutive adult patients suffering bystander-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac origin, for whom resuscitation was attempted by emergency medical service personnel, who had ventricular fibrillation as an initial rhythm, and who were transported to critical care medical centers in Osaka from March 2008 to December 2008. This study merged data on treatments after transportation, collected from 11 critical care medical centers in Osaka with the prehospital Utstein-style database. Results During the study period, there were 260 bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation arrests of cardiac origin. Of them, 252 received defibrillations before hospital arrival, 112 (44.4%) were transported to critical care medical centers, and 35 had shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. At the critical care medical centers, 54% (19/35), 40% (14/35), and 46% (16/35) of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients were treated with extracorporeal life support, percutaneous coronary interventions, and therapeutic hypothermia, respectively, but their treatments differed among institutions. Some patients with prolonged arrest without prehospital return of spontaneous circulation who received advanced treatments had neurologically favorable survival, whereas approximately two-thirds of shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation patients with advanced treatments did not. Conclusion This pilot descriptive study suggested that actual treatments for prehospital ventricular fibrillation patients differed between critical care medical centers. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of in-hospital advanced treatments for ventricular fibrillation including shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - Abstract Fracture healing is a well-organized process between several molecules and mediators. As known from other diseases, genetic polymorphisms may exhibit different expression patterns in these mediators. Concerning fracture healing, this may lead to an extended healing process or non-union. We investigated the incidence of polymorphisms in patients with aseptic non-unions after femoral and tibial shaft fractures as compared to patients with uneventful healing. Exclusion criteria were smoking, diabetes, bilateral fractures, systemic corticoid therapy, and septic non-unions. Analysis of allele frequencies and genotype distribution of various mediators were carried out following PCR. Clinical parameters such as injury severity and in-hospital were analyzed. Fifty patients following non-union (group NU) were enrolled, the control group consisted of 44 patients (group H). A significant association of a PDGF haplotype and non-unions following fracture could be observed. There was a significantly increased in-hospital time and amount of surgical procedures in group NU. Polymorphisms within the PDGF gene seem to be a genetic risk factor for the development of non-unions of the lower extremity following fracture. The early identification of high risk patients could result in an adapted therapeutical strategy and might contribute to a significant decrease of posttraumatic non-unions. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Sexual activity and desire have often been seen as inimical to Christian spirituality and practice, and many people have come to view Christianity as austere and shaming regarding sexuality. However, sexuality, religion, and policy-making have become so intertwined, that to ignore how they intersect and affect particular individuals' lives does a disservice to students. This article presents resources and strategies for incorporating the topic of sexuality into liberal undergraduate and graduate theological classrooms. It provides guidance to instructors lacking research expertise in sexuality and focuses on three main pedagogical categories: perspective transformation; embodiment pedagogy; and sexual violence and trauma. One purpose of this article is to generate conversation: there is a need for further collaboration with colleagues who are experts in various disciplines to continue mining resources to offer diverse strategies and resources.
