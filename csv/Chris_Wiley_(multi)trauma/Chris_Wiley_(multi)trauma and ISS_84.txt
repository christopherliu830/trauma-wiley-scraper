AB  - Abstract There is increasing evidence that titanium ions are released from orthopedic implants by biocorrosion. The aim of this study was to investigate titanium uptake by human T-lymphocytes and its effects on phenotype and proliferation. Freshly isolated human nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (NA-PBMC), were exposed to TiCl4 [Ti(IV)]. Bioavailability and distribution of Ti(IV) in T-lymphocytes was determined by energy-filtered electron microscopy (EFTEM). The effects of Ti(IV) challenge on nonactivated and PHA-activated cells were assessed by flow cytometric analysis of surface markers, RANK-L production, and proliferation assays. EFTEM colocalized Ti(IV) with phosphorus in the nucleus, ribosomes, cytoplasmic membranes, and the surface membrane of T-lymphocytes. Ti(IV) increased significantly the expression of CD69, CCR4, and RANK-L in a concentration-dependent manner. Titanium enters T-lymphocytes through a currently unknown mechanism and binds to phosphorus-rich cell structures. Titanium influences phenotype and function of T-lymphocytes, resulting in activation of a CD69+ and CCR4+ T-lymphocyte population and secretion of RANK-L. These results strongly suggest the involvement of titanium ions challenged T-lymphocytes in the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants. ? 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Medical records of 143 dogs with pulmonary contusion secondary to motor vehicular trauma were evaluated retrospectively to determine length of hospitalization, oxygen supplementation, and associated injuries. Therapeutic interventions, including the dose of intravenous fluid administration, the use of antibiotics, and the use of glucocorticoids were recorded. Initial thoracicradiographs were reviewed, and pulmonary contusion was graded as mild, moderate or severe. Pulmonary contusion severity was compared to use of supplemental oxygen, oxygen administration time, hospitalization time, and the presence or absence of fractures. The length of hospital stay and the survival rate was calculated. The mean respiratory rate at admission was 55 ± 22 breaths per minute. Concurrent thoracicinjuries were common, and included pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Fifty-two percent ofdogs received oxygen supplementation for a median of 35 hours. The median hospitalization time was 48 hours. Forty (28%) dogs were treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days, and forty- five (31%) were administered glucocorticoids. Two (1%) dogs developed pulmonary infection. Dogs with more severe thoracic radiographic changes on presentation were more likely to receiveoxygen, received oxygen for longer periods of time, and had a longer hospitalization time. Eighty-two percent of dogs survived to hospital discharge.

AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The situation for people with mental health problems as a group of disabled people who experience targeted violence and abuse is a complex one. Disabled people, particularly those with mental health problems, are at higher risk of targeted violence and hostility with few effective evidence-based prevention and protection strategies. Achieving effective safeguarding for adults with mental health problems is characterised by differential attitudes to and understandings of abuse by safeguarding practitioners, as well as systemic issues arising from multi-agency working. ?Keeping Control? was a 16-month user-led, co-produced exploratory qualitative study into service user experiences of targeted violence and abuse that was examined in the context of Care Act 2014 adult safeguarding reforms in England. User-controlled interviews of mental health service users (N = 23) explored their experiences and concepts of targeted violence and abuse, prevention and protection. Preliminary findings from these interviews were discussed in adult safeguarding and mental health stakeholder and practitioner focus groups (N = 46). The data were also discussed via two facilitated Twitter chats (responses N = 585 and N = 139). Mental health service users? experiences and concepts of risk from others, vulnerability and neglect can be different to those of practitioners but should be central to adult safeguarding. Histories of trauma, multi-factorial abuse; living with fear and stigma as well as mental distress; the effects of ?psychiatric disqualification? and individual blaming should be addressed in adult safeguarding in mental health. Fragmented responses from services can mean a person becomes ?lost in the process?. Staff can feel disempowered, afraid or lacking in confidence to ?speak up? for individuals in complex service systems with poor communication and lines of accountability. Adult safeguarding practitioners and stakeholders need to be confident, accessible and respond quickly to service users reporting incidents of targeted violence and abuse particularly in closed environments such as wards or supported housing.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article explores the various psychosocial problems that children and adolescents experienced due to communal violence in the Indian state of Gujarat in 2002. Five strategies were adapted to provide support and care to the children and adolescents in the relief camps as well as in the community during the rehabilitation phase. Community volunteers were used in the program to facilitate psychosocial healing by using different mediums of expression. Each medium encouraged the expression of thoughts and feelings caused by the trauma and the building of hope for the future. Various community-oriented peace-building measures, which are explained and outlined, were adapted to build trusting inter-community relationships. The peace-building measures focused on rebuilding a nurturing environment by re-establishing community networks and social support systems. Life skills education was one of the approaches adopted for fostering psychosocial development among the children in order to restore peaceful cohabitation for a future based on mutual respect and acceptance. Ultimately, in disaster rehabilitation, rebuilding one's ?sense of place? through holistic psychosocial support has been highlighted as a model for practice. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract We document evidence for trophy-taking and dismemberment with a new bioarchaeological database featuring 13,453 individuals from prehistoric central California sites. Our study reveals 76 individuals with perimortem removal of body parts consistent with trophy-taking or dismemberment; nine of these individuals display multiple types of trophy-taking and dismemberment for a total of 87 cases. Cases span almost 5,000 years, from the Early Period (3000?500 BC) to the Late Period (AD 900?1700). Collectively, these individuals share traits that distinguish them from the rest of the population: a high frequency of young adult males, an increased frequency of associated trauma, and a tendency towards multiple burials and haphazard burial positions. Eight examples of human bone artifacts were also found that appear related to trophy-taking. These characteristics suggest that trophy-taking and dismemberment were an important part of the warfare practices of central Californian tribes. Temporally, the two practices soared in the Early/Middle Transition Period (500?200 BC), which may have reflected a more complex sociopolitical system that encouraged the use of trophies for status acquisition, as well as the migration of outside groups that resulted in intensified conflict. Overall, trophy-taking and dismemberment appear to have been the product of the social geography of prehistoric central California, where culturally differentiated tribes lived in close proximity to their enemies.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the development and implementation of a Pacific medical mentoring programme and to evaluate the programme after the first year. Methods The mentoring programme was adapted from Australasian College for Emergency Medicine resources and involved Australian emergency physicians mentoring Pacific Island Country doctors. Using a prospective, cross-sectional survey of all participants, researchers collected data that were analysed for content using deductive and inductive methods. Content analysis aimed to generate new concepts that could apply to different components of mentoring, and overarching themes that apply to the mentoring programme overall. Results Nineteen doctors participated in the first year of the programme; 11 mentees from three different Pacific Island Countries and eight Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Fellow mentors. The survey was completed with a 100% response rate. Five core themes were identified from the data: vital face-to-face communication (the key to effective communication); supportive personal relationship (valued and desired by mentees); motivating professional relationship (including a regional Pacific network); substantial challenges (time, distance, remote communication); and issues around the mentoring model (goal-orientation, mentor-driven, culture). Conclusions The present study suggests a new model of Pacific mentoring that recognises the centrality of the mentoring relationship, and allows for flexible communication, shared responsibility of mentors and mentees as co-drivers and a broad understanding of goals and timelines. Future programmes should incorporate funding for in-person meetings and educational opportunities to enhance contextual and cultural understanding. These lessons can inform future medical mentorship programmes across the Pacific.

AB  - Mitral regurgitation (MR) related to chronic degenerative valvular disease is the most important cause of heart failure in dogs. Ultrasound examination of the heart can identify valve lesions, confirm the presence of valvular regurgitation, document cardiac remodeling, estimate intracardiac pressures, and quantify systolic ventricular function. These findings can influence prognosis or selection of medical therapy. Reductions in ventricular systolic function may be detected on serial echocardiographic examinations in some dogs with MR. However the changes in ventricular loading that accompany MR often complicate these measurements. For example, shortening and ejection fractions are often increased in severe MR, even in the setting of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography with Doppler is also used to assess ventricular diastolic function and filling pressures. This information helps predict the risk of congestive heart failure. However these findings are often rendered ambiguous by age-related impairment of ventricular relaxation, elevations in left atrial pressure due to MR, and effects of volume overload on myocardial tissue velocities. These factors limit the usefulness of ventricular filling and tissue velocities, as well as derived ratios such as the E/E' ratio, for predicting congestive heart failure in MR. More advanced Doppler and tissue echocardiographic methods, as well as prospective clinical studies, are needed to reduce the ambiguity involved with assessment of ventricular function and filling pressures in the setting of MR.

AB  - Background Disruptions in emotion regulation are a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology. However, scant research has examined whether emotion regulation strategies are related to the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among youths exposed to trauma. We investigated whether pretrauma emotion regulation strategies prospectively predicted PTSD symptom onset after the 2013 Boston Marathon terrorist attack among adolescents and whether these associations were moderated by the degree of exposure to media coverage of the attack. Methods A sample of 78 Boston-area adolescents (mean age = 16.72 years, 65% female) who previously participated in studies assessing emotion regulation and psychopathology were recruited following the terrorist attack. Within 4 weeks of the attack, we assessed self-reported PTSD symptoms and attack-related media exposure via an online survey. We examined the association of pretrauma emotion regulation strategies with PTSD symptom onset after adjustment for pretrauma internalizing symptoms and violence exposure. Results Greater pretrauma engagement in rumination predicted onset of PTSD symptoms following the attack. Adolescents who engaged in catastrophizing also had greater PTSD symptoms postattack, but only when exposed to high levels of media coverage of the attacks; the same pattern was observed for adolescents who engaged in low levels of cognitive reappraisal. Conclusions Engagement in specific emotion regulation strategies prior to a traumatic event predicts the onset of PTSD symptoms among youths exposed to trauma, extending transdiagnostic models of emotion regulation to encompass trauma-related psychopathology in children and adolescents.

AB  - The construct of resilience was examined in a South Asian community impacted by natural and human-made disasters. Forty-three Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim Sri Lankans (27 women; age range 21?62?years) participated in 6 focus groups, conducted in either Sinhala or Tamil, to elicit participants? own ideas about components of resilience. Schema analysis of transcripts revealed that although some elements of resilience were common across ethnocultural groups, others differed by ethnic group. The differences appeared to be as much a function of type of trauma exposure as of culture. Components of resilience included many that are recognized in the western construct of resilience as well as 2 culturally unique components: strong will relating either to religious faith or to karma and psychosocial gratitude. These components could be examined in future measures of resilience with similar populations. Findings also revealed that some components of resilience can be taught; thus they can be the focus of interventions and public health policies.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess intracochlear trauma using two different round window-related cochleostomy techniques in human temporal bones. Methods: Twenty-eight human temporal bones were included in this study. In 21 specimens, cochleostomies were initiated inferior to the round window (RW) annulus. In seven bones, cochleostomies were drilled anterior-inferior to the RW annulus. Limited cochlear implant electrode insertions were performed in 19 bones. In each specimen, promontory anatomy and cochleostomy drilling were photographically documented. Basal cochlear damage was assessed histologically and electrode insertion properties were documented in implanted bones. Results: All implanted specimens showed clear scala tympani electrode placements regardless of cochleostomy technique. All 21 inferior cochleostomies were atraumatic. Anterior-inferior cochleostomies resulted in various degrees of intracochlear trauma in all seven bones. Conclusion: For atraumatic opening of the scala tympani using a cochleostomy approach, initiation of drilling should proceed from inferior to the round window annulus, with gradual progression toward the undersurface of the lumen. While cochleostomies initiated anterior-inferior to the round window annulus resulted in scala tympani opening, many of these bones displayed varying degrees of intracochlear trauma that may result in hearing loss. When intracochlear drilling is avoided, the anterior bony margin of the cochleostomy remains a significant intracochlear impediment to in-line electrode insertion.

AB  - Key points Ongoing, moderate noise exposure does not instantly damage the auditory system but may cause lasting deficits, such as elevated thresholds and accelerated ageing of the auditory system. The neuromodulatory peptide urocortin-3 (UCN3) is involved in the body's recovery from a stress response, and is also expressed in the cochlea and the auditory brainstem. Lack of UCN3 facilitates age-induced hearing loss and causes permanently elevated auditory thresholds following a single 2 h noise exposure at moderate intensities. Outer hair cell function in mice lacking UCN3 is unaffected, so that the observed auditory deficits are most likely due to inner hair cell function or central mechanisms. Highly specific, rather than ubiquitous, expression of UCN3 in the brain renders it a promising candidate for designing drugs to ameliorate stress-related auditory deficits, including recovery from acoustic trauma. Abstract Environmental acoustic noise is omnipresent in our modern society, with sound levels that are considered non-damaging still causing long-lasting or permanent changes in the auditory system. The small neuromodulatory peptide urocortin-3 (UCN3) is the endogenous ligand for corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2 and together they are known to play an important role in stress recovery. UCN3 expression has been observed in the auditory brainstem, but its role remains unclear. Here we describe the detailed distribution of UCN3 expression in the murine auditory brainstem and provide evidence that UCN3 is expressed in the synaptic region of inner hair cells in the cochlea. We also show that mice with deficient UCN3 signalling experience premature ageing of the auditory system starting at an age of 4.7 months with significantly elevated thresholds of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) compared to age-matched wild-type mice. Following a single, 2 h exposure to moderate (84 or 94 dB SPL) noise, UCN3-deficient mice exhibited significantly larger shifts in ABR thresholds combined with maladaptive recovery. In wild-type mice, the same noise exposure did not cause lasting changes to auditory thresholds. The presence of UCN3-expressing neurons throughout the auditory brainstem and the predisposition to hearing loss caused by preventing its normal expression suggests UCN3 as an important neuromodulatory peptide in the auditory system's response to loud sounds.

AB  - Abstract The NIH project ?Inflammatory and Host Response to Injury? (Glue) is being conducted to study the changes in the body over time in response to trauma and burn. Patients are monitored for changes in their clinical status, such as the onset of and recovery from organ failure. Blood samples are drawn over the first days and weeks after the injury to obtain gene expression levels over time. Our goal was to develop a method of selecting genes that differentially expressed in patients who either improved or experienced organ failure. For this, we needed a test for the association between longitudinal gene expressions and the time to the occurrence of ordered categorical outcomes indicating recovery, stable disease, and organ failure. We propose a test for which the relationship between the gene expression and the events is modeled using the cumulative proportional odds model that is a generalization of the pooling repeated observation method. Given the high-dimensionality of the microarray data, it was necessary to control for the multiplicity of the testing. To control for the false discovery rate (FDR), we applied both a permutational approach as well as Efron's empirical estimation method. We explore our method through simulations and provide the analysis of the multi-center, longitudinal study of immune response to inflammation and trauma (http://www.gluegrant.org).

AB  - The conflict in Northern Ireland left over 3,600 people dead and tens of thousands injured, but establishing who are victims and the very nature of victimhood has been difficult. In part this is due to the highly contested nature of the labels ?victim? and ?terrorist.? The present paper employed interpretative phenomenological analysis to gain a greater understanding of the conceptualisation of victimhood in Northern Ireland. Catholic and Protestant civilians, paramilitaries, politicians, security force personnel, and community activists who had experienced direct and/or indirect political violence were interviewed. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed five themes related to internal, interpersonal, and macro aspects of victimhood. The participants illustrated how the label of victim was associated with both weakness and strength, depending on the audience. Interview responses also revealed that although participants were resilient, they suffered at least some temporary psychological trauma due to their exposure to political violence. In addition the analysis indicated that there was a psychological cost associated with perpetrating acts of political violence. These findings are discussed in relation to the need for a national or cross-national program of intergroup dialogue and truth recovery to provide closure to victims and reintegrate victims and perpetrators into the postconflict society.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.
