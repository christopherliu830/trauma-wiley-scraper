AB  - The study by Smith et al. (2010) concluded that clips are associated with 3 times the infection rate compared with subcuticular sutures in orthopaedic surgery (P =?.01).For hip surgery, there was a 4-fold increase. We aimed to determine the trends and influences in skin closure and wound care for hip and knee arthroplasty in the northwest region as well as what would change surgeons' current practice. A short online survey was emailed to consultants in the northwest of England enquiring about their current practice in superficial skin closure, what has influenced this, and finally what would change their practice. Returned surveys were then analysed. A total of 45 consultants responded (response rate of 40.2%). In both hip and knee arthroplasty, clips were the most commonly used superficial skin closure material (53% and 63%, respectively). Personal experience was the greatest influence on the choice of closure material in both hip and knees (84% and 93% respectively). A total of 66% of hip and 76% of knee surgeons would change their closure material if there was evidence to support this. Hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons are influenced by their personal experience, and most use clips as their skin closure method. Most would change their practice with evidence of one material over another. We conclude that there is need for a prospective, well-powered, multi-centre randomised control trial to determine the skin closure material that has the lowest return-to-theatre rate in arthroplasty surgery.

AB  - ABSTRACT The ability to form biofilm on the surface of implanted devices is often considered the most critical virulence factor possessed by Staphylococcus epidermidis in its role as an opportunistic pathogen in orthopaedic device-related infection (ODRI). Despite this recognition, there is a lack of clinical evidence linking outcome with biofilm forming ability for S. epidermidis ODRIs. We prospectively collected S. epidermidis isolates cultured from patients presenting with ODRI. Antibiotic resistance patterns and biofilm-forming ability was assessed. Patient information was collected and treatment outcome measures were determined after a mean follow-up period of 26 months. The primary outcome measure was cure at follow-up. Univariate logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance on treatment outcome. A total of 124 patients were included in the study, a majority of whom (n?=?90) involved infections of the lower extremity. A clear trend emerged in the lower extremity cohort whereby cure rates decreased as the biofilm-forming ability of the isolates increased (84% cure rate for infections caused by non-biofilm formers, 76% cure rate for weak biofilm-formers, and 60% cure rate for the most marked biofilm formers, p?=?0.076). Antibiotic resistance did not influence treatment cure rate. Chronic immunosuppression was associated with a statistically significant decrease in cure rate (p?=?0.044). Clinical significance: The trend of increasing biofilm-forming ability resulting in lower cure rates for S. epidermidis ODRI indicates biofilm-forming ability of infecting pathogens does influence treatment outcome of infections of the lower extremity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract From August to November 1992, five typhoons struck the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam. Three hundred and twenty subjects exposed to all five typhoons participated in a population survey measuring their acute stress symptoms and subsequent diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. A 23-item scale approximating the new DSM-IV diagnosis of acute stress disorder (ASD) was used to classify subjects into three groups based on their symptoms one week after the first typhoon: (1) probable ASD, (2) an early traumatic stress response (ETSR) of fear, intrusion, avoidance, and arousal, without dissociation, and (3) no acute diagnosis. A multi-dimensional measure of PTSD and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale were used to assess PTSD and depression 8 months after the first storm. The point prevalence of ASD at one week was 7.2%. An additional 15% of subjects had ETSR. Subjects with probable ASD at one week had significantly increased rates of PTSD and somewhat higher rates of depression at 8 months than those without ASD. In contrast, subjects with ETSR at one week did not have a poorer outcome than those with no acute diagnosis. These findings suggest that ASD is prognostically important, but also indicate that all acute stress symptoms do not have the same discriminative value. In this study, the acute dissociative symptoms of emotional numbing and derealization differentiated highly symptomatic subjects at risk for subsequent psychopathology (ASD) from others who were highly symptomatic at one week, but then had a more benign, posttraumatic course (ETSR).

AB  - Summary Pituitary apoplexy is a rare clinical syndrome comprising sudden-onset severe headache accompanied by visual deficit, or extraocular muscle nerve palsy, or reduced conscious level. It may be misdiagnosed as meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Pituitary apoplexy results from haemorrhage into or infarction of a pre-existing pituitary tumour, and is almost invariably associated with hypopituitarism. A prior diagnosis of pituitary tumour is usually absent, with the apoplexy representing the first presentation of a previously unrecognized tumour in 80% of cases. Patients with pituitary apoplexy should, once stabilized, be transferred to a neurosurgical centre for the multidisciplinary management of an experienced pituitary surgeon, neuro-ophthalmologist and endocrinologist. Apoplexy may be precipitated by many factors; hypertension is the commonest. Conditions causing wide variations of blood pressure, including major surgery, are frequently implicated. Other known risk factors include head trauma, anticoagulant therapy or clotting disorders and pregnancy.

AB  - Summary The knee is the largest and most complex joint in the body and a wide variety of bone and soft tissue injuries are seen in the knee. Trauma to the knee can result in injury to the bone, articular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments. Fractures of the proximal tibia, particularly those that extend into the knee joint, are serious injuries that frequently result in functional impairment. Recent advances in cross-sectional imaging, particularly in computed tomography (CT), have given this modality a prominent role in the detection and classification of fractures in and around the knee. With the advent of high-performance multi-detector CT, isotropic data sets can be generated with subsecond gantry rotation times and submillimetre slice thickness. CT arthrography can clearly demonstrate many lesions in the plethora of internal derangement of the knee. CT arthrography also deserves its advantage as it may be used to evaluate knee injuries in patients where magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated. In this article we discuss the indications for imaging of knee injuries by CT, present the advantages of multi-detector CT and CT arthrography, and provide examples that highlight the utility of CT in the evaluation of the knee injuries.

AB  - Abstract Background Prior to the mobilization of patients with spinal fractures following treatment, it is important to confirm stability in the upright position. Methods A patient presented with T2 and T3 vertebral body fractures visible on recumbent CT. Supine and upright plain x-rays with additional swimmer's views were deemed suboptimal prior to mobilization. The default configuration of the O-arm was modified to enable imaging in the upright position. Results Images utilizing the O-arm were satisfactory and anatomic alignment confirmed in an upright position. It is believed that this is the first time the O-arm has been used for upright diagnostic imaging (off-label application). Excellent visualization of the cervicothoracic junction and upper thoracic regions was obtained in the desired upright position. Conclusion The O-arm was used successfully to image spinal trauma in the upright position and may represent a new application of the device, potentially fulfilling a frequently unmet medical imaging need.

AB  - Abstract The main research goal has been to evaluate significant factors affecting the in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters T, T, T2, and 1H density. This approach differs significantly from other such projects in that the experimental data analysis is being performed while concurrently developing automated, computer-aided analysis software for such MRI tissue parameters. In the experimental portion of the project, statistical analyses, and a heuristic minimum/maximum discriminant analysis algorithm have been explored. Both methods have been used to classify tissue types from 1.5 Tesla transaxial MR images of the human brain. The developing program, written in the logic programming language Prolog, is similar in a number of ways to many existing expert systems now in use for other medical applications; inclusion of the underlying statistical data base and advanced statistical analyses is the main differentiating feature of the current approach. First results indicate promising classification accuracy of various brain tissues such as gray and white matter, as well as differentiation of different types of gray matter and white matter (e.g.: caudate-nucleus vs. thalamus, both representatives of gray matter; and, cortical white matter vs. internal capsule as representative of white matter). Taking all four tissue types together, the percentage of correct classifications ranges from 73 to 87%.

AB  - Abstract A child who had had surgery at 5 months of age, and who had been treated at the time for post-traumatic symptoms (reported in a previous paper by the author), was interviewed 2 years later and almost 3 years later to test for possible verbal recall of his hospitalization. He appeared to have some memories of the experience at 29 months of age, and he was able to superimpose verbal labels onto the preverbal memories. At 40 months of age, however, the memories were no longer verbally accessible. The results are discussed in the context of different theories of encoding, storage, retrieval, and loss of early memories. The findings from this study support other findings indicating that there appears to be some form of long-term memory in place early in life, at least for highly salient, traumatic events. There may be one memory system for traumatic memories, fully functional at birth, and a later developing, different system for neutral memories. It is further hypothesized that there may be a sensitive period around 2?3 years of age for the recall of early traumatic memories, and that verbal recall is more likely to be present in verbally precocious children during that period.

AB  - Abstract Objective While emergency medicine (EM) physicians treat the majority of pediatric EM (PEM) patients in the United States, little is known about their PEM experience during training. The primary objective was to characterize the pediatric case exposure and compare to established EM residency training curricula among EM residents across five U.S. residency programs. Methods We performed a multicenter medical record review of all pediatric patients (aged < 18 years) seen by the 2015 graduating resident physicians at five U.S. EM training programs. Resident-level counts of pediatric patients were measured and specific counts were classified by the 2016 Model of Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine (MCP) and Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) diagnostic categories. We assessed variability between residents and between programs. Results A total of 36,845 children were managed by 68 residents across all programs. The median age was 6 years. The median number of patients per resident was 660 with an interquartile range of 336. The most common PECARN diagnostic categories were trauma, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disease. Thirty-two core MCP diagnoses (43% of MCP list) were not seen by at least 50% of the residents. We found statistically significant variability between programs in both PECARN diagnostic categories (p < 0.01) and MCP diagnoses (p < 0.01). Conclusion There is considerable variation in the number of pediatric patients and the diagnostic case volume seen by EM residents. The relationship between this case variability and competence upon graduation is unknown; further investigation is warranted to better inform program-specific curricula and to guide training requirements in EM.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses only a subset of the many fascinating topics that link memory development and law. It reviews core basic memory development principles that are important in the legal context. The chapter focuses on distress, trauma and memory, a topic of vital concern given the types of cases that come to the attention of police officers, child protection workers, child forensic interviewers, and the courts. It reviews some of the prominent research on children's non-disclosure of crime, particularly of child sexual abuse. The chapter considers memory development not only as influenced by cognitive factors but by social factors as well, since the latter can profoundly affect children's memory reports within the legal context. It ends with addressing, in some detail, child forensic interview protocols that have been developed based in large part on scientific research on children's eyewitness memory.

AB  - We have explored the working patterns and perceptions of a group of teachers who provide home tuition for children who cannot attend school due to medical problems. These teachers reported high levels of experience in teaching, enthusiasm for their work, and clear managerial structures. Home tutors found it very rewarding to build relationships with children and families, and see children making progress. Challenging aspects of the work included relationship issues, both with the children and their families and with the professional network around the child. Liaison with other professionals was reported to be variable, sometimes helpful and well structured, and sometimes very poor. Those interviewed felt additional training on specific issues related to their work in this context would be beneficial.

AB  - Abstract Aims To estimate the influence of non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) on heroin initiation among US veterans receiving medical care. Design Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we analyzed data from a prospective, multi-site, observational study of HIV-infected and an age/race/site-matched control group of HIV-uninfected veterans in care in the United States. Approximately annual behavioral assessments were conducted and contained self-reported measures of NMUPO and heroin use. Setting Veterans Health Administration (VHA) infectious disease and primary care clinics in Atlanta, Baltimore, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Washington, DC. Participants A total of 3396 HIV-infected and uninfected patients enrolled into the Veterans Aging Cohort Study who reported no life-time NMUPO or heroin use, had no opioid use disorder diagnoses at baseline and who were followed between 2002 and 2012. Measurements The primary outcome measure was self-reported incident heroin use and the primary exposure of interest was new-onset NMUPO. Our final model was adjusted for socio-demographics, pain interference, prior diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and/or depression and self-reported other substance use. Findings Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we found that non-medical use of prescription opioids NMUPO was associated positively and independently with heroin initiation [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 5.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.01, 7.35]. Conclusions New-onset non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) is a strong risk factor for heroin initiation among HIV-infected and uninfected veterans in the United States who reported no previous history of NMUPO or illicit opioid use.

AB  - Abstract This article prospectively explores the effects of collective team work engagement and organizational constraints during military deployment on individual-level psychological outcomes afterwards. Participants were 971 Dutch peacekeepers within 93 teams who were deployed between the end of 2008 and beginning of 2010, for an average of 4?months, in the International Security Assistance Force. Surveys were administered 2?months into deployment and 6?months afterwards. Multi-level regression analyses demonstrated that team work engagement during deployment moderated the relation between organizational constraints and post-deployment fatigue symptoms. Team members reported less fatigue symptoms after deployment if they were part of highly engaged teams during deployment, particularly when concerns about organizational constraints during deployment were high. In contrast, low team work engagement was related to more fatigue symptoms, particularly when concerns about organizational constraints were high. Contrary to expectations, no effects for team work engagement or organizational constraints were found for post-traumatic growth. The present study highlights that investing in team work engagement is important for those working in highly demanding jobs. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction:? Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. We hypothesized that Lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. The objective was to investigate the effect of Lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. Methods:? Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. Glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3?ml/min) with and without Lf (100??g/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3?h, 37°C). Attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (107?colony-forming units/ml) with Lf-coated (20?100??g/ml) and uncoated glass slides. The effects of ?-lactoglobulin, 2,2?-dipyridyl (25?100??g/ml), an iron chelator, and FeCl3 on attachment were also examined. Results:? Lf inhibited the initial attachment of S. gordonii (50.3%, P?<?0.05) but not that of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. However, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing S. gordonii (i.e. S. gordonii/F. nucleatum or S. gordonii/P. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, P?<?0.05) in the presence of Lf. ?-Lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of S. gordonii. In the presence of 100??m 2,2?-dipyridyl, attachment of S. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. No reduction in attachment was noted in S. gordonii pretreated with Lf (100??g/ml) and FeCl3 (20?200??m). Conclusion:? Lf suppresses initial attachment of S. gordonii and S. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. This may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

AB  - Abstract Clinical and empirical studies have documented significant alterations in self-related thought in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To our knowledge, however, few studies have examined self-referential cognition by analyzing survivors? written impact statements in individuals whose PTSD is due to interpersonal trauma. In the current study, we performed a linguistic analysis of impact statements (i.e., descriptions of how the trauma has affected the survivors? views of themselves, others, and the world) collected at the start of therapy from women with PTSD that was due to interpersonal trauma, with the goal of determining whether PTSD symptom clusters were associated with altered self-referential thought. We found that higher levels of PTSD-related hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with diminished self-related word use, after controlling for depression severity, f2 = .31. Similarly, diminished negative self-related word use was associated with higher levels of hyperarousal symptoms, f2 = .47. Our findings align with previous research that has provided evidence for a diminished sense of self in PTSD. These results may help inform targeted interventions aimed at improving social-affective functions in PTSD and other psychiatric conditions.
