AB  - Objectives: The diagnostic utility of routine faecal examinations can be greatly enhanced through an appreciation of risk factors most commonly associated with endoparasitism. Methods: From a sample of 6578 canine patients presenting to a veterinary teaching hospital between 1996 and 2006, this study used univariate and multi-variable techniques to examine putative signalment, medical history and demographic factors predisposing dogs to intestinal parasites. Results: Age and median household income were the strongest predictors of endoparasitism. The odds of a patient being diagnosed with endoparasites were 0·82 times smaller for every 1 year increase in age (OR=0·82, 95% CI: 0·80 to 0·84) and for every $10,000 increase in median household income, the odds were 0·86 times lower (OR=0·86, 95% CI: 0·83 to 0·89). The variables gender, neuter status, month of diagnosis, admitting clinical service and primary diagnosis were not significant predictors. Animals that were presented for underlying medical conditions were less likely to have parasites and the presence of diarrhoea was associated with 76% lower odds of endoparasitism compared to healthy animals (OR=0·76, 95% CI: 0·64 to 0·90). Clinical Significance: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for parasites in younger patients that live in high population density and low income neighbourhoods.

AB  - Abstract Background?Studies of the relationship between alcohol and violent injury confirm that while there is some evidence of a direct pharmacological association, many other factors are relevant to the frequency and severity of both violent perpetration and being a victim of violence. It is now widely recognized that official police statistics are a poor indicator of the nature and extent of public violence. Aims?Accident and emergency departments and trauma surgeons are not only in a position to provide more accurate information on the nature and extent of clinically significant injury, but they can contribute substantially to violence prevention. This can be achieved through individually targeted interventions in conjunction with other clinicians on the one hand, and on the other through public health and community initiatives, in conjunction with other community agencies, including the police and local authorities. This article describes some of those initiatives and the evidence underpinning them. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of subclinical abnormalities reported in thoracic (CT) scans of cats and to investigate associations between respiratory signs and CT signs. METHODS Retrospective review of signalment, indications, respiratory signs and reported CT findings in a series of cats. Associations between patient variables, respiratory signs and CT signs were analysed using multi-variable regression methods. RESULTS Records of 352 consecutive cats were reviewed. Abnormalities affecting thoracic structures were reported in CT scans of 138/179 (77%) cats that did not have respiratory signs; the most prevalent CT findings were pulmonary collapse (41%), evidence of bronchial disease (24%) and space-occupying lesions (21%). Dyspnoea, cough and tachypnoea were associated with space-occupying lesions. Dyspnoea was also associated with pulmonary consolidation and atelectasis. Increasing body weight was associated with pulmonary atelectasis and increasing age was associated with evidence of bronchial disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Abnormalities were commonly detected in thoracic CT scans of cats that did not show respiratory signs. The most prevalent abnormality ? pulmonary atelectasis ? is probably a temporary effect of sedation or anaesthesia. A high prevalence of subclinical abnormalities and limited correlations between clinical signs and CT findings will complicate diagnosis.

PY  - 1996
AB  - Background: The chief danger of colonic injury is sepsis resulting from faecal spill. Primary repair is now well established in the USA, particularly for penetrating injuries, in up to 81% of patients. However, in Australia, highly destructive blunt trauma forms a larger proportion of injuries, and the purpose of this study was to determine if there are any contrasts in the management of these patients. Method: A retrospective survey was undertaken over the past 20 years of all of the patients with full-thickness colorectal injuries presenting at the three major hospitals which receive multi-trauma patients in Brisbane. Results: Of 112 patients 114 sustained full-thickness colorectal injuries. Forty patients had penetrating injuries, 41 had blunt injuries and 33 had iatrogenic injuries. Primary repair or resection and anastomosis was performed in 39% of patients with colonic injuries and the leak rate was 8%. Exteriorized repairs had a 67% leak rate. A colostomy was used in 58% of patients. The mortality for penetrating injuries was zero. The mortality for blunt colonic injuries was 17% and for iatrogenic injuries was 7% but for blunt rectal injuries was 50%. The overall mortality was 10%. Colostomy closure had a 20% morbidity but no mortality. Conclusions: In the absence of shock, associated injuries, or gross faecal soiling primary repair or resection with anastomosis may be considered. For blunt injury, colostomy is still usually indicated, often with resection. For iatrogenic injury, when seen early, primary repair can be performed. We do not recommend exteriorized repair. Extraperitoneal rectal injuries require proximal colostomy and distal washout, with drainage where appropriate. Blunt devitalizing injury is relatively more common in Australia than in the USA and therefore there is less indication here for primary repair. Colostomy remains an important consideration in operative management.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains how to establish a dental health screening program within modern sport. Common dental diseases can manifest as tooth surface loss, dental caries, and periodontal disease, which may severely compromise the longevity and restorative status of a patient's dentition in later life. The outer surface of a tooth is a highly protective mineralized enamel layer, which covers the inner dentine structure. Saliva has a crucial role in tooth protection due to its chemical composition, and the physical and mechanical effects of saliva flow. A mouth guard is a key feature in dental trauma impact minimisation and prevention of orofacial injuries. The main rationale for screening is to identify members of the public likely to have a particular disease and to either confirm or exclude the disease. After screening completion the dental professional will need to collate the data and identify the 'at risk athletes and dentitions'.

AB  - Aim There is strong evidence that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with poor short-, medium- and long-term health outcomes. In South Western Sydney, we trialled a modified ACE checklist in community paediatric clinics. Our aim was to design the best version of the ACE checklist for routine clinical use to serve as both a clinical and quality indicator. Methods We trialled two versions of the modified ACE checklist based on a pre-existing tool in child development (CD) and vulnerable child (VC) clinics over a 6-month period in 2012 (V1) and 7-month period in 2017 (V2). We analysed clinical and demographic data and correlated with ACE scores. We asked clinicians about the use of the ACE checklist and modified the checklist based on clinicians' recommendations. Results In phase 1, V1 was trialled in CD clinics only; 77 children were assessed, of whom 38 children (49%) had ACE score of ≥1, and 8 (10%) had a score of ≥4. In phase 2, of 279 children assessed, 178 (64%) had ACE ≥1, and 78 (28%) had ACE ≥4. In both phases, clinicians found the checklist simple to use and helpful in identifying especially vulnerable children. Conclusions The ACE checklist helps clinicians and managers identify the burden of exposure to trauma, violence and abuse of children attending paediatric clinics, both to facilitate intervention and aid service development. This version of the ACE checklist has the potential to be used across a variety of populations and settings as a clinical and quality indicator.

AB  - Abstract Fractures are one of the most common large-organ, traumatic injuries in humans, and osteoporosis-related fractures are the fastest growing health care problem of aging. Elective orthopedic surgeries of the bones and joints also represent some of most common forms of elective surgeries performed. Optimal repair of skeletal tissues is necessary for successful outcomes of these many different orthopedic surgical treatments. Research focused on post-natal skeletal repair is therefore of immense clinical importance and of particular relevance in situations in which bone tissue healing is compromised due to the extent of tissue trauma or specific medical co-morbidities. Three commonly used murine surgical models of bone healing, closed fracture with intramedullary fixation, distraction osteogenesis (DO), and marrow ablation by reaming, are presented. The biological aspects of these models are contrasted and the types of research questions that may be addressed with these models are presented. ? 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to assess the oral health knowledge among professionals who specialize in treating eating disorders, and identify to what extent their education, and training addresses oral health care delivery, and recommendations for individuals with eating disorders. Method Participants for this study were licensed behavioural and medical providers specializing in eating disorder treatment (n = 107), and recruited through professional eating disorder organizations. Participants completed an anonymous, online questionnaire (33 items) assessing level of oral health-related education, knowledge and treatment recommendations within the participant's respective eating disorder discipline. Results The majority of respondents (85%) were formally trained in eating disorders, and of those trained, 64.4% were not satisfied with the level of oral health education during formal education, and 19.5% report no oral health education. Respondents consider their knowledge of risk of oral disease for their clients/patients as average or above (84%), and ranked tooth erosion as the greatest reason for oral care (63%) while dry mouth led in the rankings for least significant reason for oral care (33%). Referral for oral care was found to be more common after reports of complication (55%). Discussion According to these findings, eating disorder professionals regard oral health care for their clients as significant, and may be unaware of associated oral risk factors, current oral care standards and long-term oral effects of disordered eating apart from enamel erosion.

AB  - Radiation therapy has been used to treat animal cancers for more than 100?years. Clinical experiences and experimental results have been widely published and provide a basis for the recognition of radiation therapy as an integral component of multimodal cancer management in veterinary oncology. As the expectations of pet owners and the demand for treatment of companion animals with cancer have increased, veterinary oncology itself has undergone dramatic advances in the past several decades both in terms of improved diagnostics and treatments, including increased accessibility of radiation therapy. Synchronous with development of the specialism of veterinary radiation oncology, confusion and controversy have arisen with regard to distinguishing between different types of radiotherapy and methods of treatment delivery. Importantly, the confusion extends beyond semantics, and includes opinionated debate about defining which forms of therapy (if any at all) are optimal for a given patient. This exemplifies how, despite marks of maturity including age and a robust publication history, the field of veterinary radiation oncology is in some ways still in its infancy. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence base for daily (fine) fractionation versus weekly (coarse) hypofractionation in veterinary oncology, using selected tumour types as examples.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeutic approaches in bone-healing disorders. Although bone marrow-derived MSCs are most frequently used, the knowledge that many other adult tissues represent promising sources for potent MSCs has gained acceptance. In the present study, the osteogenic differentiation potential of porcine skin fibroblasts (FBs), as well as bone marrow- (BMSCs), adipose tissue- (ASCs) and dental pulp-derived stromal cells (DSCs) were evaluated. However, additional application of BMP-2 significantly elevated the delayed osteogenic differentiation capacity of ASC and FB cultures, and in DSC cultures the supplementation of platelet-rich plasma increased osteogenic differentiation potential to a comparable level of the good differentiable BMSCs. Furthermore, microarray gene expression performed in an exemplary manner for ASCs and BMSCs revealed that ASCs and BMSCs use different gene expression patterns for osteogenic differentiation under standard media conditions, as diverse MSCs are imprinted dependent from their tissue niche. However, after increasing the differentiation potential of ASCs to a comparable level as shown in BMSCs, a small subset of identical key molecules was used to differentiate in the osteogenic lineage. Until now, the importance of identified genes seems to be underestimated for osteogenic differentiation. Apparently, the regulation of transmembrane protein 229A, interleukin-33 and the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 in the early phase of osteogenic differentiation is needed for optimum results. Based on these results, bone regeneration strategies of MSCs have to be adjusted, and in vivo studies on the osteogenic capacities of the different types of MCSs are warranted.

AB  - SUMMARY Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a pivotal cytokine at the centre of a cascade of cytokines and inflammatory mediators which modulate the host response to infection and trauma, and in particular the metabolic changes resulting in shock and subsequent multi-organ failure. The cytokine IL-8?predominantly an activator and chemotactic factor for circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes?is produced in response to TNF-αin vitro, and high circulating levels of IL-8 are found in septic primates. We have studied the release of IL-8 into the circulation of subjects with chronic hepatitis B undergoing a 10 week pilot trial of recombinant TNF-α (rTNF-α) therapy in doses of 15-100 ?g/m2, A marked dose-dependent increase in plasma IL-8 levels was seen commencing at 30-60 min after the start of rTNF-α infusion and peaking between 2 and 3 h (mean peak level 4300 ng/l). The temporal pattern of IL-8 production exactly echoed that of IL-6, another component of the cytokine cascade, but peak plasma levels of IL-8 were up to 17 times higher than those of IL-6. This study confirms in vitro data suggesting that IL-8 is a component of the acute circulating cytokine cascade with a potential role in the modulation of the acute immune and metabolic response to infection and trauma.

AB  - Abstract We measured ERPs of professional boxers in a Go/No-Go task, comparing them to fencers and non-athletes. Results showed that fencing improved attention and motor response control, but boxing did not. More strikingly, in boxers, as in brain trauma patients, the P3 component was delayed and reduced. The P3 delay of boxers was correlated with the amount of performed sport exercise. Furthermore, in terms of behavior, boxers showed increased intra-individual variability and switch cost. Results were consistent with the hypothesis of specific impairment at the level of response inhibition processing. We suggest that this impairment is derived from the cumulative effect of blows to the head. The changes found in boxers suggest that ERPs and reaction times may be a tool for early detection of specific brain dysfunction.

To determine the level of agreement between trained ED nursing staff and senior ED medical staff in the application and interpretation of the National Emergency X-radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) low-risk criteria (NLC). Methods:? A NEXUS training and accreditation package was developed. It was successfully undertaken by 22 senior ED nursing staff and 26 senior ED medical staff. A study nurse and doctor independently applied the NLC to a convenience sample of patients who had been placed in a hard cervical collar prior to arrival in the ED. The findings for each of the NLC and the overall decision regarding collar removal were recorded on specific case report forms. The primary endpoint was the level of agreement for the overall decision to leave the collar in place. Levels of agreement for the individual NLC were also examined. Results:? In total, 183 patients were recruited. The level of ?safe agreement? where nursing and medical staff agreed that the collar should be left in place was 94.3% (95% CI: 89.5?97.2%). Agreement with regard to individual NLC varied from good to fair. The median times from patient arrival to completion of study nurse and doctor assessments were 14?min (interquartile ranges [IQR] 5?30) and 29?min (IQR 15?47), respectively. Conclusion:? The study demonstrated a high level of agreement between nursing and medical staff for stable low-risk trauma patients.

AB  - Background Far West New South Wales Local Emergency Management Committee runs an annual crash simulation exercise to assess the operational readiness of all local emergency services to coordinate and manage a multi-casualty exercise. Context Since 2009, the Broken Hill University Department of Rural Health (BHUDRH) has collaborated with the committee, enabling the inclusion of health students in this exercise. It is an immersive interprofessional learning experience that evaluates teamwork, communication and safe effective clinical trauma management outside the hospital setting. Innovation After 7 years of modifying and developing the exercise, we set out to evaluate its impact on the students? learning, and sought ethics approval from the University of Sydney for this study. At the start of this year's crash simulation, students were given information sheets and consent forms with regards to the research. Once formal debriefing had finished, the researchers conducted a semi-structured focus-group interview with the health students to gain insight into their experience and their perceived value of the training. Students also completed short-answer questionnaires, and the anonymised responses were analysed. Crash simulation ? evaluates teamwork, communication and safe effective clinical trauma management Implications Participants identified that this multidisciplinary learning opportunity in a pre-hospital mass casualty situation was of value to them. It has taken them outside of their usually protected hospital or primary care setting and tested their critical thinking and communication skills. We recommend this learning concept to other educational institutions. Further research will assess the learning value of the simulated event to the other agencies involved.

AB  - Abstract Objective Asia?Pacific countries have unique prehospital emergency care or emergency medical services (EMS) systems, which are different from European or Anglo-American models. We aimed to compare the EMS systems of eight Asia?Pacific countries/regions as part of the Pan Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS), to provide a basis for future comparative studies across systems of care. Methods In the first phase, a systematic literature review of EMS system within the eight PAROS countries/regions of interest was conducted. In the second phase, PAROS site directors were surveyed for additional information about the demographics and characteristics of EMS services at their sites. Results The database and bibliography search identified 25 eligible articles. The survey of EMS systems was completed by seven PAROS directors. By combining information sources from phases 1 and 2, we found that all PAROS EMS systems were single-tiered, and most were public (vs private) and fire-based (Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Korea). Ambulance personnel were primarily emergency medical technicians and paramedics, except for Thailand and Turkey, whose personnel include nurses and physicians. Personnel were trained to use automated external defibrillators and have basic cardiac life support certification. The service capability of each EMS system in terms of dispatch, airway management and medications, for example, varied greatly. Conclusion We found variation in the EMS systems across the eight Asia?Pacific countries/regions studied. The findings will inform the construction of a multinational Asia?Pacific research network for future comparative studies and could serve as a model for international research networks.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In this second paper looking at pruritic skin disease in the cat, the aetiology and management of pruritus is discussed. Successful control is based upon diagnosis. The most frequently encountered aetiologies are considered including ectoparasites, bacterial, fungal and viral infections, allergic and immune-mediated dermatoses, neurological conditions, behavioural abnormalities and neoplasia. Management of pruritus is discussed looking at flea control, physical prevention of self trauma and the anti-inflammatory agents most frequently used in the treatment of pruritus in the cat.

AB  - Abstract Cell-based tissue engineering is a promising approach for treating cartilage lesions, but available strategies still provide a distinct composition of the extracellular matrix and an inferior mechanical property compared to native cartilage. To achieve fully functional tissue replacement more rationally designed biomaterials may be needed, introducing bioactive molecules which modulate cell behavior and guide tissue regeneration. This study aimed at exploring the impact of cell-instructive, adhesion-binding (GCWGGRGDSP called RGD) and collagen-binding (CKLER/CWYRGRL) peptides, incorporated in a tunable, matrixmetalloprotease (MMP)-responsive multi-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG)/heparin hydrogel on cartilage regeneration parameters in vitro and in vivo. MMP-responsive-starPEG-conjugates with cysteine termini and heparin-maleimide, optionally pre-functionalized with RGD, CKLER, CWYRGRL or control peptides, were cross-linked by Michael type addition to embed and grow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or chondrocytes. While starPEG/heparin-hydrogel strongly supported chondrogenesis of MSC according to COL2A1, BGN and ACAN induction, MMP-degradability enhanced cell viability and proliferation. RGD-modification of the gels promoted cell spreading with intense cell network formation without negative effects on chondrogenesis. However, CKLER and CWYRGRL were unable to enhance the collagen content of constructs. RGD-modification allowed more even collagen type II distribution by chondrocytes throughout the MMP-responsive constructs, especially in vivo. Collectively, peptide-instruction via heparin-enriched MMP-degradable starPEG allowed adjustment of self-renewal, cell morphology and cartilage matrix distribution in order to guide MSC and chondrocyte-based cartilage regeneration towards an improved outcome.

AB  - Dorsiflexor tendons are particularly exposed in crush injury of the foot. Anterior tibialis tendon defects may be responsible for a steppage gait and a drop foot deformity. Drop foot reconstruction is challenging because of the high risk of postoperative adhesions and functional sequelae. In this report, we present the results of the reconstruction of post-injury anterior tibialis tendon defects with chimeric deep inferior epigatric artery perforator (DIEP) free flap associated with a quadriceps osteotendinous graft in two patients. Two men (32-year-old and 19-year-old) presented drop foot deformity with defect of the anterior tibialis tendon secondary to a crush injury. The sizes of the soft tissues defects at the foot dorsum were 24 cm ? 8 cm and 20 cm ? 8 cm, respectively. The quadriceps osteotendinous grafts were used to reconstruct the anterior tibialis tendon in both patients. The chimeric DIEP free flaps with skin paddles (24 cm ? 8 cm and 20 cm ? 8 cm) and rectus abdominis fascia (24 cm ? 4 cm and 20 cm ? 4 cm) were used for reconstruction. The skin component based on a musculocutaneous perforator was used for soft tissue reconstruction of the foot dorsum. The fascial component based on a second perforator was used to create a sliding surface around the osteotendinous graft. Postoperative course was uneventful. Rehabilitation lasted 3 months. The range of ankle movement was measured during 12 months. The first patient recovered 10 degree of dorsiflexion. The second patient recovered 25 degree of dorsiflexion. Walk recovery was satisfying in both patients. The single-stage procedure using the chimeric DIEP free flap may be an option for post-injury drop foot reanimation. Creating a sliding surface around a composite osteotendinous quadriceps graft with a vascularized fascial component avoid postoperative peritendinous adhesions. This technique may improve foot dorsiflexion and walk recovery. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 36:334?338, 2016.
