AB  - Dorsiflexor tendons are particularly exposed in crush injury of the foot. Anterior tibialis tendon defects may be responsible for a steppage gait and a drop foot deformity. Drop foot reconstruction is challenging because of the high risk of postoperative adhesions and functional sequelae. In this report, we present the results of the reconstruction of post-injury anterior tibialis tendon defects with chimeric deep inferior epigatric artery perforator (DIEP) free flap associated with a quadriceps osteotendinous graft in two patients. Two men (32-year-old and 19-year-old) presented drop foot deformity with defect of the anterior tibialis tendon secondary to a crush injury. The sizes of the soft tissues defects at the foot dorsum were 24 cm ? 8 cm and 20 cm ? 8 cm, respectively. The quadriceps osteotendinous grafts were used to reconstruct the anterior tibialis tendon in both patients. The chimeric DIEP free flaps with skin paddles (24 cm ? 8 cm and 20 cm ? 8 cm) and rectus abdominis fascia (24 cm ? 4 cm and 20 cm ? 4 cm) were used for reconstruction. The skin component based on a musculocutaneous perforator was used for soft tissue reconstruction of the foot dorsum. The fascial component based on a second perforator was used to create a sliding surface around the osteotendinous graft. Postoperative course was uneventful. Rehabilitation lasted 3 months. The range of ankle movement was measured during 12 months. The first patient recovered 10 degree of dorsiflexion. The second patient recovered 25 degree of dorsiflexion. Walk recovery was satisfying in both patients. The single-stage procedure using the chimeric DIEP free flap may be an option for post-injury drop foot reanimation. Creating a sliding surface around a composite osteotendinous quadriceps graft with a vascularized fascial component avoid postoperative peritendinous adhesions. This technique may improve foot dorsiflexion and walk recovery. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 36:334?338, 2016.

AB  - Abstract Multiple recent Sickle Cell Disease studies have been terminated due to poor enrollment. We developed methods to overcome past barriers and utilized these to study the efficacy and safety of intravenous magnesium for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). We describe the methods of the Intravenous Magnesium in Sickle Vaso-occlusive Crisis (MAGiC) trial and discuss methods used to overcome past barriers. MAGiC was a multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous magnesium versus normal saline for treatment of VOC. The study was a collaboration between Pediatric Hematologists and Emergency Physicians in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). Eligible patients were randomized within 12?hours of receiving intravenous opioids in the Emergency Department (ED) and administered study medication every 8?hours. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Associated plasma studies elucidated magnesium's mechanism of action and the pathophysiology of VOC. Health-related quality of life was measured. Site-, protocol-, and patient-related barriers from prior studies were identified and addressed. Limited study staff availability, lack of collaboration with the ED, and difficulty obtaining consent were previously identified barriers. Leveraging PECARN resources, forging close collaborations between Sickle Cell Centers and EDs of participating sites, and approaching eligible patients for prior consent helped overcome these barriers. Participation in the PECARN network and establishment of collaborative arrangements between Sickle Cell Centers and their affiliated EDs are major innovative features of the MAGiC study that allowed improved subject capture. These methods could serve as a model for future studies of VOCs. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:1049?1054. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Executive Functions (EFs) development is critically affected by stress and trauma, as well as the socioeconomic context in which children grow up (Welsh, Nix, Blair, Bierman, & Nelson, 2010, Journal of Educational Psychology, 102, 43?53). Research in this field is surprisingly lacking in relation to war contexts. This study represents a first attempt at addressing this topic by evaluating EFs in Yazidi children. The Yazidi community is an ethnic and religious minority living in Iraq. From August 2014 onwards, the Yazidi community has been the target of several atrocities perpetrated by ISIS and described as genocide by the international community at large. The University of Trieste, thanks to a program financed by the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, developed a study aimed at (a) evaluating hot and cool EFs in children living in a war context and (b) developing a specific training method to enhance hot and cool EFs in Yazidi children of preschool age (N = 53). Data related to this group of children were compared with a sample of typically developing Italian children randomly assigned to either an EFs training group (N = 55) or a passive control group (N = 51). Results indicate different baselines in EFs in Yazidi and Italian samples and a significant effect of the program on both trained groups, especially in tasks measuring hot EFs. Data are discussed in terms of hot and cool EFs in children growing in adverse environments, as well as the evaluation of educational and developmental opportunities to prevent children who survived genocide from becoming a ?lost generation?.

AB  - Abstract Hemocompatible materials for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) technology are investigated to mitigate thrombotic complications associated with this therapy. A promising solution is an omniphobic bilayer coating, tethered liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP), which utilizes an immobilized tether to anchor a mobile, liquid surface lubricant that prevents adhesion of blood components to the substrate. In this study, we investigated the effects of TLP on real-time clot formation using thromboelastography (TEG). TLP was applied to TEG cups, utilizing perfluorodecalin (PFD) or FluorLube63 as the liquid layer, and compared to uncoated cups. Human blood (n = 10) was added to cups; and TEG parameters (R, K, α-angle, MA, LY30, LY60) and adherent thrombus weight were assessed. TLP decreased clot amplification (α-angle), clot strength (MA), and adherent clot weight (p?<?.0001). These effects were greater with FluorLube63 versus PFD (α-angle p?<?.0001; MA p = .0019; clot weight p?<?.0001). Reaction time (R) was longer in TLP-coated cups versus control cups with liquid lubricant added (p = .0377). Percent fibrinolysis (LY30 and LY60) was greater in the TLP versus controls at LY30 (p?<?.0001), and in FluoroLube63 versus controls at LY60 (p = .0021). TLP significantly altered clot formation, exerting antithrombogenic effects. This reduction in surface thrombogenicity supports TLP as a candidate for improved biocompatibility of ECLS materials, pending further validation with exposure to shear stress.

AB  - Abstract Boys and young men more frequently live out aspects of their psychic and social alienation online. This paper explores some of the risks and dangers that can arise from retreats into the two-dimensional world of cyberspace. It focuses more specifically on videogaming called MOBA, multi-player online battle arena games, in which players point and shoot at others. A case example emphasizes the clinical problems emerging from violent fantasies that seek a false form of containment in cyberspace. Themes of destructive fantasizing are further amplified through images of apocalypse, which are often prevalent in combat arena videogames. Textual sources from the Book of Revelation offer possible understanding for various elements of destructiveness as it appears in vulnerable male psyches. Therapeutic contact that combines a relational, containing approach and a broadly spiritual and soulful perspective can provide a path to healing such violent splits within the psyches of boys and young men.

AB  - Abstract Much attention has been given to the influences of bioactive factors on mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation, but few studies have examined the effect of mechanical factors on these cells. This study examined the effects of cyclic hydrostatic pressure on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells undergoing chondrogenic differentiation. Aggregates of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells were cultured in a defined chondrogenic medium and were subjected to cyclic hydrostatic pressure. Aggregates were loaded at various time points: single (day 1 or 3) or multiple (days 1?7). At 14 and 28 days, aggregates were harvested for histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative DNA and matrix macromolecule analysis. The aggregates loaded for a single day did not demonstrate significant changes in proteoglycan and collagen contents compared with the non-loaded controls. In contrast, for the multi-day loaded aggregates, statistically significant increases in proteoglycan and collagen contents were found on both day 14 and day 28. Aggregates loaded for seven days were larger and histological staining indicated a greater matrix/cell ratio. This study indicates that hydrostatic pressure enhances the cartilaginous matrix formation of mesenchymal progenitor cells differentiated in vitro, and suggests that mechanical forces may play an important role in cartilage repair and regeneration in vivo. ? 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Of the 248 soldiers killed in the 1985 crash of a chartered Army jetliner at Gander, Newfoundland, most (189) came from a single Army battalion. In order to gain a better understanding of psychological aspects of group adjustment to collective traumatic loss, a naturalistic case study was made of this battalion over the 6-month period following the crash. Of special interest was the problem of integrating new replacements, and the role of these replacements in helping or impeding group recovery. Extensive interview and observational data were collected at approximately monthly intervals. Results suggest four relatively distinct psycho-social phases of unit recovery, each lasting about 4?6 weeks: (1) Numb Dedication; (2) Anger-Betrayal; (3) Stoic Resolve; and (4) Integration. A reconstitution plan that intermixed replacements with veterans facilitated integration and unit recovery; veterans quickly accepted newcomers as allies in adversity. Despite some individual differences, the general response pattern indicates a group-level phenomenon of adaptation to collective trauma that includes both intrusion and denial. This model of group recovery from trauma calls attention to social aspects of the grief process, and suggests interactions between individual and social factors that may influence adjustment to traumatic loss.

AB  - To the Editor: In 1993 Valparaíso San Antonio Health Service initiated an Organizational Development Programme that included all facilities, extending from the six major hospitals to the 26 primary care clinics of the region. The programme adopted Quality Management as its model, without discarding other concepts and methods of proven effectiveness (see Walton 1992; Al-Asaf 1993; Ishikawa 1993).?In 1994 the Health Service Council identified the emergency care system as a model in need of great improvement and considered the incorporation of pre-hospital care as a top priority. The challenge was to implement a new system, affordable with a small budget, with greater satisfaction for staff and users, better coordinated and more responsive to local needs (see Ministère de la Santé 1992). ?Quality management techniques were used to adapt and develop a new model, essentially designed by local staff, based on the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and other relevant literature (Burnett  Grijseels et al. 1996; Gwinnutt  Hu  Jabbour et al. 1996; Boyington 1995). A ?network? model rather than a centralized one was chosen and implemented at a very low direct cost, optimizing existing resources.

AB  - Premise Plant sex is usually fixed, but in rare cases, sex expression is flexible and may be influenced by environmental factors. Theory links female sex expression to better health, but manipulative work involving the experimental change of health via injury is limited, particularly in sexually plastic species. A better understanding of mechanisms influencing shifts in sex is essential to our understanding of life history theory regarding trade-offs in sex allocation and differential mortality. Methods We investigated the relationship between physiological stress and sex expression in sexually plastic striped maple trees (Acer pensylvanicum) by inflicting damage of various intensities (crown pruning, defoliation, and hydraulic restriction). We then monitored the sex expression of injured and control individuals for 2 years to assess the extent to which injury may cue changes in sex expression. Results We found that severe damage such as full defoliation or severe pruning increased odds of changing sex to female and decreased odds of changing to male. In fact, no pruned male trees flowered male 2 years later, while all males in the control group flowered partially or fully male. After full defoliation, trees had 4.5 times higher odds of flowering female. Not all injury is equal; less-severe physical trauma did not affect the frequency of sex change to femaleness. Conclusions This work demonstrates that physical trauma in striped maple appears to exhibit a threshold effect in which only the most stressful of physiological cues instigate changes in sex expression, a phenomenon previously unknown, and that damage stress is strongly correlated with switching to femaleness. These findings have implications for population sex ratios and sustainability within an increasing stressful climate regime.

The review is not intended to identify the microscopist's ?cure all? technique for immunocytochemistry but rather to describe what techniques are available and what are their relative merits. Expensive equipment and technically complicated methods are not always necessary to collect robust data.

AB  - Abstract Downstream passage of European eel Anguilla anguilla (L.) in catchments with pump(s) for water level management is a major concern. Catchment-wide acoustic telemetry revealed silver eels quickly migrated downstream through unobstructed reaches (n = 12; mean ± SD = 17.9 ± 1.9 km/day). Fourteen of 17 acoustic-tagged eels detected at the pumping station (82.1%) retreated back upstream and ten (58.8%) passed through pumps after delays (9.5 ± 11.0 days). Multi-beam sonar imaging across the intake screen (55-mm gaps) revealed that peaks in migration occurred during the nights preceding the new moon but 76.7% retreated back upstream. All passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged eels recaptured (n = 56) downstream of a large (2.23-m diameter) mixed flow pump survived but 96.5% had minor injuries, reduced physical condition and/or abnormal behaviour. By contrast, 64.7% of PIT-tagged eels recaptured (n = 17) downstream of a small (0.8-m diameter) axial flow pump died. No acoustic-tagged eels that passed through the small axial flow pump (n = 10) performed onward migration at sea, unlike ?control? eels released downstream (n = 11). This evidence may help develop effective remediation measures, such as operational changes, to maximise escapement of catadromous eel species at pumping stations.

AB  - Abstract During excavations at the Early Neolithic site of the Brze?? Kujawski Group of the Lengyel Culture in Os?onki (central Poland), an atypical burial of an adult male was discovered. The individual's skeleton revealed traces of several perimortem injuries: both broken shins (the right shin with two fractures), a large fracture to the frontal bone and about 25 cut marks made with a flint blade in the parietal-occipital region of the cranium on the left side. The arrangement of the fractured parts of the lower limbs might suggest that the injuries were intentionally exposed. Due to the relatively rich grave goods, it seems unlikely that the buried person was rejected by the community and thus killed or stigmatized by mutilation of the cadaver. The way the cuts were made is different from the cases of scalping or severing muscles in cannibalistic or mortuary practices known from the literature. This burial probably reflects some special funerary rite, which is now difficult to reconstruct or interpret. It is both possible that the observed injuries resulted from wounds that led to the individual's death (perhaps in circumstances that motivated the other special features of the burial) or that they were inflicted on the dead body. Taking into account the probable practices of dismembering of the dead body or human sacrifice found in the later Neolithic period in Poland, all of these possibilities may be considered with respect to this burial.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The Myanmar Ministry of Health has formed a partnership with Australasian professional colleges and international medical specialists to deliver a comprehensive programme for emergency care training and development. We describe this programme, emphasising the training of the first emergency specialists for Myanmar. Methods Eighteen junior specialists (EM18) joined a new postgraduate diploma in emergency medicine (Dip EM) through the University of Medicine (1) (UM1), Yangon. Diploma content included an introductory course, clinical rotations, 2 months in the emergency receiving centre (ERC) of the Yangon General Hospital (YGH) supervised by a volunteer Australasian emergency physician (FACEM), several short courses and an educational visit to Hong Kong. Curriculum and assessments comprising written and oral exams were devised and delivered by volunteer FACEMs and Hong Kong specialists. Results All EM18 completed the 18 month programme and passed the final assessments to graduate in February 2014. Course strengths included the supervised clinical rotation to the ERC and short course teaching on emergency medical, surgical, trauma, paediatric and disaster topics. The educational visit to Hong Kong enabled the EM18 to visualise more advanced EM systems that could be adapted to the Myanmar context. The participating international clinicians provided expert strategic advice on ED design, staffing, equipment, nursing and pre-hospital systems to leaders within universities, hospitals and the Ministry of Health. Conclusion The first Myanmar postgraduate diploma in EM provides an example of collaborative and responsive clinical health capacity building in a context of very limited resources.

AB  - Abstract Clinically, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been used in treatment of many diseases, but the local oxidative stress (OS) of lesion severely limits the survival of BMSCs, which reduces the efficacy of BMSCs transplantation. Therefore, enhancing the anti-OS stress ability of BMSCs is a key breakthrough point. Preconditioning is a common protective mechanism for cells or body. Here, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of OS preconditioning on the anti-OS ability of BMSCs and its mechanism. Fortunately, OS preconditioning can increase the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, NQO1, and heme oxygenase 1 through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway, thereby decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, relieved the damage of ROS to mitochondria, DNA and cell membrane, enhanced the anti-OS ability of BMSCs, and promoted the survival of BMSCs under OS.

AB  - Murder of a loved one typically has a tremendous impact on the family as a whole and on individual members. While it is true people often react in very similar ways following such a traumatic loss, they do not necessarily grieve in the same way or at the same time. Additionally, the murder may have a detrimental effect on the stability, developmental tasks, communication patterns, and role functioning of the family. This paper explores some of the many issues and challenges families must face in the aftermath of a murder.

AB  - Summary We report the successful use of a stellate ganglion block as part of a multi-modal postoperative analgesic regimen. Four patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery following upper limb trauma underwent blockade of the stellate ganglion pre-operatively under ultrasound guidance. Patients reported excellent postoperative analgesia, with postoperative VAS pain scores between 0 and 2, and consumption of morphine in the first 24 h ranging from 0 to 14?mg. While these are preliminary findings, and must be confirmed in a clinical trial, they highlight the potential for stellate ganglion blockade to provide analgesia following major upper limb surgery.

AB  - Chronic osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect following surgical management is a severe complication for orthopaedic surgeons. Traditionally, the treatment protocol for the notorious complication involved thorough debridement, bone grafting, long-term antibiotic use and flap surgery. Alternatively, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a high concentration of platelets collected via centrifugation, has been successfully used as an adjuvant treatment for bone and soft-tissue infection in medical practices. PRP has numerous significant advantages, including stypsis, inflammation remission and reducing the amount of infected fluid. It increases bone and soft-tissue healing and allows fewer opportunities for transplant rejection. Through many years of studies showing the advantages of PRP, it has become preferred organic product for the clinical treatment of infections, especially for chronic osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect. To promote the clinical use of this simple and efficacious technique in trauma, we report the case of a patient with chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect that healed uneventfully with PRP.
