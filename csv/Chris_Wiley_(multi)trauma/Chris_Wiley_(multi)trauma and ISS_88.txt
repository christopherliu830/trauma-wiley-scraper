AB  - Introduction Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern with implications for animal health. This study investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal and environmental Escherichia coli isolated from animals sampled in referral hospitals in the UK. Materials and Methods Resistant Escherichia coli isolated from animal faeces and practice environments were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. PCR and sequencing techniques were used to identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC-producer genotypes. Results In total, 333 faecal and 257 environmental samples were collected. Multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli were found in 13·1% of faecal and 8·9% of environmental samples. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC genes were identified 14% and 7·7% of faecal samples and 8·6% and 8·6% of environmental samples, respectively. The most common extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene type detected was blaCTX-M ?15, although blaTEM-158 was detected in faecal and environmental samples from one practice. Clinical Significance Escherichia coli resistant to key antimicrobials were isolated from hospitalised animals and the practice environment. We identified the emergence of the inhibitor resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase blaTEM-158 in companion animals. Further investigation to determine risk factors for colonisation with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is needed to provide evidence for antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programmes.

AB  - Abstract Critically ill patients, not infrequently present alterations of physiological parameters that determine the success/failure of therapeutic interventions as well as the final outcome. Sepsis and polytrauma are two of the most common and complex syndromes occurring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and affect drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and elimination. Pharmacological management of ICU patients requires consideration of the unique pharmacokinetics associated with these clinical conditions and the likely occurrence of drug interaction. Rational adjustment in drug choice and dosing contributes to the appropriateness of treatment of those patients.

AB  - Background and Objectives Scar rehabilitation is a complex process that incorporates medical, surgical, and physical therapeutic measures to best restore function and visual normalcy. Lasers have emerged as essential tools in the management of scars, with devices available to address scar size, dyschromia, and contour irregularities. As different lasers treat these different features, multi-laser, same session therapeutic approaches may offer a more comprehensive approach to scar revision. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the effect of a combinatorial, same session treatment with intense pulsed light (IPL) and fractional ablative CO2 as compared to single laser treatment with fractional ablative CO2 laser alone or control in the treatment of mature hypertrophic scars. Materials and Methods This institutional review board-approved, randomized controlled trial, enrolled 23 healthy adults with large (>100?cm2) hypertrophic scars who were randomized to one of three treatment arms: (i) IPL and CO2 ablative fractional laser (AFL), (ii) CO2 AFL alone, and (iii) control (no laser treatment). Subjects underwent a total of four treatment sessions at 6?8-week intervals with follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months following the last treatment session. Primary endpoints included blinded scoring of before and after photographs via the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS). Secondary endpoints included the Patient-Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Results As compared to control and CO2 AFL laser alone, the combination of CO2 AFL and IPL demonstrated statistically significant improvement across a greater number of scar domains, as assessed by the MSS. 100% of subjects in both treatment groups showed a statistically significant decrease in the POSAS scale after the series of four treatment sessions. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion Treatment with combined IPL and CO2 AFL demonstrated higher average improvements across the majority of assessed scar domains, as compared to both control and CO2 laser alone. The difference was not statistically significant in overall MSS score as expected due to the role of CO2 as the main source of improvement. However, only the combination group had statistically significant improvement in both color and texture. These findings support the assertion that a multi-photo-thermolytic approach with combined IPL and CO2 AFL can have a positive impact on the treatment of hypertrophic scars by using multiple wavelengths to maximize laser-skin interactions in targeting the different chromophores expressed in scar tissue.

AB  - Non-technical summary? The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical brain structure critically involved in the production of eye and head movements to novel or salient visual cues. But to accomplish its function, an input from visual cortex also is required. Because visual cortex projects directly to the SC, this route is typically viewed as the predominant way by which cortex exerts higher-level control over SC-mediated behaviours. However, anatomical studies suggest that other multi-neuronal circuits through the basal ganglia, a collection of interconnected structures involved in decision making, might provide an alternative way for cortex to influence the SC. The present study provides physiological evidence for such an alternative route and affords additional insights into how the brain initiates and controls movements in response to visual cues. Such knowledge could be important for developing therapies to lessen the effects of visual deficits in patients experiencing loss of function following head trauma or stroke.

PY  - 2015
AB  - Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) is the most common cause for thoracic spinal stenosis. TOLF is usually complicated by thoracic disc herniation, ossi?cation of the posterior longitudinal ligament and degenerative spinal diseases such as cervical spondylosis and lumbar spinal stenosis, and the ossi?cation also usually has a discontinuous or continuous multi-segment distribution. The resultant superposition of several symptoms makes the clinical manifestations complex. Currently, the diagnosis of TOLF depends mainly on the patient's symptoms, physical examination and thoracic CT and MRI examinations. Identification of the location of TOLF depends more on the doctor's subjective judgement. Diagnostic problems are related to the specific region and level of surgical decompression: if the extent of decompression is insufficient, the treatment is inadequate, resulting in residual symptoms. Obversely, unnecessary trauma and a various complications will occur if the decompression is too extensive. Hence, the clinical features and process of diagnosis, especially the means of identifying the location, still require further improvement. It is necessary to establish a simple and accurate means of identifying the segment of TOLF that is responsible for the neurologic deficit: a number of spinal surgeons have been working hard on this. This article will provided an overview of the clinical features of TOLF and the related problems of clinical identification of the location of the segment causing the neurological deficit. The relationship between the imaging manifestations and clinical characteristics still need to be explored with the aim of establishing a simple and precise method for determining precisely whether TOLF is related to spinal cord injury or not, thus reducing surgical trauma and achieving an optimal prognosis.

AB  - Summary. Objectives.? The aims of the present study were to investigate the type and prevalence of dental emergencies presenting at a teaching hospital paediatric emergency clinic in Trinidad, and to describe the socio-demographic factors related to the use of the service. Design and methods. ? The authors used a prospective study of consecutive dental patients presenting to a paediatric emergency clinic. Data recorded included type of presenting emergency and socio-demographic variables. Results.? Data were available for 309 participants; 47% were male and 53% female. The average age of the participants was 8·66 years (SD = 3·75 years; range = 1?16 years). Seventy-three per cent of the participants? parents were involved in manual work or unemployed, and 21% were in nonmanual/professional employment; the occupation was not known in 6% of cases. Caries-related problems accounted for 74% of emergencies. Dental trauma mostly affected the upper permanent incisor teeth, with concussion, subluxation and intrusion being the most common injuries. Conclusion.? Dental emergencies presenting to this university-based clinic were predominantly related to caries and trauma. The service was more frequently utilized by children in the mixed dentition stage, children from lower socioeconomic groups and those living in the local area. The frequency of caries-related problems indicates the need for more community-based preventive strategies, including encouraging greater attendance for routine dental care and dental health education. Strategies for oral health promotion should also be developed to prevent dental trauma.

AB  - Introduction Health professionals are frequently exposed to traumatic events due to the nature of their work. While traumatic and adverse labour and birth events experienced by women are well researched, less attention has been given to midwives? and nurses? experiences of these events and the impact it has on their lives. Aims and objectives To undertake a meta-ethnographic study of midwives? and nurses? experiences of adverse labour and birth events. Methods Scopus, CINHAL PLUS, MEDLINE and PUBMED databases were searched using subject headings and keywords. The search was limited to papers published in peer-reviewed journals from 2004?October 2016. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Inclusion criteria Papers had to be qualitative or have a substantial qualitative component. Studies were included if they primarily focused on midwives? or nurses? perspectives or experiences of complicated, traumatic or adverse labour and birth events. Analytic strategy A meta-ethnographic approach was used incorporating methods of reciprocal translation guided by the work of Noblit and Hare (1988, Meta-Ethnography: Synthesizing qualitative studies (Vol. 11). Newbury Park: Sage publications). Findings Eleven qualitative studies were included in the final sample. Four major themes were (i) feeling the chaos; (ii) powerless, responsible and a failure; (iii) ?It adds another scar to my soul?; and (iv) finding a way to deal with it. Conclusion Midwives and nurses feel relatively unprepared when faced with a real-life labour and birth emergency event. While many of the midwives and nurses were traumatised by the experience, some were able to view their encounter as an opportunity to develop their emergency response skills. Relevance to clinical practice Witnessing and being involved in a complicated or adverse labour and birth event can be traumatic for nurses and midwives. Organisational and collegial support needs to be available to enable these health professionals to talk about their feelings and concerns.

AB  - Summary Intestinal hyperammonaemia in horses is a syndrome putatively caused by increased intestinal production and/or absorption of ammonia that clinically manifests as severe neurological abnormalities often in conjunction with signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction but without evidence of hepatic compromise. Ingestion of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a novel primary condition that may predispose to development of the syndrome as described in this issue. Treatment of the condition is symptomatic and aimed at decreasing blood ammonium concentrations by reducing further production and absorption, reducing brain oedema and preventing self-inflicted trauma. Prognosis for survival is guarded, particularly in cases with severe gastrointestinal lesions, and is influenced by the ability to control clinical signs.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a brief account of a qualitative multicultural study and heuristic exploration of how trainee counsellors understand black issues in their training and in their therapeutic work with clients. This initiative is supported by a previous survey of black clients and therapists who suggest that changes are needed in training. It presents current legislation and need for equalities in Higher Education and counsellor training, by challenging the dominance of Eurocentric approaches. A pluralistic, flexible Action Research methodology will be outlined. The theory and context of previous studies are presented. Phases of the process are described to show how this study was approached. Phase one describes how interviews with a variety of experienced practitioners confirmed the need for the study. Using examples of trainees? narratives, phase two describes how the phenomenon of black issues was integrated into training and the process of generating data. The paper shows how the explication process reveals elements of fear, history, guilt and racism, present in the dynamic of black issues. The paper highlights how racism features highly in trainees? concerns and influences their ability to share and understand. A snapshot of emerging concepts such as ?finding a voice? and ?recognition trauma? which are developed to assist the reflexive process is featured. The role of the researcher and black trainees as ?black expert? is discussed. In the context of ethical concerns and working through the researcher's counter transference as a black female tutor researcher, the process of modelling within a participatory role is described. An excerpt from a discussion with colleagues gives an essence of the outcome. The outcome is summarised in the conclusion:'A bridge from fear to transformation?. The study enabled both trainees and staff as collaborators to shift from a position of fear and not knowing to engaging in active dialogue about black issues on a personal and professional basis.

AB  - Abstract Background Obesity is common in the equine population and it has been associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality in humans. The effect of increased body mass index (BMI) on the incidence of surgical site infections has not been investigated in horses. Objectives To determine whether horses with increased body fat, as estimated by BMI, are more likely to develop post-operative complications, particularly incisional complications, following emergency ventral midline celiotomy. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional clinical study. Methods Medical records of horses >2 years old presenting with colic that underwent ventral midline celiotomy between January 2010 and September 2018 with follow-up of a minimum of 30 post-operative days were reviewed. Extracted data included signalment, operative details and outcome. BMI was calculated by dividing the patient's weight (kg) by the withers height squared (m2). Results In all, 287 horses fit inclusion criteria. Incisional complication prevalence was 23.7%. Horses with incisional complications had a higher BMI (median 203.6 kg/m2, IQR = 191.5-217.4) compared with those without (median 199.1 kg/m2, IQR = 184.7-210.2) (P = .03). Multi-variable analysis of the effects of age, sex, breed and presence of metabolic disease on the association between BMI and risk of incisional complications, identified a tendency towards increased risk with a higher BMI, but statistical significance decreased to P = .07. Breed had an association with BMI (P < .01), but not with incisional complication risk. Main limitations BMI as an estimate of body fat has limitations. Retrospective studies with reliance on owners reporting data and complete medical records is imperfect. When the data were subjected to multi-variable analysis, the trend towards an increased incidence of incisional complications in horses with higher BMI persisted but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion Higher BMI may increase the risk for the development of incisional complications in horses following emergency ventral midline celiotomy.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, indications, potential risks, complications, and expected outcomes of strictures, and procedures for balloon dilation, bougienage and injections and esophageal stenting to treat esophageal obstruction in cats and dogs. Esophageal obstructions can be a result of extraluminal or intraluminal occlusion. Strictures occur secondary to local esophageal injury often associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) or direct damage (esophageal trauma, caustic irritation, post surgical inflammation). Treatment for benign esophageal strictures includes medical management, bougienage, balloon dilation, resection and anastomosis, and salvage esophageal stenting. A subset of strictures is termed refractory benign esophageal strictures (RBES) and recurs despite multiple attempts at dilation. Both balloon dilation and bougienage have been used in animals for the management of benign esophageal strictures. Stents were found to immediately improve the dysphagia score, but were met with some complications, most commonly discomfort from the presence of the stent or chronic esophageal distension.

AB  - BACKGROUND Implications from the pragmatic, randomize, optimal platelet and plasma ratios (PROPPR) trial are critical for remote damage control resuscitation (DCR). Utilizing DCR principals in remote settings can combat early mortality from hemorrhage. Identifying the appropriate transfusion strategy is mandatory prior to adopting prehospital hemostatic resuscitation strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The PROPPR study was examined in relation to the following questions: 1) Why is it important to have blood products in the prehospital setting?; 2) Which products should be investigated for prehospital hemostatic resuscitation?; 3) What is the appropriate ratio of blood product transfusion?; and 4) What are the appropriate indications for hemostatic resuscitation? RESULTS PROPPR demonstrates that early and balanced blood product transfusion ratios reduced mortality in all patients at 3 hours and death from exsanguination at 24 hours (p?=?0.03). The median time to death from exsanguination was 2.3 hours, highlighting the need for point-of-injury DCR capabilities. A 1:1:1 transfusion ratio of plasma:platelets:packed red blood cells increased the percentage of patients achieving anatomic hemostasis (p?=?0.006). PROPPR used the assessment of blood consumption score to identify patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. The critical administration threshold predicted patient mortality and identified patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. CONCLUSION A balanced resuscitation strategy demonstrates an early survival benefit, decreased death from exsanguination at 24 hours and a greater likelihood of achieving hemostasis in critically injured patients receiving a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma:platelets:PRBCs. This finding highlights the need to import DCR principals to remote locations.

AB  - Inguinal hernia was associated with trauma in five dogs and was considered nontraumatic in 30 dogs. There were 11 males, 13 intact females, and six spayed females with nontraumatic inguinal hernia. Six dogs had bilateral hernias. Five dogs were younger than 4 months at the time of diagnosis. In 11 older dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia, the hernias were identified less than 7 days before surgical repair; in 14 older dogs, the hernias had been recognized for 1 to 60 months. Clinical signs in dogs without small intestinal incarceration were usually limited to a visible or palpable mass without pain or systemic illness. Hemiorrhaphy approaches included inguinal, midline with contralateral ring evaluation, and celiotomy with or without inguinal exposure. Fat and omentum were the most common hernial contents. Small intestine was within the hernias of 12 dogs. Six dogs had nonviable small intestine. Postoperative complications included two incisional infections, one incisional dehiscence, two cases of peritonitis and sepsis associated with bowel leakage after intestinal resection and anastomosis, and one hernia recurrence. The overall prevalence of postoperative complications was 17%, and the mortality rate was 3%. Vomiting for 2 to 6 days was predictive of nonviable small intestine. Dogs younger than 2 years were at 11 times greater risk for nonviable small intestine than dogs older than 2 years. Four of five dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia and nonviable small intestine were intact males, whereas none of 13 intact females were affected. Only one of 14 dogs with longstanding hernias had nonviable small intestine.

AB  - Summary Onychectomy, or surgical amputation of the third phalanx (P3), is an elective surgical procedure performed on the forelimbs of cats to eliminate destructive or harmful scratching behavior. After removal of P3, the surgical site is closed using suture or surgical tissue adhesive or left open to heal by second intention. Short-term complications include hemorrhage, pain, neuropraxia or ischemic injury secondary to tourniquet application, digital pad trauma, lameness, and non-weight bearing. Long-term complications include infection or osteomyelitis, nail regrowth, chronic pain syndrome, development of a palmigrade stance, lameness, and protrusion of the second phalanx (P2). Pain and lameness after onychectomy is a debilitating complication for the patient and can cause significant emotional stress for the pet owner. Most recent literature regarding feline onychectomy has focused on the use of CO2 laser and its potential for reducing pain and lameness compared with traditional blade dissection.

AB  - Background/aim Legibility is important for functional, handwritten communication. Deficits in legibility can impair occupational performance following stroke or trauma. Few instruments are available to assess adult handwriting legibility during rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to compare inter-rater reliability of a new four-point legibility rating instrument with two existing instruments, and describe scale structure and item difficulty of each instrument. Methods Three trained raters scored 60 handwriting samples using: (i) a Four-Point Scale (FPS); (ii) the modified Evaluation Tool of Children's Handwriting (mETCH); and (iii) the new modified FPS. Rater concordance and exact agreement were investigated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC3,1), multi-rater kappa (?) and Krippendorff's alpha (α). Cronbach's alpha was calculated to examine internal consistency reliability, and Rasch modelling was used to examine scale structure and item difficulty. Results Rater concordance for the FPS was fair (ICC3,1 = 0.37); exact agreement was poor (? = 0.19; α = 0.19). Rater concordance for the two mETCH subtests was fair to moderate (ICC3,1 = 0.39?0.50), but with no exact agreement (? < 0.00). Rater concordance for three subtests of the modified FPS was slight to moderate (ICC3,1 = 0.16?0.51); exact agreement ranged from nil to fair (? = ?0.06?0.30; α = ?0.05?0.30). Rasch modelling confirmed internal consistency of instruments, but was low between-rater consistency (rater severity variability). Conclusions A reliable instrument for measuring change over time remains elusive. In the meantime, these instruments can be used by individual clinicians to diagnose and rate legibility.

AB  - Abstract ?Community mobilization? in the Community Trials Project refers to organizing community members to support and implement policies to reduce alcohol-involved trauma. This paper defines the conceptual model of mobilization used in the project. In evaluating the project, we were guided by the conceptual model and we used structured materials from interviews with local staff in all three experimental communities; we found that the overall goal of mobilization (implementation of policies) was achieved. Additional observations based on naturalistic case studies of the communities include: (1) the importance of an established research base, (2) the varying role and problematic nature of coalitions, (3) the strategic advantage of early project support r among the general population, (4) the role played by key leaders in mobilization, (5) the advantages of a multi-component design, and (6) the key role played by media advocacy.

AB  - Summary.? The Middle and Late Iron Age samples of disarticulated human remains from the settlement site of Gussage All Saints and the hillfort of Maiden Castle (Dorset, England) were investigated for evidence of funerary rites. The samples were examined using osteological, forensic and archaeological methodologies for evidence of excarnation and secondary burial. The study found evidence for dry-fractures, animal gnawing and peri-mortem trauma, indicating that many individuals had received blunt-force cranial fractures and/or weapon injuries at the time of death. The taphonomic indicators showed that bodies were excarnated, received secondary burial treatment and then selected skull and long bones were incorporated into structured deposits. Osteological analysis also showed that the majority of individuals were adult males, which corresponded to patterns of trauma in the inhumated sample from Dorset. Two bones also provided unique evidence within Dorset for the cultural modification of human remains.

AB  - Case We investigated the usefulness of multidetector computed tomography during examination in the emergency department to detect the location of press-through packages that had been inadvertently swallowed. In three patients, four press-through packages were detected on multi-planar reconstruction of multidetector computed tomography images, with three lodged in the esophagus and one in the stomach. Outcome The multidetector computed tomography detection rate of press-through packages was 100% in patients who realized they had swallowed the packages by mistake. After diagnosis, press-through packages in the esophagus were immediately removed endoscopically. Conclusion There are few reports on the usefulness of multi-planar reconstruction images by multidetector computed tomography during examinations in the emergency department for the diagnosis of foreign bodies in patients who have mistakenly swallowed press-through packages. Detecting the location of the packages provided useful information regarding the strategy for their removal. Therefore, proactive multidetector computed tomography use in the emergency department could be beneficial for patients who have inadvertently swallowed press-through packages.

AB  - Increased-risk donor (IRD) organs make up a significant proportion of the deceased organ donor pool but may be declined by patients on the waiting list for various reasons. We conducted a survey of patients awaiting a liver transplant to determine the factors leading to the acceptance of an IRD organ as well as what strategies could increase the rate of acceptance. Adult liver transplant candidates who were outpatients completed a survey of 51 questions on a 5-point Likert scale with categories related to demographics, knowledge of IRDs, and likelihood of acceptance. A total of 150 transplant candidates completed the survey (age 19-80 years). Male patients constituted 67.3%. Many patients (58.7%) had postsecondary education. Only 23.3% of patients had a potential living donor, and 58/144 (40.3%) were not optimistic about receiving an organ in the next 3 months. The overall IRD organ acceptance rate was 41.1%, whereas 26.2% said they would decline an IRD organ. Women were more likely to accept an IRD organ (54.3% versus 34.7%; P = 0.02). Those who had a college education or higher tended to have lower IRD organ acceptability (28.3% versus 47.4%; P = 0.07). Acceptability also increased as the specified transmission risk of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus decreased (P < 0.001). Patients were also more likely to accept an IRD organ if they were educated on the benefits of IRD organs (eg, knowledge that an IRD organ was of better quality increased overall acceptance from 41.1% to 63.3%; P < 0.001). Our survey provides insight into liver transplant candidates who would benefit from greater education on IRD organs. Strategies targeting specific educational points are likely to increase acceptability.

AB  - Aim Flexed knee gait can be treated with distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) and additional patellar tendon advancement (PTA) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study assesses changes in hamstring muscle tendon length (MTL) and velocity after DFEO (+PTA). Method Nineteen children (mean age 13y [standard deviation 3y] at surgery) with CP and flexed knee gait who were treated with DFEO (15 limbs) or DFEO+PTA (10 limbs) were retrospectively included in this study. Gait analyses were performed preoperatively (E0), 1 year postoperatively (E1), and for 10 limbs additionally 2 to 5 years postoperatively (E2). Hamstring MTL and velocities were assessed at all examination dates using OpenSim. Results Hamstring MTL and velocity did not change significantly over time. From E0 to E1, knee flexion in stance improved for both DFEO and DFEO+PTA (p<0.05), knee flexion in swing only improved after DFEO+PTA (p<0.05). The improved knee flexion in stance and swing was maintained at E2. Interpretation DFEO led to a significant improvement in knee kinematics at E1 which was maintained at E2. DFEO seems to prevent recurrent hamstring tightness but does not lead to lengthened or fastened hamstrings. What this paper adds Distal femoral extension osteotomy (DFEO) does not change hamstring muscle tendon length. DFEO does not change hamstring lengthening velocity. DFEO leads to a significant improvement in knee kinematics. Changes in knee kinematics after DFEO can be maintained at mid-term. DFEO seems to prevent recurrent hamstring tightness.
