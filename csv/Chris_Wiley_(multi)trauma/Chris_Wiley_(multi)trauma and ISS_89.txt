AB  - Background/aim Sensory approaches in mental health are designed to assist consumers to regulate physiological and emotional arousal. They have been highlighted as non-invasive, self-directed and empowering interventions that may support recovery-oriented and trauma-informed mental health practice and may assist in efforts to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint. Over recent years, there has been a substantial increase in research in this area. However, there has not yet been any attempt to map and summarise this literature. Method A five-stage scoping review was conducted. Four databases were searched for literature evaluating sensory interventions implemented in mental health settings. Results A total of 17 studies were included in the final review. A range of sensory approaches was evaluated and a range of outcomes measured. In general, consumers reported reductions in distress associated with engaging in sensory interventions. Results in terms of reduction of seclusion and restraint were mixed, with some studies reporting a decrease, others reporting no change and one reporting an increase. Methodological limitations in the studies reviewed mean that results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions Although there is emerging evidence for the usefulness of sensory approaches in supporting consumers? self-management of distress, there is less evidence for sensory approaches supporting reductions in seclusion and restraint when used in isolation. More research is necessary, but sensory approaches do appear safe and effective. Services wishing to reduce seclusion and restraint should implement sensory approaches in conjunction with other strategies to achieve this important outcome.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine if balloon injury to the adjacent arterial wall during intracoronary stent deployment influences late in-stent neointimal formation. Stent design and deployment techniques are considered important factors in determining acute and long-term success with intracoronary stenting. Experimental and clinical studies support that the extent of neointimal formation and the probability for restenosis are influenced by the magnitude of arterial trauma induced with stenting. Nineteen 18-mm-long balloon-expandable stainless steel stents (MULTI-LINK Duet) were implanted at a 1:1 stent-to-artery ratio in the coronary arteries of swine with a conventional noncompliant balloon (n = 10) or a novel noncompliant balloon with short tapered shoulders to prevent edge dissection (n = 9). Quantitative coronary angiography and histology were used to evaluate balloon and artery interactions and the chronic vascular responses to the stents. Nineteen stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of seven swines at an inflation pressure of 14 atm using a standard noncompliant (n = 10) or a unique short transitional edge protection (n = 9) balloon. Histologic analysis at 28 days demonstrated balloon-associated barotrauma in 13 of 20 (65%) of adjacent nonstented arterial segments with the conventional balloon and only 3 of 18 (17%) of the adjacent nonstented arterial segments with the short transition edge protection balloon (P = 0.022). In-stent neointimal area and % stenosis correlated with the severity of peristent arterial injury (r = 0.43, P = 0.01). In-stent vessel injury scores were similar for stents with peristent injury (1.0 ± 0.3) versus stents without peristent injury (1.0 ± 0.03, P = 0.73). In-stent neointimal area and % stenosis were greater for stents with peristent injury (2.36 ± 0.74 mm2, 32% ± 9%) as compared to stents without peristent injury (1.39 ± 0.70 mm2, 20% ± 10%, P = 0.01). Arterial wall injury adjacent to a stent after high-pressure deployment contributes to late in-stent neointimal hyperplasia in this model. These experimental data suggest that further study is warranted to refine stent implantation techniques and that modifications of balloon shape or material may be useful to optimize stent deployment and reduce arterial trauma.

AB  - Summary.? Introduction: Although the advent of multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) has enabled better visualization of subsegmental pulmonary (SSP) arteries, SSP embolism is of uncertain clinical significance. We aimed at answering the following questions: Is spiral CT an accurate method to detect SSP embolism? How are subsegmental perfusion defects managed in outcome studies including spiral CT? What are the main characteristics and outcomes of patients in whom CT detects isolated subsegmental defects? Methods: We performed a Medline search on July 1, 2004, using the keywords ?pulmonary embolism? and ?computed tomography?. We limited our search to English language prospective studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and to prospective outcome studies including CT in a diagnostic strategy, with at least a 3-month follow-up. Results: Fourteen studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and five prospective management studies using CT were retrieved. The sensitivity of single-detector CT for detecting subsegmental defects compared with pulmonary angiography was low (25%). The proportion of isolated SSP images was significantly higher in management studies using multi-detector CT (17 of 770 scans, 2.2%) compared with those using single-detector CT (22 of 2232, 1.0%; P?=?0.01). No straightforward attitude regarding anticoagulation therapy for isolated subsegmental defects emerged from the available literature. Finally, important clinical differences were found between patients having subsegmental and segmental or more proximal defects. Conclusions: These findings underline the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of SSP embolism, and the management of patients with such findings.

AB  - Objective To test whether polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-S) interacts with childhood adversity and daily-life stressors to influence momentary mental state domains (negative affect, positive affect, and subtle psychosis expression) and stress-sensitivity measures. Methods The data were retrieved from a general population twin cohort including 593 adolescents and young adults. Childhood adversity was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Daily-life stressors and momentary mental state domains were measured using ecological momentary assessment. PRS-S was trained on the latest Psychiatric Genetics Consortium schizophrenia meta-analysis. The analyses were conducted using multilevel mixed-effects tobit regression models. Results Both childhood adversity and daily-life stressors were associated with increased negative affect, decreased positive affect, and increased subtle psychosis expression, while PRS-S was only associated with increased positive affect. No gene?environment correlation was detected. There is novel evidence for interaction effects between PRS-S and childhood adversity to influence momentary mental states [negative affect (b = 0.07, P = 0.013), positive affect (b = ?0.05, P = 0.043), and subtle psychosis expression (b = 0.11, P = 0.007)] and stress-sensitivity measures. Conclusion Exposure to childhood adversities, particularly in individuals with high PRS-S, is pleiotropically associated with emotion dysregulation and psychosis proneness.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The aims of this study were to describe clinical staff perceptions of their ED working environment and to explore associations between staff demographics, coping styles and the work environment. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in one Swedish ED and two Australian EDs in 2015?2016. Descriptive statistics were used to explore stressors, coping styles and aspects of the working environment for the combined cohort and the cohort split by age, sex, professional role, years of employment in the ED and country. Regression analyses examined the impact of coping style and demographic characteristics on staff perceptions of the working environment. Results Two hundred and six ED staff completed the survey (response rate: 64%). Factors most stressful for ED staff included death or sexual abuse of a child, heavy workload and poor skill mix. Staff perceptions of the working environment differed based on age, sex, country, tenure and job role. Regression analysis of perceptions of the work environment on demographics and coping strategies revealed that negative coping strategies were associated with low self-realisation, high workload, high conflict and high nervousness. Active coping and positive thinking were associated with increased self-realisation. Positive thinking was associated with lower levels of conflict. Conclusions Employees engaging in positive coping strategies had more positive perceptions of the work environment, while those engaging in maladaptive coping strategies reported negative perceptions of the work environment. These data suggest that strategies that promote the use of active coping and positive thinking should be encouraged and warrant further research in the ED.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

While palpating the tissues of the lower lip we felt the presence of a foreign body. This was confirmed by a radiograph of the lip that showed a radiopaque material, being similar to the coronal fragment of the fractured incisor. It was successfully surgically removed and immediately reattached using a composite adhesive technique. At the follow-up of 1?year later the vitality test on the teeth was positive and neither one of the two traumatized teeth showed any sign of discoloration.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an elevated risk of post-operative complications. The impact it has on patients living with DM following hip fracture surgery (HFS) is not completely understood and may represent a predictor of increased mortality. This study investigates the impact of DM, gender, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and fracture location, on the outcome of HFS in Ireland. The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) database records all fragility hip fractures within Galway University Hospital. Retrospective data collection was performed over a 3-year period. Data collected included patient age, gender, date of HFS, anatomical fracture location, type of operation, ASA grade, DM status, and mortality. A database of 650 individuals was created including 461 females and 189 males, with an average group age of 80.2?±?9.3 years. Results showed a significantly higher incidence of hip fractures in males with DM (19.57%) than females with DM (12.36%) (?2 test, p?=?0.020). Cox regression survival analysis indicated that DM status and ASA grade were the two main independent predictors of patient survival following HFS. Nevertheless, when examining the combined impact of gender and DM status on survival after HFS, results showed that survival post HFS differed significantly with gender and presence of DM (log-rank test, p?<?0.001), with males with DM performing worse than females with DM (p?=?0.021) or males without DM (p?=?0.001). This gender and disease-associated outcome should prompt an early multi-disciplinary team approach to the management of hip fractures in patients with DM. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - The anatomical response of Norway spruce bark polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) to inoculation with the phytopathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica and attack by its bark-beetle vector Ips typographus was examined. Fungal inoculation on the periderm surface had no effect, while inoculation just below the periderm or halfway into the phloem (mid-phloem) generated detectable responses within 3 wk. The responses included increase in PP cell size and in periodic acid-Schiff's staining of PP cell phenolics, wound periderm initiation from PP cells, and cambial zone traumatic resin duct formation. Fungi were not seen in samples 3 wk after subperiderm or mid-phloem inoculation, but were found in some samples 6 and 9 wk after mid-phloem inoculation. In contrast, inoculations into the cambium resulted in partial (3 wk) or complete (6 and 9 wk) fungal colonization and death of tissue in the infected area. This indicates that PP cells have defenses capable of inhibiting fungal growth. Samples taken near bark-beetle galleries had similar anatomical responses as inoculated samples, validating the inoculation approach to studying defense responses in spruce. These results show that PP cells represent not only a constitutive defense system, but are also involved in local and remote inducible defenses against fungal and beetle attack.

AB  - The energy-sensing AMP-activated serine/threonine protein kinase (AMPK) confers cell survival in part by stimulation of cellular energy production and limitation of cellular energy utilization. AMPK-sensitive functions further include activities of epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and voltage-gated K+ channel KCNE1/KCNQ1. AMPK is activated by an increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The present study explored whether AMPK regulates the Ca2+-sensitive large conductance and voltage-gated potassium (BK) channel. cRNA encoding BK channel was injected into Xenopus oocytes with and without additional injection of wild-type AMPK (AMPKα1+AMPK?1+AMPK?1), constitutively active AMPK?R70Q, or inactive AMPKαK45R. BK-channel activity was determined utilizing the 2-electrode voltage-clamp. Moreover, BK-channel protein abundance in the cell membrane was determined by confocal immunomicroscopy. As BK channels are expressed in outer hair cells (OHC) of the inner ear and lack of BK channels increases noise vulnerability, OHC BK-channel expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and hearing function analyzed by auditory brain stem response measurements in AMPKα1-deficient mice (ampk?/?) and in wild-type mice (ampk+/+). As a result, coexpression of AMPK or AMPK?R70Q but not of AMPKαK45R significantly enhanced BK-channel-mediated currents and BK-channel protein abundance in the oocyte cell membrane. BK-channel expression in the inner ear was lower in ampk?/? mice than in ampk+/+ mice. The hearing thresholds prior to and immediately after an acoustic overexposure were similar in ampk?/? and ampk+/+ mice. However, the recovery from the acoustic trauma was significantly impaired in ampk?/?mice compared to ampk+/+ mice. In summary, AMPK is a potent regulator of BK channels. It may thus participate in the signaling cascades that protect the inner ear from damage following acoustic overstimulation.?Föller, M., Jaumann, M., Dettling, J., Saxena, A., Pakladok, T., Munoz, C., Ruth, P., Sopjani, M., Seebohm, G., Rüttiger, L., Knipper, M., Lang, F.

AB  - A 10-year-old male German shepherd dog was referred for evaluation of a cranial cervical mass causing progressively worsening respiratory distress. A fine-needle aspirate of the mass was obtained and the cytology results were compatible with a carcinoma. The dog underwent chemotherapy without clinical improvement and was ultimately euthanased because of clinical deterioration. At post-mortem examination, an irregular multi-lobated mass in the cranial cervical region was observed causing ventro-lateral tracheal deviation. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed a mixed population of CD3 lymphocytes and macrophages in an exuberant fibrous stroma, associated with dispersed cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells with marked eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some of the epithelial cells were arranged in concentric clusters that were interpreted as Hassall's corpuscles. Histopathological examination of the thyroid gland revealed several neoplastic emboli composed of epithelial cells similar to those observed in the cervical mass. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an ectopic cervical thymic carcinoma in a dog.

AB  - Abstract Twenty Holocaust survivors gave extensive interviews about their experiences in the Holocaust and their lives since. This study affords a rare opportunity to explore language use and trauma using a within-subjects design. Consistent with past research which has shown that cognitive word use typically increases when describing stressful experiences, participants used a higher percentage of cognitive words when describing their Holocaust experiences, in comparison to describing non-Holocaust experiences. Four years after the interviews, participants completed memory questionnaires in relation to their Holocaust experiences and measures of physical health and cognitive functioning. The extent to which participants used an elevated use of insight words when describing their Holocaust experiences 4 years earlier was related to lower ratings of visceral emotional reactions, less avoidance and better lifetime physical health. The results are discussed in terms of how use of cognitive words when describing traumatic memories reflects adaptive psychological and coping processes. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Ultrasonography of a cat with diarrhoea and vomiting revealed a multi-layered, discrete linear structure within the large intestine with retention of the intestinal layers which could potentially be confused with an intestinal intussusception. The structure was ultimately expelled from the large intestine during defecation, and confirmed as a fibrinonecrotic cast. The origin of the fibrinonecrotic cast was assumed to be an intestinal pseudo-membrane formed in enteritis caused by immune suppression due to the panleukopenia virus. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasonographic description of a fibrinonecrotic cast and spontaneous passage of the colonic cast in the veterinary field.

AB  - Summary Denture stomatitis has been reported in 11?67% of complete denture wearers. It is more common on the palatal mucosa and in female patients. In Newton's type I denture stomatitis, where the inflammation remains focal, trauma seems to be responsible. In Newton's types II and III denture stomatitis, where the denture-bearing mucosa is diffusely involved, most workers assert that the aetiology is multi-factorial. Evidence is presented incriminating Candida albicans colonization of the fitting surface of the prosthesis in many cases of denture stomatitis promoted by continuous denture wearing. Allergic and primary irritant reactions to the denture base material, systemic predisposing factors including dietary deficiency and haematological disorders, also play a part. In most cases of denture stomatitis, elimination of denture faults, control of denture plaque and discontinuous denture wearing are sufficient treatment. The routine use of antiseptic or antimycotic drugs seems unnecessary.

AB  - Abstract The functional significance of changes in nuclear structure and organization in transformed cells remains one of the most enigmatic questions in cancer biology. In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.

AB  - The acute Page kidney phenomenon occurs as a consequence of external compression of the renal parenchyma leading to renal ischemia and hypertension. Between January 2000 and September 2007, 550 kidney transplants and 518 ultrasound-guided kidney biopsies were performed. During that time, four recipients developed acute oligo-anuria following ultrasound-guided allograft biopsy. Emergent doppler-ultrasounds were performed demonstrating absence of diastolic flow as well as a sub-capsular hematoma of the kidney. Prompt surgical exploration with allograft capsulotomy was performed in all cases. Immediately after capsulotomy, intraoperative Doppler study demonstrated robust return of diastolic flow. Three patients maintained good graft function, and one kidney was lost due to acute antibody-mediated rejection. We conclude that postbiopsy anuria associated with a subcapsular hematoma and acute absence of diastolic flow on doppler ultrasound should be considered pathognomonic of APK. All renal transplant specialists should be able to recognize this complication, because immediate surgical decompression can salvage the allograft.
