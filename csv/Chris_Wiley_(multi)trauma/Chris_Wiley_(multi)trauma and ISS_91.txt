AB  - Summary Monitoring the effectiveness of treatment is an essential part of the overall management of horses affected by a wide variety of abdominal conditions. Careful monitoring of gastrointestinal function is important so that the response to therapy can be assessed, and any derangements or deteriorations of gastrointestinal function can be identified and supportive therapy instituted rapidly. However, the critically ill patient may develop abnormalities and dysfunction of many organ systems in addition to the system affected by the primary disease. The result can be multi-organ dysfunction, and ultimately multi-organ failure, which is invariably fatal. It is important, therefore, that monitoring allows assessment of the function of all of the major organ systems, and not just gastrointestinal function. This monitoring includes repeated physical examinations and pain assessment, monitoring of temperature and pulse and respiratory rates, and collection of clinical pathological data. Accurate medical records are essential to monitor trends in an animal's response to treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-?B ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide. These findings suggest a new role for sclerostin in the regulation of perilacunar mineral by osteocytes. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary Myxedema coma is a decompensated state of hypothyroidism resulting from severe and prolonged depletion of thyroid hormones, leading to altered mental status and other clinical features related to widespread multi-organ dysfunction. While this is a rare condition on the spectrum of thyroid disorders, myxedema coma is considered an endocrine emergency due to the danger of increased mortality with recent rates of 20?25% reported. Therefore, it is important to promptly recognize and treat myxedema coma in an attempt to improve outcomes.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina brought to the surface serious questions about the capacity of the public health system to respond to community-wide disaster. The storm and its aftermath severed developmentally protective family and community ties; thus its consequences are expected to be particularly acute for vulnerable adolescents. Research confirms that teens are at risk for a range of negative outcomes under conditions of life stress and family disorganization. Specifically, the multiple interacting risk factors for substance abuse in adolescence may be compounded when families and communities have experienced a major trauma. Further, existing service structures and treatments for working with young disaster victims may not address their risk for co-occurring substance abuse and traumatic stress reactions because they tend to be individually or peer group focused, and fail to consider the multi-systemic aspects of disaster recovery. This article proposes an innovative family-based intervention for young disaster victims, based on an empirically supported model for adolescent substance abuse, Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT; Liddle, 2002). Outcomes and mechanisms of the model?s effects are being investigated in a randomized clinical trial with clinically referred substance-abusing teens in a New Orleans area community impacted by Hurricane Katrina.

AB  - Abstract This is the continuation of an article that presents a generic four-quadrant ground map for working with conflict. Four key tasks of conflict transformation and proactive peacebuilding are explored: Q1.?Personal resources Q2.?Interpersonal and intercultural issues Q3.?Bio-psycho-social determinants Q4.?Organizational and systemic dimensions Quadrant 1, which maps personal resources, and Quadrant 2, which deals with the interpersonal and intercultural dimensions of conflict, were covered in the previous issue of this journal. In this issue I present the remaining two quadrants of the ground map: Quadrant 3, which addresses bio-psycho-social determinants of conflict, and Quadrant 4, which covers the systemic and organizational dimensions of conflict. This concludes the first conceptual part of this four-quadrant framework for understanding and working with conflict. In Part Two of this framework this conceptual ground map is applied to generate four practical steps towards transforming conflict on the road to peace: Step 1.?Diagnosis: what is going on here ? both good and bad? Step 2.?Prognosis: what are the options for change? Step 3.?'Treatment': what are the real-time possibilities for change? Step 4.?Maintenance: what will be needed to maintain these gains (stability under stress)? Part Three of this four-quadrant framework sets out common topics in a curriculum for peace work that addresses the theory and practice of conflict transformation by peaceful means. This includes: 1. Understanding root causes of conflict and other conflict contributing factors. 2. Theoretical approaches to understanding violence: structural, cultural and direct violence. 3. Mapping conflict positions, interests, needs, attitudes and behaviours of the actors, stakeholders and ?conflict entrepreneurs? involved in the conflict. 4. ?Multi-track diplomacy?, conflict settlement, management, and sustainable reintegration of conflict actors, (re)construction of infrastructure and sustainable development through institution building and wealth creation. I conclude by outlining four essential qualities for peace builders: The capacity to: 1 witness pain, distress and suffering. 2 hear complaints made by either party, connect emotionally with their pain and offer listening and understanding in a compassionate and intelligent way. 3 target those peacebuilding interventions that have the greatest leverage. 4 implement coherent partnership working across all four conflict quadrants. In the Appendix I introduce the recent international initiative for creating ministries or departments for peace in government. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - There is a lack of knowledge about psychosocial resources that may sustain post-resettlement psychological adjustment among unaccompanied minor asylum-seekers. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of social support from family abroad and friends on acculturation, discrimination, and mental health among these vulnerable children and youth. Questionnaire data were collected from a population-based multi-ethnic sample involving 895 unaccompanied minors resettled in municipalities in all regions of the country. They met in groups in their local communities. The informants were on average 18.6 years, and had an average length of stay in Norway of 3.5 years. The findings showed that the participants suffered from high levels of ongoing war related intrusive symptoms and depression. Still, at the same time they engaged in adaptation processes that are normative to youth with immigrant backgrounds, in terms of constructing supportive networks and developing culture competence. In accordance with the main effect hypothesis, social support had direct effects on depression and indirect effects by increasing culture competence that may aid the young refugees in dealing with discrimination. However, there were no effects of social support on symptoms of PTSD. The findings give direction to areas of interventions, beyond dealing with the sequel of the traumas the unaccompanied minors have been exposed to, not only for clinicians, but also social workers and school personnel.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To evaluate the effect of an educational intervention and documentary pro forma on the adequacy of documentation of intubation in an adult ED. Methods:? A structured medical record review was performed before and after a multi-pronged educational programme and introduction of a specifically designed guide to documentation. Records were assessed for adequacy of documentation by the presence or absence of predetermined elements. Analysis focused on five aspects considered to be most important for future clinical care: drugs and doses used, grade of view, size of endotracheal tube, confirmation of placement and adverse events/difficulties encountered. Results:? Sixty-one and sixty-eight charts were included in the pre-intervention and post-intervention groups, respectively. The drugs and doses used were documented in 92% and 93%. The endotracheal tube size was recorded 82% and 91% of the time. Grade of laryngoscopy was documented in 35% and 46%. Confirmation of endotracheal tube placement was 69% and 84%. Presence or absence of adverse events was recorded in 37% and 54%. All five elements were present in 8.2% and 25% of medical records. Conclusion:? Documentation improved slightly following the intervention, but was still unsatisfactory. We believe that to achieve an adequate level of documentation in the medical record for an episode of intubation, there needs to be a formal and structured mechanism, either via mandatory use of a specifically designed form and/or by participation in an organized data registry.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the subjective experience of hearing voices and the theories of explanation available to account for out-of-the-ordinary experiences (OOEs). The causes and meaning of the kinds of OOEs associated with diagnostic terms such as 'psychosis' and 'dissociation' are open to dispute and disagreement. Shamanism can be defined as a family of traditions across the world whose practitioners focus on entering altered states of consciousness in a voluntary manner, often through inductive techniques. In these states, they have experiences of interacting with spirits, beings, and ancestors or travelling to other realms in order to heal and serve their communities. Altered states of consciousness (ASCs) can be understood as different mental states triggered or entered into through special induction techniques. Many cultures use various techniques as voluntary dissociative tools in order to induce specific ASCs.

This paper defines the conceptual model of mobilization used in the project. In evaluating the project, we were guided by the conceptual model and we used structured materials from interviews with local staff in all three experimental communities; we found that the overall goal of mobilization (implementation of policies) was achieved. Additional observations based on naturalistic case studies of the communities include: (1) the importance of an established research base, (2) the varying role and problematic nature of coalitions, (3) the strategic advantage of early project support among the general population, (4) the role played by key leaders in mobilization, (5) the advantages of a multi-component design, and (6) the key role played by media advocacy.

AB  - Background In the past 15 years, there have been a substantial number of rigorous studies examining the effectiveness of various treatments for child trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although a number of review articles exist, many have focused on randomized controlled trials or specific treatment methodologies, both of which limit the ability to draw conclusions across studies and the statistical power to test the effect of particular treatment characteristics on treatment outcomes. The current study is a review and meta-analysis of 74 studies examining treatments for children exposed to violence. Methods After reviewing the literature, we examined the relationship of a variety of treatment characteristics (e.g., group or individual treatments) and sample characteristics (e.g., average age) on treatment effect sizes. Results Results indicated that individual therapies and those with exposure paradigms within a cognitive-behavioral therapy or skills-building framework show the most promise, but treatment is somewhat less effective for those with more severe symptomology and for younger children. Conclusions Future treatments should consider the developmental and social contexts that may impede treatment progress for young children and consider how best to develop the effectiveness of group interventions that can be readily delivered in settings of mass trauma.

AB  - Objective: To describe the radiographic appearance of pulmonary oedema in cats with cardiac failure. Methods: Thoracic radiographs of 23 cats presented to a first opinion practice with signs of cardiac failure were reviewed. All cats had tachypnoea and/or dyspnoea and enlarged left atrium on echocardiography. Results: Pulmonary oedema was characterised radiographically by an increased opacity associated with a range of patterns and variable distribution. All cats had evidence of a reticular or granular interstitial pattern. This occurred in combination with alveolar pattern in 19 (83 per cent) cats, including six with air bronchograms, with increased diameter of pulmonary vessels in 16 (71 per cent) cats and with bronchial pattern in 14 (61 per cent) cats. The distribution of pulmonary oedema was considered to be diffuse/non-uniform in 14 (61 per cent) cats, diffuse/uniform in four (17 per cent) cats, multi-focal in four (17 per cent) cats and focal in the remaining one (4 per cent). Nine (39 per cent) cats were considered to have a regional distribution of oedema, including five (22 per cent) with a ventral distribution, three (13 per cent) with a caudal distribution and one (4 per cent) cat with a hilar distribution. The distribution of pulmonary opacities was bilaterally symmetrical in five (22 per cent) cats. Clinical Significance: The variable appearance of feline pulmonary oedema is likely to complicate its radiographic diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the ethical issues that arise when healthcare providers act as gatekeepers to research involving vulnerable populations. Traumatised refugees serve as an example of this subset of research participants. Highlighting the particular vulnerabilities of this group, we argue that specific ethical considerations are required that go beyond the conventional research approaches. While gatekeeping responds to some of those vulnerabilities, it risks wronging through unwarranted paternalism. Instead, we will propose that a relational ethics of justice and care serves as a more appropriate framework for responding to the challenges of research involving traumatised refugees. Specifically, such a framework allows us to reflect more deeply on the role of the gatekeeper. In conclusion, we recommend that clinicians and researchers collaborate with survivors? advisory groups in the development of specific research ethical guidelines.

AB  - Multi-motivational theories of human relatedness state that different motivational systems with an evolutionary basis modulate interpersonal relationships. The reliable assessment of their dynamics may usefully inform the understanding of the therapeutic relationship. The coding system of the Assessing Interpersonal Motivation in Transcripts (AIMIT) allows to identify in the clinical the activity of five main interpersonal motivational systems (IMSs): attachment (care-seeking), caregiving, ranking, sexuality and peer cooperation. To assess whether the criteria currently used to score the AIMIT are consistently correlated with the conceptual formulation of the interpersonal multi-motivational theory, two different studies were designed. Study 1: Content validity as assessed by highly qualified independent raters. Study 2: Content validity as assessed by unqualified raters. Results of study 1 show that out of the total 60 AIMIT verbal criteria, 52 (86.7%) met the required minimum degree of correspondence. The average semantic correspondence scores between these items and the related IMSs were quite good (overall mean: 3.74, standard deviation: 0.61). In study 2, a group of 20 naïve raters had to identify each prevalent motivation (IMS) in a random sequence of 1000 utterances drawn from therapy sessions. Cohen's Kappa coefficient was calculated for each rater with reference to each IMS and then calculated the average Kappa for all raters for each IMS. All average Kappa values were satisfactory (>0.60) and ranged between 0.63 (ranking system) and 0.83 (sexuality system). Data confirmed the overall soundness of AIMIT's theoretical?applicative approach. Results are discussed, corroborating the hypothesis that the AIMIT possesses the required criteria for content validity. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background and Objective Low-level light therapy (LLLT) has been revealed as a potential means to improve wound healing. So far, most studies are being performed with irradiation in the red to near-infrared spectra. Recently, we showed that blue light (470?nm) can significantly influence biological systems such as nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and is able to release NO from nitrosyl-hemoglobin or mitochondrial protein complexes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic value of blue or red light emitting diodes (LEDs) on wound healing in an ischemia disturbed rodent flap model. Study Design/Materials and Methods An abdominal flap was rendered ischemic by ligation of one epigastric bundle and subjected to LED illumination with a wavelength of 470?nm (blue, n?=?8) or 629?nm (red, n?=?8) each at 50?mW/cm2 and compared to a non-treated control group (n?=?8). Illumination was performed for 10?minutes on five consecutive days. Results LED therapy with both wavelengths significantly increased angiogenesis in the sub-epidermal layer and intramuscularly (panniculus carnosus muscle) which was associated with significantly improved tissue perfusion 7 days after the ischemic insult. Accordingly, tissue necrosis was significantly reduced and shrinkage significantly less pronounced in the LED-treated groups of both wavelengths. Conclusions LED treatment of ischemia challenged tissue improved early wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis irrespective of the wavelength thus delineating this noninvasive means as a potential, cost effective tool in complicated wounds.

AB  - summary? This study investigated the shear bond strengths of sectioned human mandibular incisor edge fragments reattached using luting cements, bonding agents or restored with composite resins. Seventy teeth were randomly distributed among six experimental groups and a control group. Leaving half of the anatomic crowns exposed, the teeth were embedded in self-cure acrylic resins with the exposed part then sectioned. The fragments in groups 1?4 were bonded to their respective teeth using Clearfil Liner Bond 2V, Scotch Bond Multi Purpose Plus, Panavia-F and 3M Opal Luting cement. The 5th and 6th groups were restored with composite resins (Silux 3M and Clearfil AP-X) using their bonding agents (Single Bond and Clearfil SE Bond). The results indicated that reattachment of fractured incisal fragments by using new generation bonding agents was effective against shear stresses, comparable with the intact teeth. Instead of restoration with composite resins therefore reattachment of a fractured fragment might be more preferable in cases of dental trauma.

AB  - A general factor (gp) at the apex of personality has been suggested to account for the correlations between the Big Five. Although the gp has received ample support from monomethod studies, results from studies incorporating different methods have remained rather ambiguous; some have identified a gp across different informants, whereas others have not. It was hypothesized that these divergent findings are a result of varying lengths of acquaintance between raters. To this end, the current study presents a multitrait multi-informant meta-analysis (total N?=?11?941) that found weak support for a gp as a substantive trait of personality. Evidence for a gp was susceptible to the length of acquaintance between informants. Although a gp could be identified for short-term acquaintances, it remained elusive at long-term acquaintance. Thus, the gp in other ratings more likely reflects normative ratings of an average individual rather than ratings of the specific target person.

Abstract Aim.? This study explores the experience of hope for patients and staff in the context of a British stroke unit. Background.? Hope is identified as a useful concept for exploring how people find meaning in recovery from illness. Uncovering the experience of hope in acute stroke care has provided evidence that can be used to facilitate rehabilitation. Methods.? The methodology drew on the principles of ethnography, undertaking unstructured qualitative interviews with ten patients, ten multidisciplinary staff and 21?hours of participant observation including informal discussions with staff and patients. Data collection took place between November 2007 and November 2008. Findings.? Four themes were identified: suffering, struggling with no hope and despair, hope for recovery and realistic hopefulness. Hope was experienced in the context of suffering a stroke demonstrated as loss of function, loss of mental capacity and dependency. Patients struggled to maintain a sense of hopefulness while feeling close to a slippery slope towards despair and death. Hope was expressed as a strong desire to recover, get back to normal and a time to reflect on their lives so far. Staff identified realistic hopefulness as focused on keeping things real while balancing giving hope and avoiding false hope. Conclusion.? Hope is placed within the emotional challenges of suffering and struggle inherent in recovery from stroke. The staff work with patients? hopes but offer realistic hopefulness as a practical strategy for recovery. Further interventions are required for working with feelings of despair or no hope.
