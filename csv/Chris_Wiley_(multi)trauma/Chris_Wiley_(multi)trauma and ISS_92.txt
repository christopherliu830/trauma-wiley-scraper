AB  - Though first introduced more than 130 years ago, the concept of stress diabetes or stress hyperglycemia has gained tremendous attention in recent years in view of the landmark article by van den Berghe and colleagues in 2001. As opposed to earlier work that suggested that hyperglycemia in the acute clinical setting may be beneficial, it now appears that lower glucose levels are associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms behind the improved outcomes are numerous and seem to be tied to the inflammatory process. Both lower glucose values and insulin therapy seem to be anti-inflammatory, whereas hyperglycemia increases the proinflammatory process and negatively affects the innate immune system. Despite the numerous approaches to achieve normoglycemia described in the literature, only modest success has been achieved. Understanding the pathophysiology driving stress hyperglycemia?the stress response and modulation of the inflammatory process?seems to be the key to improving the care of the most critically ill and injured patients.

AB  - A general factor (gp) at the apex of personality has been suggested to account for the correlations between the Big Five. Although the gp has received ample support from monomethod studies, results from studies incorporating different methods have remained rather ambiguous; some have identified a gp across different informants, whereas others have not. It was hypothesized that these divergent findings are a result of varying lengths of acquaintance between raters. To this end, the current study presents a multitrait multi-informant meta-analysis (total N?=?11?941) that found weak support for a gp as a substantive trait of personality. Evidence for a gp was susceptible to the length of acquaintance between informants. Although a gp could be identified for short-term acquaintances, it remained elusive at long-term acquaintance. Thus, the gp in other ratings more likely reflects normative ratings of an average individual rather than ratings of the specific target person.

AB  - Abstract The Titicaca Basin of Peru and Bolivia has been occupied by humans for millennia and was home to one of the first major state societies in the Andes. Many foundations of state power, however, developed much earlier, during the Late Preceramic/Terminal Archaic Period (3000 ? 1500 BC), when people initially began herding, marking territories, and creating new metallurgy technology. We present a skeletal analysis of 14 individuals dating between 3000 and 1500 BC from Muruqullu, an archaeological site on the Copacabana Peninsula of Bolivia. These are the first Preceramic burials documented for the peninsula and contribute to the relatively small sample of Preceramic bodies from the Andean highlands more broadly. From this sample, we suggest that highland foragers and early herders suffered little nutritional stress and had limited violent interactions, perhaps related to a relatively mobile lifestyle and utilisation of lake resources.

AB  - Abstract L1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules that is associated with axonal growth, including formation of the corticospinal tract (CST). The present study describes the effects of L1 deletion on hindlimb function in locomotion, and examines the role of L1 in recovery and remodeling after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Uninjured adult L1 knockout (Y/?) mice had impaired performance on locomotor tests compared with their wild-type littermates (Y/+). Anterograde tracing demonstrated that CST axons project to thoracic, but not lumbar, levels of the spinal cord of Y/? mice, and revealed a diversion of these fibers from their position in the base of the dorsal columns. Retrograde tracing also revealed reduced numbers of descending projections from paraventricular hypothalamus and red nuclei to the lumbar spinal cord in Y/? mice. SCI at the mid-thoracic level produced a lesion encompassing the center of the spinal cord, including the site of the dorsal CST and surrounding gray matter (GM). The injury caused lasting deficits in fine aspects of locomotion. There was no effect of genotype on final lesion size or the growth of axons into the lesion area. However, injured Y/? mice demonstrated a robust expansion of CST projections throughout the GM of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord rostral to the lesion compared with Y/+ littermates. Thus, L1 is important for the development of multiple spinal projections and also contributes to the restriction of CST sprouting rostral to the site of a SCI in adults.

AB  - Summary Blood transfusion occurs in all parts of the world, but the availability, quality, and safety of the blood depends on the general status of medical care in that area. In contrast, the United States blood supply is provided by many different organizations with different organizational structures and philosophies. Certain areas of the United States are chronically unable to collect enough blood to meet their local transfusion needs. This occurs mostly in metropolitan areas that serve large trauma, tertiary, and transplantation centers. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is a professional, nonprofit, scientific, and administrative association for individuals and institutions engaged in the many facets of blood transfusion and cellular therapies. America's Blood Centers (ABC) is an association of independent not-for-profit community blood centers established in 1962. The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) is a trade association that advocates for the world's source plasma collectors and producers of plasma-based therapeutics.

AB  - Abstract This manuscript constitutes a review of several innovative biomedical technologies fabricated using the precision and accuracy of silicon micro- and nanofabrication. The technologies to be reviewed are subcutaneous nanochannel drug delivery implants for the continuous tunable zero-order release of therapeutics, multi-stage logic embedded vectors for the targeted systemic distribution of both therapeutic and imaging contrast agents, silicon and porous silicon nanowires for investigating cellular interactions and processes as well as for molecular and drug delivery applications, porous silicon (pSi) as inclusions into biocomposites for tissue engineering, especially as it applies to bone repair and regrowth, and porous silica chips for proteomic profiling. In the case of the biocomposites, the specifically designed pSi inclusions not only add to the structural robustness, but can also promote tissue and bone regrowth, fight infection, and reduce pain by releasing stimulating factors and other therapeutic agents stored within their porous network. The common material thread throughout all of these constructs, silicon and its associated dielectrics (silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc.), can be precisely and accurately machined using the same scalable micro- and nanofabrication protocols that are ubiquitous within the semiconductor industry. These techniques lend themselves to the high throughput production of exquisitely defined and monodispersed nanoscale features that should eliminate architectural randomness as a source of experimental variation thereby potentially leading to more rapid clinical translation.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The residency review committee for emergency medicine (EM) requires residents to have greater than 70% attendance of educational conferences during residency training, but it is unknown whether attendance improves clinical competence or scores on the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) in-training examination (ITE). This study examined the relationship between conference attendance and ITE scores. The hypothesis was that greater attendance would correlate to a higher examination score. Methods:? This was a multi-center retrospective cohort study using conference attendance data and examination results from residents in four large county EM residency training programs. Longitudinal multi-level models, adjusting for training site, U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 score, and sex were used to explore the relationship between conference attendance and in-training examination scores according to year of training. Each year of training was studied, as well as the overall effect of mean attendance as it related to examination score. Results:? Four training sites reported data on 405 residents during 2002 to 2008; 386 residents had sufficient data to analyze. In the multi-level longitudinal models, attendance at conference was not a significant predictor of in-training percentile score (coefficient = 0.005, 95% confidence interval [CI] = ?0.053 to 0.063, p?=?0.87). Score on the USMLE Step 1 examination was a strong predictor of ITE score (coefficient = 0.186, 95% CI = 0.155 to 0.217; p?<?0.001), as was female sex (coefficient = 2.117, 95% CI = 0.987 to 3.25; p?<?0.001). Conclusions:? Greater conference attendance does not correlate with performance on an individual?s ITE scores. Conference attendance may represent an important part of EM residency training but perhaps not of ITE performance.

AB  - Chile entered a period of political turmoil when Dr Salvador Allende, a socialist, won the 1970 presidential election. After he was overthrown, Chile was governed by a military dictatorship that engaged in massive human rights violations. Some 30 years later, this article summarizes the psychological consequences of the traumas that victims experienced and the emotions triggered in these individuals and their families, as well as the very real difficulties they faced. This report focuses on the loss and grief that many families experienced after a family member was imprisoned and tortured or assassinated, or both. Systemic therapeutic implications of the difficulties these families faced are proposed.

AB  - Abstract Detection and accurate classification of traumatic tarsal fractures are important for identifying cases requiring surgical intervention. The aim of this prospective, experimental, methods comparison study was to directly compare the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of tarsal computed tomography (CT), ten-view and two-view digital radiographs for detecting traumatic fractures of the canine tarsus. The working hypothesis was that tarsal fractures would be detected with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using CT imaging compared to radiography, and a ten-view would be superior to a two-view radiographic study. Ten cadaver hind limbs of medium to large dogs received a CT scan and ten-view radiographic study before and after induction of fractures with a hydraulic press. All bones included in the radiographic images were assessed for fractures by two observers and gross dissection was used as the gold standard. The two-view radiographic study (dorsoplantar, lateromedial) was created from the ten-view study and reviewed 2 years later. All limbs sustained fractures, the most common locations were the talus and calcaneus (n = 7). The sensitivity of CT was greater than ten-view radiographic study (77% vs. 57%), while the specificity was similar (97% vs. 98%). The sensitivity and specificity of the ten-view and two-view radiograph studies were similar (57% vs. 55%; both 98%). Computed tomography images were reassessed postdissection to determine if failure to identify fractures resulted from observer error. Overall, CT was better than radiography for detecting fractures of the canine tarsus, however there was little improvement with ten-view compared to two-view radiographic studies.

AB  - Summary Over the past 12?years, the United Kingdom Defence Medical Services have evolved an integrated ?damage control resuscitation ? damage control surgery? sequence for the management of patients sustaining complex injuries. During 2009, over 3200?units of blood products were administered as massive transfusions to severely injured UK personnel. An important part of the approach to traumatic bleeding is the early, empirical use of predefined ratios of blood and clotting products. As soon as control of bleeding is achieved, current practice is to switch towards a tailored transfusion, based on clinical and laboratory assessments, including point-of-care coagulation testing. A key goal is to provide resuscitation seamlessly throughout surgery, so that patients leave the operating room with their normal physiology restored. This article outlines the current management of haemorrhage and coagulation employed in Afghanistan from the point of wounding to transfer back to the National Health Service.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare cardiac risk stratification using a 0 and 2?h point-of-care (POC) cardiac troponin (cTn), 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers against the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn reference standard. Methods A prospective observational study of ED patients presenting with chest pain was performed. Patients were risk stratified and treated as per the Heart Foundation of Australia/Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (HF-A/CS-ANZ) guidelines using the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn (T6). Patients were further stratified using a 0 and 2?h POC cTn (T2) plus 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers (cTn, creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin) (M2). The T6, T2 and M2 strategies were compared using the 30-day major adverse cardiac events as the primary outcome. Results Seven hundred and four patients (median age 54 years, male 62.1%) were enrolled. Using the T6 reference standard, 2%, 61% and 37% were stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The 30-day event rates were 0%, 3.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The T2 strategy stratified 1.5%, 57% and 41% as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 4.2% and 24.8%, respectively. The M2 strategy resulted in significantly different risk distribution with 1%, 40% and 59% stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 3.9% and 18.8%, respectively. Conclusion Using a 2?h POC cTn-only biomarker strategy with the HF-A/CS-ANZ guidelines accurately identified a population at intermediate risk of 30-day events in whom further objective testing might be accelerated, allowing subsequent early discharge of the majority of this cohort. Within 2?h of presentation a high risk population could be identified in whom early management, including admission, was required.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective was to track and compare the progression of neuroplastic changes in a large animal model and humans with spinal cord injury. Methods A total of 37 individuals with acute traumatic spinal cord injury were followed over time (1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury) with repeated neurophysiological assessments. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were recorded in the upper extremities above the level of injury. In a reverse-translational approach, similar neurophysiological techniques were examined in a porcine model of thoracic spinal cord injury. Twelve Yucatan mini-pigs underwent a contusive spinal cord injury at T10 and tracked with somatosensory and motor evoked potentials assessments in the fore- and hind limbs pre- (baseline, post-laminectomy) and post-injury (10 min, 3 h, 12 weeks). Results In both humans and pigs, the sensory responses in the cranial coordinates of upper extremities/forelimbs progressively increased from immediately post-injury to later time points. Motor responses in the forelimbs increased immediately after experimental injury in pigs, remaining elevated at 12 weeks. In humans, motor evoked potentials were significantly higher at 1-month (and remained so at 1 year) compared to normative values. Conclusions Despite notable differences between experimental models and the human condition, the brain's response to spinal cord injury is remarkably similar between humans and pigs. Our findings further underscore the utility of this large animal model in translational spinal cord injury research.

AB  - An eight-year-old mixed-breed dog was presented with progressive paraparesis. Neurological examination revealed a painful diffuse lesion between spinal cord segments T3 and L3. Magnetic resonance images displayed multi-focal contrast enhancing spinal cord and meningeal lesions. Cytology of these lesions revealed a malignant tumour prompting euthanasia of the dog. Histopathology confirmed the cytological diagnosis and a final diagnosis of a glioblastoma multiforme was made based on immunohistochemistry.

AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

Safety and efficacy of two manual toothbrushes. Abstract:? Objective:? The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of a newly designed multi-level manual toothbrush (Profit-Haije-Brush) compared with a control flat-trimmed manual reference toothbrush from the American Dental Association (ADA). Material and methods:? For this study, 36 healthy subjects without previous experience in the use of the Profit-Haije-Brush (PHB) were selected. Subjects were given a period of 2?weeks to become familiar with both types of brushes and were instructed to use them on alternate days for 2?min twice daily. Prior to their visit, subjects refrained from all oral hygiene procedures for 48?h. Prebrushing plaque and gingival abrasion scores were assessed. Subsequently, two randomly chosen contra-lateral quadrants were brushed with one of both brushes and the other two quadrants with the alternate brush. Subjects were supervised during their 2-min brushing exercise. After brushing, plaque and gingival abrasion were re-assessed. A questionnaire was filled out to investigate the subjects? attitudes towards both brushes. Results:? The overall mean prebrushing PI was 2.47 for the PHB and 2.44 for the ADA. The reduction in PI was 1.32 and 1.23 respectively (P?<?0.05). With regard to gingival abrasion the overall mean prebrushing scores were 4.57 (PHB) and 5.34 (ADA). Post-brushing scores were 13.49 and 13.77 for the PHB and ADA respectively. Conclusion:? Statistically, the multi-level PHB was significantly more efficacious than the flat-trimmed ADA. However, the difference is clinically considered small and the amount of remaining plaque was not significantly different between brushes. No greater potential to cause gingival abrasion to the oral tissues was observed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.

AB  - The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the risk of acute injuries among youth male and female footballers playing on third-generation artificial turf compared with grass. Over 60?000 players 13?19 years of age were followed in four consecutive Norway Cup tournaments from 2005 to 2008. Injuries were recorded prospectively by the team coaches throughout each tournament. The overall incidence of injuries was 39.2 (SD: 0.8) per 1000 match hours; 34.2 (SD: 2.4) on artificial turf and 39.7 (SD: 0.8) on grass. After adjusting for the potential confounders age and gender, there was no difference in the overall risk of injury [odds ratio (OR): 0.93 (0.77?1.12), P=0.44] or in the risk of time loss injury [OR: 1.05 (0.68?1.61), P=0.82] between artificial turf and grass. However, there was a lower risk of ankle injuries [OR: 0.59 (0.40?0.88), P=0.008], and a higher risk of back and spine [OR: 1.92 (1.10?3.36), P=0.021] and shoulder and collarbone injuries [OR: 2.32 (1.01?5.31), P=0.049], on artificial turf compared with on grass. In conclusion, there was no difference in the overall risk of acute injury in youth footballers playing on third-generation artificial turf compared with grass.
