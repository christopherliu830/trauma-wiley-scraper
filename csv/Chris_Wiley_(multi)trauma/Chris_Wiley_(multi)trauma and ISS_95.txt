AB  - Abstract Recently there has been an increase in interest in the relationship between stress and memory. Brain regions which are involved in memory function also effect the stress response. Traumatic stress results in changes in these brain regions; alterations in these brain regions in turn may mediate symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Neural mechanisms which are relevant to the effects of stress on memory, such as fear conditioning, stress sensitization, and extinction, are reviewed in relation to their implications for PTSD. Special topics including neural mechanisms in dissociation, neurobiological approaches to the validity of childhood memories as they apply to controversies over the ?False Memory Syndrome,? and implications of the effects of stress on memory for psychotherapy, are also reviewed. The findings discussed in this paper are consistent with the formulation that stress-induced alterations in brain regions and systems involved in memory may underlie many of the symptoms of PTSD, as well as dissociative amnesia, seen in survivors of traumatic stress.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes after radical mandibulectomy in cats. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Eight cats were included. Methods Medical records were searched for cats with confirmed oral neoplasia treated with radical mandibulectomy. Data collected included demographics, surgical procedure, histopathological diagnosis, postoperative management, and outcomes. Results Ages ranged from 8 to 17?years. All cats had 75% to 90% of the mandible removed and feeding tubes placed. Seven cats had squamous cell carcinoma, and one cat had a giant cell tumor. Six cats ate on their own postoperatively. Three cats had local recurrence and tumor-related died at 136 and 291?days. Six cats had no recurrence, with survival times of 156, 465, 608, and 1023?days, and two cats were still alive at 316 and 461 days after surgery. The three long-term survivors died of causes unrelated to oral neoplasia. One cat died at 156?days due to aspiration of food material. The overall estimated mean survival time was 712 days. Conclusion After radical mandibulectomy, independent food intake was achieved in 6 of eight cats, and four cats lived longer than one year. Clinical significance: Radical mandibulectomy should be considered for the treatment of extensive oral neoplasia in cats. Successful long-term outcomes are possible with aggressive supportive care perioperatively.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Children sometimes require minor procedures in the ED for which sedation is needed. Information from Victorian EDs indicated that processes for paediatric procedural sedation were variable, both within and between health services. The aims of this project were to improve safety and reduce variation in practice with respect to paediatric procedural sedation in EDs by rolling out a standardised paediatric sedation programme in Victorian EDs. Methods The project was managed by a clinical network with support of an expert reference group; however, implementation was conducted at the local ED level. The approach was multi-modal and grounded in quality and safety theory. It included revision of evidence-based training materials, information sheets and risk assessment/procedure documentation forms, information on a child and family-centred approach, a before-and-after clinical governance assessment, and train-the-trainer activities. The project was evaluated by clinical audit of cases, analysis of before-and-after clinical governance assessments, numbers of staff completing training and credentialing, and qualitative feedback on the programme from ED staff. Results Fourteen EDs completed the project; 10 metropolitan and four regional/rural. Significant shifts in nine key clinical governance items were found, including structured training and credentialing, provision of parent information sheet, and monitoring of adverse events. The clinical audit showed >75% compliance, with seven indicators including recording of weight, fasting time and baseline observations, composition of sedation team, and documentation that discharge criteria were met. Nine hundred and seventy-one staff were trained within the project period. Conclusion This multi-modal implementation strategy has achieved clinical practice improvement across organisational boundaries.

AB  - Abstract This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, coping, and physical health status in students reporting a trauma history (N = 138) using structural equation modeling. Participants completed questionnaires assessing PTSD symptoms, coping specific to health-related and trauma-related stressors and physical health. After accounting for coping with health-specific problems, trauma-specific avoidance coping was uniquely associated with poorer health status. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were associated with poorer physical health status, controlling for age, health behaviors, and other psychopathology. In addition, the effect of PTSD symptoms on poorer health status was mediated by health- and trauma-specific avoidance coping. Results suggest that university health centers should screen for PTSD and consider psychoeducational programs and coping skills interventions for survivors of trauma.

AB  - Background In humanitarian settings, family-level drivers of mental health are insufficiently documented; we examined the strength of caregiver?child associations with two-wave, family-level Afghan data. Methods We recruited a gender-balanced sample of 681 caregiver?child dyads (n = 1,362 respondents) using stratified random-sampling in government schools in Kabul (364 dyads) and refugee schools in Peshawar (317 dyads). One year after baseline, we re-interviewed 64% of Kabul and 31% of Peshawar cohorts (n = 331 dyads, 662 respondents), retaining fewer Peshawar families due to refugee repatriation. In multivariable analyses adjusted for baseline, we assessed the extent to which caregiver mental health (Self-Report Questionnaire, SRQ-20) was associated with child symptom scores of post-traumatic stress (Child Revised Impact of Events Scale, CRIES), depression (Depression Self-Rating Scale, DSRS), psychiatric difficulties, impact, and prosocial strength (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ). Results Caregiver mental health was prospectively associated with all eight measures of child mental health at follow-up, adjusted for baseline. For post-traumatic stress, caregiver mental health had a predictive impact comparable to the child experiencing one or two lifetime trauma events. For depression, caregiver mental health approached the predictive impact of female gender. Thus a one SD change in caregiver SRQ-20 was associated with a 1.04 point change on CRIES and a 0.65 point change in DSRS. For multi-informant SDQ data, caregiver?child associations were strongest for caregiver ratings. For child-rated outcomes, associations were moderated by maternal literacy, a marker of family-level dynamics. Both adults and children identified domestic violence and quality of home life as independent risk and protective factors. Conclusions In the context of violence and displacement, efforts to improve child mental health require a thoughtful consideration of the mental health cascade across generations and the cluster of adversities that impact family wellbeing. We identify culturally meaningful leverage points for building family-level resilience, relevant to the prevention and intervention agenda in global mental health.

AB  - Abstract Aims Exposure to extraordinary traumatic experience is one acknowledged risk factor for drug use. We aim to analyse the influence of potentially life-changing childhood stressors, experienced second-hand, on later drug use disorder in a national population of Swedish adolescent and young adults (aged 15?26 years). Design We performed Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, complemented with co-relative pair comparisons. Setting Sweden. Participants All individuals in the Swedish population born 1984?95, who were registered in Sweden at the end of the calendar year that they turned 14 years of age. Our follow-up time (mean 6.2 years; range 11 years) started at the year they turned 15 and continued to December 2011 (n?=?1?409?218). Measurements Our outcome variable was drug use disorder, identified from medical, legal and pharmacy registry records. Childhood stressors, as per DSM-IV stressor criteria, include death of an immediate family member and second-hand experience of diagnoses of malignant cancer, serious accidental injury and victim of assault. Other covariates include parental divorce, familial psychological wellbeing and familial drug and alcohol use disorders. Findings After adjustment for all considered confounders, individuals exposed to childhood stressors ?parental death? or ?parental assault? had more than twice the risk of drug use disorder than those who were not [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.63 (2.23?3.09) and 2.39 (2.06?2.79), respectively]. Conclusions Children aged under 15 years who experience second-hand an extraordinary traumatic event (such as a parent or sibling being assaulted, diagnosed with cancer or dying) appear to have approximately twice the risk of developing a drug use disorder than those who do not.

AB  - Summary This case report describes a geriatric gelding with a 2 month history of fast-growing masses within the parotid and submandibular regions. The horse was dyspnoeic on presentation and upper airway endoscopy revealed partial airway obstruction at the level of the pharynx, secondary to a space-occupying mass. Cytological evaluation of multiple fine-needle aspirates obtained from the masses were suggestive of salivary gland neoplasia, therefore the horse was subjected to humane euthanasia. A computed tomographical scan was obtained post mortem and revealed a large multi-lobulated mass involving both guttural pouches, resulting in 80% occlusion of the naso- and oropharynx. Histopathology confirmed a parotid salivary gland carcinoma (papillary-cystic type). Salivary gland tumours are extremely rare in horses, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Treatment of these malignancies proves to be challenging, requiring complete parotidectomy or surgical debulkment, in combination with adjunctive therapy.

AB  - Abstract Background Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is recommended for post-traumatic stress disorder and emerging evidence indicates that it is effective for people with intellectual disabilities. However, acceptability from the perspectives of clients with intellectual disabilities, their therapists and other key people has not been formally evaluated. This study investigates process issues in the implementation of EMDR from perspectives of multiple stakeholders. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two adults with intellectual disabilities and three clinical psychologists who had participated in EMDR as well as a key supporter (N = 6) to provide information relating to three cases. The interviews were analysed thematically either directly from the audio recording or from transcripts. Results Five themes were identified: EMDR feels very different; EMDR is a technical process; the need to work with the present; talking is important; cautious optimism. Conclusions Whilst a range of client- and therapist-related factors served as barriers to using EMDR in this small-scale study, such as preferences in working with the present and inexperienced therapists, there was cautious optimism that EMDR may be useful for ?the right person at the right time.?.

AB  - Summary Local and regional anesthetic techniques are gaining widespread acceptance in the management of pain in small and large animals. They penetrate peripheral nerves and induce reversible blockade of impulse conduction in myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels. The local anesthetics block the conduction of nerve impulses by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes. Administration of an incorrect dose and inadvertent intravenous administration of the local anesthetics are probably the most common causes of systemic toxicity. Local anesthetics can also be given systemically to manage perioperative pain and ileus. They are often used in combination with other classes of analgesic drugs as part of a multi-modal pain management strategy. The local anesthetics have the unique ability to produce complete blockade of peripheral nociceptive input, preventing the development of pathological pain as well as the stress response.

AB  - Summary In children's critical care alone there are in excess of 5000 paediatric intensive care unit transfers between hospitals and 16 000 transfers of neonatal patients in the UK every year. The NAPSTaR manual together with its associated course is aimed at a multi-disciplinary audience and has been developed to provide a comprehensive introduction and overview of the process of transferring unwell patients. With regard to the transfer of children there has been a cultural change which has occurred in many centres where non-paediatricians have distanced themselves from paediatric practice, triggered by the centralisation of paediatric services. In adult practice most centres do not have a dedicated transport team and transfer teams are drawn from in-patient staff. Any transfer process may be broken down into three components: organisational and management strategy; practical issues; and training required to appropriately use the equipment needed during the transfer.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent an ideal source of autologous cell-based therapy for chronic wounds. Functional characteristics of MSCs may benefit wound healing by exerting their multi-regenerative potential. However, cell ageing resulting from chronic degenerative diseases or donor age could cause inevitable effects on the regenerative abilities of MSCs. A variety of studies have shown the relationship between MSC ageing and age-related dysfunction, but few associate these age-related impacts on MSCs with their ability of repairing chronic wounds, which are common in the elderly population. Here, we discuss the age-associated changes of MSCs and describe the potential impacts on MSC-based therapy for chronic wounds. Furthermore, critical evaluation of the current literatures is necessary for understanding the underlying mechanisms of MSC ageing and raising the corresponding concerns on considering their possible use for chronic wound repair.

The explanation for this pass rate, which many would judge as unacceptably low, is likely to be multi-factorial. Possible factors that should be considered include trainee selection, training programme structure, the impact of the Director of Emergency Medicine Training, examination preparation, examination validity and examination reliability. Each of these potential factors needs to be addressed in a systematic fashion in the context of inevitable and increasing internal and external scrutiny of the outcomes of our training programme.

AB  - Contrary to prevailing medical belief, dementia is generally not caused by arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels. There may be, in fact, as many as 50 different causes. While the two major types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, are irreversible, perhaps 20 per cent of dementias are secondary to treatable causes, and are reversible. The most important of these is the pseudodementia of depression, which can be easily missed without a high degree of suspicion. Tips on the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, and pseudodementia are discussed, as are other causes of dementia secondary to various diseases or therapy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the everyday life conditions experienced by older migrants and their reasons for specific age- and health-related behaviour during the conduct of everyday life. The study comprised 16 qualitative interviews with migrants aged 56?96 years from Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq and Somalia. The three themes that emerged from the conditions, meanings and reasons analysis illustrated that the older persons were trapped in various ways ?without language, in fragmented families and in an unfamiliar structure. We identified these themes as The importance of the life history, Lost in language barriers and Having a national sense of belonging. The main findings emphasise the vulnerability of older migrants in a resettlement country. With an unclear national identity and without the local language, older migrants struggle to develop a clear vision of their role in a minority community in a foreign country. Besides language skills and the need for interpreters, health professionals need to consider issues such as life history, traumas and national belonging when their usual approaches to managing health-related topics have failed.

AB  - Abstract This paper explores approaches to ?later recovery? or ?slow recovery? in post-disaster contexts, viewing it as a positive force by terming it ?slow healing? contracted to ?shealing?. Slow healing hopes to develop a multi-scalar, processual, open-ended, and future-oriented approach to asynchronous and differentiated processes and practices of individual and collective recovery. ?Shealing?, as used here, then denotes ongoing, individual and collective efforts through remaking and building one's life post-disaster. This process of shealing, of re-making and making lives liveable, is a process of assembling, or trying to assemble, life and livelihoods, without necessarily immediately eradicating all traces of destruction which might be vestiges of a life before the disastrous manifestation of compound vulnerabilities. Shealing provides an alternative to assumptive, linear approaches in order to enfold healing and vulnerability reduction within day-to-day, continual, accepted, non-spectacular actions. From a noun or an attribute, ?shealing? functions as a verb by being a continuous and open-ended process in the present, not just a defined stage, whether a hoped-for endpoint or a recovery of some pre-disaster state. Shealing allows theorising the many ways of living in and through disaster experiences alongside the range of everyday post-disaster approaches to re-making one's life that an individual or community might embrace. Shealing forms a joint scholarly-practical approach that better addresses what needs to be done and accepted after experiencing a disaster. This paper focuses on disasters, but wider implications and connections emerge, such as for grief, trauma, and social work.

AB  - Abstract Osteomyelitis often causes functional impairment due to tissue destruction. This report demonstrates a novel previously unappreciated role of osteoblasts. Samples of osteomyelitic bone and bacterially challenged osteoblasts produce increased amounts of antimicrobial peptides in order to combat bacterial bone infection. An osteomyelitis mouse model confirmed the osseous induction of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, suggesting a central role in the prevention of bacterial bone infection. Antimicrobial peptides are effectors of the innate defence system and play a key role in host protection at cellular surfaces. Some of them are produced constitutively, whereas others are induced during infection. Human ?-defensins represent a major subclass of antimicrobial peptides and act as a first line of defence through their broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity. The aim of the present in-vitro and in-vivo investigations was to study the expression and regulation of human ?-defensin-2 in the case of bacterial bone infection and to analyse the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on bone-derived antimicrobial peptide expression. Samples of healthy human bone, osteomyelitic bone and cultured osteoblasts (hFOB cells) were assessed for the expression of human ?-defensin-2. Regulation of human ?-defensin-2 was studied in hFOB cells after exposure to bacterial supernatants, proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppressive drugs (glucocorticoids and methotrexate) and was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An osteomyelitis mouse model was performed to demonstrate the regulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, named murine ?-defensin-3, by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Healthy human bone and cultured osteoblasts are able to produce human ?-defensin-2 under standard conditions. Samples of infected bone produce higher levels of endogenous antibiotics, such as human ?-defensin-2, when compared with samples of healthy bone. A clear induction of human ?-defensin-2 was observed after exposure of cultured osteoblasts to Gram-positive bacteria or proinflammatory cytokines. Additional treatment with glucocorticoids or methotrexate prevented bacteria-mediated antimicrobial peptide induction in cultured osteoblasts. The osteomyelitis mouse model demonstrated transcriptional upregulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, namely murine ?-defensin-3, in bone after intraosseous contamination of the tibia. Human and murine bone have the ability to produce broad-spectrum endogenous antibiotics when challenged by micro-organisms in vitro and in vivo. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids or methotrexate, may increase the susceptibility to bone infection by decreasing antimicrobial peptide expression levels in case of microbial challenge. The induction of human ?-defensin-2 following bacterial contact suggests a central role of antimicrobial peptides in the prevention of bacterial bone infection.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the bi-planar robot navigation system for insertion of cannulated screws in femoral neck fractures. Method Between January 2016 and December 2016, 60 patients with femoral neck fractures were separately treated using percutaneous cannulated screws assisted by the bi-planar robot navigation system (robot group) and conventional freehand surgery (freehand group). The fluoroscopy time, the number of drilling attempts, and the operation time were recorded during operations; the dispersion and parallelism of the cannulated screws on the posteroanterior and lateral images were measured after operations. Patients were followed up for 12?24?months and the Harris scores and the final results of the two groups were compared. Results During bi-planar robot navigation system-assisted surgery, the fluoroscopy time for acquisition of images was 2.3?seconds on average, and the time for planning screws during the operation was 2.8?min on average. The average fluoroscopy time during the placement of the guide pin was 5.7?seconds and 14.14?seconds (P?=?0.00), respectively. The average time of the placement of the cannulated screws was 12.7?min and 19.4?min (P?=?0.00), respectively, in the robot group and the freehand group. In the robot group, only one guide pin was replaced during the operation, and the average number of adjustments for each guide pin was 2.39 in the freehand group. The screw parallelism and dispersion measured by postoperative imaging in the robot group were significantly superior to those in the freehand group. From postoperative CT it was evident that there were 5 cases of screws exiting the posterior cortex in both groups. During the follow-up phase, 1 case of femoral head necrosis and 5 cases of femoral neck shortening of more than 10 mm occurred in the robotic navigation group; 3 cases of femoral head necrosis, 1 case of fracture nonunion, and 2 cases of shortening of more than 10?mm occurred in the freehand group. At 18?months after surgery, the average Harris scores of the patients were 85.20 and 83.45, respectively, with no significant difference. Conclusion Using bi-planar robot navigation system-assisted placement of femoral neck cannulated screws can significantly reduce the time of intraoperative fluoroscopy, drilling attempts, and operation time. The placed screws are superior to the screws placed freehand in relation to parallelism and dispersion. However, it is still necessary for surgeons to have a good reduction of the femoral neck fracture before surgery and to be proficient in the operation of the robot navigation system. In summary, the bi-planar robot navigation system is an effective assistant instrument for surgery.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this randomised controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of intensive and non-intensive formats of delivery of image interpretation education for radiographers. Methods A multi-centre, stratified (by years of experience) two group parallel arm, single blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants (n = 48) were allocated to one of two groups to receive image interpretation education: (1) intensive format (13.5 h over two consecutive days) (2) non-intensive (sequential 90-min tutorials delivered 1 week apart). Participants undertook x-ray interpretation tests before education, at 1-week post-education completion and at 12-week post-education completion. Results Image interpretation performance was not significantly different between groups at baseline. A generalised linear model indicated that participants who received intensive education format improved image interpretation performance by a greater margin than the group that received non-intensive education at 1-week (P = 0.002) and 12-week (P < 0.001) follow-up assessments. Conclusions Although both formats of education delivery may be beneficial, the findings of this study have indicated that the intensive format of delivery was more effective at improving radiographers? ability to interpret trauma radiographs in the weeks after completion of the image interpretation program.

AB  - Abstract Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the aesthetics of implant-supported single crowns in the anterior maxilla using objective indices and patients' perception. Methods: Fifty participants, former patients (mean age 31.3 years) at the Dental Hospital, University of Bergen, or at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, who had implant-supported single crowns replacing upper anterior teeth lost due to trauma or agenesis during 2006, were included. One year after placement of the crown, an evaluation was carried out using the Pink Aesthetic Score (PES), the Implant Crown Aesthetics Index (ICAI), a modified version of the ICAI (mod-ICAI), and the index of the Californian Dental Association (CDA). The participants rated their satisfaction with the crowns and adjacent soft tissue. Results: The form of the crown was satisfactory for 88% and the colour for 84% of participants, while 72% were satisfied with the adjacent mucosa. A statistically significant bivariate correlation was found between the PES and the ICAI and mod-ICAI. A weaker association was found between the CDA and the ICAI, mod-ICAI and PES. A positive correlation was found between the mod-ICAI index and satisfaction with the form and colour of the crowns and with the sum of ratings of responses to the questions about the form and colour of the crowns and the form and colour of the adjacent mucosa (P<0.05). Although most participants were satisfied, objective evaluation showed that a good aesthetic outcome for single implants was related to the quantity of the peri-implant mucosa. Conclusion: The mod-ICAI index correlated with responses to questions about the form and colour of the mucosa. Other significant correlations were found between the participants' aesthetic perceptions and the ICAI and the mod-ICAI. The mod-ICAI combined best objective and subjective assessment of aesthetics related to implant-supported crowns. To cite this article: ?Vilhjálmsson VH, Klock KS, St?rksen K, Bårdsen A.
