AB  - Abstract Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the aesthetics of implant-supported single crowns in the anterior maxilla using objective indices and patients' perception. Methods: Fifty participants, former patients (mean age 31.3 years) at the Dental Hospital, University of Bergen, or at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, who had implant-supported single crowns replacing upper anterior teeth lost due to trauma or agenesis during 2006, were included. One year after placement of the crown, an evaluation was carried out using the Pink Aesthetic Score (PES), the Implant Crown Aesthetics Index (ICAI), a modified version of the ICAI (mod-ICAI), and the index of the Californian Dental Association (CDA). The participants rated their satisfaction with the crowns and adjacent soft tissue. Results: The form of the crown was satisfactory for 88% and the colour for 84% of participants, while 72% were satisfied with the adjacent mucosa. A statistically significant bivariate correlation was found between the PES and the ICAI and mod-ICAI. A weaker association was found between the CDA and the ICAI, mod-ICAI and PES. A positive correlation was found between the mod-ICAI index and satisfaction with the form and colour of the crowns and with the sum of ratings of responses to the questions about the form and colour of the crowns and the form and colour of the adjacent mucosa (P<0.05). Although most participants were satisfied, objective evaluation showed that a good aesthetic outcome for single implants was related to the quantity of the peri-implant mucosa. Conclusion: The mod-ICAI index correlated with responses to questions about the form and colour of the mucosa. Other significant correlations were found between the participants' aesthetic perceptions and the ICAI and the mod-ICAI. The mod-ICAI combined best objective and subjective assessment of aesthetics related to implant-supported crowns. To cite this article: ?Vilhjálmsson VH, Klock KS, St?rksen K, Bårdsen A.

AB  - Summary Established post-traumatic spinal cord injuries can serve as an ?experimental model? in which trauma has partially separated the ?spinal neuronal pool? from supraspinal influence. Our findings show that: (1) when the muscle is deprived of upper motor neuron activity, fatigue resistance is diminished and external, electrically induced daily contractions will restore the level of fatigue resistance close to that of muscles in healthy, active subjects; (2) the spinal interneuron network, when completely deprived of brain influence, is a ?spinal reflex centre? with a relatively restricted and low excitability level; and (3) the ?discomplete spinal cord injury? model illustrates that spasticity is of suprasegmental origin and that there are two basic features of brain motor control of the spinal interneuron system: the command to restrict interneuronal pool activity and the command to activate the interneuronal network. Moreover, I have described the modifiability of fatigue resistance. locomotor patterns and different alternatives in the neurocontrol of motor activity, depending on the kind and degree of residual brain influence. Such significant modifiability can be thought of as plasticity of the neuromuscular system and impaired control of the nervous system.

The aim of this report is to alert the veterinary profession to high-level gentamicin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in companion animal patients. Multi-drug resistant strains of this pathogen are the cause of considerable problems in human hospitals and for community healthcare professionals worldwide. The potential for a similar impact within veterinary medicine is discussed.

AB  - Summary The pressure within the abdominal cavity is normally little more than atmospheric pressure. However, even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can have adverse effects on renal function, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow, respiratory mechanics, splanchnic perfusion and intracranial pressure. Although intra-abdominal pressure can be measured directly, this is invasive and bedside measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is usually achieved via the urinary bladder. This cheap, easy approach has been shown to produce results that correlate closely with directly measured abdominal pressures. Significant increases in intra-abdominal pressure are seen in a wide variety of conditions commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, such as ruptured aortic aneurysm, abdominal trauma and acute pancreatitis. Abdominal compartment syndrome describes the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and end-organ dysfunction. This syndrome has a high mortality, most deaths resulting from sepsis and multi-organ failure. Detection of abdominal compartment syndrome requires close surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure in patients thought to be at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension. The only available treatment for established abdominal compartment syndrome is decompressive laparotomy. Prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome after laparotomy by adoption of an open abdomen approach may be preferable in the patient at significant risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension, but this has not been demonstrated in any large trials. Most surgeons prefer to adopt a ?wait and see? policy, only intervening when clinical deterioration is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure.

AB  - Abstract In 2017, 1492 patients were added to the pancreas transplant waiting list, 964 listed as active, a slight increase from 2016. This is significant because for the first time in the past decade, the steady downward trend in additions to the waiting list has been reversed. Proportions of pancreas donors with cerebrovascular accident as cause of death decreased, with a concomitant increase in proportions with anoxia and head trauma. This is partly a result of the national opioid crisis, and it reflects increasing use of younger donors for pancreas transplant. The 2017 outcome report remains compromised by previous variation in reporting graft failure. Although the OPTN Pancreas Transplantation Committee has approved more precise definitions of pancreas graft failure, implementation of these definitions took place recently, and the data are not reflected in this report.

AB  - Objective: To report the success of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of Nocardia brasiliensis mycetoma. We believe this to be only the second report in the medical literature of hyperbaric oxygen therapy used in the therapy of nocardial disease. Clinical features: A 78-year-old man presented to a general hospital outpatient clinic after eight months with a painless swollen left foot. There was no significant medical history, no trauma had occurred, and no foreign body had been detected. The dorsum of the foot had a discharging sinus, from which N. brasiliensis was isolated. Interventions: After unsuccessful treatment with surgical debridement and high-dose antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy was administered in a multi place recompression chamber (one hour of treatment at 1.8 atmospheres absolute followed by a 30 minute ?ascent? to surface pressure). A total of 19 treatments were administered. Outcome: Successful healing of an N. brasiliensis mycetoma of the left foot. Conclusion: In this case of N. brasiliensis mycetoma involving the lower extremity, the conventional management of surgery and antibiotic therapy was unsuccessful, and only with the addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy did clinical recovery occur.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate robotic dry laboratory (dry lab) exercises in terms of their face, content, construct and concurrent validities. To evaluate the applicability of the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) tool to assess dry lab performance. Materials and Methods Participants were prospectively categorized into two groups: robotic novice (no cases as primary surgeon) and robotic expert (≥30 cases). Participants completed three virtual reality (VR) exercises using the da Vinci Skills Simulator (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), as well as corresponding dry lab versions of each exercise (Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) on the da Vinci Surgical System. Simulator performance was assessed by metrics measured on the simulator. Dry lab performance was blindly video-evaluated by expert review using the six-metric GEARS tool. Participants completed a post-study questionnaire (to evaluate face and content validity). A Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used to compare performance between groups (construct validity) and Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess simulation to dry lab performance (concurrent validity). Results The mean number of robotic cases experienced for novices was 0 and for experts the mean (range) was 200 (30?2000) cases. Expert surgeons found the dry lab exercises both ?realistic? (median [range] score 8 [4?10] out of 10) and ?very useful? for training of residents (median [range] score 9 [5?10] out of 10). Overall, expert surgeons completed all dry lab tasks more efficiently (P < 0.001) and effectively (GEARS total score P < 0.001) than novices. In addition, experts outperformed novices in each individual GEARS metric (P < 0.001). Finally, in comparing dry lab with simulator performance, there was a moderate correlation overall (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Most simulator metrics correlated moderately to strongly with corresponding GEARS metrics (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions The robotic dry lab exercises in the present study have face, content, construct and concurrent validity with the corresponding VR tasks. Until now, the assessment of dry lab exercises has been limited to basic metrics (i.e. time to completion and error avoidance). For the first time, we have shown it is feasibile to apply a global assessment tool (GEARS) to dry lab training.

AB  - Objective To describe the frequency and extent of complications associated with lateral caudal axial pattern flaps used to cover large traumatic or excision skin defects on the dorsum, gluteal, and perineal region in 13 dogs. Study Design Case series. Animals Thirteen client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 8 institutions were reviewed for dogs treated with a lateral caudal axial pattern flap, including cases in which the procedure was combined with other reconstructive techniques. The flap length relative to the tail length, location of tail skin incision, size and cause of the defect, and short- and long-term complications were recorded. Results Thirteen dogs were included, 11 with tumors and 2 with traumatic skin loss. The mean estimated length of the flap relative to tail length was 51% (range 33?70%). Four dogs had wound complications. This included 2 dogs with minor postoperative wound complications (mild distal dehiscence) that did not require surgical revision and 2 dogs with major complications that required surgical revision. Two of these 4 dogs had distal flap necrosis, one was revised surgically and one was managed conservatively. In these 2 dogs, the flap length was estimated as 80% and 65% of the tail length, respectively. At 30 days, flaps in all dogs were completely healed. No long-term complications were recorded in any dog. For some dogs, the reconstruction was not obvious, with only the change in hair direction and color noticeable. Conclusion Lateral caudal axial pattern flap is a reconstructive option for gluteal, dorsal, and perineal skin defects in dogs. Distal flap necrosis and dehiscence due to wound infection occurred in 4 dogs that required additional wound care but not always surgical revision.

HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Summary: Twenty stillborn infants with unexplained intracranial haemorrhages were identified in a review of approximately 3,500 perinatal postmortems performed between 1966 and 1982. After apparently uneventful pregnancies, fetal death occurred before the onset of labour and was recognized at a mean of 10 days before delivery; 80% had subdural haemorrhages, others had intraventricular and/or intracerebral haemorrhages, and many had haemorrhages at more than one of these sites. These haemorrhages were of sufficient size to have caused death and no other causes were found at postmortem examinations. All 20 mothers were immigrants to New Zealand from the Pacific Islands and almost all were older, married, multi-gravidas with uneventful medical histories and in stable socio-economic circumstances. In the period studied the incidence of stillbirths with unexplained intracranial haemorrhages was 1.15 per 1,000 Pacific Islander births and, at one hospital, these haemorrhages were found in 14.6% of Pacific Islander stillbirths. There were no unexplained intracranial haemorrhages in other racial groups. Prenatal subdural haemorrhage without a history of maternal trauma is extremely rare. In the absence of supporting maternal histories and other fetal or maternal injuries the possibility that these are ?battered? fetuses remains circumstantial.

AB  - Objective To report the complications and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gall bladder disease. Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Client-owned dogs (n=20). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. Results Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed successfully for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in dogs after careful case selection. The surgeon considering laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be familiar with a variety of methods for cystic duct dissection and ligation to avoid difficulties during the procedure.

The sample consisted of 265 teachers, 223 of whom attended the debriefing meetings. The personal satisfaction ratings of the teachers who attended the meetings revealed that they found the sessions satisfactory. The results of the comparison between those who reported that they benefited from the meetings and those who felt they did not indicated that the first group had lower scores on all of the psychopathology measures. A comparison between 42 teachers who did not attend the meetings and a randomly chosen group of 45 teachers who did attend revealed that the two groups differed significantly in terms of their post-traumatic stress symptom scores. The findings of the study suggest that, in general, the teachers' debriefing sessions were satisfactory.

AB  - Abstract We have previously described a duodenojejunal bypass (DJB) surgical model in healthy C57BL/6 mice. However, our pilot study showed that the same surgical technique caused a high mortality rate in obese mice. In this study, to significantly improve animal survival rate following bariatric surgery and thereby providing a stable surgical model for the study of glucose homeostasis in obese mice, we have used modified techniques and developed the end-to-side gastrojejunal bypass (GJB) surgery in obese C57BL/6 with impaired glucose tolerance. The modification consisted of using the distal part of the jejunum for biliopancreatic diversion including: 1) ligation of the distal stomach at the level of the pylorus; 2) connection the jejunum to the anterior wall of stomach in an end-to-side fashion; and 3) diverting the biliopancreatic secretions through the blind limb into the distal jejunum through an end-to-side anastomosis. We found that by modifying the proximal end-to-end duodenojejunal anastomosis, described in our original model, to an end-to-side gastrojejunal anastomosis in these obese mice, we were able to significantly improve the postoperative mortality in this study. We have also demonstrated that performing the GJB surgery in obese mice resulted in significant weight loss, normalized blood glucose levels, and prevented acute pancreatitis. This newly developed GJB surgery in the obese mice offers a unique advantage to study the mechanisms of gastrointestinal surgery as treatment for type 2 diabetes. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The case presented is a report of a healthy 11- year-old boy, who fell down and traumatized his four maxillary incisors. Both central incisors were deeply intruded with concomitant uncomplicated crown fractures, and both lateral incisors suffered concussion. The intruded teeth were repositioned using a removable orthodontic appliance and were endodontically treated 3 weeks after trauma. Tooth 11 became ankylosed 3 months post trauma, and tooth 21 was extruded to its original position after 5 months. Five months post-trauma, teeth 12 and 22 underwent necrosis and were endodontically treated. In addition, tooth 22 presented an external inflammatory root re-sorption that was arrested by calcium hydroxide paste after 3 months. A crown-lengthening procedure was performed on tooth 11 10 months post-trauma, exposing the clinical crown to a better condition for restoration. All 4 incisors were restored with a composite material, and the incisal edges of the central incisors were shaped at the same level. Two months after the crown lengthening procedure, spontaneous eruption occurred on tooth 11, that had been ankylosed. The restored incisal edge of tooth 11 was reduced to the same level of tooth 21. The patient is under periodical examination till a definitive orthodontic treatment can be performed.

AB  - Summary According to transplant registries, grafts from elderly donors have lower survival rates. During 1999?2005, we evaluated the outcomes of 89 patients who received a liver from a donor aged ≥?60?years and managed with the low liver-damage strategy (LLDS), based on the preoperative donor liver biopsy and the shortest possible ischemia time (group D?≥?60-LLDS). Group D ≥?60-LLDS was compared with 198 matched recipients, whose grafts were not managed with this strategy (89 donors?<?60?years, group D?<?60-no-LLDS and 89 donors aged ≥60?years, group D?≥?60-no-LLDS). In the donors proposed from the age group of ≥60?years, the number of donors rejected decreased during the study period and the LLDS was found to be responsible for this in a significant manner (47% vs. 60%, respectively P?<?0.01). Among the recipients transplanted, the clinical features (age, gender, viral infection, child and model for end-stage liver disease score) were comparable among groups, but group D ≥?60-LLDS had a lower mean ischemia time: 415?±?106?min vs. 465?±?111 (D?<?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05 and vs. 476?±?94 (D?≥?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05. After a median follow-up of 3?years, the 1- and 3-year graft survival rates of group D ≥?60-LLDS (84% and 76%) were comparable with group D <?60-no-LLDS (89% and 76%) and were significantly higher than group D ≥?60-no-LLDS (71% and 54%), P?<?0.005. In conclusion, the LLDS optimized the use of livers from elderly donors.

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - T2 relaxation time mapping provides information about the biochemical status of intervertebral discs. The present study aimed to determine whether texture features extracted from T2 maps or geometric parameters are sensitive to the presence of abnormalities at the posterior aspect of lumbar intervertebral discs, i.e. bulging and herniation. Thirty-one patients (21 women and 10 men; age range 18?51?years) with low back pain were enrolled. MRI of the lumbar spine at 3.0 Tesla included morphological T1- and T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, and multi-echo spin-echo sequences that were used to construct T2 maps. On morphological MRI, discs were visually graded into ?normal?, ?bulging? or ?herniation?. On T2 maps, texture analysis (based on the co-occurrence matrix and wavelet transform) and geometry analysis of the discs were performed. The three T2 texture features and geometric parameters best-suited for distinguishing between normal discs and discs with bulging or herniation were determined using Fisher coefficients. Statistical analysis comprised ANCOVA and post hoc t-tests. Eighty-two discs were classified as ?normal?, 49 as ?bulging? and 20 showed ?herniation.? The T2 texture features Entropy and Difference Variance, and all three pre-selected geometric parameters differed significantly between normal and bulging, normal and herniated, and bulging and herniated discs (p?<?0.05). These findings suggest that T2 texture features and geometric parameters are sensitive to the presence of abnormalities at the posterior aspect of lumbar intervertebral discs, and may thus be useful as quantitative biomarkers that predict disease.
