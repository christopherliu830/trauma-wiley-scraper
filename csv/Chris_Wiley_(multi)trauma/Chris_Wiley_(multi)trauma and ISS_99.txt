AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) changed radically with the advent of Multi Slice CT (MSCT) which enabled necessary technical improvements for the study of blood vessels, particularly arteries. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has some advantages when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MSCT scanners are widely available in places such as emergency rooms and research centers for the diagnosis and research of stroke. Arterial venous malformations, blunt vascular trauma, aneurysms and several other diseases can also be studied with CTA. Since the early 1990's there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications regarding CTA and its widespread use makes it an essential tool in the radiologist's armamentarium.

AB  - Donation after cardiac death (DCD) liver grafts are associated with inferior clinical outcomes and high discard rates because of poor graft quality. We investigated the predictive value of DCD liver biopsy for the pretransplant graft quality evaluation. DCD liver transplants that took place between October 2010 and April 2014 were included (n?=?127). Histological features of graft biopsy samples were analyzed to assess risk factors for graft survival. Macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.973; P?=?0.045] and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate (HR?=?6.969; P?=?0.005) were confirmed as independent risk factors for graft survival; hepatocellular swelling, vacuolation, and necrosis failed to show prognostic value. Additionally, a donor serum total bilirubin level?≥?34.2 ?mol/L was also associated with a lower probability of graft survival. Our analysis indicates that macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate are novel and useful histological markers for DCD liver grafts with unacceptable quality. This finding can be used by transplant surgeons to improve DCD liver acceptance protocols. Liver Transpl 21:838?846, 2015. ? 2015 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract Objective Investigations examining psychosocial adjustment among childhood cancer survivors have focused primarily on negative effects and psychopathology. Emergent literature suggests the existence of positive impact or adjustment experienced after cancer, as well. The purpose of this study is to examine the distribution of Perceived Positive Impact (PPI) and its correlates in young adult survivors of childhood cancer. Methods 6425 survivors and 360 siblings completed a comprehensive health survey, inclusive of a modified version of the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as a measure of PPI. Linear regression models were used to examine demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with PPI. Results Survivors were significantly more likely than siblings to report PPI. Endorsement of PPI was significantly greater among female and non-white survivors, and among survivors exposed to at least one intense therapy, a second malignancy or cancer recurrence. Survivors diagnosed at older ages and fewer years since diagnosis were more likely to report PPI. Income, education and marital/relationship status appeared to have varied relationships to PPI depending upon the subscale being evaluated. Conclusions The existence and variability of PPI in survivors in this study suggest that individual characteristics, inclusive of race, gender, cancer type, intensity of treatment, age at diagnosis and time since diagnosis, have unique and specific associations with different aspects of perceived positive outcomes of childhood cancer.

AB  - Objectives To describe the clinical presentation, MRI findings and outcome in dogs with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin. Materials and Methods Dogs were included in this retrospective study if they had complete medical records, complete neurological examination, MR imaging, cerebellomedullary cerebrospinal fluid sample consistent with eosinophilic pleocytosis and negative infectious disease testing. Results Eleven dogs were included with a median age of 22·0?months (range 7·6 to 92·0?months). Nine breeds were represented. Neurological abnormalities included obtundation (n=10), menace response deficits (n=9), proprioceptive deficits (n=7), ataxia (n=7) and seizures (n=2). Neuroanatomical localisation was multi-focal (n=4), central vestibular system (n=4), diffuse forebrain (n=2) or left trigeminal/facial nerves (n=1). Seven dogs had peripheral eosinophilia. Ten dogs had bilateral symmetrical lesions affecting the cortical grey matter, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuating inversion recovery images and iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images with associated meningeal contrast enhancement. MRI findings were consistent with diffuse meningitis and atrophy or necrosis of cortical grey matter. One dog had increased contrast uptake in the left trigeminal nerve. Ten dogs receiving corticosteroids survived to discharge, with seven also receiving cytarabine arabinoside. Median survival time was 762?days. Clinical Significance Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affects younger larger-breed dogs, with the majority having suspected diffuse cerebrocortical meningitis and cortical (polio)encephalitis, which can be identified on MRI. Response to immunosuppressive treatment is good in the medium to long term, although further studies are required in this area.

AB  - Background There are 4.8 million emergency department (ED) visits for traumatic brain injury (TBI) annually in the United States. Many of these patients do not receive educational information or follow-up care. Aims of the Study Our institution implemented a Neurotrauma Hotline for TBI patients. This study describes our implementation and utilization of a Neurotrauma Hotline at a Level I trauma center. Methods Callers and outcomes of calls to the hotline over a 12-month period were analyzed. Correlation analysis was done to assess relationship between hotline calls and TBI clinic volumes. Results There were 1205 calls to the hotline. Calls were most commonly from internal providers or patients, with 338 repeat callers. The call reason was frequently an appointment (36.8%) or advice (32.1%). There were 334 TBI clinic visits, and however, there was no statistically significant correlation between number of hotline calls and number of clinic visits (r = .417; P = .177). Conclusions There was widespread utilization of our hotline. Other institutions wishing to adopt similar practices can expect that the majority of calls will be for appointment scheduling or clinical advice. Further work is needed to determine whether implementation of a Neurotrauma Hotline improves resource utilization and patient outcomes.

AB  - Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Although the use of prone restraint should be avoided, it may remain a last resort emergency intervention for violent behaviour in psychiatric settings. However, when used as a last resort, concerns remain about the ability of staff to maintain the dignity, welfare and safety of the patient and minimize the potential adverse outcomes associated with restraint. This study builds on existing research regarding the risks of prone restraint by focusing on the psychological perceptions of individuals held in this position. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? Individuals, who were asked to rate the psychological impact of two different prone-restraint positions (Supported and Unsupported Prone Positions) reported that the Supported Prone Position was more comfortable, less anxiety inducing and less limiting to breathing. Although no individual found prone restraint a positive experience, it shows that individuals found the psychological impact of the Supported Prone Position was less than the Unsupported Prone Position. What are the implications for practice? Mental health professionals have a clear responsibility to maintain the dignity, safety and wellbeing of individuals subject to prone restraint as a short-term emergency procedure for the management of violent behaviour. Reducing both the physiological and psychological impact of prone restraint will help to reduce any adverse impact on individuals subject to such interventions. The findings will help influence current practice and promote the removal of the USPP as a specific prone-restraint intervention. Abstract Aim Restraint-related deaths are multi-factorial with prone restraint remaining a concern due to the physiological and psychological risks. This study builds on evidence presented by (Barnett et al. Medicine, Science and the Law (2012b): 1) that the Supported Prone Position (SPP) reduces physiological risks, by examining if the SPP also reduces the psychological impact of prone restraint. Methods Twenty participants ran to near maximal exertion before being held in two prone-restraint positions: SPP and Unsupported Prone Position (USPP). Perceptions of comfort, anxiety and breathing limitation were measured using Visual Analogue Scales. Results Results showed that (1) comfort was 23% greater in the SPP; (2) anxiety was 55% less in the SPP; and (3) perception of breathing limitation was 32% less in the SPP when compared with the USPP. Negative perceptions expressed for the USPP included feeling trapped, vulnerable and concern over heart rate. Discussion In addition to reducing physiological risks, this study shows that the SPP reduced the psychological impact of prone restraint compared to USPP. Implications for Practice Settings where prone restraint cannot be avoided should remove the USPP as an emergency procedure in favour of the SPP as a way of maintaining safety and reducing the psychological impact of prone restraint.

AB  - Abstract In this paper we draw on the findings of a critical, multi-sited ethnographic study of two rural communities affected by a wildfire in British Columbia, Canada to examine the salience of place, identity, and social capital to the disaster recovery process and community disaster resilience. We argue that a reconfiguration of disaster recovery is required that more meaningfully considers the role of place in the disaster recovery process and opens up the space for a more reflective and intentional consideration of the disorientation and disruption associated with disasters and our organized response to that disorientation. We describe a social-psychological process, reorientation, in which affected individuals and communities navigate the psychological, social and emotional responses to the symbolic and material changes to social and geographic place that result from the fire's destruction. The reorientation process emphasizes the critical importance of place not only as an orienting framework in recovery but also as the ground upon which social capital and community disaster resilience are built. This approach to understanding and responding to the disorientation of disasters has implications for community psychologists and other service providers engaged in supporting disaster survivors. This includes the need to consider the complex dynamic of contextual and cultural factors that influence the disaster recovery process.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina of August 2005 forced more than one million people to evacuate the Gulf Coast of the United States. This study examines the psychological health and well-being of a subset of evacuees to determine the prevalence of ongoing mental health problems. Interviews were conducted with 101 adults who evacuated to Louisville, Kentucky, and were living in the state at the one-year anniversary of the event or had recently returned to the Gulf Coast. The psychological health and well-being of respondents was evaluated using several well-validated measures. More than one-half met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder and a majority were suffering from depression and anxiety. The mean quality of life score was 0.6 on a scale from 0?1, suggesting that adaptation and return to pre-hurricane well-being had not occurred 12 months after the storm. The potential for long-term psychological damage exists in this sample of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Results suggest other evacuees may also be at heightened risk.

AB  - Abstract High mortality rates have been reported for methadone in both adults and children. We aimed to determine the pattern of toxicity, possible underlying diseases and treatment challenges in patients referred to our centre with early diagnosis of methadone toxicity and who later died. Medical files of all methadone-poisoned patients who had been admitted to a referral centre of toxicology between March 2011 and March 2016, died during the hospital stay and sent for autopsy to Legal Medicine Organization were retrospectively evaluated. In a total of 94 patients, autopsy findings and laboratory evaluations showed that cause of death was pure methadone toxicity in 57 (60.6%). Other causes of death were ischaemic heart disease in ten, co-ingestions (toxicities including methadone) in eight, brain haemorrhage, multi-organ failure and pneumosepsis (each in four), meningitis/encephalitis in three and head trauma and other toxicities (other than methadone but including an opioid, each in two) patients. Time of cardiopulmonary arrest was significantly different between those with pure methadone toxicity and those who died due to other causes (p = 0.01). Patients who had died due to co-ingestions and other toxicities were younger (p = 0.029) and took more bolus doses of naloxone (p = 0.042). In methadone users, especially in older ages and those with trivial response to naloxone administration, loss of consciousness should not be strictly attributed to methadone toxicity. In such patients, thorough evaluation for other possible causes of loss of consciousness is mandatory.

The ongoing conflict in Afghanistan continues to generate a large number of complex trauma injuries and provides unique challenges to military anesthetists working in forward field hospitals. We report successful use of ultrasound-guided continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in two Afghan war casualties who sustained major trauma with coagulopathy. The use of bilateral continuous TAP blocks following major thoracoabdominal trauma in a combat environment is unique in the literature. Design.? Case report. Results.? The acute perioperative outcomes of two Afghan civilian patients were improved with bilateral continuous TAP blocks. Multiple benefits shared by both patients included early extubation, excellent analgesia, and minimal post-operative morphine requirements despite the setting of a massive blood transfusion and coagulopathy. Conclusions.? A continuous TAP block technique can be utilized to provide excellent analgesia following major abdominal surgery when neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated. The TAP block's ease of placement under ultrasound guidance makes this technique particularly useful in the austere battlefield hospital environment.

Common characteristics included high MELD scores (mean 35.2?±?4.8) and advanced renal disease (duration range 6?44 weeks). CUA was diagnosed within the first 2 months post-SLK based on clinical features. Severe morbidity and prolonged hospital stay were observed and one of the patients died secondary to sepsis. Treatment included metabolic support, wound care, calcium level correction and use of sodium thiosulphate. CUA should be considered in the presence of painful dermatologic changes in patients status post SLK.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a summary of the theoretical perspectives behind the aetiology of child abuse and neglect, including historical perspectives. Early theories of child maltreatment focused on single-factor causes, such as psychopathology/mental illness. The aetiology of child maltreatment is complex and heterogeneous and single-cause approaches are not sufficient. Multi-factorial models of child abuse and neglect are required to fully consider the complexity of risk. The most commonly considered approach in the child abuse and neglect literature is outlined in this chapter: the ecological theory of child maltreatment. In recent years there has been a very substantial and notable social change, i.e., the increased use of and dependence on technology. This has both positive and negative outcomes: alongside increased channels by which potential offenders can access children, there are also increased opportunities for positive interventions following abuse and neglect. Hence this is used as an example throughout the chapter.

AB  - Haemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved, prioritizing the early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while haemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy. Haemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells (RBCs) in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Transfusion of RBCs, plasma and platelets in a similar proportion as in whole blood prevents both hypovolaemia and coagulopathy. Although an early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Results from recent before-and-after studies in massively bleeding patients indicate that trauma exsanguination protocols involving the early administration of plasma and platelets are associated with improved survival. Furthermore, viscoelastic whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG)/rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe haemorrhage, as opposed to conventional coagulation assays. In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of its cause, should be treated with goal-directed haemostatic control resuscitation involving the early administration of plasma and platelets and based on the results of the TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal haemostatic competence until surgical haemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the associations between different types of trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and suicidal ideation among New York City adolescents 1 year after the World Trade Center attacks. A sample of 817 adolescents, aged 13?18, was drawn from 2 Jewish parochial high schools (97% participation rate). We assessed 3 types of trauma exposure, current (within the past month) and past (within the past year) suicidal ideation, and current PTSD symptoms. Findings indicated that probable PTSD was associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation. Exposure to attack-related traumatic events increased risk for both suicidal ideation and PTSD. However, specific types of trauma exposure differentially predicted suicidal ideation and PTSD: knowing someone who was killed increased risk for PTSD, but not for suicidal ideation, and having a family member who was hurt but not killed, increased risk for suicidal ideation, but not for PTSD. This study extends findings from the adult literature showing associations between trauma exposure, PTSD, and increased suicidal ideation in adolescents.

AB  - Gerhard Roth's novel from 1986, Am Abgrund, stands at the center of hismonumental and multi-genre cycle, Die Archive des Schweigens. On one level, the novel can be read as an allegory of modern Austria, which Roth has called a ?Reich des Schweigens.? Its main protagonists?the mute, ostensibly insane Lindner and the law student-cum-murderer Jenner?could represent the twinned dimensions of post-war Austrian silence: guilt and trauma. More broadly, Am Abgrund enacts a post-rational subjectivity that is dispersed over a ground of multivalent and supremely powerful silence. Narrative agency, scattered among multiple figures, is attenuated to the point of nearly disappearing. Roth has said ?das Untersuchen ist eine Krankheitvon mir,? an illness he shares with the novel's third protagonist, the magistrate Sonnenberg. But through this pathologically tinged compulsion, Roth's fiction ultimately makes present a mute reality that can only be traced and silhouetted, but never penetrated, by language.

AB  - Abstract To advance the goal of Getting to Zero and eliminating preventable harm, ASHRM is providing guidance for defining, investigating, and measuring serious safety events. The first step in this process is the recommendation for a common and standardized definition. A common definition for a serious safety event facilitates timely detection, rapid action, and future prevention. This paper outlines that definition, provides a skill-based model for investigation, and explains a clear plan for how to conduct the investigation. A measurement system is described to determine the frequency of SSEs and comparison methods to determine events prevented, potential lives saved, and methods to demonstrate financial loss control. These methods and approach are consistent with ASHRM's core values and mission, which is safe and trusted healthcare.

AB  - Purpose As deep neural networks achieve more success in the wide field of computer vision, greater emphasis is being placed on the generalizations of these models for production deployment. With sufficiently large training datasets, models can typically avoid overfitting their data; however, for medical imaging it is often difficult to obtain enough data from a single site. Sharing data between institutions is also frequently nonviable or prohibited due to security measures and research compliance constraints, enforced to guard protected health information (PHI) and patient anonymity. Methods In this paper, we implement cyclic weight transfer with independent datasets from multiple geographically disparate sites without compromising PHI. We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multisite learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions. Results The MSL model attains an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0.914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and 5% statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0.646 and average correlation of 0.871. Conclusions We show that a neural network can be efficiently trained on data from two physically remote sites without consolidating patient data to a single location. The resulting network improves model generalization and achieves higher average DSCs on external datasets than neural networks trained on data from a single source.

AB  - Background:?? With the use of the three-point lap-diagonal seat belt restraint there has been a reduction in the number of deaths caused by automobile trauma. However, with the use of a restraint, a new pattern of injuries has emerged. The ?seat-belt syndrome? comprises a constellation of injuries including soft tissue injury to the breast. Given that seat-belt legislation is becoming more widespread, it is likely that the incidence and reporting of these injuries will become more common. In this paper, we provide an overview of the reported literature regarding three-point lap-diagonal seat belt injury to the female breast. We then discuss the previously unreported area of breast reconstruction in a breast deformed as a result of blunt trauma, using a specific case as an example. Methods:?? A Medline search was undertaken and all available reported literature, related to seat-belt associated breast trauma, reviewed. Results:?? A concise summary of the varied clinical and radiological presentations is given, as is their suggested management. Subsequently highlighted is the paucity of literature discussing the breast reconstruction options for a breast deformed by blunt trauma and thus, this issue is discussed using a specific case as an example. Conclusions:?? Blunt breast trauma secondary to seat-belt restraint is not only likely to become more common, but can be severe in its functional, psycho-social and aesthetic impact. This paper provides a new adjunct to the currently reported literature, especially in the area of plastic surgical reconstruction of a breast deformed by blunt trauma.
