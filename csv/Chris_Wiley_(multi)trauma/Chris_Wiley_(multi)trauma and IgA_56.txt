AB  - Abstract Objective Since the initial description of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in the early 1900s, classification of this disease has been in flux. The goal of this manuscript is to review the existing literature and to revisit definitions and diagnostic criteria for AgP. Study analysis An extensive literature search was performed that included databases from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science. Of 4930 articles reviewed, 4737 were eliminated. Criteria for elimination included; age > 30 years old, abstracts, review articles, absence of controls, fewer than; a) 200 subjects for genetic studies, and b) 20 subjects for other studies. Studies satisfying the entrance criteria were included in tables developed for AgP (localized and generalized), in areas related to epidemiology, microbial, host and genetic analyses. The highest rank was given to studies that were; a) case controlled or cohort, b) assessed at more than one time-point, c) assessed for more than one factor (microbial or host), and at multiple sites. Results Epidemiologic studies provided insight into ethnic and societal factors affecting AgP. DNA analysis of microbes showed some consistency but significant variability. Host factor analysis was less consistent. Many genetic studies were conducted but few had either sufficient power or looked at multiple genes in AgP. Conclusions Conflicting data resulted for several reasons; 1) the classification was too broad, 2) the disease (AgP) was not studied from its inception, at differing time points (temporal), and at different locations (topographic). New technologic advances coupled with a more delimiting definition of disease will allow for genetic, host and microbial factor analyses in an unbiased manner. As such we predict that progress can be made in identifying a robust group of genetic, host, and microbial risk-markers associated with periodontal disease that can improve diagnostic capability in disease associated with juveniles, adolescents, and post-adolescent individuals.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory confirmation, prevention, surveillance, control of an outbreak for various diseases. The diseases include amoebic dysentery, anthrax, bacillus cereus, botulism, brucellosis, campylobacter, chicken pox, chikungunya, chlamydia pneumonia, chlamydia trachomatis, cholera, clostridium perfringens, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, dengue fever, diphtheria, enterovirus infections, Epstein-Barr virus, gram-negative bacteraemia, hantavirus infection, Hepatitis E virus, influenza, listeriosis, lyme disease, malaria, measles, pneumococcal infection, rabies, relapsing fever, rubella, schistosomiasis, tularaemia, typhoid, viral haemorrhagic fevers, and Zika virus infection. Leishmania are flagellate protozoan parasites transmitted by the bite of sand flies. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of disease, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) occurs when parasites have migrated to vital organs. Acanthamoebae are free-living trophozoites in moist environments that can cause keratitis. The microorganism can survive in the space between lens and the eye, especially in people using contact lenses.
