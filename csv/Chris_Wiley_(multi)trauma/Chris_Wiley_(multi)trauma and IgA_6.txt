AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the trot may occur or increase during endurance rides due to lameness, pain or fatigue. By visual inspection of the movement it is difficult for veterinarians, riders and researchers to distinguish between fatigue and low-grade lameness, which make objective movement analysis relevant for this purpose. The aim of this study was to determine changes in movement symmetry during long-term exercise. Methods Movement symmetry of 45 horses finishing endurance rides of 120?160 kilometres was determined by tri-axial accelerometry according to an earlier published method. Data was collected in Denmark and Germany from 5 international competitions between 2011 and 2013. Movement was assessed at trot on a straight-line in-hand on the day before the race and 30?mins to 3?hrs after passing the final veterinary examination. An overall symmetry index S was calculated on the basis of trunk accelerations measured at 240?Hz during 8 strides. All trotting sequences were recorded on videotape. A paired t-test was performed comparing symmetry indices before and after racing for each individual horse. Results A significant decrease in post-ride symmetry was detected (P?=?0.0042). This is seen as a lower S-index before racing (-6.18; SD?=?0.86. CI [-6.427; ?5.923]) compared to after racing (-5.67; SD?=?0.79; CI [-5.908; ?5.434]). Conclusions This study indicates that the biomechanical method applied allows quantification of the symmetry of movement during field conditions. Most horses had decreased movement symmetry after the race. Accordingly the study provides the basis for further investigation of the causes, including surface, climate and fitness; and the possible health consequences of asymmetric movement developed during long-term exercise. Ethical Animal Research The study was pre-approved by the FEI, the local organizing committees, ground jury, and Danish riding association (DRF). Participation was voluntary and the owner or rider signed an informed consent. All information regarding the horses is kept confidential and the horses coded for anonymity.

AB  - Introduction Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most important Brazilian horse breed. Functional evaluation of MM horses is performed in marcha competitions, where horses must perform 4-gaited exercise at 13?km/h for 70?min. The aim of this work was to test a training protocol to prepare MM horses for marcha competition. Methods Eight untrained MM mares, in randomized blocks with Split plots, were trained for 84 days. Three days/week horses were ridden for one hour (10?min walk, then an individual amount of marcha exercise at 13?km/h established in a previous test, then walk to complete one hour total exercise time). Two days/week, horses walked for one hour. Before training and every 21 days a marcha test (MT) was performed, totaling 5 tests in the experimental period. During the MT, mares were exercised at 13?km/h using a heart rate monitor. Every 10?min heart rate (HR) and blood lactate concentration [La] were recorded. The MT was stopped at 70?min of exercise, or if HR was ≥150?bpm and [La] was ≥4?mmol/L, or if Marcha Time was reached. Blood samples for hemogram, lactate, glucose, triglyceride and CK, LDH, AST determination were collected. Individual time used for training was 10?min less than the exercising time in the previous MT. Regression was used to analyze the results. Results From MT 1 to 4, the positive effect of training was shown on HR, [La] and marcha time (from 9.52?min to 70.5?min, CV?=?26.41). There was not an increase in marcha time on test 5. Conclusions MM mares trained for 63?days with the described protocol are ready to compete in marcha competition.

AB  - Introduction Poll flexion may play an important role in the development of dynamic upper respiratory tract (URT) collapse. However, limited investigations have been performed in Standardbred racehorses. Methods Eight Standardbreds were examined during training, once flexed and once in extension, using a randomised crossover design. Head position was maintained using modified check-reins and head-neck angle was recorded. On each occasion horses performed 2 rounds of exercise of 2400?m at ?35?km/h. Speed and heart rate (HR) were measured and blood obtained before and after exercise. URT endoscopy was performed during the second round. Videos were blinded and URT function assessed. HR, plasma lactate (Lac) and speed were compared for different head positions using paired t-tests. Cortisol was analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA and URT function using Fisher's exact tests and paired t-tests (P<0.05). Results Data were excluded for one horse where head-neck angle could not be measured. Flexed and extended head-neck angles differed significantly (mean: 85.0° vs 97.8°; P?=?0.001). All horses showed some form of URT collapse during exercise, although this was only deemed clinically significant in 4 horses with a history of abnormal noise. These horses showed additional abnormalities during flexion. However, mean severity scores did not reach statistical significance (P?=?0.08). No significant difference was found for speed, HR or Lac. A significant increase in cortisol was found with exercise (P<0.001). The interaction between time and head position approached significance (P?=?0.09) with higher concentrations of cortisol generally occurring in extension rather than flexion. Conclusions URT abnormalities may be exacerbated with poll flexion. The use of equipment to modify head position may induce a stress response.

AB  - Introduction Healthy and poorly performing horses can display arrhythmias during exercise and immediately afterwards. The relationship of arrhythmias to exercise intensity or type, and their frequency of recurrence, are poorly understood. Clarification of these issues was the objective of this investigation. Methods Electrocardiograms were recorded on 9 Thoroughbreds during maximal and submaximal exercise on a racetrack (RA) and treadmill (TM). The frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias for RA and TM were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Results 65 workouts (TM?=?46, RA?=?19; median[range]: 4/horse[2?14]) were performed. Exercising arrhythmias were detected in 4/9 horses (12/65 workouts) and there were post-exercise arrhythmias in 7/9 horses (20/65 workouts). A single exercising electrocardiogram per horse often did not display all arrhythmias detected over several workouts. 3/9 horses exhibited arrhythmias during the first and second runs while the other 6 had none. 4/9 had 1 post-exercise arrhythmia. Of 6 horses with >3 runs, 1 displayed arrhythmias each time, 3 never had arrhythmias and 2 sometimes showed arrhythmias during exercise (1/9 and 4/8 workouts, respectively). All 6 intermittently had post-exercise arrhythmias (median[range]: 50% [9?75%] of workouts). Presence of arrhythmias was positively related to intensity and all occurred at ≥94%HRmax. The frequency of arrhythmias following RA (29%) and TM (12.5%) was not statistically different. Conclusions Gallops on TM or RA were equally effective for detecting arrhythmias. The presence/absence of exercising arrhythmias was more repeatable than post-exercise arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are more likely to be detected at maximal or near-maximal intensities. A larger population needs to be studied before firm conclusions are drawn. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.

AB  - Introduction Previous research suggests stalling may have a negative influence on bone mineral content (BMC). Yet slow, long-distance exercise has not been successful in improving BMC compared to free-choice exercise. Still, it is a common practice to stall horses with light exercise and minimal turnout. We hypothesized stalled horses, despite ?weekend? turnout and light exercise, would have lower estimated BMC compared to pasture turnout. Methods Thirteen mature horses were split into two groups, Control (C, n?=?6) and Stalled (S, n?=?7). Digital radiographs were taken of the third metacarpal for estimation of BMC by radiographic bone aluminum equivalence (RBAE). After a 42-d period (P1) additional radiographs were taken and S-horses stalled for 4-d (receiving light under-saddle exercise), followed by 72-h pasture turnout. This pattern repeated for an additional 42-d (P2) followed by radiographs. Radiographs were analyzed for optical density of bone cortices and total BMC compared to an aluminum step-wedge on each cassette. Changes in BMC were analyzed using PROC mixed in SAS with repeated measures. Results No treatment differences were observed in the medial (P?=?0.72) or lateral (P?=?0.46) cortices. Dorsal and palmar cortices exhibited a treatment by period interaction (P<0.01, P<0.02), remaining unchanged in C but S decreased over P1 and returned to baseline in P2. Total RBAE was not different by treatment or period. Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, horses stalled with light exercise and ?weekend? turnout maintained BMC compared to themselves and controls at pasture. Such management may be considered for maintaining BMC when horses must be stalled for weekday riding or training. Further research is necessary to determine minimum turnout and exercise needs to maintain BMC when stalling.

AB  - Introduction One of the causes of injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is assumed to be repeated high intensity loading of the tendon. Earlier fatigue of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) in comparison to the time of fatigue of the superficial digital flexor muscle (SDFM) is also assumed to increase load on the SDFT during long distance running. This study evaluated the fatigue of SDFM and DDFM with maximal exercise. Methods Two wire electrodes were inserted into the SDFM and DDFM of 6 Thoroughbred horses (461?557?kg). Electromyogram (EMG) and hoof strain gauge signals were recorded at 2,500?Hz with horses on an inclined treadmill (6%), and filter processing was applied (high-pass 10?Hz for EMG and low-pass 200?Hz for strain gauge). Integrated EMG (iEMG), the median frequency (MF) of EMG, and the stride frequency (SF) were compared using paired t-test during 100?105% heart rate max exercise and trotting before and after maximal exercise. Results The SF significantly decreased and iEMG of SDFM tended to decrease during maximal exercise (P?=?0.055), while MF of EMG in SDFM and DDFM did not change. The iEMG of SDFM and DDFM significantly decreased and MF of EMG in DDFM tended to decrease at a trot after maximal exercise (P?=?0.063). Conclusions The DDFM may fatigue earlier than SDFM during long distance running. Further study is needed to evaluate the relationship between the decrease in iEMG of SDFM and DDFM during maximal exercise and the injury to SDFT.

AB  - Introduction Selecting the appropriate nutritional supplements for performance horses is difficult, due to significant gaps in the current scientific evidence. Our hypothesis was that nutritional supplements are chosen based on owner's perception of discipline specific health and performance problems. Methods A mixed methods (open and closed questions) online questionnaire was distributed through British Eventing and Dressage websites, to collect data on demographics of owners and their horses, supplements used, and their opinion on health and performance problems in their discipline, and in their own horses. Data was evaluated using descriptive analysis and Sign and Fisher's exact tests for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results 599 responses met the inclusion criteria, of which 441 were or had competed in dressage, and 158 in eventing (unaffiliated novice to affiliated advanced levels). Participants had been riding for 26.4 (3?60) (mean (range)) years, currently competed 1.2 (0?10) horses, and used 2 (0?12) supplements in their top horse. Participants ranked the most important health and performance issues as (1) Energy and behaviour, (2) Lameness, (3) Back and muscle problems for dressage, and (1) Lameness, (2) Energy and behaviour, (3) Stamina and fitness for eventing horses. The most common reason supplements were used in individual horses were (1) Joints and mobility, (2) Behavioural problems for dressage, and (1) Electrolytes, (2) Joints and mobility for eventing. Conclusions There was discrepancy between participants' opinions of the main health and performance problems within their discipline, and their reasons for using supplements.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training can enhance antioxidant status, but it is unknown whether selenium supplementation can further improve antioxidant defenses. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At wk 14, all horses underwent a 2-hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Blood samples and biopsies of the gluteus medius were obtained before and after training and in response to the SET. Serum Se, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in whole blood and muscle, and plasma lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) were evaluated. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures. Results Serum Se was higher (P?=?0.02) at wk 14 in trained horses receiving 0.3 than 0.1?mg?Se/kg, but was unaffected by diet in untrained horses. Muscle GPx activity was unchanged after 14-weeks of Se and training, but in response to the SET, muscle GPx was higher (P?=?0.05) in trained than untrained horses. An effect of training*time (P?=?0.008) was noted for whole blood GPx, reflecting greater (P?=?0.01) activity in trained than untrained horses immediately after the SET. Plasma LPO was not influenced by dietary Se, but increased (P<0.0001) in untrained horses immediately after the SET while remaining unchanged in trained horses. Conclusions Training appears to mitigate oxidative damage in response to prolonged exercise in young horses. Although trained horses responded to a higher level of dietary Se, it showed no clear advantage for reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction Equine training often includes running on tracks with different uphill (UP) or downhill (DOWN) slopes and examination of lame horses on a slope can be used to investigate the origin of lameness. However little is known about the kinetics of horses in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare ground reaction force, acceleration and sliding of the hoof in the forelimb of horses trotting an uphill and downhill slope. Methods The right front hoof of 5 horses was equipped with a dynamometric horseshoe and an accelerometer allowing the measurement of 3D ground reaction force and hoof acceleration and displacement. The horses were trotted in hand (3.5?m/s) on a 7% inclined asphalt area successively uphill and downhill. Data were analysed using an ANOVA, accounting for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (P<0.01). Results Speed was not significantly different between UP and DOWN. The maximal longitudinal breaking force of the hoof, maximal vertical force, vertical impulse and longitudinal sliding of the hoof at impact were significantly increased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively +97.7%, +8.4%, +16.6% and +450%). Stride frequency and longitudinal propulsive force were significantly decreased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively ?5.1% and ?48.7%). Conclusions The results of this study (increased longitudinal breaking force and maximal vertical force on a downward slope) are consistent with previous measurements of superficial digital flexor tendon loading on the same area [1]. Conversely increased propulsive force on an uphill slope needs to be taken into account during rehabilitation of horses with deep digital flexor tendon injuries.

AB  - Introduction Poor hoof angle and hoof pastern alignment has been linked to lameness in mature horses. External characteristics, such as the hoof pastern axis and hoof angle, are commonly used to assess dorsopalmar conformation in the same manner in foals. The hoof wall integument and distal phalanx is parallel in healthy mature horses but not in foals: this is not understood. Methods The front feet of 22 Thoroughbred foals were radiographed and measured in June and again in November. Lateromedial radiographic images were measured (Osirix) for hoof integument angle and width, and proximal, middle and distal phalanx angles. The data were tabulated in Excel and analysed in Minitab. After assessment for normality (Anderson-Darling), potential relationships were assessed for differences between June and November using paired t-tests and regression analysis. Results The dorsal hoof angle became more acute with age, R2?=?0.3326, the mean of June, 59.05?±?3.662°, was significantly different from November, 53.64?±?2.7824°, P<0.0001. The hoof pastern axes were broken forward in June, 6.1?±?2.1°, in November 2.5?±?1.6°, whereas the phalangeal axes were broken back, June,-11.0?±?7.5°, November, ?8.3?±?4.4°. There was a significant relationship between age and hoof pastern axis alignment, R2?=?0.3746; P<0.0001. The phalangeal axis did not correlate with age. The relationship between age and parallelism of the integument was significant R2?=?0.4867; P<0.0001. Conclusions The cause of the non-alignment of the hoof pastern axis and phalangeal axis in Thoroughbred foals is widening of hoof integument proximodistally and circumferential bone thickening of the distal phalanx. Assumptions of phalangeal angles based on external characteristics cannot be made in foals.

AB  - Introduction Myofascial lines are chains of interconnected anatomical structures that functionally direct the basic motion patterns of the musculoskeletal system. They have previously been dissected in humans, where they describe the overall spinal motion of flexion, extension, lateral flexion and axial rotation. They are believed to play a role in functionality, connection, and balance of the body. The aim of this study was to investigate whether similar myofascial lines could be identified in the horse. Methods Five myofascial kinetic lines were dissected in 22 horses euthanized for unrelated reasons. The lines were the Superficial Dorsal Line (SDL), Superficial Ventral Line (SVL), Lateral Line (LL), Spiral Line (SL), and Functional Line (FL). Results SDL included hind limb flexors and the errector spinae group, which extend the hip and spine. SVL included hind limb extensors, abdominal muscles, and ventral neck muscles, which are structures with antagonistic functions to SDL. LL followed myofascial tissues along the side of the abdomen and produced latero-flexion of the spine. FL and SL formed helical lines concerned with spinal axial rotation. FL connected the front limb to the contralateral hind limb by crossing over the midline at the thoraco-lumbar level dorsal and ventral on the trunk. SL connected one side of the neck with the contralateral front limb and ipsilateral hind limb by a helical course around the body crossing over at the cervico-thoracic and lumbo-sacral junctions. Conclusions The SBL, SVL and LL complete a functional anatomical ring, which balances the dorsal, ventral and lateral motion patterns of the horse. The helical FL and SL determine the spinal axial rotation. With minor exceptions all lines mirrored the human lines.

AB  - Introduction Racing Quarter Horses (QH) typically compete at shorter distances and faster speeds than Thoroughbreds (Tbred). The two components of speed are stride rate and stride length. The hypothesis of this study is that racing QH have greater stride rates than Tbreds, and that stride rate decreases as distance increases, even within breed. Methods Five runnings of sprint and classic distance stakes races for both QH (Texas Twister Stakes, 100.6?m; Champion of Champions, 402.3?m) and Tbred (Breeders? Cup Sprint, 1,207.0?m; Breeders? Cup Classic, 2,011.7?m) contested from 2008 to 2012 were obtained and viewed by five individuals. Individuals watched each race three times (in slow motion when needed) and the average number of strides per second taken by the winning horse was calculated. Using the PROC Mixed Procedure of SAS, the averages from the five individuals were used to compare differences between breeds, and between distances within a breed. The stride rates were also used to determine average stride length by factoring in length of each race. Results The average stride rate was greater for QH than for Tbred (2.88 vs 2.34 strides/sec; P<0.0001). Additionally, stride rate decreased (P<0.0001) as distance increased (2.96, 2.81, 2.45, 2.23 strides/sec, respectively). Stride length was longest in the Tbred races and shortest in the 100.6?m QH race (P<0.0001). Conclusions The Tbred stride rates reported here, and associated respiratory rates, have been previously reported and are remarkable. However, QH rates are nearly 25% greater. The associated rapid acceleration and deacceleration of the lower limb and quick breathing rate may have implications for skeletal and respiratory soundness.

AB  - Introduction One week of reduced workload between 3 periods of 2 weeks of conditioning (CP) 5 times/fortnight at VLa10 for two bouts of 5 minutes allowed for a continuous increase of VLa4, but the extent was smaller than in another study with the same conditioning program but for the recovery week (VLa4, VLa10: horse's speed, which produced a blood lactate concentration of 4 and 10?mmol/l). Methods Six Purebred Arabians were submitted to the same conditioning protocol of the studies mentioned above except for increasing the duration of treadmill exercise in each CP by 2.5 minutes (2?x?10 minutes in the third CP). A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed at the beginning of CP to determine VLa4 and VLa10, and repeated after the week with reduced workload after each CP. Exercise speed was individually adapted to the new VLa10 for every CP. The effects of conditioning on VLa4 were examined using repeated measures analysis of variance. Significant results were analyzed further with Fisher's test. Results Mean VLa4 increased after the first CP (P<0.001), fell between first and second CP (P<0.001) and remained at this level after the third CP (P>0.05). Conclusions This conditioning program did not allow for VLa4 increases of the magnitude observed in other studies with the same exercise protocols but without the week with reduced workload and increases in exercise duration. It is possible that the decline of VLa4 of the horses after the first CP was due to overtraining (simultaneous increase of speed and duration of exercise). The effect of recovery from training needs further studies. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Bioethical Committee of the University of La Plata, Argentina.

AB  - Introduction The fixation of the bridle, particularly the noseband, is important in the horse-rider interaction. The goal of this study was to show the influence of noseband tightness on tensile forces elicited in side reins under traction to position the horse's head. Methods Ten Warmblood horses (2 mares, 8 geldings; mean age: 12.4?±?5.3 years) were assessed during walk and trot on a treadmill. Side reins were used to position the horse's head so that the nose was nearly vertical. Measurements were made with a correctly tightened noseband (two fingers space between the noseband and nasal bone?=?N1) and with a tight noseband (=?N2). Rein forces were measured with an electronic sensor based on a force sensing resistor (27?g, sample rate 120?Hz, Interlink Electronics corp.), synchronized with a kinematic system (10 cameras, 120?Hz, Motion Analysis corp.). The force sensors were calibrated with masses of 1?Kg (=9.81?N) and 4?Kg (=39.24?N). Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS. Normality of data was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test and data were analysed with repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results Side rein forces in N1 were significantly higher than in N2 during walk and trot. Maximum forces at walk were 8.6?±?0.9?N for N1 and 6.7?±?0.95?N for N2. At trot the forces (7.2?±?0.95?N for N1; 5.96?±?0.9?N N2) were significantly reduced compared to walk. There was no significant difference between left and right rein forces. Conclusions This study demonstrated that noseband tightness has an influence on rein tension. The rein forces that were exerted were lower than in ridden horses.

AB  - Introduction Suspensory apparatus injuries are common in dressage horses. Studies demonstrate that surface type affects hoof forces and distal limb kinematics of equine athletes. Because synthetic race surfaces have lower stiffness and limb loads than dirt surfaces, it was hypothesized that dressage horses have less fetlock hyperextension on a synthetic surface than a dirt surface. Methods Two-dimensional, high-speed videos (250?Hz, 2?ppcm) of 6 dressage horses (ages 8?13; 5 males, 1 female) during extended trot on dirt and synthetic surfaces (6 trials (strides) per horse per surface) were digitized (low-pass Butterworth filter, 15?Hz). Fetlock and solar hoof angles determined from skin and hoof markers were compared between surfaces using a mixed model ANCOVA that accounted for horse velocity (saddle billet marker) and repeated horse measures. Surface mechanical behaviors were characterized using a track testing device. Maximum force, time to maximum force, maximum displacement, resting rebound, maximum vertical rebound, average stiffness, and maximum load rate were compared between surfaces and time of day (morning, afternoon) using a general linear model ANOVA. Results Maximum and toe off fetlock angles were greater on the synthetic surface compared to dirt (??=?2°, P?=?0.070). Mean maximum fetlock angle on the synthetic surface was 260°. The maximum load rate of the synthetic surface was 5 times greater than the dirt surface (P?=?0.0086). Conclusions Synthetic surfaces were designed to reduce injuries in equine athletes. Because suspensory apparatus elongation is largely dependent on fetlock extension, it is possible that suspensory apparatus strain is greater on synthetic surfaces. Thus, surface design may require more refinement to promote injury prevention based on horse discipline and gait.

AB  - Introduction To enhance expressiveness and regularity of the tölt, Icelandic horses are commonly shod with excessively high and long hooves. The aim of this study was to objectively assess the effect of shoeing on distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint moments of the left forelimb during break-over at walk, tölt and trot. Methods Twelve sound Icelandic horses accustomed to exercise with a rider on a treadmill were assessed with hooves trimmed and shod according to the standards of normal shoeing and with long and high front hooves; besides the 20?x?8?mm steel shoes, this condition included pads and packing material used in competition. Vertical ground reaction forces (GRFz) were measured with an instrumented treadmill. Time of break-over was determined kinematically. Measuring systems were started synchronously; sampling frequency was 480?Hz. Measurements were taken at 1.34?±?0.04?m/s (walk), 3.89?±?0.10?m/s (tölt), and 3.90?±?0.10?m/s (trot). The DIP joint moment arm was determined on size-calibrated latero-medial radiographs of the left front hoof. Differences were tested using a t-test (walk) or repeated measures ANOVA (tölt, trot). Results In the condition with the long and high hooves, DIP joint moment was increased by 18.5% at walk (P<0.001), 17.3% at tölt (P<0.001) and 13.4% at trot (P?=?0.017) although vertical GRFz at break-over was not statistically different between the two shoeing conditions. The increase could be attributed to the 22.7% increase of the lever arm. Conclusions High hooves with long toes may have negative implications for the health of the palmar structures of the distal foot.

AB  - Introduction The aims of this study were to quantify the morphological differences between uneven feet, and to evaluate the biomechanical locomotor consequences compared to horses with even feet, considered as normal. Methods Eight anatomical parameters that quantified conformational differences in the distal forelimbs of horses with a varied range of hoof asymmetries (n?=?36, of which 2 were lame) were compared using discriminant analysis. Forefeet were subjectively scored for unevenness by one clinician. Kinetics and distal limb kinematics of clinically sound horses (n?=?34; the 2 lame horses were excluded) were collected at trot and compared between even (n?=?13) versus uneven (n?=?21) forefeet and between all feet when classified as flat, medium and upright using MANOVA/ANOVA. The relative influence of contralateral differences in hoof angle and of absolute hoof angle on functional parameters was analyzed by multiple regression (P<0.05). Results Unevenness was best determined by the differences in dorsal hoof angle between the forefeet. In uneven footed horses, the flatter foot showed a significantly larger maximal horizontal braking and vertical ground reaction force, a larger vertical fetlock displacement and a suppler limb spring. A steeper hoof angle was linearly correlated with an earlier braking-propulsion transition. No significant differences were found between individual flat, medium or upright feet. Conclusions The conformational differences between the forefeet were more important for loading characteristics than the individual foot conformation. The contralateral differences in vertical force could in fact imply an early, subclinical sign of lameness developing in the steeper forefoot, as these differences were smaller than those reported for subtle, clinically evident lamenesses.

AB  - Introduction We have observed major back-shape changes over time in some horses, the speed of which may be influenced by work-type, skeletal maturity, nutrition and saddle-fit. Currently, there are no longitudinal data quantifying changes in back-shape and no objective data assessing the importance of each variable. The objectives were to: quantify back-shape changes over time; describe the effects of age, breed, weight, work-discipline, saddle-management and pain elicited on palpation. Methods Preliminary data from 98 sport horses in regular work in an on-going one-year longitudinal study. Weight and management changes were recorded. The thoracolumbar shape was measured at T18, T13 and T8 using a Flexible Curve Ruler [1] every two months. Ratios were calculated for each site for the widths 3?cm and 15?cm ventral to the dorsal midline. Differences in back-shape were determined using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Chi-square test was used to assess associations between categorical variables, Spearman rank correlation for continuous variables, Mann-Whitney-U for continuous variables with binary outcomes and Kruskal-Wallis to assess ≥3 groups. Results T8 and T18-ratios were significantly different after two months (P<0.001) and T13 after four months (P?=?0.004). Decreased ratio at T8 was related to ill-fitting saddles (P?=?0.005), saddles tipping back (P?=?0.020), pain on palpation (P?=?0.032) and greater age (P?=?0.004). Increased T18-ratio was associated with weight gain (P<0.001), more prevalent in stallions and geldings than mares (P?=?0.035) and in dressage horses than other disciplines (P?=?0.043). Conclusions Back-shape can change within two months, the speed and direction of which are influenced by saddle-fit, age and bodyweight. Pain elicited on palpation of the back may indicate that changes have occurred. Thus saddle-fit should be reassessed.

AB  - Introduction There are few data on training horses used for show jumping (SJ) in practice. This study presents such data and relates it to changes of VLa4 during an outdoors season (VLa4?=?speed at which a blood lactate concentration of 4?mmol/l is achieved). Methods The training of 19 SJ (11 managed by professional trainer, PSJ, and 8 by amateur riders, ASJ) was documented and related to changes of VLa4. All horses were submitted to 3 standardized exercise tests (SET) to calculate VLa4: April/May, June/July, September: SET1, SET2, SET3. Noted daily were: Minutes of turn-out on pasture, of walking in horse-walker, of lungeing and of specific exercise (gymnastics, jumping and others). Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA (Fisher's test as applicable) or linear regression. Results The duration of the specific exercises ranged between 30?60 minutes. PSJ were exercised less often and duration of each specific exercise was lower than for ASJ (P?=?0.01). Considering all horses, the VLa4 increased between SET1 and SET2 when the duration of exercise and gymnastics was longer and the number of days on pasture higher (P<0.05 both). These relationships became not significant when groups were analysed separately. The VLa4 of ASJ increased between SET2 and SET3 when horses were kept on pasture for more time (P<0.05, r2?=?0.64). The VLa4 of PSJ tended to increase with a higher percentage of jumping days between SET1 and SET2 (P?=?0.08, r2?=?0.30), and with longer duration of jumping exercise sessions between SET2 and SET3 (P?=?0.06; r2?=?0.33). Conclusions The information may help to improve the training of show jumpers. Ethical Animal Research Horse owners gave consent for these procedures within a veterinary monitoring system.

AB  - Introduction There is relatively little information concerning physiological factors affecting show-jumping performance. This study examined the relationship between show-jumping exercise, muscle soreness, serum muscle enzyme activity and blood lactate concentration. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up and after jumping a 15 fence course (1.35?1.45?m) once on day one and twice on day two; on day three the second round was an 8 fence jump-off. Veterinary and physiotherapy assessments of muscle soreness were performed daily before and after exercise. An international coach graded jumping technique. Blood was obtained before and on two occasions after jumping (1 minute, two hours) for measurement of serum CK and AST, and blood lactate concentration. Data were analysed using regression procedures or Spearman correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<0.05). Results Blood lactate significantly increased one minute after jumping on all three days (P?=?0.003 for all). When two rounds were jumped, lactate was significantly lower after the second round compared to the first (P?=?0.006, P?=?0.014). There was a positive correlation between blood lactate one minute after jumping and number of faults scored daily and overall (R2?=?0.61; P<0.01), decreased jumping technique grade (R2?=?0.69; P<0.01) and increased gluteal muscle soreness on day two (r?=?0.75; P?=?0.012). Plasma CK activity one minute, and 2 hours after jumping was significantly higher than before jumping on all days (P<0.01). Conclusions Horses with higher blood lactate concentrations after jumping demonstrated decreased jumping performance and were more likely to display muscle soreness.
