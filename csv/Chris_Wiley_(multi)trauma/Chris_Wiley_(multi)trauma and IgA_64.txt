AB  - A 24-year-old female with a lifelong history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with left ring finger pain and decreased sensation for over a year. She has multiple café au lait spots over her entire trunk, upper and lower extremities. She also had 11 surgeries to excise superficial neurofibromas over her body. She first noticed a painful swelling of the proximal phalanx of the left ring finger. She then gradually noticed a loss of sensation distally and a constant numb and tingling feeling distal to the palm and the left ring finger. The clinical impression was neurofibroma. MRI of the tender lesion found no evidence of neurofibroma. Biopsy of the lesion showed hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles. Hypertrophy of Pacinian Corpuscles is a rare condition which has been reported very infrequently. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with persistent pain localized to the distal palm or digits in addition to glomus tumor and neuroma. It was thought not to be connected with neurofibromatosis. The finding of this lesion in a patient with neurofibromatosis is somewhat intriguing and the relationship of these two entities is unclear.

AB  - Progressive mucinous histiocytosis is a rare, benign, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis limited to the skin. A total of ten cases, all women, in four families, and one sporadic case have been described in the English literature. The disorder usually begins in childhood and progresses slowly. We report two sporadic cases of adult-onset progressive mucinous histiocytosis in unrelated African American women, age 48 and 55?years old respectively, who developed red-brown and flesh-colored, asymptomatic papules on the face, arms and legs without truncal, mucosal or visceral involvement. The lesions show no spontaneous regression. Both patients lack associated systemic symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia or seizures. There is no underlying hyperlipidemia, paraproteinemia or lymphoproliferative disease. No family history of similar lesions can be identified. Light microscopy reveals dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped histiocytes with abundant mucin deposition. Electron microscopy demonstrates a high number of myelin-figures or zebra bodies in the cytoplasm of histiocytes. On immunohistochemistry, positive staining with macrophage markers CD68, HAM56 and lysozyme, and Factor XIIIa, a transglutaminase present in dermal dendrocytes, and negative staining with Langerhans cell markers CD1a and S100, and CD34, a marker present in dermal dendritic cells derived from uncommitted mesenchymal cells, are observed.

AB  - A substantial minority of patients with coeliac disease (estimated at anything between 7 and 30%) fail to respond to treatment with a gluten-free diet. Non-responsiveness may be primary, that is when the patient fails to respond to treatment following initial diagnosis, or secondary, when a patient who has previously had a documented response to gluten exclusion becomes non-responsive to therapy. The commonest cause of non-responsiveness is continued gluten ingestion, either voluntary or inadvertent. Other causes to be considered include intolerances to dietary constituents other than gluten (e.g. milk, soya), pancreatic insufficiency, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunitis. There is some evidence that ulcerative jejunitis is, in fact, a manifestation of lymphoma. The most important steps in the management of the non-responsive coeliac patient are (a) to determine whether the patient is indeed coeliac, (b) to exclude lymphoma and (c) to establish the cause of the non-responsiveness. In those coeliac patients with no demonstrable cause for non-responsiveness, a variety of therapeutic stratagems (mostly based on small, uncontrolled studies) have been described; these include elimination diets, dietary supplementation with zinc and copper, and pharmacological therapy in the form of steroids, azathioprine and cyclosporin. In a minority of non-responsive patients, the clinical course is characterized by a rapid decline, and total parenteral nutrition is required. None of the therapies described above has been subjected to rigorous controlled studies. The precise mechanisms of non-responsiveness in coeliac patients need to be unravelled before rational therapeutic approaches can be established.

AB  - Isolated cases and outbreaks of mycobacterial furunculosis among patients receiving pedicures have been reported. The transmission of the mycobacteria likely occurs while soaking the legs in a whirlpool foot bath prior to the pedicure. Oils are often applied to the legs following the foot bath. Typically, patients present with multiple papules and pustules below the knees that, after several weeks or months, may become large, tender, and fluctuant furuncles. Histology usually demonstrates a suppurative folliculitis with or without associated suppurative granulomatous inflammation. We present a culture-proven case of M. fortuitum furunculosis in a patient after receiving whirlpool leg soaking and pedicure in a foot salon. We also illustrate several other highly suspected cases in which cultures failed to grow the organism. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize the gross and histological patterns of this under-reported condition as cultures, particularly swabs, often fail to grow the organism.

AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans is the most common tropically acquired dermatosis caused by larvae of various nematodes, which penetrate the skin and subsequently migrate, causing serpiginous lesions and pruritus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. While a biopsy taken just ahead of the leading edge of a lesion is felt to enhance the yield of a positive biopsy, the larvae are migratory and thus rarely identified on histologic sections. We present a case of cutaneous larva migrans in which the larval forms are well demonstrated both in a horizontal and longitudinal orientation. A 75-year old man presented with intractable pruritus and multiple erythematous plaques on his back, poorly responsive to topical steroids. The diagnosis was made on biopsy. Associated with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, a cross section of a larval form was identified within the epidermis. In a second biopsy, the entire organism was present within a sebaceous gland. This case clearly demonstrates the rarely identified larval forms of cutaneous larva migrans.

AB  - We present a 69-year-old woman with a sebaceous carcinoma of the left upper eyelid, which originated from the Meibomian gland of the tarsal plate. The intraepidermal extension involved not only the conjunctival epithelium but also the overlying skin with subsequent extension into the dermis. The discussion will include diagnostic, both clinical and microscopic, considerations along with comparison to mammary Paget?s disease. Just as mammary Paget?s disease, which originates from the glands in the dermis eventuating in the seeding of the overlying epidermis, so too does sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Accordingly, just as mammary Paget?s disease is often misdiagnosed as an inflammatory condition, so too is sebaceous carcinoma.

AB  - We present here a case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with neuroendocrine features that has transformed into a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with various morphologic features of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). A 54-year-old white female was treated for a BCC of the right thigh. Pathologic examination revealed an otherwise classical BCC that demonstrated granular positivity for chromogranin. Six years later the patient developed a right inguinal lymphadenopathy diagnosed as metastatic BCC with squamous changes. The metastatic BCC showed partial peripheral palisading and a trabecular pattern. Two years later the patient underwent a right nephrectomy due to obstruction of the right ureter by metastatic BCC. After another four years the patient came back with extensive involvement of the appendiceal wall and right ovary by a diffusely infiltrating metastatic basaloid and trabecular carcinoma. This time the tumor had many histologic features of MCC and showed strong positivity for chromogranin and also for CK20 and NSE. Electron microscopy revealed neurosecretory granules. This case is an example of a chromogranin positive basal cell carcinoma of the skin, which transformed during multiple recurrences into a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with features of Merkel cell tumor, demonstrating the potential for cross differentiation among skin tumors.

AB  - Apocrine hidrocystomas occur most commonly as solitary nodules on the face and neck. Case reports of patients with multiple lesions on the face, particularly in the periorbital region, have been described. They present as cystic, translucent, blue or brown papules or nodules. The color is attributed to the Tyndall effect, as pigment such as melanin or hemosiderin has rarely been demonstrated within the lesions. We present a 43-year-old Caucasian female with over thirty blue-gray macules on her perineum and vulva. The patient was unaware of the lesions though she noted perineal and inguinal pruritus after exercise. Punch biopsy showed a cluster of cysts within a loose stroma, located in the deep dermis. The cysts were lined by a single layer of flattened cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal areas of papillation and decapitation secretion. A peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells was present. The epithelium contained brown pigment confirmed to be melanin by Fontana-Masson stain. Iron stain was negative. GCDFP-15 (gross cystic disease fluid protein) labelled the epithelial cells. S-100 and Mart-1 immunohistochemical stains were negative. Unusual features of this case include the anatomic site, number of lesions, and demonstration of melanin as the cause of the clinical pigmentation.

AB  - A 77-year-old white female presented with a two to three year history of an asymptomatic skin-colored papule on the right upper arm. Examination revealed a 7?mm???7?mm soft papule, supplanted by a smaller soft papule. Clinical differential diagnosis included an adnexal tumor, neurofibroma, and dermal nevus. Histological examination revealed a sparse proliferation of spindle and stellate-shaped cells within the dermis, including many large cells with bizarre shaped nuclei. Focal multinucleated giant cells were present as well. The background stroma was both collagenous and myxoid, the later being highlighted by diffuse colloidal iron staining. The spindle and stellate-shaped cells demonstrated CD34 and vimentin positivity. Factor XIIIa was focally positive. Actin and S-100 staining were negative. These changes were thought to be consistent with a myxoid pleomorphic fibroma. This is a rare tumor, with only a few reported cases of myxoid variants in the literature to date. The staining pattern of this tumor, along with others in the reported literature, suggest a mesenchymal, fibroblastic origin.

AB  - Subcutaneous swellings uncommonly occur at vaccination or desensitization injection sites and may present long after the procedure. Such lesions can show a range of histopathological appearances that are not well recognized, often leading to erroneous diagnoses. We describe the clinicopathological features of 13 cases (12 adults, 1 child) with subcutaneous swellings presenting at injection sites (upper arm n12, thigh n1). In the cases studied the histological appearances were varied, although predominantly the subcutis was involved. Six cases showed a mixed panniculitis with focal fat necrosis and fibrosis. Four cases demonstrated a pseudolymphomatous pattern, mimicking a B cell lymphoma. One case was reminiscent of lupus profundus and 3 other cases resembled deep granuloma annulare. Importantly, all cases contained histiocytes with violaceous granular cytoplasm, representing ingested aluminium salts employed for adsorption of antigens in the injection preparations. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis in 8 cases confirmed a positive aluminium peak. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed crystalline material in the histiocytes. In conclusion, the spectrum of histological appearances in so called aluminium granuloma can be misleading and it is important to identify the characteristic histiocytes of this condition, for otherwise erroneous diagnoses, with serious clinical implications, can follow.

AB  - Epithelial cysts are commonly encountered in clinical practice, most usually as epidermoid (infundibular) cysts, and trichilemmal (pilar) cysts. A multitude of other cystic structures can arise from the pilosebaceous unit, including dermoid cyst, pilonidal cyst, eruptive vellus hair cyst, steatocystoma, pilomatricoma, as well as eccrine and apocrine hydrocystoma. Epidermoid cysts are thought to derive from the follicular infundibulum, and express keratin 10 but not keratin 17, whereas trichilemmal cysts are believed to derive from the follicular isthmus, and express both keratins 10 and 17. Proliferating follicular cysts generally exhibit trichilemmal keratinization. In addition to the various aforementioned cysts, hybrid cysts have been reported. The majority of hybrid cysts described have been epidermoid-trichilemmal, in which the upper portion of the cyst shows epidermoid keratinization with a sharp transition inferiorly to trichilemmal keratinization. However other hybrid variants have been reported, including epidermoid-pilomatricoma, epidermoid-apocrine hydrocystoma, trichilemmal-pilomatricoma, eruptive vellus hair cyst-steatocystoma, and eruptive vellus hair cyst-trichilemmal cysts. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a proliferating hybrid cyst containing both epidermoid and trichilemmal components, which presented on the scrotum of a 44-year-old man.

AB  - Mycosis fungoides with central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a rare event. Most cases evolve from progressive tumor stage skin disease or CD30 large cell transformation. Cases with CD 30 transformation can show CNS involvement without advanced skin disease. We report a 63 year-old woman with 6 year history of mycosis fungoides with patch and plaque stage disease who developed a single 2.5?cm tumor on the left chest without lymphadenopathy. Histology revealed a dense infiltrate of small atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei. Immunohistochemistry showed CD 4+, CD 43+ and CD 30- staining. Within 2 weeks she developed ataxia and right-sided weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left frontal and brainstem masses. Stereotactic biopsy showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes with large convoluted nuclei. The immunohistochemistry showed a population of CD 4+, CD 43+, Alk-1- cells with CD 30+ transformation. Gene rearrangement studies for the gamma T cell receptor on the skin patch and tumor as well as brain tumor failed to reveal a monoclonal population in any of the specimens. No other areas of involvement were found on complete staging. This case is an example of tumor stage MF with CD 30 transformation and CNS involvement.
