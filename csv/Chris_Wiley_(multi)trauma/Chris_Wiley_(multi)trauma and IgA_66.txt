AB  - We describe here the case of a female patient with an otherwise classic invasive melanoma of the upper extremity, demonstrating the typical immunohistochemical profile, who presented three years later with massive ipsilateral axillary node metastases. The metastatic tumor had morphologic features similar to the primary melanoma, however at immunohistochemical level the tumor cells not only gained expression of pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) but also lost expression of all standard melanoma markers (S100, Melan-A, HMB-45, MIT-1, and tyrosinase) thus mimicking a poorly differentiated mammary carcinoma. Additional stains reveal expression of Vimentin, NSE, c-kit, CD10 and negativity for CK7, CK20, BR2, ER/PR, mucin, and LCA. To rule out a breast carcinoma, real-time RT-PCR was performed on a lymph node using six breast cancer-associated genes (>99% sensitivity), which was also negative. Clinical work-up of the patient failed to reveal abnormal masses in the breast or elsewhere. The clinical history, histological appearance, immunohistochemical profile (including negative CK7 and positive NSE, c-kit and CD10) as well as a negative RT-PCR renders almost null the possibility of a breast carcinoma and supports a diagnostic of melanoma in this case. Cases like ours may be easily misclassified unless a concerted approach is used to reach the correct diagnosis.

AB  - We present a 58-year-old Caucasian man who spawns sebaceous neoplasms with a widely varying histopathologic pattern, the true nature of which were difficult to determine in some of the cases. In a 10-year period, the patient developed over 20 lesions that varied in size, shape, and location. The patient denied a family history of either similar cutaneous lesions or internal malignancies that would fulfill the criteria of Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). Vigilant screening failed to reveal visceral carcinomas. The histopathologic findings of the neoplasms as well as the results of tests for microsatellite instability(MSI) in various tumors and the immunohistochemical staining for the mismatch repair genes (MMR) MSH2 and MLH1 will be discussed. Our patient has been maintained on low-dose isotretinoin since 1995.

AB  - A 53 year old woman with CML in the chronic phase received therapy with Imatinib on two separate occasions. Both occasions were followed by the development of an abrupt onset of skin lesions characterized by painful and tender erythematous plaques and nodules on the upper extremities that subsequently resolved with hyperpigmentation. The patient was also found to have pleural and pericardial effusions. She had a WBC count of 57,250 cells per mm3, a platelet count of 740,000 per mm3 and a single temperature spike of 100.4 Â°F. Over the course of a week the WBC count dropped to 51,520 cells per mm3 but the percent of mature neutrophils rose to 55%. Imatinib was discontinued and steroid therapy led to resolution of the skin lesions with residual pigmentation. A skin biopsy was obtained that showed neutrophilic dermatosis with epidermal sparing consistent with Sweet's syndrome but with atypical features such as extension into deep dermis and subcutaneous fat. Lab work up including blood cultures and bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures of the skin as well as special stains of the skin biopsy specimen failed to reveal any microbiological etiology.

AB  - Skin biopsies of 8 patients diagnosed with herpetic folliculitis by light microscopy were retrieved from the files of the UCSF Dermatopathology Service. Clinical and microscopical features were reviewed and tabulated, and PCR analysis was employed to seek DNA sequences specific for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The study group included 4 women and 4 men, ages 15 to 54. Five patients (62%) were immunosuppressed, with underlying conditions including HIV infection, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus erythematosus with polyarteritis nodosa. Microscopically, herpetic cytopathic changes involved the isthmus in 7/8 cases (87%), and involved the sebaceous apparatus in 4/8 cases (50%). Herpetic viropathic changes were not found within eccrine epithelium. A moderate to dense perifollicular infiltrate, comprised mostly of lymphocytes, was evident in 7/8 cases (87%). After PCR expansion of genetic material extracted from the original paraffin blocks, VZV-specific DNA sequences were detected in 8/8 cases. We conclude that herpetic folliculitis is a consequence of VZV infection. Because follicular herpetic infection is often accompanied by a dense perifollicular lymphoid infiltrate, the microscopical presentation can simulate inflammatory skin diseases such as lupus erythematosus. Level sections may be required for a specific diagnosis to be made.

AB  - Background: The differential diagnosis of intraepidermal neoplasms showing cell clusters and/or single units with upward migration includes Pagets disease, melanoma in-situ, Bowens disease, and Pagetoid reticulosis. Purpose: We describe three cases of Pagets disease of the nipple with melanin pigment uptake by Paget cells. Results: Clinical and pathologic material of three women with biopsy proven Pagets disease of the nipple was reviewed. Clinically, two cases demonstrated an excoriated nipple, one of which also showed a zone of depigmentation. The clinical appearance of the third case was not available. Histologically, each case demonstrated Paget cells singly and in clusters with cytoplasmic uptake of melanin pigment. Melanocytes were found in each case, but were neither increased in number nor showed atypical forms. The dendritic processes of melanocytes were found to encase single Paget cells. Pigment was also found dispersed in the papillary dermis and within melanophages. Conclusions: Melanin pigment uptake by Paget cells represents a significant potential pitfall in ultimately arriving at the correct diagnosis. Misdiagnosing these cases as a melanocytic lesion could potentially delay the management of an underlying breast cancer. Careful examination of melanocyte and melanin distribution with respect to Paget cells is warranted in such cases.

AB  - We present a case of a male infant born to a 21 year-old mother without significant past medical history. Clinically, he presented with diffuse bullae and thickened patches of yellow to brown skin exhibiting Darier?s Sign. This condition affected the infant?s entire integument. There was also mild hepatosplenomegaly, detected radiologically. Blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy were normal. The differential diagnosis, clinically, included diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, bullous genodermatosis, epidermolysis bullosa, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, incontinentia pigmenti, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Histologically, there was a proliferation of mast cells within the papillary and reticular dermis, which exhibited positivity with Leder staining, thereby confirming the diagnosis of diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. Mastocytosis is a condition characterized by mast cell hyperplasia in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Diffuse cutaneous matocytosis is a rare subset limited to the skin. It occurs in about two percent of cases of mastocytosis and usually affects children before the age of three. This case, although extremely rare, gives an excellent overview of the differential diagnosis of bullous lesions in the pediatric population.

AB  - We report two unrelated infants that presented for evaluation of large dermal plaques that histologically resembled dermatofibromas. The clinical appearance and histochemical staining, however, support a myofibroblastic origin of the neoplasms. The patients were a 13 month old female with a slowly growing, pink, firm, irregular plaque that was first noticed at 3 months of age, and an 11 month old boy who presented with a pruritic, slowly growing, irregular, nodular plaque that was noticed shortly after birth. MRI revealed no extension of tumor into deeper subcutaneous tissues in either infant. Both infants had normal growth and development. Biopsies of both infants? plaques revealed spindle cell neoplasms dissecting through collagen bundles throughout the entire dermis with overlying psoriasiform epidermal hyplerplasia. The spindle cells were predominantly haphazardly arranged but in a few areas were arranged in small fascicles. Both tumors stained positively for Factor XIIIa and were focally smooth muscle actin positive. Staining for CD34 was negative in both neoplasms. Histologically, both tumors resembled dermatofibromas; however the clinical appearance and positive smooth muscle actin staining best fit with a myofibroblastic neoplasm. The features of this neoplasm and the differential of other spindle cell tumors of infancy will be reviewed.

AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is a common and frequently lethal melanocytic neoplasm that can quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Currently, prognosis is determined by measuring tumor thickness but more reliable markers for metastatic spread are urgently needed. We investigated whether the extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis can predict melanoma metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). We quantified the extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis, as well as other factors, in excised primary tumors and in SLN biopsy samples from 45 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. Primary melanomas from patients whose tumors had metastasized to the SLN, along with their metastastic foci, contained prominent hotspots of increased lymphatic vessel density, compared to non-metastatic tumors. Multivariate risk analysis revealed that the lymphatic vascular area (LVA) of primary melanomas, an index of tumor lymphangiogenesis, was the most sensitive prognostic marker for SLN metastasis, and was even able to more accurately predict which tumors would become metastatic to SLN than measuring tumor thickness. The extent of tumor lymphangiogenesis is a highly sensitive (83%) and specific (89%) prognostic marker of lymph node metastasis. Assessment of lymphangiogenesis in primary melanomas may be a more effective approach than measuring tumor thickness in selecting patients with early metastatic disease for aggressive therapy.

AB  - Srcasm, a Src activating and signaling molecule, is a recently discovered substrate of the Src family kinase, Fyn. Although Srcasm can bind downstream signaling molecules, such as Grb2 and the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the physiologic role of Srcasm is unknown. Because Fyn is believed to promote keratinocyte differentiation, we hypothesized that Srcasm may also promote keratinocyte differentiation and, thus, antagonize squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) formation. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine if Srcasm expression was decreased in SCC?s and actinic keratoses (AK). Using immunohistochemisty with a polyclonal affinity-purified anti-Srcasm antibody, we evaluated the expression of Srcasm in parafin imbedded sections of AK, SCC in-situ (SCIS), and SCC from up to 15 different patients each. The expression of Srcasm in these lesions was compared to normal peri-lesional skin of the same biopsy specimen or normal skin from separate biopsies. We found that Srcasm expression was decreased in approximately 50% of the AK and SCC-IS samples and in over 90% of the SCC samples. This increased prevalence of Srcasm downregulation from pre-malignant to less differentiated malignant lesions, supports our hypothesis that Srcasm, by functioning downstream of Fyn, may promote keratinocyte differentiation.

AB  - The hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is the most common method used worldwide for routine pathologic evaluation of tissue specimens. Evaluation of cutaneous specimens frequently requires differentiation of elastic fibers, melanin, hemosiderin, fungal elements, mast cells and depositions. For this reason, we used acid-orcein and Giemsa (AOG) stain to evaluate various skin disorders to determine the extent of utility of this infrequently reported stain. As expected, AOG stain functioned well as an elastic fiber stain, highlighting loss of elastic fibers in areas of scar and in disorders such as anetoderma. In pigmentary disorders, AOG stains melanin a dark green to greenish-black pigment while hemosiderin remained yellow-brown to light green color. Fungal hyphae in superficial dermatophytosis and leishmania organisms stained a deep blue. Amyloid stained a ?sky? blue color in macular, lichenoid and nodular amyloid cases. The granules of mast cells stain purple in cases of urticaria pigmentosa and mastocytomas. Dermal mucin stained metachromatic lavender. Due to the multifunctional nature of the AOG stain, this simple technique can improve dermatopathologic diagnosis while decreasing the number of special stains necessary to have available in the laboratory setting.

AB  - Since many studies have shown the discordant diagnoses of melanocytic lesions among pathologists despite the existence of an established histologic criteria, we sought to refine the histologic criteria by finding an additional reliable and reproducible objective histopathologic feature, to aid in the diagnosis of melanoma in situ. We performed a retrospective analysis of 100 cases, histologically diagnosed as melanoma in situ and compared to a study control group consisting of junctional benign melanocytic nevi. The epidermis of all the melanocytic lesions were examined for epidermal effacement. Examination of the epidermis in the study group revealed absence of epidermal effacement in only seven (10%) cases, whereas ninety-three (93%) cases showed absence of rete ridges in some foci, making this an overwhelming majority finding in the cases examined. These results serve as a compelling adjunctive finding that can be used to increase the histologic diagnostic accuracy of melanoma in situ.

AB  - Polypoid lesions arising at ileostomy sites are uncommon and include inflammatory polyps related to prolapse and neoplastic polyps. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma arising at an ileostomy site is rare and usually occurs in longstanding ulcerative colitis. An 82-year-old woman presented with an erythematous 1.5?cm polyp at the mucocutaneous junction of her ileostomy. Her history is significant for a cystectomy with ileal loop 23 years earlier for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. She had no prior history of ulcerative colitis. Histologically, a polypoid lesion was produced by variable-sized cystic spaces filled with mucin and lined by columnar epithelium with goblet cells. The epithelial cells demonstrated cytological atypia and occasional mitotic figures were observed. Smaller neoplastic glands infiltrated the dermis and scattered, multiple epidermotropic foci were noted. We present an unusual case of a primary mucinous adenocarcinoma with multiple epidermotropic foci arising at an ileostomy site in a patient without a known history of ulcerative colitis. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma arising at an ileostomy site is a rare occurrence described primarily in the gastrointestinal literature but could easily be unrecognized by a dermatopathologist. Knowledge of this phenomenon may prove helpful in arriving at the correct diagnosis.

AB  - The immunohistochemical profile of hidradenocarcinoma, defined here as the malignant counterpart of hidradenoma, has not been well characterised. We evaluated the staining pattern of six cases of hidradenocarcinoma using antibodies to gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), S-100 protein, keratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, bcl-1, bcl-2, and Ki67. All tumours were poorly circumscribed with clefting between tumour and stroma, evidence of poroid cells and cuticular cells, decapitation secretion, and increased mitoses with cords of tumour infiltrating through the adjacent desmoplastic stroma. The tumours stained with antibodies to CEA, S-100 protein, GCDFP-15, and EMA in no consistent pattern. All tumours studied stained positively for keratin AE1/3 and cytokeratin 5/6. Ki67 and p53 staining were strongly positive in 5 of 6 tumours. Bcl-1 and bcl-2 staining were variable. Our study demonstrates that hidradenocarcinomas may have both apocrine and eccrine features within the same tumour and suggests that it may be most accurate to consider that these tumours originate from apoeccrine structures or stem cells with the capacity for pluripotential differentiation.

AB  - A 27-year-old woman presented with a 5?mm papule on her cheek. She had no family history or stigmata of neurofibromatosis. Biopsy showed a diffuse dermal proliferation of spindle cells embedded in a slightly myxomatous stroma which entrapped adnexae. They displayed cytologic atypia with hyperchromatic nuclei and bizarre multinucleated giant cells. No mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemistry showed the spindle cells to be S-100 and collagen IV positive, but MART-1 negative. The differential diagnosis included desmoplastic melanoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and atypical neurofibroma. Both atypical neurofibroma and desmoplastic melanoma are S-100 positive, show variable atypia and can have bizarre multinucleated giant cells. However, the lack of epidermal melanocytic hyperplasia, mitosis and the positive collagen type IV staining, favor nerve sheath differentiation. In neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas may undergo malignant degeneration resulting in MPNST. Whether atypical neurofibroma represents a transitional stage is unknown. Mitotic activity and necrosis strongly suggest MPNST. The biologic potential of cutaneous atypical neurofibroma has not been well studied, but they appear to behave in a benign fashion. This case demonstrates the diagnostic challenge of atypia in neurofibromas and highlights the need for further studies on the behavior of these rare variants.

AB  - Metastasis to the breast from extramammary neoplasms is rare. Such metastatic neoplasms can mimic inflammatory breast carcinoma clinically and histologically, presenting a diagnostic challenge. A 50-year-old woman with a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma in clinical remission presented with rapid onset unilateral breast swelling with warmth and erythema. Based upon the clinical presentation, an underlying breast carcinoma was suspected. A punch biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with extensive involvement of the dermal lymphatics. The clinical and histologic differential diagnosis included inflammatory carcinoma secondary to a primary breast carcinoma vs. metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast. To resolve this question, immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors and CDX-2 were performed. CDX-2 is an intestinal homeobox gene that is expressed in intestinal epithelium and tumors with intestinal differentiation including esophageal adenocarcinoma. CDX-2 expression has not been reported in breast carcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for CDX-2 but negative for both steroid receptors. The diagnosis of metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma to the skin of the breast was confirmed. This case emphasizes the importance of confirming the tumor lineage in inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. CDX-2 can be a useful tool in establishing a gastrointestinal origin of cutaneous metastases.

AB  - The glomus coccygeum is a vestigial structure related to the canals of Sucquet-Hoyer, an arteriovenous anastomosis surrounded by glomus cells derived from modified smooth muscle and involved in thermoregulation. It is an incidental finding in specimens from the sacral area and may represent a diagnostic challenge to the unaware observer. We present a case of a glomus coccygeum, presenting as a 1.5?mm structure adjacent to a typical pilonidal cyst excised from a 7-month-old boy, that was the subject of a second opinion consultation. The lesion showed small to medium sized clusters of predominantly epithelioid cells with moderate amounts of clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, intercellular borders and plump, round nuclei with fine chromatin. These cells were closely associated with small vascular channels and nerves. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the epithelioid cells expressed vimentin, muscle-specific actin, neuron-specific enolase, and S-100 protein, were weakly positive for smooth muscle actin, and negative for desmin, synaptophysin and chromogranin. The endothelial cells of the vascular channels were antibody CD31 positive. Recognition of the histological features of glomus coccygeum is important to avoid confusion with glomus tumor and neural or smooth muscle neoplasms in the sacral area.

Our goal was to analyze laminin-5 expression in melanocytic lesions and evaluate its role in tumor progression. Design: Immunohistochemical staining for laminin-5 was performed on 101 cutaneous melanocytic lesions including 41 nevi, 31 primary melanomas, and 29 metastatic melanomas. A standard immunoperoxidase technique (ABC) was used with DAB chromagen and a primary monoclonal antibody to the laminin-5 gamma2 chain (clone D4B5, 1:50, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Any degree of staining in melanoma cells or at the tumor-stromal interface was considered positive. Results: Positive staining for laminin-5 was observed in three of the primary melanomas (10.7%), three of the metastatic melanomas (10.3%), and none of the nevi. In primary melanomas, staining was observed predominately at the tumor-stromal interface. In metastatic lesions, staining was observed around individual melanoma cells and melanoma cell nests.Conclusion: Expression of laminin-5 was detected in a small percentage of primary and metastatic melanomas and in none of the nevi studied. Laminin-5 expression does not appear to be essential for the development of melanomas or their metastases.

AB  - The patient is an eight-year-old white male with a prior history of a small bowel transplant secondary to gastroschisis and a history of chronic rejection. He was admitted to the hospital to rule out rejection of his second small bowel transplant. During the admission he developed painful erythematous plaques with necrosis and hemorrhagic bullae on his left knee and left neck. Dermatology was consulted and biopsies and tissue cultures were obtained. On H&E there were multiple thick walled non-septate hyphae and the GMS stain showed right angle irregular branching hyphae with an affinity for blood vessels. A further work-up for disseminated disease was negative. The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous mucormycosis. The patient underwent extensive surgical debridement and was started on Ambisone and treated for six months with resolution. Primary cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic deep fungal infection. It is the most acute and fatal of all fungal infections. There are multiple associated conditions including immunosuppression. This disease can be controlled with early diagnosis and a combination treatment plan. There are only a few reported cases in the pediatric population.

AB  - Distinguishing among the various melanocytic proliferations remains one of the biggest challenges in dermatopathology. New insights into tumor proliferation may lead to the discovery of helpful immunohistochemical markers. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase which is a core component of the PI3K signalling pathway. Activation of Akt is seen in many human cancers. This study evaluated Akt activation (phospho-Akt) by immunohistochemistry on 18 intradermal nevi, 8 dysplastic nevi, 9 Spitz nevi, and 27 melanomas. Immunostaining was graded 0 (no staining), 1 (slightly positive), 2 (moderately positive), and 3 (highly positive). The mean immunostaining scores were as follows: intradermal nevi 1.16, dysplastic nevi 1.25, Spitz nevi 2.11, and melanomas 2.15. Spitz nevi exhibited significant pAkt immunoreactivity. Increased pAkt immunoreactivity is seen in melanomas and Spitz nevi as compared to benign intradermal nevi and dysplastic nevi.

AB  - A sixty-nine-year-old male patient, without a significant prior medical history, presented with a rapidly enlarging, 2?cm non-tender nodule on the right lower eyelid. The lesion persisted in spite of an incision and drainage. Following an excision, the histology revealed a diffuse infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells within the dermis. The cells were large, monomorphic, with irregular to convoluted nuclei, prominent nucleoli, amphophilic cytoplasm. They were very mitotically active. Immunohistochemical stains for CD45, CD3, and CD30 were strongly positive. Pancytokeratin, CD20, and ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase fusion protein) were negative. The histopathologic diagnosis was CD30 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The margin was positive for involvement by lymphoma. The lesion was re-excised with no evidence of residual involvement by lymphoma. A primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma was favored over systemic involvement based on the clinical presentation of a single eyelid nodule and ALK negativity. He was referred to a hematology-oncologist for further management. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a distinctive type of malignant lymphoma with a relatively favorable prognosis. It frequently involves the skin, however, to the best of our knowledge, presentation of this lymphoma type as a single lesion on the eyelid is extremely rare.
