AB  - A 77-year-old white male presented to an outpatient clinic with painful, purpuric macules and papules on his right foot. The patient had recently undergone cardiac catheterization via his right femoral artery. The patient had no other complaints, was afebrile, and generally felt well. The clinical impression was either cholesterol emboli versus vasculitis. A 4?mm punch biopsy was obtained. Histopathology showed a vasculitis with many basophilic organisms consistent with bacteria present within the vascular spaces. There was a perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and neutrophils. A gram stain revealed gram-positive cocci. The clinician was immediately notified and blood cultures were drawn and echocardiogram performed. The cultures grew staphylococcus aureus. While no evidence of endocarditis was found, a psuedoaneurysm of the right femoral artery was noted. Despite rapid admission and treatment, the patient subsequently expired.

AB  - An 85 year-old woman presented with two pearly papules on her left cheek. The clinical impression was BCC. Biopsy revealed a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes emanating from the epidermis and extending beyond the papillary dermis. A diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered. Excison with frozen section margin control was performed. Permanent sections revealed melanoma, at least 2.06?mm in depth, with melanoma in situ extending to all peripheral margins. Upon re-examination of the initial biopsies, pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia (PEH) with marked squamous atypia was noted. Intimately admixed with the squamous proliferation was a growth of large malignant epithelioid cells. The epitheliod cells lacked pigment production and extended to the shave biopsy margins. This second population of cells was strongly S-100 positive, diagnostic for amelanotic verrucous melanoma. A revised diagnosis of verrucous malignant melanoma, Clark level III, 0.82?mm in depth was rendered. The patient?s course was complicated by multiple positive surgical margins and she ultimately received XRT. This case spotlights the rare occurrence of PEH in conjunction with melanoma. PEH can mask the underlying melanoma and lead to a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. As demonstrated, immunostaining is essential in diagnosis of this difficult tumor.

AB  - Physicians of various specialties submit cases for histopathological examination. Using the dermatopathology report as an objective verification tool of clinical diagnostic accuracy we assessed the diagnostic abilities of nondermatologist physicians, who performed various types of skin biopsies, and compared them with those of dermatologists. In total, 4,451 cases were analyzed. Dermatologists diagnosed twice the number of neoplastic and cystic skin lesions correctly (75%) than nondermatologists (40%). The clinical diagnosis rendered by family practitioners matched only in 26% the histopathological diagnosis. Plastic surgeons did better than family physicians but still had a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 45% for skin tumors. Inflammatory skin diseases were correctly diagnosed in 71% of the cases by dermatologists but in only 34% of the cases by nondermatologists. In our view, it is appropriate for nondermatologists to perform skin biopsies only, if they have required sufficient knowledge in basic dermatology and dermatopathology. A skin biopsy consists not only of the technical aspects of the actual procedure but necessitates an understanding of basic dermatology and dermatopathology to facilitate clinicopathological correlation.

AB  - We present a case of a sixty-one-year-old Hispanic man with multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Facial papules and nodules appeared around age five, increasing in number with age. Two BCCs were diagnosed and treated elsewhere, one of which prompted enucleation of the left eye and radiation therapy to that area at age fifty. Physical examination showed nodules (0.5 to 2.5?cm in size) on the scalp, face, ears, arms and the upper back. Biopsies from such tumors demonstrated three histological patterns: pure trichoepithelioma, trichoepithelioma with unequivocal BCC, and basaloid neoplasms of uncertain histogenesis. The trichoepithelioma shows the typical pattern: hair papillae, cystic, retiform basaloid cells and abundant stroma. The BCCs, which were often admixed with the trichoepitheliomas, were nodular type with peripheral palisading, stromal retraction, central confluent necrosis and adenoid features. The basaloid neoplasm of uncertain histogenesis showed cords and nests of basaloid cells without follicular differentiation. Immunohistochemically BCC?s areas showed more uniform and stronger staining for BCL-2 than in trichoepithelioma though the latter showed papillary mesenchymal staining. No significant difference was observed for Ber-EP4 and CD34. We conclude this may represent a unique malignant degeneration or a contiguous gene syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma patients without lymph node metastases (Stage II) have a variable five-year survival. The influence of falsely negative lymph nodes on this variability is unknown. DESIGN: The Poisson distribution describes the probability of finding no positive lymph nodes when a certain number are examined. Using this model, we analysed lymph node dissection results from 780 patients with melanoma and published survival results for Stage II patients. RESULTS: In the 294 patients without positive nodes, 18% had fewer than 7 nodes examined. The Poisson probability of finding no positive nodes when 1 to 6 were examined ranged from 0.4 to to 0.8 (mean 0.6). We partitioned survival for stage II into two categories: those with truly negative nodes with a five-year survival of 80% and those with a five-year survival matching Stage III (46%). The observed five-year survival of 77% in Stage II patients implied that the fraction with false negative nodes was also 18%, which corresponded with the subgroup with fewer than 7 nodes examined. CONCLUSION: The Poisson model suggests that the variable survival in Stage II patients may reflect the incorrect staging of patients with stage III melanoma who have limited numbers of lymph nodes examined.

AB  - Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. On occasion, KS may histologically mimic pyogenic granulomas (PG), a common benign vascular tumor of the skin. Using immunoperoxidase stains, we examined 28 PG and 4 PG-like KS for HHV-8 to determine the specificity of positive staining in this setting. All PG-like KS demonstrated nuclear staining for HHV-8. No staining was identified in any of the PG. Furthermore, histologic criteria often used to differentiate between these two entities were not helpful in difficult cases. The only distinguishing features were the presence/absence of HHV-8 staining and, in some cases, clinical history. The presence of HHV-8 nuclear staining appears to be a specific marker for KS when comparing PG and PG-like KS. Given the lack of distinguishing morphologic criteria, we suggest performing immunoperoxidase stains for HHV-8 on any PG occurring in a clinically atypical setting.

AB  - CD99, also known as p30/32, is a glycoprotein product of the MIC2 gene, which is located on the short arm of both chromosome X and Y. This transmembrane protein was originally utilized in immunohistochemistry as a unique marker for Ewing sarcoma, other primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and more recently in a wide variety of tumors. It?s expression in malignant melanoma (MM) has not been well documented. A recent study at our institution demonstrated membranous staining in approximately 61% of primary MM. As CD99 is expressed by hematopoeitic cells, it has been proposed as a mechanism for lymphocytes to gain access to the vasculature.1 This study is designed to determine if CD99 expression in melanoma cells has a similar role using cases of metastatic MM from our archives. Our evaluation shows that 13 of 28 cases (46.4%) demonstrated membranous CD99 staining. A case of this magnitude has not been previously reported.? Reference: 1.

AB  - Texts and atlases have limitations when used to teach dermatopathology to trainees: they can be tedious and time-consuming to use, image detail is limited, text and figure legends can be ambiguous, and only a minor degree of image annotation (letters, arrows, lines outlining important features) is possible. A video screen recording software program (Camtasia Studio) has been used to create high quality digital audio and video dermatopathology tutorials. The screen recording program is started with the image window being recorded. Audio narration (USB digital microphone) is recorded along with live drawings of annotating lines outlining important histologic features, creating the effect of a ?digital chalkboard? being used by the instructor. Separate clips of each ?chalkboard annotation? with accompanying narration can be combined to create a seamless movie detailing each of the important histopathologic features leading to a specific dermatopathologic diagnosis. Video dermatopathology tutorials are extremely effective because they closely mimic instruction at the microscope. However, they offer the significant advantage of allowing remote teaching at any time or place convenient for the learner. Tutorials can be compressed into a variety of multimedia formats and streamed for web delivery or can be provided on CD for distribution.

AB  - Background: Shadow cells are characteristic of pilomatricoma, a distinct neoplasm of hair matrix differentiation. Shadow cells within an otherwise classic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been referred to as ?BCC with matrical differentiation?. We present a case of BCC with matrical differentiation in a transplant patient. To our knowledge, none have been reported arising on the background of immunosuppression. Methods: A 58-year-old male cardiac transplant patient had a left hand nodule, which was excised and submitted for routine histologic review. Results: The lesion revealed multiple basaloid tumor masses. In some areas, there was peripheral palisading with stromal retraction artifact, typical of basal cell carcinoma, extending into the deep reticular dermis. The tumor also contained a population of shadow cells, similar to those in pilomatricoma, with basaloid cells in the periphery. Trichohyaline granules were identified in many of the tumor cells. These granules are a hallmark of follicular matrix differentiation. Mitoses were rare. There was no evidence of an infiltrating growth pattern. Conclusion: Basal cell carcinoma with matrical differentiation is a rare subtype of basal cell carcinoma featuring shadow cells, such as those typically seen in pilomatricoma. This tumor has not yet been reported in an immunosuppressed transplant patient.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated the utility of D2?40 as a marker for lymphatic endothelium and can be used for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials. We studied 13 capillary hemangiomas: kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH, 2), acquired tufted angioma (ATA, 5), juvenile hemangioma (JH, 2), granuloma pyogenicum (GP, 4); 6 other hemangiomas: cavernous hemangioma (3), arterio-venous hemangioma (1), angiokeratoma (1), epithelioid hemangioma (1); Kaposi?s sarcoma (1); 12 lymphangiomas: lymphangioma circumscriptum (6), deep type of cutaneous lymphangioma (6). D2?40 monoclonal antibody, endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, Factor VIII related antigen) and juvenile hemangioma-associated marker GLUT-1 were applied. D2?40 was immunopositive for the peripheral area of proliferative capillaries and negative for surrounding dilated vessels in KH, but positive for surrounding dilated vessels and negative for tufted proliferative capillaries in ATA. KH and ATA were all positive for endothelial markers and negative for GLUT-1. Other hemangiomas were negative for D2?40. Eight of 12 cases were positive for lymphangiomas. Based on these results, D2?40 is a useful additional immunostain for the discrimination of KH and ATA. KH and ATA may originate from different stage of both the lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial lineages.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis is associated with cutaneous melanin pigmentation, but an association with ordinary melanocytic nevi has not been described. This retrospective case-control study was designed to see if neurofibromas in patients with Neurofibromatosis, Type I (NF-1) differ from sporadic neurofibromas (SN) in their incidence of associated melanocytic nevi and other histologic features. Slides from 114 NF-1 were compared with 112 SN. Lentiginous melanocytic nevi were identified over 13 NF-1 (11%) but no SN (p?=?0.00019, Fisher?s test). Compared with other NF-1, NF-1 with nevi were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test), and a greater number of biopsies (p?=?0.04, t-test). Compared with SN, NF-1 were more frequently associated with melanocytic hyperplasia, lentigo simplex-like changes, honeycomb infiltration of the subcutis (p?<?0.001, Chi squared test), plexiform neurofibroma and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (p?<?0.03, Fisher?s test). SN more frequently presented as a polyp or papule (p?<?0.009). Sebaceous hyperplasia (present in 14% of cases), dermal elastosis (9%), lipomatous neurofibroma (8%), epithelial cysts (4%), and keratin granulomas or folliculitis (3%) were equally common in NF-1 and SN. This study suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the potential for melanocytic proliferation in NF-1 compared with SN.

AB  - Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in distinguishing cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (CLMS) from other spindle cell neoplasms. Recently, several new immunohistochemical markers of smooth muscle differentiation (calponin, h-caldesmon) have shown greater utility in the diagnosis of CLMS. We compared the expression of various traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers in CLMS. Thirteen cases of CLMS were immunostained with a panel of antibodies (SMA, MSA, desmin, vimentin, S100, cytokeratin, NSE, HMB-45, CD117, procollagen, h-caldesmon and calponin. Immunostaining was graded from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of positive staining. All 13 cases of CLMS showed positive staining with SMA, MSA and h-caldesmon. 12 cases showed positive staining with desmin, calponin, vimentin and NSE. 8 cases showed positive staining with CD117 and procollagen. 4 and 3 cases showed focal positive staining for S100 and cytokeratin. All cases were HMB-45 negative. All 13 cases exhibited greater than 50% staining with SMA and MSA. 11 cases were strongly positive (>50%) for calponin and h-caldesmon, while only 8 cases were strongly positive for desmin. Our study finds no significant difference between traditional and novel smooth muscle immunostains. We conclude that a panel of immunohistochemical stains should be employed to differentiate CLMS from other spindle cell neoplasms.

AB  - Nonmyeloablative hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a recent alternative to myeloablative HSCT in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains as a complication of both types of HSCT. Recently the clinical phenomenon of late-onset (>100 days) acute GVHD has been described following nonablative HSCT. However, there has been no relevant description of the histologic features of GVHD in this setting. We reviewed clinical and pathologic features of 28 cases of acute and chronic GVHD following nonablative HSCT at out institution between 2000 and 2003. Our results support the observation of late onset acute GVHD in nonablative HSCT. The mean onset of acute GVHD was 109.8 days (range 8?410 days). Furthermore, we identified a subset of patients (8/23) in the acute GVHD group with composite histologic features of both acute and chronic GVHD. This subset was more likely to develop chronic GVHD as compared to patients with only classic acute GVHD, 87.5% versus 25%, respectively (p?<?0.01). Composite histologic features could serve a a predictor of an increased risk for the development of chronic GVHD. These patients may potentially benefit from more aggressive treatment than patients with histologic features of solely acute GVHD.

AB  - Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma typically presents as solitary, well-circumscribed, firm plaques or nodules. We describe a case of cutaneous leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag on the thigh of a 50-year-old male. Histological examination of the lesion revealed a dome-shaped tumor with interlacing fascicles of smooth muscle with pleomorphism, cellular atypia and multiple mitoses. Malignant tumors may rarely present as a skin tag, and these are most frequently basal cell carcinomas. We are unaware of previously reported leiomyosarcoma clinically presenting as a skin tag. This case suggests that solitary, wide-based, papilloma-like lesions or skin tags should be submitted for histologic examination to rule out malignancy.
