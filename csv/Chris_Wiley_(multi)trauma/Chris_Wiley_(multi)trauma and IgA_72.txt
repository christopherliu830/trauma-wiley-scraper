AB  - Background: Sebaceous tumors are adnexal tumors with usually low-gradebehavior. The distinction between sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, especially on small biopsies from sensitive sites (i.e., ocular), may bedifficult. We compared the expression of various oncogenic andprognostic markers by immunohistochemistry in order to distinguishbenign from malignant sebaceous tumors.Design: 10 sebaceous adenomas, 10 sebaceous carcinomas, and 5 cases ofsebaceous hyperplasia, were studied with antibodies directed againstKi-67 (mib-1), bcl-2, p53, p21, p27, c-erb2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, and CD99 (mic2).Results: We found that sebaceous carcinomas differed from sebaceousadenomas by having increased staining for p53 (50% vs 11%) and mib-1(average 1.8+ vs. 1.0+), and significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7%vs 62%) and p21 (16% vs 34%).The other markers did not differ significantly, although there was atrend towards more Her-2/neu staining in the carcinomas. No cases showedany c-kit staining.Conclusions: We have shown that several markers, including mib-1, p53, p21, and bcl-2, are expressed at significantly different levels insebaceous carcinomas versus adenomas, and may be of use indiagnostically challenging cases. Whether or not any of these markerswill prove useful in predicting prognosis remains controversial.

AB  - Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm that typically arises in the pleural cavity but may also be seen at extra-pleural sites including liver, lung, thymus, orbit, soft tissue, and rarely the skin. The diagnosis of cutaneous SFT is challenging due to its histologic variability and lack of distinctive immunophenotype. We report a case of SFT with unusual histologic and immunophenotypic findings. A 23-year-old man presented with a two-year history of a painful, enlarging scalp mass. Histologic examination revealed a variably cellular neoplasm composed of tumor cells with uniform oval nuclei embedded in a collagenous matrix. In areas there was a prominent hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature. The tumor was strongly immunoreactive for CD34 and had some immunoreactivity for S100. The diagnosis of SFT was rendered based upon the histologic features and strong immunoreactivity for CD34. Immunoreactivity for S100 is rarely seen in SFT. The tumor had a mitotic rate of 8/50?hpf. Mitotic rates greater than 5/50?hpf have been associated with aggressive behavior in SFTs of soft tissue. The significance of aggressive histologic attributes with clinical outcome is yet to be determined in cutaneous SFT. Cutaneous SFTs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of superficial spindle cell tumors.

AB  - With the advance of our knowledge and understanding of the molecular basis of the immune system and inflammatory process, biological modulators, such as anti-TNF-alpha antibodies, are increasingly used in the treatment of immune disorders and hematogenous neoplasm. Side effects of those biological modulators, such as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, lichenoid drug reaction, acute folliculitis, and superficial granuloma annulare, have been reported. Recently, we encountered two patients who developed interstitial granulomatous drug reaction while receiving anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. The patients, a 48 year-old male and a 54 year-old female, both have severe rheumatoid arthritis and responded poorly to conventional therapies, received Remicade (Infliximab). Pruritic erythematous skin eruptions developed on the trunk and extremities one month after starting the therapy. The lesions are multiple irritated papules and plaques; some are targetoid, measuring several centimeters, with raised borders. Skin biopsies showed an interstitial granulomatous infiltrate in the mid- and deep dermis. The infiltrate is composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and eosinophils, palisade around degenerating collagen. Pathological diagnosis was drug-induced interstitial granulomatous dermatitis. Discontinuation of Remicade led to resolution of the skin lesions in both patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a drug eruption caused by anti-TNF-alpha antibodies.

AB  - An 8-year-old male presented with several 1?4?cm, indurated, brownish-red nodules with superficial, punctate hemorrhagic crusts localized to the groin, which developed over several weeks. An initial biopsy was consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. A work up, including a chest and abdominal CT scan demonstrated a large mediastinal mass which was diagnosed as precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Treatment with a chemotherapeutic protocol resulted in shrinkage of both the mediastinal and cutaneous lesions. Late in the course of treatment the cutaneous lesions rapidly recurred and spread to various sites. A second skin biopsy showed an extensive diffuse infiltrate of histiocytic-appearing cells extending from the papillary dermis into the superficial subcutis. The cells had markedly pleomorphic, vesicular nuclei and abundant amphophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures were present. The neoplastic cells were S-100 protein and CD1a positive by immunohistochemistry. The histopathologic diagnosis was Langerhans cell sarcoma. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor gamma gene in specimens from both the mediastinal mass and one of the recurrent cutaneous lesions. The sizes of the PCR products were identical demonstrating a clonal relationship between the two neoplasms.

AB  - Expensive telepathology programs are known for long. Instant messaging, in contrast, is a new trend that will permeate serious enterprises, including dermatopathology. We present an adaptation of microscopy to the MSN Messenger that allows simple and instant sharing of images through the Internet. Any digital camera can act as a webcam, even if no picture is taken. Images through a camera tethered to a microscope can be captured into the PC in real time as video. An inexpensive Belkin VideoBus II card (?$50) between the AV cable of the camera and the PC, using an USB port, is used as the capture device (among others). In the MSN Messenger v. 6.1, the Audio/Video Tuning Wizard (from ?Tools?) is notified that the Belkin capture mode will be used as video-composite input. The same card could optionally capture audio from any microphone. The above procedure will produce relatively high quality images in the Messenger image subwindow when the digital camera is activated. The interlocutor can broadcast images back. The only limitation is the relatively small size of the Messenger window. This is an example of current mass-appeal technologies that presage the marriage of teledermatopathology and instant messaging.

AB  - A 52-year-old male with Crohn?s disease presented with florid pustulosis of the face and trunk. Six months prior to presentation, he received amphotericin for pulmonary aspergillosis. Amphotericin was discontinued after five months due to toxicity, and pharmacotherapy was changed to voriconazole. After four weeks of voriconazole, the acneiform eruption occurred which prompted referral to dermatology. Physical examination revealed innumerable 0.5?cm?1.5?cm pustules, cysts, and inflammatory papules concentrated predominantly over the central face, ears, and conjunctiva, but also involving the chest, shoulders, and back. The clinical differential diagnosis included suppurative folliculitis, papulonecrotic tuberculid, cutaneous Crohn?s disease, acne fulminans, and pustular drug eruption. Multiple biopsies demonstrated diffuse neutrophilic and granulomatous dermal inflammation in a predominantly follicular and perifollicular distribution. Microorganisms were not identified by either histology or culture. The histologic differential diagnosis included cutaneous Crohn?s disease and pustular drug eruption. Voriconazole was discontinued with gradual clearing of the skin lesions. Three months later, worsening of the pulmonary disease necessitated restarting voriconazole. A recurrent pustular eruption, similar to the original eruption, occurred within weeks and subsequently cleared upon discontinuation of voriconazole. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of a voriconazole induced pustular drug eruption.

AB  - Acetylglucosoaminyltransferase V (GNTV), an enzyme responsible for branching of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Beta1?6 branched oligosaccharides, detected with the lectin, LPHA, are associated with tumor progression in human breast and colon cancer. They were found to be common to 22 types of human cancers, and were particularly expressed in metastases. Matriptase is a proteolytic inducer of both the HGF/cmet and plasminogen activator pathways, highly associated with metastasis. A potential prometastatic effect of GNTV was found to be due to modification of active matriptase by adding beta1?6 GlcNAc branching. We investigated expression of LPHA, matriptase and GNTV in pathology specimens of primary invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas. Sequential sections were stained with anti-GnT-V, anti-matriptase, or biotinylated LPHA. Our results showed variable staining patterns, from involving only small regions, to encompassing the entire tumor. The expression of all three markers was closely associated, suggesting that metastatic pathways might have been activated in the staining areas of these tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of matriptase expression in malignant melanoma, as well as the first demonstration of an association between matriptase, GNTV and beta 1,6-branched oligosaccharides in vivo.

AB  - A 41 year-old man presented with an atrophic, hyperpigmented plaque on the right lower abdomen present since?birth?. He denied any prior activity at the site, and had been told it was a ?scar? from a prenatal insult. Six months earlier, he developed idiopathic focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis and was placed on 70?mg prednisone per day. He had not demonstrated evidence of lupus eythematosus. Shortly after beginning this regimen, erythematous and tender papules developed around the quiescent plaque. He had tapered his prednisone dose to 60?mg per day, but additional papules continued to erupt. An ellipse biopsy was performed which included a portion of the atrophic plaque and several surrounding papules. Histological examination revealed a proliferation of fibrohistiocytes between and amongst collagen bundles. In some areas, fibrohistiocytes entrapped collagen in a fashion reminiscent of a dermatofibroma. In other areas, particularly that of the atrophic plaque, the fibrohistiocytes were less numerous and more delicate in appearance. Scattered rudimentary fascicles were demonstrated. Adnexal structures were preserved. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the fibrohistiocytes to be positive for factor XIIIa and actin, but negative for desmin, CD34, S-100, procollagen I, and CD68. This lesion demonstrated unique clinical/histiological aspects not well characterized in the literature.

AB  - Lipedematous alopecia is a rare entity of uncertain etiology characterized by a diffusely thickened and boggy scalp, with varying degrees of alopecia. Six of eight cases in the literature have occurred in African American women. Classic histopathologic findings include increased subcutaneous tissue, varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis, and an absence of significant mucin deposition. Herein, we report an additional case of lipedematous alopecia occurring in an African American woman who also demonstrated clinical, historical, and histopathologic findings reminiscent of discoid lupus erythematosus. Explicit observation of such an occurrence has not been made previously, although hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, mild perivascular or periadnexal infiltrates, and fibrosing alopecia have been reported in lipedematous scalp, possibly the residua of other cases with associated discoid lupus-like features. For further comparison, we contrast our case with a second patient with lipedematous scalp, which maintained histological similarities to lipedematous alopecia, but was lacked any significant hair loss. It is possible that some cases lipedematous alopecia may represent an unusual sequela of discoid lupus erythematosus. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of two diseases occurring independently, nor that early changes of lipedematous alopecia might share histopathological and/or clinical findings with discoid lupus erythematosus.

AB  - We have reviewed sixteen patients with the diagnosis of desmoplastic Spitz nevus. The age of our patients ranged between seven years and fifty-four years. We noted a predominance of twelve female patients and four male patients. Histologically, ten of the sixteen cases were well circumscribed and symmetric. In six cases we were unable to ascertain the overall architectural features because of the biopsy technique. Only three cases showed significant junctional melanocytic nesting. In five cases there were rare nests of melanocytes at the dermo-epidermal junction and in eight cases there was no evidence of melanocytic nesting at the dermo-epidermal junction. Dermal mitotic figures were rare, with five cases showing a single dermal mitotic figure. The lesions did not arise in sun damaged skin as evidenced by the rarity of actinic elastosis within our specimens. Additional clinical and histologic findings and follow up will be reported.

AB  - Cutaneous adnexal tumors manifesting divergent differentiation are a rare but recognized subset of adnexal neoplasms. We present a 42-year-old woman with a cystic tumor of the skin above the left eyebrow. A biopsy revealed a tumor comprising eccrine tubules lined by a single row of columnar epithelium surrounded by a peripheral small cuboidal layer and containing, adhered to the internal cuticle, mucin-like material. In some areas, the eccrine tubules were associated with sheets of small plasmacytoid myoepithelial cells embedded in a chondroid matrix. Elsewhere, there were cysts containing central keratinous debris associated with a peripheral basaloid epithelial proliferation showing the formation of buds mimicking abortive hair follicle structures. No polarizable terminal or vellus hairs were seen. These two elements were geographically separate in the biopsy but collided in the center of the tissue element. A diagnosis of benign cutaneous mixed tumor with combined folliculosebaceous and eccrine differentiation was rendered. Such tumors present a diagnostic challenge and are frequently confused with neoplasms including the benign mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma) and a variety of eccrine and folliculosebaceous neoplasms and harmatomata. This case illustrates the potential multilineage differentiation of pluripoential germinative cells of the cutaneous adnexae.

AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a small round cell tumor which does not characteristically stain with S-100 protein. We report a case of an 83 year-old male with a two-month history of an ulcerated nodule on the right arm. Histopathology revealed small blue round cells arrayed in a trabecular pattern and in diffuse sheets, with scattered mitoses and necrosis. The cells were negative for vimentin, positive for NSE, focally positive for high molecular weight cytokeratins and diffusely positive for low molecular weight cytokeratins, including CK20. The findings were diagnostic of MCC, however, foci of S-100 protein positive cells were also present in the tumor. Upon reviewing cases from Skin Pathology Laboratory at BUSM received between 1/1/2000 to 7/30/2004, we documented a total of 34 cases diagnosed as MCC; 24 were stained with S-100 protein and this case was the only one that stained positively. S-100 protein positivity of MCC, while having been previously reported, is an uncommon finding. We report our case to stress the importance of morphological and immunoperioxidase features for the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, particularly in the exceptional cases which exhibit S-100 protein positivity.

AB  - A five-month old girl presented with a 5?cm brown patch on her right lower leg. The lesion had a 6?mm area of hyperpigmentation that was removed by shave biopsy for pathologic diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis at the time was that of congenital nevus but the multicolored appearance of the lesion raised the index of suspicion for melanoma. Histology revealed junctional activity with melanocytes distributed in the dermis including migration around appendages and among collagen bundles as seen in congenital nevi. However, there were some unusual features that warranted careful analysis. The lesion was asymmetric, with numerous single melanocytes in confluence at the dermo-epidermal interface. Single cells and nests were noted in the epidermis. Our case illustrates a congenital nevus with atypical patterns easily confused with those of melanoma. Our lesion exhibited pagetoid melanocytes, which is considered virtually diagnostic of melanoma. However, these melanocytes were monomorphous as opposed to the pleomorphic appearance found in melanoma. Additionally, there was evidence of cellular maturation in the dermis as well as a lack of variance in nest size, which favors the diagnosis of congenital nevus1.

AB  - While cell cycle markers have been used to differentiate benign versus malignant lesions and to classify malignant lesions, benign keratoses have not been well studied using such markers, and the relation of the cell cycle to inflammation or irritation of benign keratoses is unclear. We compared the immunohistochemical staining patterns of 10 seborrheic keratoses, 10 inflamed seborrheic keratoses, and 10 inverted follicular keratoses using antibodies to p53, bcl-1, and bcl-2. Staining with antibodies to p53 was increased in inverted follicular keratoses compared to inflamed or non-inflamed seborrheic keratoses. Bcl-1 staining was similar in all lesions. A population of bcl-2-positive dendritic cells was seen within the epidermal portion of inverted follicular keratoses. Keratinocyte bcl-2 staining was higher in seborrheic keratoses compared to the other two keratoses. Bcl-2 may be increased in seborrheic keratoses as an anti-apoptotic mechanism while increased p53 may trigger apoptosis in inverted follicular keratoses.

AB  - The histopathologic differential diagnosis of subepidermal blisters is broad and most commonly includes primary dermatologic diseases (i.e. bullous pemphigoid), secondary blistering conditions (i.e. bullous lichen planus), and drug reactions (i.e. toxic epidermal necrolysis); however, when examining blister specimens taken during autopsy, several other entities need to be added to the differential diagnosis. For one year, we biopsied cutaneous blisters and erosions found during autopsies performed at the Dallas County Medical Examiner?s Office and examined them histologically. The objective of this study was to determine the primary cause of blisters and erosions seen at autopsy, characterize them histologically in order to allow differentiation from other blistering conditions, and emphasize causes of subepidermal blisters that are often not considered in the differential diagnosis. We present eight representative cases in order to illustrate the following points. The majority of blisters and erosions examined were subepidermal and secondary to physical causes, such as burns, defibrillation, submersion, fetal maceration, and decomposition. Although primary skin conditions need to be considered when examining blisters and erosions at autopsy, the most common entities are secondary to physical causes, and these need to be included in the differential diagnosis in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Soft tissue chondroma is a rare lesion that has been reported in various organs including brain, nasopharynx, larynx, lung, esophagus, liver, urinary bladder, fallopian tube, skin, and oral mucosa. We report a chondroma occurred on the tongue of a 38-year-old-woman. She presented with an asymptomatic, several-millimeter, firm papule on the lateral border of the tongue. She had been healthy otherwise, and the lesion had been present for about 9 to 10 months without change in size. Possibility of sialolith was considered clinically. Microscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed, lobular, subepithelial lesion composed of mature hyaline cartilage. No cytologic atypia of chondrocytes was noted. The overlying squamous mucosa was unremarkable. Chondromas may occur in association with Maffucci?s syndrome, Ollier?s disease, CREST syndrome, and Carney?s triad. However, in most cases, such as in this case, it is solitary and not associated with the preceding entities.

AB  - Rosai-Dorfman disease, or sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML), is a rare benign disease of unknown etiology that involves the cervical lymph nodes. Histologic findings include emperiopolesis of lymphocytes and S-100 protein positivity. Extranodal involvement occurs in 30?40% of cases, often involving skin. However, cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease without lymph node involvement is uncommon. We describe a case of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease and discuss its clinical and histopathologic findings. A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented with a two-year history of a slowly enlarging violaceous mass on the mid-upper abdomen. He had a history of renal cell carcinoma two-year ago and was asymptomatic without any systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed a large, violaceous mass of mid-upper abdomen with several violaceous nodules surrounding the periphery. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Punch biopsy showed diffuse dermal infiltrates composed of central xanthomatous cells surrounded by lymphoplasmacytic cells. Focal germinal center was noted. Immunostaining revealed strong S-100 and CD68 reactivity of central xanthomatous cells and kappa and lambda polyclonal lymphoplasmacytic cells. Special stains for infectious disorder were negative. Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease is a benign reactive process, often under-recognized due to lack of systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy. A high index of diagnostic awareness is required for its recognition.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a rare and recently described disease which occurs in patients with a history of renal disease and is often associated with hemodialysis or renal transplants. The usual presentation is multiple indurated plaque lesions resembling scleromyxedema on the extremities and trunk. Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy has been described in association with calciphylaxis and metastatic calcification, however, to our knowledge, the occurrence of osteoid metaplasia has not been previously reported. We report a case of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy with osteoid metaplasia in a 78-year-old female patient with chronic renal failure on dialysis. The patient had a relatively acute onset (a few months) of lesions with irritation and pruritis of the lower extremities. Biopsies showed fibrous thickening of the dermis with islands of osteoid tissue with osteoblastic rimming. Calcification and lamellar bone formation were not seen. An Alcian blue stain demonstrated increased dermal mucin. Elastic stains showed prominent elongated elastic fibers between collagen fibers and within osteoid areas. The differential diagnosis included scleromyxedema and other fibrotic disorders. The pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown. Although rare patients improve with correction of renal abnormalities, currently no effective treatment is available.

AB  - Spectral Imaging Microscopy (SIM) is a technique for performing image-enabled spectroscopic analysis using a standard light microscope. We employed a prototype to a current, commercially available, spectral imaging system (NuanceTM, CRI, Inc.) that electro-optically selects narrow bands of light to be collected by a cooled, monochrome CCD camera. For each sample, images were taken every 10?nm from 420?nm to 720?nm to create a spectral image ?stack.? Analysis of the images with a prototype to the Nuance TM Analyze software (CRI, Inc.) gave both standard color (RGB) and spectral information at each pixel of the images. A representative 40x field was spectrally imaged from H&E slides of 104 biopsy specimens of mycosis fungoides (MF). Optical densities and spectral properties of small lymphocytes were determined. Hyperchromatic cells were pseudocolored to show their distribution. In addition to the important architectural features of MF, SIM can define whether hyperchromatic or normochromatic small lymphocytes are epidermotropic in the lesion by setting appropriate threshold values. Hyperchromasia can be attributed to increased nuclear eosinophilia or basophilia. These differences are difficult to estimate by eye. Since lymphoblasts have enlarged nuclei with dispersed chromatin, a combination of spectral and spatial data is required for their analysis.

AB  - Porocarcinomas are thought to be differentiated into the acrosyringeal portion of the sweat duct, and they are relatively rare. It may develop from a long standing eccrine poroma undergoing malignant transformation or may arise de novo. We evaluated pathological and immunohistocheimical findings of six cases of eccrine porocarcinoma. Special stains (PAS and PAS with diastase) and immunohistochemical stainings (CEA, CAM5.2, CK7, bcl-2, p53 protein, and MIB-1) were performed. We observed asymmetrical architecture, cytological pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, ductal differentiation, intracytoplasmic lumina, mitotic activity, and melanin colonization. Three patients were male and four patients were female. The average age was 76 years. The time interval from tumor onset to treatment ranged from 6 months to 10 years. The mean size was 3.2?cm, and the mean depth of invasion was 1.0?cm. Four tumors were found on the head, one on the hip, and one on the foot. Regional lymph node metastases were noted in one case. Microscopically, luminal spaces and intracytoplasmic lumina were noted in all cases. Immunohistochemically, the mean MIB-1 index was 41%. P53 immunoreactivity was detected in five cases. Interestingly, a case of porocarcinoma with lymph node metastases showed high mitotic figures as well as less lymphocytic infiltration.
