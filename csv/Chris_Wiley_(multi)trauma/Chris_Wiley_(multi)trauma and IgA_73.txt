AB  - Background: There are only two reported cases of hypomelanosis of Ito (HI) associated with precocious puberty. Here we report a third case, and the first one to be autopsied. Design: A 5-year-old female with HI, intractable seizures and mental retardation presented with gray vaginal discharge and bacterial vaginosis. The patient subsequently died from neurologic complications and was autopsied. Results: Post-mortem examination revealed pigmentary mosaicism following the lines of Blaschko and advanced development of vulvar labia, pubic hair, and breast buds. Other significant autopsy findings included conical teeth, patchy alopecia, macrosomia (body weight and height above 95th percentile), and macrocephaly with megalencephaly (brain 1850?g). The uterus and ovaries were unremarkable. Epidermis had decreased melanocytes in hypopigmented areas. Skin fibroblast karyotype was normal. Conclusion: The two previous case reports indicate that the mechanism for precocious puberty in HI may be either biochemical, as in McCune-Albright Syndrome, or independent of GnRH. The mechanism of the precocious puberty in our case is most likely central.

AB  - Retinoic X receptor-b (RXR-b) is a heterodimerization partner for vitamin D receptor (VDR). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 activation of VDR leads to growth inhibition in numerous cell lines, including some melanoma lines. Evaluation of VDR and RXR-b expression in vivo in melanocytic neoplasms will increase our understanding of this pathways potential role in growth control. Previous studies in our laboratory showed decreased VDR expression in superficially invasive melanoma, and progressive loss of expression in deeply invasive melanomas and metastatic melanomas (MET). We next sought to evaluate RXR-b expression. Twenty-eight melanocytic neoplasms including 8 melanomas in situ (MIS), 9 primary invasive melanomas (PIM), and 11 MET were evaluated for RXR-b expression by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear labeling was assessed as 0 (0%), 1+(<5%), 2+(>5% but <50%), or 3+(>=50%). A significant increase in RXR-b expression from low (0?1+) to high (>1+) was found when comparing MIS to PIM and MET (chi2 p?<?0.05). These data suggest: 1) potential loss of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induced growth inhibition during melanoma progression may be due to decreased VDR expression without concomitant loss of RXR-b; and 2) increased RXR-b expression during melanoma progression may offer selective advantage through alternative signaling pathways.

AB  - The inconsistent use of the term ?erythema annulare centrifugum? has created confusion, in that it has been applied to a group of distinct diseases as if they were a single condition. The literature becomes more ambiguous when different names are given to annular eruptions that have a similar pathogenesis. We present two neonates who presented at birth with similar diffuse erythematous annular eruptions, but differed in their serologic and histopathologic findings. The first child was otherwise healthy and had normal laboratories findings that excluded both infectious and autoimmune diseases. His biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate throughout the entire dermis that was composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and numerous eosinophils. The second neonate had elevated anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, thrombocytopenia and a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. His biopsy showed focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer. There was a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate that extended throughout the dermis which consisted primarily of nuclear debris. Within the cytoplasm of the few intact histiocytes and neutrophils, were hematoxylin bodies, giving these cells the appearance of LE cells. We discuss the clinical and histopathological findings in these two neonates and attempt to clarify the nomenclature pertaining to the annular erythemas.

AB  - Introduction: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a low grade B cell lymphoproliferative disease with overlapping features with small lymphocytic lymphoma. The neoplastic cell is an autoreactive CD5 CD23 B lymphocyte. B-CLL may involve the skin, typically in the context of known disease. We present a case of subclinical B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. Results: A 73-year-old male developed a lesion on his right cheek in April 2003 compatible with basal cell carcinoma. The re-excision specimen contained a well differentiated atypical lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with B-CLL along with residual carcinoma. Subsequent laboratory studies revealed slight thrombocytopenia and mild peripheral blood lymphocytosis. A diagnosis was made of stage 0 CLL. Chromosomal studies on peripheral blood showed a deletion at 13q14.3. Conclusion: This case represents a cutaneous presentation of subclinical B-CLL. There are two prior reports describing B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. In one case the infiltrates were incidental on a re-excision specimen. The second report suggests 16% of B-CLL patients have cutaneous manifestations as the first sign of disease. Data indicates that 13q14 deletion in B-CLL in early stage disease may portend a more aggressive course, possibly explaining its early presentation in the skin in our case.

AB  - Genetic identity analysis is a procedure that may be done on paraffin blocks to determine genetic identity or non-identity of tissues. On occasion biopsy specimens from different patients are mixed up. This becomes a major problem if the subsequent diagnoses require further therapy or have other significant medical implications. We recently had such a case in which three biopsy specimens from a middle age man were possibly mixed up with that from a pre-teen age boy. The biopsy from the pre-teen was originally reported as a malignant skin tumor. Initially, the three biopsy specimens from the middle age man were sent for genetic identity analysis, which showed that one biopsy specimen was genetically different. The biopsy specimen from the pre-teen was then sent, and found to be genetically similar to the two genetically identical specimens originally submitted for the middle age man. Further confirmation of genetic identity could have been obtained by obtain further samples from both patients, but was not felt necessary in this case. We review the procedure used for genetic identity analysis as well as its other applications for this procedure in clinical practice.

AB  - A 33-year-old African American woman presented with a 2 year history of skin lesions on her legs. Skin biopsy demonstrated interstitial and focally confluent reticular dermal histiocytic infiltrate consistent with granuloma annulare. She was treated with high-potency topical steroids and returned 14 months later with diffuse papular lesions, 80?lb. weight loss, and dyspnea. Repeat skin biopsy showed similar distribution of interstitial and sheet-like histiocytopathy, accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis, cell-poor lymphocytic interface dermatitis and thrombogenic vasculopathy. Stains for fungi (AB ? PAS and GMS) and mycobacterial species (Ziehl-Neelsen, Fite and auramine-rhodamine immunofluorescence) were negative. No foreign material was evident under polarized light. A diagnosis of cutaneous necrotizing sarcoidosis was made. Necrotizing sarcoidosis is a well-recognized pulmonary entity, but is rarely reported in the skin. Diagnostic features include granulomata with regional necrosis, often with a granulomatous vasculitis, in the absence of demonstrable microbial pathogens. Patients are typically adult women who present with pulmonary symptoms, fever, weight loss and fatigue. The etiology of sarcoidosis remains obscure. One proposed mechanism is an id reaction to an as yet unidentified pathogen, with circulating microbial antigens leading to an occlusive and infarctive vasculopathy. Such a mechanism could explain the pathologic changes seen with our patient.

AB  - Large cell transformation of mycosis fungoides (MF) is an uncommon phenomenon. We present a case of CD30-positive large cell transformation and discuss its possible pathophysiology. A 74 year-old male with a 36-year history of patch stage MF presented with a 3-month history of right chest cellulitis that was refractory to IV antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsies from his thigh demonstrated a patchy dermal infiltrate of irregular and hyperchromatic lymphocytes and epidermotropism. The majority of the infiltrate was positive for CD4, CD3, CD2, and negative for CD7. Only 10% were positive for CD25 and CD8. Biopsies obtained from the ulcerated chest nodules showed a dermal infiltrate of large and pleomorphic lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. These large lymphoid cells were strongly positive for CD3, CD30, CD25, CD2 and UCHL-1. Occasional cells were positive for CD4 and CD20. They were negative for ALK-1, TIA-1, CD7, CD8, and CD15. T-gamma receptor gene rearrangement analyses by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a clonal process with similar rearrangement patterns identified in the patch stage MF as well as in large cell transformation areas. Examinations of his peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative. The patient had tolerated one cycle of CHOP chemotherapy.

AB  - Case 1: A 38 year-old man presented with a painless right post auricular mass, slowly growing for ten years. Clinical impression was a salivary gland lesion. The excised mass measured 3?cm and was gelatinous. Case 2: A 28 year-old man presented with a lump in the region of the left heel, slowly growing for several years. Excision revealed a lobulated pink-gray mass measuring 2?cm. In both cases, histology demonstrated a circumscribed encapsulated proliferation of tumour cells surrounded by abundant myxoid stroma. There were almost exclusively hyaline cells with plasmacytoid features, arranged predominantly in nests and sheets with abundant pink cytoplasm and hyaline inclusions. Round to oval nuclei with occasional small nucleoli and rare mitotic figures were seen. Both cases stained strongly positive for low molecular weight cytokeratin, S 100 and vimentin and were negative for desmin, smooth-muscle actin and muscle-specific actin. We describe two cases of hyaline cell-rich chondroid syringoma, a histologically benign entity. The importance in recognizing this entity is that these tumors can easily be confused with malignant neoplasms including malignant melanoma, myxoid chondrosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Follow up for a year has shown no evidence of metastases or recurrence in both cases.

AB  - Atypical fibroxanthoma is a fairly common dermal neoplasm that is characterized histologically by infiltrating pleomorphic spindle cells and atypical giant cells with numerous mitoses. Clinically, the lesion most commonly presents as a solitary ulcerated papule on the head or neck of elderly males. We report a patient with a rare granular cell variant of atypical fibroxanthoma. The patient was a seventy-five-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the left scalp treated by Mohs surgery two years prior. In the vicinity of the previous squamous cell carcinoma site, the patient presented with a slow growing, approximately 1.0 by 1.0?cm red, violaceous, firm nodule on the left scalp. The clinical impression was recurrent squamous cell carcinoma. Biopsy of the lesion revealed a dermal tumor composed of pleomorphic cells with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm with numerous typical and atypical mitoses. The tumor stained focally with Factor VIII, CD 68, and SMA and 30% of the neoplastic cells stained with Ki 67. Staining for Keratin cocktail, High Molecular Weight Keratin, Melan A and S100 were negative. PAS strongly stained the granules. These features are consistent with a granular cell variant of atypical fibroxanthoma.

AB  - Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) may be idiopathic, drug-induced, related to infection, or may occur in patients with autoimmune disorders. Our objective was to determine whether tissue eosinophilia is a reliable indicator of a drug-induced etiology in the setting of LCV. Thorough chart investigation of 63 patients with LCV was performed with division of patients into drug-induced and non-drug-induced groups. Corresponding histopathologic material was reviewed by a dermatopathologist blinded to the etiologic associations.? An eosinophil score was tabulated by averaging the number of eosinophils in 10 high-power fields (400x) and dividing by the density of inflammation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxin rank sums test. Mean eosinophil scores in the drug-induced (n?=?16) and non-drug-induced (n?=?47) groups were 5.20 and 1.05 respectively (p?=?0.0126). Vascular fibrin deposition and epidermal changes were present in both groups. Clinical evidence of systemic vasculitis was present in 6%(1/16) of the drug-induced group vs. 38%(18/47) of the non-drug-induced cases. This study establishes tissue eosinophilia as a reliable indicator of drug induction in the setting of LCV. Furthermore, this information may be useful for guiding management decisions, especially in settings of unclear etiology.

AB  - BRAF encodes a serine-threonine kinase, which acts in the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway transducing regulatory signals from RAS to MEK1/2. Somatic mutations in BRAF have been identified in 53?80% of primary melanomas and 70?90% of common melanocytic nevi. More than 90% of these mutations consist of a valine to glutamate substitution at codon 599 (V599E) of exon 15. While a high prevalence of BRAF mutations in common melanocytic nevi has been reported in adults, nevi in children have not been studied. Of interest, we have previously shown that Spitz nevi in children do not harbor mutations in BRAF. To investigate the association of BRAF mutations with patient age, we studied common melanocytic nevi in children for the V599E activating mutation. Tumor cells were microdissected from 6 common melanocytic nevi in children 10 years of age or younger, and analyzed for the V599E mutation in BRAF by allele-specific PCR and gel electrophoresis. In 6 of 6 (100%) nevi, the V599E mutant allele was observed. Our data suggest that similar genetic pathways are involved in the development of common melanocytic nevi in children and adults. The absence of BRAF mutations in Spitz nevi in children is therefore associated with tumor type, not patient age.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common primary cutaneous carcinomas, but on rare occasion, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from a distant site or solid organ can present as a cutaneous lesion. Most metastases to the skin present as dermal nodules or involve the dermal lymphatics, but when they are intimately associated with the epidermis, distinguishing the lesion as primary or metastatic may be extremely difficult and usually requires a clinical history or high index of suspicion. A 71-year-old woman presented with a history of breast carcinoma, status post radiation therapy and subsequent mastectomy. She developed multiple eruptive nodules over her mastectomy site, flank and back two years later. Histologically the lesions appeared to be arising from the surface epidermis and consisted of atypical, predominantly spindle cells, some of which streamed off of the basal layer of the epidermis. Following review of the mastectomy specimen material and performing additional immunohistochemical studies, it became clear that the origin of the carcinomas was metastatic from an underlying metaplastic breast carcinoma.

AB  - A 13 year-old boy presented with a six-month history of severe lip swelling. His past medical history was significant for eczema, multiple episodes of urticaria, and two episodes of anaphylaxis. Physical exam revealed severe cheilitis and labial angioedema. The cranial nerves were intact, and there was no evidence of a fissured tongue. A lip biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas throughout the dermis, with extension into the underlying skeletal muscle. Other features included dilated lymphatic channels, some closely approximating the granulomas, and a mild perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The epidermis was acanthotic with parakeratosis and focal acantholysis. Methenamine silver and acid-fast stains were negative. A laboratory work-up revealed an increased total eosinophil count, an increased serum IgE level, and a low complement C1q level. All other complement levels were normal. The patient also had an unremarkable chest x-ray and a normal angiotensin converting enzyme level. This case represents the monosymptomatic form of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), also known as cheilitis granulomatosa Meischer. MRS is classically known as a triad of granulomatous cheilitis, facial nerve palsy, and fissured tongue. The onset of granulomatous cheilitis typically precedes the other symptoms, and when present alone, it is known as the monosymptomatic form of MRS.

AB  - Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is a rare autosomal genodermatosis characterized by the triad of fibrofolliculomas, trichodyscomas and acrochordons. The gene for BHD was localised to chromosome 17p11.2 and a germline insertion/deletion was identified to cause premature truncation of the BHD protein, folliculin. Patients carry increased risk for developing lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal carcinoma. Prompt diagnosis is important for patient clinical management. We encountered a 41 year-old white male, otherwise healthy, with classic clinical presentation of BHD, i.e. numerous firm, smooth, whitish papules covering his face and neck, which were developed after adolescence. There is no related family history. Nine biopsies were taken during the past 5 years. The following changes are present: markedly dilated hair follicles, telangiectasia in fibrosing stroma, and melanocytic nevus cells. Diagnoses of epidermal inclusion cyst, fibrous papules, and dermal nevus were given. However, some subtle but diagnostic histopathological features for fibrofolliculoma, perifolliculafibroma, and trichodyscoma were overlooked. Correct diagnosis was reached upon review of all the biopsies. Patient is currently undergoing genetic testing and clinical workups. We present this case to update our knowledge on this rare disease, particularly the diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic pitfalls, in order to avoid the delay of correct diagnosis.

AB  - p63, a recently identified homologue of p53 gene, has been reported to be essential in the development of epithelia and is mainly expressed by basal and myoepithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of p63 expression in cutaneous adnexal neoplasms and to assess its possible value in the differential diagnosis of primary cutaneous neoplasms versus adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. Immunohistochemical analysis using p63 monoclonal antibody (clone 4A4) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 20 benign adnexal tumors, 10 malignant adnexal tumors, and 14 adenocarcinomas metastatic to the skin. The expression of p63 was evaluated in epidermal cells, skin appendages and metastatic tumor cells. p63 was consistently expressed in the basal/suprabasal cells of epidermis and cutaneous appendages, including the basal/myoepithelial cells of sweat glands. Thirteen out of 20 (65%) benign adnexal tumors showed strong p63 expression; the remaining 7(35%) cases had over 50% p63-positive nuclei. All primary cutaneous carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas, expressed p63. In contrast, none of the metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin was positive for p63 (p?<?0.0001). Based on our findings, analysis of p63 expression may be a helpful tool in the differential diagnosis of primary versus metastatic cutaneous adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN) is a rare hamartomatous malformation of the eccrine duct which typically presents at birth or early in life. Multiple punctate pits and verrucous papules and plaques with nonfollicular hyperkeratotic spines are seen over the palms and soles and may extend to the distal extremities. A linear distribution may be present. A wide range of involvement has been reported in the literature, including bilateral systematized involvement. No systemic involvement has been linked to PEODDN to date. Histologic findings are characteristic and include a dilated eccrine acrosyringium with an overlying parakeratotic column or cornoid lamella. There is slight dyskeratosis and loss of the granular layer under the cornoid lamella. Here, we present a case of bilateral systematized PEODDN in an otherwise healthy, 18 year-old Hispanic female. Physical examination is notable for marked hypoplasia of the left breast with overlying verrucous papules and plaques. Multiple punch biopsies were performed and showed findings diagnostic of PEODDN. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive involvement of PEODDN reported in the literature to date and the only case with associated hypoplasia of the breast.
