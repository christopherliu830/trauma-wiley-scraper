AB  - Abstract All organisms contain thousands of proteins and peptides in their body fluids. A deeper insight into the functional relevance of these polypeptides under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions and the discovery of specific peptide biomarkers would greatly enhance both diagnosis and therapy of specific diseases. Proteomic methods can provide means to accomplish this grand medical vision. In this review, we will focus on the potential use of proteome analysis for clinical applications, such as disease diagnosis and assessment of response to therapy. We focus on CE coupled with MS (CE-MS) and review in detail different aspects of CE-MS coupling and the results obtained using CE-MS analysis of clinically relevant samples. We also discuss clinical applications of the technology for the diagnosis of renal diseases, urogenital cancer, and arteriosclerosis as well as monitoring the responses to therapeutic interventions.

AB  - ABSTRACT The current research will examine the frequency of carious teeth, periapical abscesses and ante-mortem tooth loss in the Newburgh Colored Burial Ground (1830?1870), a free black cemetery in Newburgh, New York. The Newburgh material is compared with skeletal samples from the New York African Burial Ground, New York State almshouses, a free black cemetery from Philadelphia and middle-class/upper-class European cemeteries. Although previous research suggests that dental health became worse throughout the 19th century, there is no consistent pattern between the 17th-century and 18th-century skeletal sample of enslaved blacks from New York City and 19th-century free blacks from Newburgh and Philadelphia. The frequency of dental caries does increase through time but the other indicators change little (equal or fewer ante-mortem tooth loss) or suggest an improvement in dental health (fewer periapical abscesses) through time. Relative to contemporaneous populations, the individuals from Newburgh appear much more similar in terms of dental health to upper-class and middle-class European groups than to the other marginalised groups considered in this research. The impact of the economic, political and social changes that accompanied the Industrial Revolution and their potential impact on dental health are considered.

AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - John W. Swann 1 ( 1 Pediatrics/Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX ) Summary: Epilepsy research scientists and clinicians are collaborating in translating scientific discoveries into new therapies for the intractable epilepsies. Discoveries of clinical researchers are guiding the development of relevant animal models. Studies in these models are leading to the identification of what appear to be key molecular steps in the genesis of epilepsy. These molecular mechanisms provide new targets for the development of rationale therapies, which can be tested in these same models. As an example of the progress being made, this program will review the most recent studies of the consequences of prolonged febrile seizures in children. Potential targets for new therapies that have been discovered in models of febrile seizures, head injury, neonatal seizures and kindling will be discussed.

AB  - While severe nephrotoxicity is uncommon during gold therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the prevalence of mild nephrotoxicity has not been investigated. To study this, levels of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase (NAG) (nmole/hr/mg urinary creatinine), and ?2microglobulin (?2M) (?g/mg urinary creatinine) were measured in urine samples from 33 patients with RA receiving gold and 28 patients with various musculoskeletal diseases not receiving gold. Each patient had a normal urinalysis and blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine. LAP was above 30 in 55% of RA patients and 7% of controls (p < 0.01). NAG was above 100 in 70% of RA patients and 14% of controls (p < 0.01). In 8 RA patients, NAG was over 200; LAP was over 100 in 4, but in none of the controls. ?2M was above 0.32 in 7 of 23 female RA patients and in none of 12 female controls (p = 0.012) and none of the male patients. Patients who excreted high levels of ?2M also excreted high levels of NAG and LAP. These data show that gold in therapeutic doses affects renal tubular cells, causing the release of NAG and LAP from lysosomes and brush borders of the cells. This may represent the mildest stage of nephrotoxicity. Elevated ?2M in the urine of some patients indicate a degree of nephrotoxicity sufficient to cause renal tubular dysfunction.
