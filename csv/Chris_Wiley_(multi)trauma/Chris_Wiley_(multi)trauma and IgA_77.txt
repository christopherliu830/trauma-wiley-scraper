AB  - Edward H. Bertram 1 , Gary Mathern 2 , Helen Cross 3 and Maria Thom 4 ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom and 4 Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom ) Summary: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been synonymous with hippocampal sclerosis, such that the consensus is that the removal of the latter cures the former. There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.

AB  - While severe nephrotoxicity is uncommon during gold therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the prevalence of mild nephrotoxicity has not been investigated. To study this, levels of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase (NAG) (nmole/hr/mg urinary creatinine), and ?2microglobulin (?2M) (?g/mg urinary creatinine) were measured in urine samples from 33 patients with RA receiving gold and 28 patients with various musculoskeletal diseases not receiving gold. Each patient had a normal urinalysis and blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine. LAP was above 30 in 55% of RA patients and 7% of controls (p < 0.01). NAG was above 100 in 70% of RA patients and 14% of controls (p < 0.01). In 8 RA patients, NAG was over 200; LAP was over 100 in 4, but in none of the controls. ?2M was above 0.32 in 7 of 23 female RA patients and in none of 12 female controls (p = 0.012) and none of the male patients. Patients who excreted high levels of ?2M also excreted high levels of NAG and LAP. These data show that gold in therapeutic doses affects renal tubular cells, causing the release of NAG and LAP from lysosomes and brush borders of the cells. This may represent the mildest stage of nephrotoxicity. Elevated ?2M in the urine of some patients indicate a degree of nephrotoxicity sufficient to cause renal tubular dysfunction.

AB  - Summary The management of diabetes is underpinned by observations that good metabolic control can not only prevent short-term problems, such as those associated with hypo- and hyperglycaemia, but also long-term complications. Special nutritional problems, including those involving nasogastric and intravenous feeding, are discussed in this chapter. There are three main groups of oral drugs that are commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: biguanides, sulphonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. An insulin pump attempts to imitate the healthy pancreas, although it delivers insulin into the peripheral circulation, whereas the pancreas delivers it into the portal circulation, which produces important 'first-pass' metabolic effects in the liver. In summary, while the healthy diet for healthy people is also generally appropriate for people with diabetes, there are also specific considerations associated with the timing of food ingestion.

AB  - Abstract The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Apheresis Applications Committee is charged with a review and categorization of indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (fourth edition), the subcommittee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Fifth ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by refining the category definitions and by adding a grade of recommendation based on widely accepted GRADE system. The concept of a fact sheet was introduced in the Fourth edition and is only slightly modified in this current edition. The fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis. The article consists of 59 fact sheets devoted to each disease entity currently categorized by the ASFA as category I through III. Category IV indications are also listed. J. Clin.
