AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis results from a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response induced by allergens. Skin dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the initiation of allergic skin responses. Following encounter with an allergen, DCs become activated and undergo maturation and differentiate into immunostimulatory DCs and are able to present antigens effectively to T cells. The frequency of allergic skin disorders has increased in the past decades. Therefore, the identification of potential sensitizing chemicals is important for skin safety. Traditionally, predictive testing for allergenicity has been conducted in animal models. For regulatory reasons, animal use for sensitization testing of compounds for cosmetic purposes is shortly to be prohibited in Europe. Therefore, new non-animal-based test methods need to be developed. Several DC-based assays have been described to discriminate allergens from irritants. Unfortunately, current in vitro methods are not sufficiently resilient to identify allergens and therefore need refinement. Here, we review the immunobiology of skin DCs (Langerhans? cells and dermal dendritic cells) and their role in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and then explore the possible use of DC-based models for discriminating between allergens and irritants.

AB  - Abstract Background Immunosuppressive drugs may prevent or partially reverse progression of renal AA-amyloidosis, a rare complication of Crohn's disease, often fatal due to renal failure. Materials and methods The clinical, biological and pathological data of 16 patients treated since 1976 were reviewed. Serum amyloid A was determined in surviving patients. Results The median age of the 16 patients (13 men) was 23·5 years (range 16?69). At Crohn's disease onset, Montreal phenotypes were similar to reported data. Out of 15 patients with renal insufficiency, 8 developed a nephrotic syndrome and 7 a low grade proteinuria. The single patient without renal insufficiency had nephrotic syndrome. A significant correlation (P < 0·05) between the extension of renal amyloid A and sclerosis was found in 12 patients. One patient had a 10 year remission of nephrotic syndrome with immunosuppressive drugs. In 6 patients treated with anti-TNF-α (Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-α) agents, anaphylactic reaction (1/6), death from septic shock (1/6), 5-year remission (1/6) or reduction of nephrotic syndrome (1/6) and stabilization of renal insufficiency (2/6) were observed. Surgery was performed in 10 patients. Kidney transplantation was performed in 5 of the 8 patients dialysed for end-stage renal failure. Among 6/16 patients (37%) still alive, 3 belong to the 5 transplanted patients (survival: 3?20 years) and 3 to the anti-TNF-α drugs treated patients; all but one exhibited a low serum amyloid A level. Conclusions Suppression of Crohn's disease inflammation potentially leads to the control of amyloid A production, assessed by a decrease of serum amyloid A. Kidney transplantation provides a long survival.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important clinical condition that is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. This study was performed to identify the factors that influence AKI stage, undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) and mortality. Methods This study was retrospectively conducted on 219 children with AKI who had been referred to the paediatric nephrology division of Dr Sami Ulus Teaching Hospital during their inpatient treatment from 2008 to 2012. AKI was defined using pRIFLE criteria. Results From the 219 enrolled patients, 131 were identified as having AKI at the time of hospital admission. Infant age group was the largest group. RRT was performed in 68 patients. Median RRT initiation time was 1.5?day (0?2) and the mortality increased significantly when RRT initiation time was >1?day. The likelihood of undergoing RRT was higher for patients who were younger, who were managed in PICU and who had intrinsic type of AKI. pRIFLE stage and AKI place did not influence the likelihood of undergoing RRT. Overall mortality was 26.9%. In log-rank tests, factors influencing survival were younger age, being treated in PICU, developing AKI during inpatient treatment, having a comorbid condition and undergoing RRT. pRIFLE stage did not influence survival. In the logistic regression model, factors associated with mortality included younger age, undergoing RRT and having AKI during inpatient treatment. Having underlying disease and being managed in PICU did not influence the likelihood of death. Conclusion Acute kidney injury is an important condition in all hospitalized patients. More studies and interventions are needed on this topic to identify, treat and prevent AKI.
