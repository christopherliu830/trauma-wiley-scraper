AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical condition responsible for high mortality and the development of multiple organ dysfunctions, because of the lack of specific and effective therapies for ALI. Increasing evidence from pre-clinical studies supports preventive and therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, also called mesenchymal stromal cells) in ALI/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Therapeutic effects of MSCs were noticed in various delivery approaches (systemic, local, or other locations), multiple origins (bone marrow or other tissues), or different schedules of administrations (before or after the challenges). MSCs could reduce the over-production of inflammatory mediators, leucocyte infiltration, tissue injury and pulmonary failure, and produce a number of benefit factors through interaction with other cells in the process of lung tissue repair. Thus, it is necessary to establish guidelines, standard operating procedures and evaluation criteria for translating MSC-based therapies into clinical application for patients with ALI.

AB  - Summary Functional foods fall into two broad categories: plant origin and animal origin. A review conducted in 1992 proves that plant-based foods have some components that act against lethal diseases, such as cancer. A vast number of components, such as fish oil and dairy products naturally present in animal sources are potentially beneficial to health. Nutraceuticals deliver a concentrated form of a biologically active component from a food to enhance health in dosages that exceed those that could be obtained from regular food. The use of probiotics in combination with prebiotic has been very effective against several chronic diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics provide an alternate source for the management of different intestinal disorders. The major contributions associated with the work of probiotics on human health are proper colonic function and increased metabolism. Research indicates that there is an estimated global market for functional foods of US$33 billion.

AB  - Summary This chapter includes HGNC entries for proteins that are expressed on the cell surface, namely receptors for different ligand classes, transporters and ion channels. Targets for existing drugs are strongly over-represented in this group; for example, approximately 40% of current medicines affect G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and hundreds of these molecules are listed with annotations that indicate pharmaceutical potential. The chapter also discusses targets that involve protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions. These are cytokines and their receptors, adhesion molecules and host defence molecules; the allocation of entries in these three sections is less clear-cut than with the GPCRs. The last group of entries that is discussed is the transporters and channels. The ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier families are not only primary therapeutic targets but also contain proteins that contribute to drug resistance.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives This study was conducted to assess transfusion knowledge between different specialty board residents and to identify areas of need for further education. Background Physicians' knowledge of transfusion medicine (TM) is critical for patients' safety. Many clinicians who are involved in day-to-day transfusion practice have little or no formal training in TM. There are no studies to assess physician's TM knowledge locally. Methods A comprehensive anonymous survey was developed to assess baseline TM knowledge of all the residents. The survey is composed of different sections, including a questionnaire on resident's demographics, resident's self-reflection on their TM knowledge and 30 multiple choice questions addressing basic and clinical TM knowledge in two major domains: component selection and transfusion practice and transfusion safety and transfusion reactions. Finally, the residents' opinion on educational needs was assessed. Results A total of 130 residents were surveyed. The lowest score obtained among the two major domains assessed was in the transfusion safety and transfusion reaction domain, with a mean score of 4·34 of 15 (SD ± 3·27). The mean score obtained on component selection and transfusion practice was 7·1 of 15 (SD ± 3·74). A substantial proportion of the residents (74·7%) admitted minimal baseline knowledge in the field of TM. Finally, 94·5% of the residents admitted the need for more education during residency, whereas 49·5% thought additional education is required during the first year of practice. Conclusion This survey shows serious TM knowledge deficiency and indicates the need for additional education among all physicians during training.
