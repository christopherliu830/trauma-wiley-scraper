AB  - SUMMARY Objectives This study was conducted to assess transfusion knowledge between different specialty board residents and to identify areas of need for further education. Background Physicians' knowledge of transfusion medicine (TM) is critical for patients' safety. Many clinicians who are involved in day-to-day transfusion practice have little or no formal training in TM. There are no studies to assess physician's TM knowledge locally. Methods A comprehensive anonymous survey was developed to assess baseline TM knowledge of all the residents. The survey is composed of different sections, including a questionnaire on resident's demographics, resident's self-reflection on their TM knowledge and 30 multiple choice questions addressing basic and clinical TM knowledge in two major domains: component selection and transfusion practice and transfusion safety and transfusion reactions. Finally, the residents' opinion on educational needs was assessed. Results A total of 130 residents were surveyed. The lowest score obtained among the two major domains assessed was in the transfusion safety and transfusion reaction domain, with a mean score of 4·34 of 15 (SD ± 3·27). The mean score obtained on component selection and transfusion practice was 7·1 of 15 (SD ± 3·74). A substantial proportion of the residents (74·7%) admitted minimal baseline knowledge in the field of TM. Finally, 94·5% of the residents admitted the need for more education during residency, whereas 49·5% thought additional education is required during the first year of practice. Conclusion This survey shows serious TM knowledge deficiency and indicates the need for additional education among all physicians during training.

AB  - ABSTRACT Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in renal transplant recipients. Frequency of UTIs depend on many factors such as age, female gender, kidney function, co-morbidity, type and amount of immunosuppression, urological instrumentation and/or the follow-up period (short term or long term) after kidney transplantation. UTI may worsen graft and patient survival. A significant proportion of renal transplant recipients with UTIs may develop acute pyelonephritis (APN), which is an independent risk factor for deterioration of graft function. Renal transplant recipients with UTIs are often clinically asymptomatic as a consequence of immunosuppression. UTI, however, may progress to APN (particularly in the early post-transplant period), bacteraemia and the full blown picture of urosepsis. Strategies for long term prophylaxis and antimicrobial treatment of UTI in renal transplant recipients are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper reports on the occurrence, biosynthesis, metabolism, biological and toxicological profile, and assessment of the authenticity of linalool. The main biological properties of linalool ? sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, local anaesthetic ? are discussed in terms of the molecule's chirality influence, the mechanisms of activity and type of study (in vitro, in vivo, clinical studies). Also, there is a discussion of the recent data on the skin sensitizing potential of linalool based on numerous scientific studies which have been performed in the last few years. Comments of the authenticity assessment of linalool are made considering the limitations imposed by the chemical structure, vegetal matrix or processing methods, but also from the perspective of the powerful and sophisticated analytical techniques available today (GC-C-IRMS, enantio-MDGC coupled to GC-C-IRMS, SNIF-NMR).

AB  - Abstract The establishment of a long-term, low Earth orbiting outpost has long been a goal of space exploration advocates. A variety of orbiting space stations, envisioned by writers, engineers, and scientists for years, have been developed, launched, and deorbited. The Soviet Union and Russia have flown several Salyut stations and only recently terminated operations of the Mir Space Station. The United State flew three missions on the Skylab Space Station that was launched in 1975. The long developmental history of the International Space Station (ISS) includes many lessons and are discussed. The huge scale of the project offers many engineering, policy, and management lessons for our future endeavors in space. Despite the many challenges and the long development period, the project is now demonstrating great success an overview of the configuration of the ISSW given. The segments contributed by the U.S., Russia, Canada, Europe, and Japan are detailed. These partners have formulated a share agreement to allocate all of the critical ISS resources. In November 2000, the first permanent crew docked with and entered the International Space Station. Since then, the International team has continued to outfit and augment the ISS. At this time, the fifth expedition crew is well into their stay on board the ISS. The results of many years of painstaking work are evident as the ISS flies overhead.
