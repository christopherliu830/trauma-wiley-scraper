AB  - Summary The use of alkylating agents as chemotherapy dates from 1946, the year that nitrogen mustard was introduced. Sulfur mustard was used as a warfare agent because of its vesicant effect on the skin and mucous membranes. The observation of its additional effect of hematopoietic and lymphoid system depression led to the use of the less volatile nitrogen mustards in studies. The alkylating agents react with (or ?alkylate?) many electron rich atoms in DNA bases, to form covalent bonds. Monofunctional alkylating agents react with only one strand of DNA, which is recognized by the cell and leads to lethal reactions. The main dermatologic adverse events (AEs) of alkylating agents are hyperpigmentation, mucositis, alopecia, hypersensitivity reactions, and xerosis with pruritus. Extravasation can lead to local cellulitis; however, it is sometimes also classified as nonirritating. Rechallenge of chlorambucil led to the same symptoms; however, other alkylating agents were tolerated.

AB  - Abstract Paul Ehrlich's concept of the magic bullet, by which a single drug induces pharmacological effects by interacting with a single receptor has been a strong driving force in pharmacology for a century. It is continually thwarted, though, by the fact that the treated organism is highly dynamic and the target molecule(s) is (are) never static. In this article, we address some of the factors that modify and cause the mobility and plasticity of drug targets and their interactions with ligands and discuss how these can lead to unexpected (lack of) effects of drugs. These factors include genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic variability, cellular plasticity, chronobiological rhythms, time, age and disease resolution, sex, drug metabolism, and distribution. We emphasize four existing approaches that can be taken, either singly or in combination, to try to minimize effects of pharmacological plasticity. These are firstly, to enhance specificity using target conditions close to those in diseases, secondly, by simultaneously or thirdly, sequentially aiming at multiple targets, and fourthly, in synchronization with concurrent dietary, psychological, training, and biorhythm-synchronizing procedures to optimize drug therapy.

AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2011; 17: 69?79 Abstract Lyme borreliosis, caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies complex, is the most commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The non-specific nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic challenge and concise case definitions are essential for its satisfactory management. Lyme borreliosis is very similar in Europe and North America but the greater variety of genospecies in Europe leads to some important differences in clinical presentation. These new case definitions for European Lyme borreliosis emphasise recognition of clinical manifestations supported by relevant laboratory criteria and may be used in a clinical setting and also for epidemiological investigations.

AB  - IDEAS (intellectual disabilities evaluation and advice system) provides the opportunity for physicians who are sending samples for the Greenwood Genetic Center (GGC) 92-gene X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) (formerly X-linked mental retardation) panel to have their male patient's clinical features reviewed by an experienced panel of six Clinical Geneticists. They were asked to obtain parental consent, complete a one-page information form, and provide A?P and lateral photographs. The panel members independently reviewed the material and forwarded comments about clinical features, possible diagnoses, and/or further testing for the patient. We present the results of the first 55 patients evaluated. In only a single case did all panelists agree on a non-XLID diagnosis, later proven by genetic testing. The XLID gene panel diagnosed an additional five (9%) cases, but in only two cases did one panelist suggest the correct gene, which was one of four they suggested. This paper examines the possible reasons for the low rate of clinical diagnosis and suggests that, while the data received were often incomplete, the most important reasons for lack of diagnoses were the source of referral and selection of patients for review. We did note that there were a number of instances where we disagreed with the submitted information as to whether the individual was dysmorphic and with the stated presence of certain physical signs, most often downslanted palpebrae and posterior ear angulation. These differences in assessment of clinical signs and the general lack of completeness and detail provided in the standard data sheet, including that regarding the extended family history, lead us to raise concerns regarding the feasibility of establishing high quality central clinical databases designed to aid in the interpretation of exomic/genomic variants. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
