AB  - Objective: This study used a prospective design and the technique of structural modelling to examine the complex interrelations between psychological factors, immune status and complications after major surgery. Methods: Twenty-nine women scheduled for elective cholecystectomy were studied prospectively. Information regarding medical history, health practices, life stressors, and coping strategies was obtained two weeks prior to admission. At this initial meeting, as well as three days after surgery, and at one month follow-up immunological tests were performed and the level of psychological distress was assessed. The study additionally included measures of post-operative complications, and infections and negative effect during follow-up. Results: Pre-operative immune status emerged as a key variable exerting strong effects on subsequent immune function and, thereby producing significant, indirect effects on every recovery variable. Pre-operative distress was directly linked to increased mood disturbance at follow-up. Moreover, distress significantly influenced immune function both before and after surgery, which mediated a significant impact on most recovery variables. Active coping behaviour directly increased the risk of a complicated recovery. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that distress-induced changes in immune functioning have clinical relevance. Overall, the present findings suggest that recovery from surgery is facilitated in patients with a well-functioning immune system, a low-level of pre-operative distress and a passive coping disposition.

AB  - Abstract The evolution of trabecular bone score (TBS) and bone mineral density (BMD) over the first 5 years after renal transplantation was prospectively evaluated in 164 patients. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months. Cumulative steroid dose, serum 25(OH)D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and total ALP levels at these time points were checked. Incident fractures were identified from X-rays/vertebral fracture assessments. Mean (SD) age, TBS, and lumbar spine BMD at baseline were 47.11 (9.53), 1.424 (0.097), and 0.935 (0.183) gm/cm2, respectively. Baseline TBS was lower in tertiary 1.38 (0.07) vs secondary hyperparathyroidism 1.43 (0.01) vs post-parathyroidectomy 1.46 (0.11); P = .035. Trabecular bone score and BMD significantly decreased from baseline->6 months, changes after that at consecutive time points were non-significant. 11% had incident fractures during the follow-up period, majority being metatarsal with no vertebral or hip fractures noted. This first prospective evaluation of TBS and BMD evolution at multiple time points over 5 years suggest that microarchitectural and bone density deteriorations post-renal transplantation stabilize after 6 months. Stabilization of these parameters could partially account for the absence of major fractures noted in this Asian population. Possible genetic and ethnic differences in fracture risk between Asian and Caucasian renal transplant patients have to be explored through large population-based studies.

Different brain rhythms, consisting of both low and fast frequencies, are grouped within complex wave-sequences. These rhythms serve as powerful synchronizing forces and play important roles in all aspects of higher cortical function. During this symposium a review of the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits will be reviewed along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms. The relationship between intrinsic hippocampal rhythms and learning and memory will be discussed. Aberrant rhythms may contribute to pathological processes such as memory impairment. There is also increasing evidence that high frequency oscillations may precede epilepsy in both the immature and mature brain, having an important role in epileptogenesis. Dr. Jerome Engle will review the physiological basis of brain rhythms and the role of high frequency oscillations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Dr.Yehezkel Ben-Ari will discuss the role of high frequency stimulations in the mirror focus in immature animals. Dr. Robert Muller will provide information about the relationship between single cell firing patterns, hippocampal rhythms, and learning. Dr. John Huguenard will discuss oscillations in the thalamocortical system and the mechanisms of epileptic synchrony. This session will emphasize that epilepsy and its related morbidities are caused by neuronal network abnormalities. The brain's rhythms are critical in determining whether these networks perform normally or abnormally.

AB  - Summary: There is compelling evidence that epithelial cells (ECs) at mucosal surfaces, beyond their role in creating a physical barrier, are integral components of innate and adaptive immunity. The capacity of these cells to license the functions of specific immune cell populations in the airway and gastrointestinal tract offers the prospect of novel therapeutic strategies to target multiple inflammatory diseases in which barrier immunity is dysregulated. In this review, we discuss the critical functions of EC-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-25 (IL-25), and IL-33 in the development and regulation of T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine-dependent immune responses. We first highlight recent data that have provided new insights into the factors that control expression of this triad of cytokines and their receptors. In addition, we review their proinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions in models of mucosal infection and inflammation. Lastly, we discuss new findings indicating that despite their diverse structural features and differential expression of their receptors, TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 cross-regulate one another and share overlapping properties that influence Th2 cytokine-dependent responses at mucosal sites.

AB  - Abstract The Japanese Dermatological Association prepared guidelines focused on the treatment of skin ulcers associated with connective tissue disease/vasculitis practical in clinical settings of dermatological care. Skin ulcers associated with connective tissue diseases or vasculitis occur on the background of a wide variety of diseases including, typically, systemic sclerosis but also systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), various vasculitides and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Therefore, in preparing the present guidelines, we considered diagnostic/therapeutic approaches appropriate for each of these disorders to be necessary and developed algorithms and clinical questions for systemic sclerosis, SLE, dermatomyositis, RA, vasculitis and APS.

AB  - 1 Ajay Gupta, and 2 Mohamad Mikati ( 1 Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon ) There is a unique, apparently heterogeneous, group of epilepsy syndromes in children that is characterized by sleep activation of the epileptiform abnormalities with nearly continuous sharp waves seen on the scalp EEG during sleep. These include commonly recognized childhood conditions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES), and benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC). Most of these children have a period of normal development and healthy childhood. Besides presenting with seizures that are often not too difficult to treat, these children have other major cognitive, behavioral and academic difficulties that are disproportionate to the burden of epilepsy and medications used to treat them. It is commonly believed that abnormal electrical activity in sleep per se leads to cognitive, behavioral, and academic difficulties in these children. However, the pathophysiological understanding of this phenomenon of sleep activation and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Moreover, there are also controversies regarding terminology, classification, and management of these disorders. Some experts believe that these conditions are distinct disease entities while others hypothesize that they may represent a spectrum of one condition. Similar sleep activation of epileptic discharges has also been reported in some other children with neuroimaging abnormalities in the deep gray nuclei. Some experts believe that the treatment with antiepileptic medications in these children should be titrated to the EEG response in sleep and not to the clinical response of seizures. It is unclear as to how often a sleep EEG should be done, and to what extent aggressive medical treatment and antiepileptic polytherapy be pursued. Use of steroids, recent success with high dose nightly benzodiazepine therapy, and surgical procedure like multiple subpial transactions in the insular regions continue to be controversial due to risk of serious side effects and modest benefits in reported anecdotal case reports and series. The focus of this symposium is to revisit these syndromes to: a) define the clinical spectrum of these conditions; b) formulate the best practices for management in the light of controversies in medical and surgical options; and c) discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders and probe future strategies for better treatment. Margret Shouse will show similarities between kindled epileptic kittens and sleep activation of EEG in children with these conditions. She will review the potential mechanisms and generators of EEG activity during sleep, discuss how the cognitive and behavioral sequelae may occur regardless of severe seizure burden. Edouard Hirsch will discuss the available clinical evidence to suggest that these ?disorders may be a clinical spectrum of one condition? and not distinct disease entities. He will also discuss diagnostic criteria and role of neuroimaging. Jim Rivello will review the available evidence, and emphasize the best clinical practices for management in these children. First, he will discuss the goals of treatment i.e. seizure control, behavior improvement, cognition monitoring, and sleep EEG improvement. Second, he will formulate a treatment and follow-up plan with indications for various medical (anti epileptic agents, steroids, nightly benzodiazepenes etc.) and surgical (multiple subpial transactions) options. Each speaker will also formulate an important research question for the future that will improve our understanding of these conditions for devising better treatment methods. Live interaction with the diverse group of audience will also provide a forum to discuss where and how we should move forward with a collaborative effort for advancing our knowledge and treatment of these conditions.
