AB  - Summary Traumatic injuries to the musculoskeletal system are extremely common. These injuries are among the short list of medical disorders that may be completely resolved if recognized and appropriately treated. Radiologists have an important role in the diagnosis. In order to identify the abnormality and characterize it correctly, it is essential to be familiar with normal anatomy, protocols for imaging tests, patterns of injury, and implement an organized approach to image interpretation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) devised guidelines for selecting the appropriate imaging test in a patient who sustained musculoskeletal trauma. This chapter deals with different imaging tests, including radiographs, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound. The radiology report needs to be concise, yet include relevant information required for effective clinical management. It is important to be familiar with common fracture classification systems and understand how different grades of injury potentially affect treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Surviving multi-trauma is strongly associated with emergent resuscitation and treatment in modern medical facilities. Multi-trauma survival before the advent of modern medicine is likely to have been extremely uncommon, particularly in primitive societies. The aim of this study was to investigate the case of an ancient Australian Aboriginal who appeared to have survived multi-trauma. Methods:? We investigated the skeletal remains of an adult Australian Aboriginal with healed fractures of the right femur and humerus. The time of death was assessed by carbon dating. The sex and approximate age of the subject were assessed from the skeleton's morphometry. The fractured bones were assessed by visual inspection, plain radiographs and computer tomography (CT) scanning. Results:? The remains were of a male aged approximately 50 years at the time of his death, approximately 1000 years ago, preceding European settlement. Analysis of the malunions indicated that all fractures occurred in one traumatic event, normally a life-threatening injury combination, and that the subject survived for years after this incident, despite no or failed active treatment of his fractures. Conclusions:? The survival of a man living in a primitive society after multi-trauma reflects an impressive depth of nursing and social support in a community of hunter gatherers.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - Abstract??? Traumatized teeth present a clinical challenge with regard to their diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis. Recent developments in imaging systems have enabled clinicians to visualize structural changes effectively. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cone beam computed tomography are among the most commonly used systems for dental and maxillofacial surgery. The purpose of this review is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and the clinical application for dento-alveolar trauma. Three clinical cases are described to illustrate the potential use of the NewTom 3G for diagnosis and treatment plan of dento-alveolar traumatic injuries.

AB  - Abstract Time-out protocols have reportedly improved team dynamics and patients? safety in various clinical settings ? particularly in the operating room. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a Trauma Care checklist, which outlines steps to follow immediately after the primary and secondary surveys and prior to the team leaving the patient. The WHO Trauma Care checklist's main perceived benefit is the prompting of clinicians to complete trauma admissions as per evidence-based guidelines. The WHO Trauma Care checklist, while likely to be successful in reducing errors of omission related to hospital admission, may be limited in its ability to reduce errors that occur in the initial 30 min of trauma reception ? when most of the life-saving decisions are made. To address this limitation a Trauma Team Time-out protocol is proposed for initial trauma resuscitation, targeting the critical first 30 min of hospital reception.

AB  - Abstract Trauma to the facial area accounts for a significant number of admissions to the emergency department. Diagnostic imaging is almost always required, and is critical in determining patient management. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) appears consistently in the literature as the gold-standard imaging modality for facial bones, but results in a high radiation dose to the patient. This makes the application and advancement of dose reduction and dose optimisation methods vital. This narrative review presents a critical analysis of the literature concerning diagnostic imaging of facial bone trauma, with an emphasis on dose reduction methods for MDCT. Databases including Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Scopus were used to investigate this topic, with the key words: facial bone trauma, computed tomography (CT) imaging and dose reduction. Exclusion criteria included studies on nasal bone fracturing, dental imaging, elective surgeries and paediatric imaging. The literature shows overwhelming support for MDCT, given its accuracy, efficiency and ease of operation. Noise reducing reconstruction algorithms show promise as a successful method of dose reduction in facial bone imaging. Investigations of more innovative techniques also appear within the literature, including diagnostic cone-beam CT (CBCT), intraoperative CBCT and dual-source CT (DSCT), but further research is required to confirm their clinical value.

AB  - Abstract Background Functional recovery is an important outcome for those who survive critical illness. The present study aimed to assess nutrition provision and nutrition-related outcomes in a multi-trauma cohort following intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Methods The present study investigated a prospective cohort of patients discharged from an ICU, who had been admitted because of major trauma and required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h. Nutrition-related outcomes, including body weight, quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT), handgrip strength and subjective global assessment, were recorded on ICU discharge, days 5?7 post-ICU discharge and then weekly until hospital discharge. Nutrition intake was recorded for 5 days post-ICU discharge. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the mean (SD). Results Twenty-eight patients [75% males, 55 (22.5) years] were included. Intake met 64% (28%) of estimated energy and 72% (32%) of protein requirements over the 5 days post-ICU discharge, which was similar to over the ICU admission. From ICU admission to hospital discharge, the mean reduction in weight was 4.2 kg (95% confidence interval = 2.2?6.3, P < 0.001) and after ICU discharge, the mean reduction in weight and QMLT was 2.6 kg (95% confidence interval = 1.0?4.2, P = 0.004) and 0.23 cm (95% confidence interval = 0.06?0.4, P = 0.01), respectively. Conclusions Patients received less energy and protein than estimated requirements after ICU discharge. Weight loss and reduction in QMLT also occurred during this period.

AB  - Objectives To analyse the contemporary management of renal injuries in a UK major trauma centre and to evaluate the utility and value of re-imaging. Patients and methods The prospectively maintained ?Trauma Audit and Research Network? database was interrogated to identify patients with urinary tract injuries between January 2014 and December 2017. Patients? records and imaging were reviewed to identify injury grades, interventions, outcomes, and follow-up. Results Renal injury was identified in 90 patients (79 males and 11 females). The mean (sd; range) age was 35.5 (17.4; 1.5?94) years. Most of the renal traumas were caused by blunt mechanisms (74%). The overall severity of injuries was: 18 (20%) Grade I, 19 (21%) Grade II, 27 (30%) Grade III, 22 (24%) Grade IV, and four (4%) Grade V. Most patients (84%) were managed conservatively. Early intervention (<24 h) was performed in 14 patients (16%) for renal injuries. Most of these patients were managed by interventional radiology techniques (nine of 14). Only two patients required an emergency nephrectomy, both of whom died from extensive polytrauma. In all, 19 patients underwent laparotomy for other injuries and did not require renal exploration. The overall 30-day mortality was 13%. Re-imaging was performed in 66% of patients at an average time of 3.4 days from initial scan. The majority of re-imaging was planned (49 patients) and 12% of these scans demonstrated a relevant finding (urinoma, pseudoaneurysm) that altered management in three of the 49 patients (6.1%). Conclusion Non-operative management is the mainstay for all grades of injury. Haemodynamic instability and persistent urine leak are primary indications for intervention. Open surgical management is uncommon. Repeat imaging after injury is advocated for stable patients with high-grade renal injuries (Grade III?V), although more research is needed to determine the optimal timing.

AB  - Purpose To visualize healthy and abnormal articular cartilage, we investigated the potential of using the 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) signal's magnitude and frequency and maps of relaxation. Materials and Methods After optimizing imaging parameters in five healthy volunteers, 3D multi-echo GRE magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired at 3T in four patients with chondral damage prior to their arthroscopic surgery. Average magnitude and frequency information was extracted from the GRE images, and maps were generated. Cartilage abnormalities were confirmed after arthroscopy and were graded using the Outerbridge classification scheme. Regions of interest were identified on average magnitude GRE images and compared to arthroscopy. Results All four patients presented with regions of Outerbridge Grade I and II cartilage damage on arthroscopy. One patient had Grade III changes. Grade I, II, and III changes were detectable on average magnitude and maps, while Grade II and higher changes were also observable on MR frequency maps. For average magnitude images of healthy volunteers, the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnitude image averaged over three echoes was 4.26?±?0.32, 12.26?±?1.09, 14.31?±?1.93, and 13.36?±?1.13 in bone, femoral, tibial, and patellar cartilage, respectively. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the feasibility of using different imaging contrasts from the 3D multi-echo GRE scan to visualize abnormalities of the articular cartilage. ? 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Level of Evidence: 1 J.

AB  - ABSTRACT Orthopedic trauma, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruption, is a common source of osteoarthritis in the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive multi-planar imaging modality commonly used to evaluate hard and soft tissues of diarthrodial joints following traumatic injury. The contrast provided by generated images enables the evaluation of bone marrow lesions as well as delamination and degeneration of articular cartilage. We will provide background information about MRI signal generation and decay (T1 and T2 values), the utility of morphologic MRI, and the quantitative MRI techniques of T1?, T2, and T2* mapping, to evaluate subjects with traumatic knee injuries, such as ACL rupture. Additionally, we will provide information regarding the dGEMRIC, sodium, and gagCEST imaging techniques. Finally, the description and utility of newer post hoc analysis techniques, such as texture analysis, will be given. Continued development and refinement of these advanced MRI techniques will facilitate their clinical translation. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) at this Major Trauma Centre; to determine independent predictors of multi-region injury; and to evaluate the accuracy of the decision to perform WBCT in detecting multi-region injury. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed at a single Major Trauma Centre in New South Wales, Australia. All adult patients who triggered trauma team activation and required an initial CT scan were studied. Primary outcome was the presence of multi-region injury. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to derive a prediction model for the need for WBCT based on our primary outcome. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the accuracy of the derived model and the clinical decision to perform WBCT. Results Six hundred and sixty patients were studied. WBCT scanning rate was 9.3% of all trauma activations. Of the patients who underwent WBCT, 31/98 (32.0%) had multi-region injury compared with 31/562 (5.5%) who underwent selective CT scanning (P < 0.001). Predictors of multi-region injuries were GCS <9 (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3?7.0, P = 0.01), full trauma activation (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5?5.3, P = 0.001), fall >5?m (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8?13.4, P = 0.003) and pedal cyclist (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2?7.5, P = 0.02). Area under ROC curve for the clinical decision to perform WBCT was 0.70 (95% CI 0.63?0.76) compared with 0.74 (95% CI 0.67?0.80) for the prediction model. Conclusion The decision to perform WBCT scans in trauma should be at the discretion of the treating clinician. Applying a prediction rule would increase the number of WBCT scans performed without improving overall accuracy.

AB  - SUMMARY One hundred and ninety-five magnetic resonance (MR) images (1.5 Tesla) of 167 patients with neurological impairment following spinal trauma were reviewed. Acute cord injury produces central haemorrhagic necrosis that extends transversely and longitudinally with time and increased injury severity. Oedoma is more homogeneous, extensive and dominant in minimal lesions. Magnetic resonance appearances correlate with neurological status and outcome. Patients with MR evidence of cord blood had severe clinical lesions and failed to show useful clinical improvement. Patients with homogeneous ?oedema?improved to useful function. Lesion signal inhomogeneity relates to a worse prognosis. The clinical level correlates closely with cord blood or signal in homogeneity but imprecisely with homogeneous oedema. Disc herniations require differentiation from epidural blood and venous engorgement, which are prominent with bone displacement. Magnetic resonance is recommended in incomplete cord syndromes and in cord injuries with no apparent fracture, particularly if clinically deteriorating. Chronic injury consists of cavitation, extensive gliosis, cord atrophy and leptomeningeal fibrosis. Progressive myelopathy may result from cystic or non-cystic intramedullary lesions. Cord cysts are common and cyst fluid signal should closely follow cerebrospinal fluid. Turbulent cyst fluid motion is commoner in larger cysts and may predict those cysts more prone to propagate. Progressive syrinxes show typical appearances, usually with transverse septa. Atrophy and propagating syrinxes usually take years to develop. Leptomeningeal cysts and spinal stenosis caused by bone displacement and accelerated adjacent disc disease may cause late deterioration. In progressive myelopathy following injury, surgically drainable cysts are clearly differentiable from cord gliosis and atrophy.

AB  - Abstract T1? describes the spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame and has been proposed for detecting damage to the cartilage collagen-proteoglycan matrix in osteoarthritis. In this study, a multi-slice T1? imaging method for knee cartilage was developed using spin-lock techniques and a spiral imaging sequence. The adverse effect of T1 regrowth during the multi-slice acquisition was eliminated by RF cycling. Agarose phantoms with different concentrations, 10 healthy volunteers, and 9 osteoarthritis patients were scanned at 3T. T1? values decreased as agarose concentration increased. T1? values obtained with imaging methods were compared with those obtained with spectroscopic methods. T1? values obtained during multi-slice acquisition were validated with those obtained in a single slice acquisition. Reproducibility was assessed using the average coefficient of variation of median T1?, which was 0.68% in phantoms and 4.8% in healthy volunteers. There was a significant difference (P = 0.002) in the average T1? within patellar and femoral cartilage between controls (45.04 ± 2.59 ms) and osteoarthritis patients (53.06 ± 4.60 ms). A significant correlation was found between T1? and T2; however, the difference of T2 was not significant between controls and osteoarthritis patients. The results suggest that T1? relaxation times may be a promising clinical tool for osteoarthritis detection and treatment monitoring. Magn Reson Med, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background Computed tomography (CT) is an essential diagnostic tool for severe multi-trauma patients. International guidelines recommend an optimal time of 1?h from arrival. The aim of this study was to determine the time interval from arrival at the emergency department to CT for all trauma patients and the effects on in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay. Methods Retrospective study of all patients who triggered a trauma call and underwent CT scanning at the Gold Coast University Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Exclusion criteria were scans performed at peripheral hospitals or performed more than 5?h after arrival to emergency department. Results One thousand six hundred and nineteen eligible trauma patients were admitted over the study period and underwent CT scanning. Median time to CT was found to be 43?min. CTs done within 1?h compared to those done after 1?h from emergency department arrival were found to have a higher mean injury severity score (11 ±?10 versus 9 ±?9, P =?0.003), a longer mean hospital length of stay (9 ±?21 versus 7 ±?13?days, P =?0.012) and no difference in mortality rates (2.2% versus 2.1%, P =?1.000). Age, injury severity score and intubation status were identified as independent predictors for longer hospital length of stay and higher mortality while time to CT did not. Injury severity score was shown to be an independent predictor of time to CT. Conclusion Our time to CT scanning is well within the timeframe recommended by international guidelines. Early CT scanning may also improve outcomes in severely injured trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of canine brain diseases are often nonspecific. Single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques allow quantification of chemical biomarkers for tissues of interest and may help to improve diagnostic specificity. However, published information is currently lacking for the in vivo performance of these two techniques in dogs. The aim of this prospective, methods comparison study was to compare the performance of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy in the brains of eight healthy, juvenile dogs using 3 Tesla MRI. Ipsilateral regions of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy were performed in symmetric regions of interest of each brain in the parietal (n = 3), thalamic (n = 2), and piriform lobes (n = 3). In vivo single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios from the same size and multi-voxel spectroscopy ratios from different sized regions of interest were compared. No significant difference was seen between single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios for any lobe when regions of interest were similar in size and shape. Significant lobar single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy differences were seen between the parietal lobe and thalamus (P = 0.047) for the choline to N-acetyl aspartase ratios when large multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest were compared to very small multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest within the same lobe; and for the N-acetyl aspartase to creatine ratios in all lobes when single-voxel spectroscopy was compared to combined (pooled) multi-voxel spectroscopy datasets. Findings from this preliminary study indicated that single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques using 3T MRI yield comparable results for similar sized regions of interest in the normal canine brain. Findings also supported using the contralateral side as an internal control for dogs with brain lesions.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - ABSTRACT A cat was presented in coma following severe trauma. The cat was alert and walking within 24 hours, after treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and mannitol. However, he subsequently began to show evidence of severe abdominal pain. An exploratory laparotomy revealed traumatic avulsion of the left limb of the pancreas. A sub-total pancreatectomy was performed and the cat recovered well. Two weeks post-operatively, the cat was re-presented with ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, and upper motor neuron weakness in all four limbs. Radiographs revealed a fracture/luxation of C1?C2 which could not be adequately stabilized solely via a dorsal approach. A combined ventral and dorsal approach produced stabilization of the cervical spine which was clinically successful. Two months post-operatively there was stability but malalignment of C1?C2, and the cat appeared normal.

AB  - Abstract Introduction:? The present article reviews the clinical and imaging clearance of the thoracic and lumbar spines of blunt trauma victims and the evolution of these strategies with the use of new imaging technologies. Methods:? A comprehensive literature search was performed, and articles identified were critically appraised Results:? Twenty papers were identified, 12 directly comparing computed tomography screening with plain X-rays. Evidence-based protocols are presented. The evolution of imaging strategies in response to new technology is described. Conclusions:? Thoracolumbar spine screening is best done using reformatted images acquired when scanning the chest and abdomen of high-risk multi-trauma patients. If computed tomography is not clinically indicated for investigation of other injuries then plain films are the first line investigation.

AB  - Abstract Few studies have prospectively analysed the delivery of care in trauma patients. This study undertook a prospective analysis of performance and consistency of care at a Level 1 trauma centre. A 3-month prospective study was undertaken of all admitted trauma patients at Liverpool Hospital. Data were collected on patient demographics, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), length of hospital stay, patient outcome and cause of death. Delivery of care was evaluated using 30 performance indicators and assessment of errors. Two hundred and thirty-six consecutive major trauma patients were studied. 73.3% were male, mean age 39 years. The main mechanism of injury was road trauma in 46.2%. Mean ISS was 12 and 64 patients had an ISS ≥16. Error-free care was delivered in 145/236 (61.4%). There were 145 errors in 91 patients (38.6%). Errors in judgement and delays in diagnosis accounted for 56/145 (38.6%) and 48/145 (33.1%), respectively. Errors occurred most commonly in the Emergency Department (ED) (48.3%), and trainees from all specialties were responsible for 67.5% of errors. There were 25 near misses detected. Three patients developed major sequelae or complications from errors. One of 13 deaths was deemed potentially preventable. This study has shown that while 61.4% of admitted trauma patients receive optimal care, errors are frequent, resulting in a spectrum of outcomes from near misses to death. The majority of errors result from the activity of unsupervised trainees and relate to errors in judgement and delays in diagnosis. Clearly, there is room for improvement of the delivery of trauma care.

AB  - ABSTRACT Trauma is the most common cause of death and significant morbidity in childhood; abusive head trauma (AHT) is a prominent cause of significant morbidity and mortality in children younger than 2 years old. Correctly diagnosing AHT is challenging both clinically and radiologically. The primary diagnostic challenges are that the abused children are usually too young to provide an adequate history, perpetrators are unlikely to provide truthful account of trauma, and clinicians may be biased in their assessment of potentially abused children. The main radiological challenge is that there is no single imaging finding that is independently specific for or diagnostic of AHT. The radiological evaluation should be based on the multiplicity and severity of findings and an inconsistency with the provided mechanism of trauma. While the most common neuroimaging finding in AHT is subdural hemorrhage, other less well-known magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings such as the ?lollipop sign? or ?tadpole sign,? parenchymal or cortical lacerations, subpial hemorrhage, cranio-cervical junction injuries including retroclival hematomas, as well as diffuse hypoxic brain injury have been identified and described in the recent literature. While AHT is ultimately a clinical diagnosis combining history, exam, and neuroimaging, familiarity with the typical as well as the less-well known MRI findings will improve recognition of AHT by radiologists.
