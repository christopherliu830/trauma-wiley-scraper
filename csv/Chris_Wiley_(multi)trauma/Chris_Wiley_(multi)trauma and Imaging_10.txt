AB  - Abstract Damage to specific white matter tracts within the spinal cord can often result in the particular neurological syndromes that characterize myelopathies such as traumatic spinal cord injury. Noninvasive visualization of these tracts with imaging techniques that are sensitive to microstructural integrity is an important clinical goal. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)- and magnetization transfer (MT)-derived quantities have shown promise in assessing tissue health in the central nervous system. In this paper, we demonstrate that DTI of the cervical spinal cord can reliably discriminate sensory (dorsal) and motor (lateral) columns. From data derived from nine healthy volunteers, two raters quantified column-specific parallel (?||) and perpendicular (??) diffusivity, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and MT-weighted signal intensity relative to cerebrospinal fluid (MTCSF) over two time-points separated by more than 1?week. Cross-sectional means and standard deviations of these measures in the lateral and dorsal columns were as follows: ?||: 2.13?±?0.14 and 2.14?±?0.11??m2/ms; ??: 0.67?±?0.16 and 0.61?±?0.09??m2/ms; MD: 1.15?±?0.15 and 1.12?±?0.08??m2/ms; FA: 0.68?±?0.06 and 0.68?±?0.05; MTCSF: 0.52?±?0.05 and 0.50?±?0.05. We examined the variability and interrater and test-retest reliability for each metric. These column-specific MR measurements are expected to enhance understanding of the intimate structure-function relationship in the cervical spinal cord and may be useful for the assessment of disease progression.

AB  - Abstract Advances in orthopedic and arthroscopic surgical procedures of the knee such as, knee replacement, ligamentous reconstruction as well as articular cartilage and meniscus repair techniques have resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy or open surgery. As a consequence postoperative MR imaging examinations increase. Comprehensive knowledge of the normal postoperative MR imaging appearances and abnormal findings in the knee associated with failure or complications of common orthopedic and arthroscopic surgical procedures currently undertaken is crucial. This article reviews the various normal and pathological postoperative MR imaging findings following anterior and posterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament and posterolateral corner reconstruction, meniscus and articular cartilage surgery as well as total knee arthroplasty with emphasis on those surgical procedures which general radiologists will likely be faced in their daily clinical routine.

AB  - Summary The restoration of a tooth or teeth damaged by trauma can be challenging. The hydrophobic dimethacrylate monomer or its derivations, such as urethane dimethacrylate (UMDA) form the basis of modern day composite resins. Other components include inhibitors, to prevent premature resin polymerisation and colour stabilizers. The reattachment approach can be used for both uncomplicated and complicated crown fractures. The concept of working from final form is crucial to allow the clinician to carefully control the composite build-up. The key to an aesthetic Class IV build-up can be broken down into four elements: shape, shade, surface texture, and polishing. The chapter presents the clinical sequence followed in the tooth restoration. Final bonding of the porcelain restoration can then be carried out to optimise the enamel, by etching for 30 seconds, washing, and drying thoroughly before applying bond and curing.

AB  - Abstract Trauma involving the dentoalveolar region is a frequent occurrence which can result in the fracturing and displacement of teeth, crushing and/or fracturing of bone and soft tissue injuries including contusions, abrasions and lacerations. This review describes the assessment of patients with these injuries, not in a didactic sense by repeating excellent already published classifications and treatment options, but by addressing questions that arise during assessment. It covers trauma first aid, examination of the patient, factors that affect treatment planning decisions, and the importance of communicating treatment options and prognosis to traumatized patients.

AB  - We report four cases of occult pneumothorax in patients who had suffered blunt trauma. In each case supine chest X-rays failed to diagnose an anterior pneumothorax. Subsequent spiral computerised tomography scans of the chest showed anterior pneumothoraces in all cases. In two of the cases anterior pneumothoraces were present in spite of a chest drain having been placed in the pleural cavity. We recommend the insertion of anteriorly positioned chest drains to relieve pneumothoraces in severely injured trauma patients.

AB  - Objective: To describe clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features in dogs with compressive cervical myelopathy due to acute suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion. Design: Retrospective case series. Animals: Ten dogs with compressive cervical myelopathy caused by acute suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion. Materials and Methods: Medical records and magnetic resonance images of dogs evaluated from 2005 through 2010 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were clinical signs compatible with cervical myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine performed within 48 hours after onset, magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with compressive suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion, complete medical records and follow-up information. Results: Six dogs were presented with acute onset tetraplegia and four dogs with acute onset of nonambulatory tetraparesis. Compromised respiratory function was present in three dogs. Compressive suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion was found on magnetic resonance imaging at the C4-C5 (n=6), C3-C4 (n=3) and C5-C6 (n=1) intervertebral disc spaces. Seven dogs underwent surgical treatment and three dogs were treated conservatively. All dogs except one regained ambulatory status within two weeks after the onset, and had a favourable outcome. Clinical Significance: Compressive myelopathy caused by acute suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion has not been reported previously and, even though neurological deficits can be severe on presentation, outcome is favourable.

AB  - Background Management of frontal sinus trauma includes coronal or direct open approaches through skin incisions to either ablate or obliterate the frontal sinus for posterior table fractures and openly reduce/internally fixate fractured anterior tables. The objective of this prospective case-series study was to evaluate outcomes of frontal sinus anterior and posterior table trauma using endoscopic techniques. Methods Prospective evaluation of patients undergoing surgery for frontal sinus fractures was performed. Data were collected regarding demographics, etiology, technique, operative site, length involving the posterior table, size of skull base defects, complications, and clinical follow-up. Results Forty-six patients (average age, 42 years) with frontal sinus fractures were treated using endoscopic techniques from 2008 to 2016. Mean follow-up was 26 (range, 0.5 to 79) months. Patients were treated primarily with a Draf IIb frontal sinusotomies. Draf III was used in 8 patients. Average fracture defect (length vs width) was 17.1 ? 9.1 mm, and the average length involving the posterior table was 13.1 mm. Skull base defects were covered with either nasoseptal flaps or free tissue grafts. One individual required Draf IIb revision, but all sinuses were patent on final examination and all closed reductions of anterior table defects resulted in cosmetically acceptable outcomes. Conclusion Frontal sinus trauma has traditionally been treated using open approaches. Our findings show that endoscopic management should become part of the management algorithm for frontal sinus trauma, which challenges current surgical dogma regarding mandatory open approaches.

AB  - Abstract Background? Trauma is a leading cause of death and although the gut is recognized as the ?motor? of post-traumatic systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure, studies on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are few. Our objectives were to create a precisely controllable tissue injury model in which GI motility, systemic inflammation and wound fluid can be analyzed. Methods? A non-narcotic murine trauma model was developed by the subcutaneous dorsal trans-implantation of a devitalized donor syngeneic harvested tissue?bone matrix (TBX), which was precisely adjusted to % total body weight and studied after 21?h. Gastrointestinal transit histograms were plotted after the oral administration of non-digestible FITC-dextran and geometric centers calculated. Organ bath evaluated jejunal circular muscle contractility. Multiplex electrochemiluminescence measurements of serum and TBX wound fluid inflammatory mediators were performed. Key Results? Increasing TBX amounts progressively delayed transit, whereas TBX heat denaturation or decellularization prevented ileus and death. In the TBX17.5% model, jejunal muscle contractility was suppressed and a systemic inflammatory response developed as significant serum elevations in IL-6, keratinocyte cytokine and IL-10 compared to sham. In addition, inflammatory responses within the wound fluid showed elevated levels of preformed IL-1? and TNF-α, whereas, 21?h after implantation IL-1?, IL-6 and keratinocyte cytokine were significantly increased in the wound. Conclusions & Inferences? A novel donor tissue?bone matrix trauma model was developed that is precisely adjustable and recapitulates important clinical phenomena. The non-narcotic model demonstrated that increasing tissue injury progressively caused ileus, initiated a systemic inflammatory response and developed inflammatory changes within the wound.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To compare and evaluate two novel diffusion-weighted sequences, based either on fast spin-echo (FSE) or interleaved echo-planar imaging (EPI) methods, as potential tools for investing spinal cord abnormalities. Materials and Methods Following recent improvements, both interleaved EPI (IEPI) and FSE techniques could be alternative approaches for rapid diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Therefore, a navigated diffusion-weighted multishot FSE sequence and a fat-suppressed navigated diffusion-weighted IEPI sequence with local shimming capabilities were tested. Both methods were compared in a consecutive series of five healthy volunteers and five patients with suspected intramedullary lesions. The sequences were graded qualitatively as either superior, inferior, or equal in quality, and also quantitatively by measuring the amount of ghosting artifacts in the background. Quantitative measurements of the diffusion coefficients within the spine were included. Results The overall image quality of IEPI was superior to FSE. Two out of five FSE scans were rated with poor image quality, whereas all IEPI scans were of sufficient quality. The ghosting levels ranged from approximately 3.3% to 6.2% for IEPI and from approximately 7.5% to 18.9% for FSE. Diffusion coefficients measured in healthy volunteers were similar for both IEPI and FSE, but showed higher fluctuations with the FSE technique. Conclusion Despite potential advantages of FSE, the IEPI technique is preferable for DWI applications in the spinal cord. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2002;15:364?373. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? Imaging is an integral diagnostic tool in mass fatality investigations undertaken traditionally by plain X-rays, fluoroscopy, and dental radiography. However, little attention has been given to appropriate image reporting, secure data transfer and storage particularly in relation to the need to meet stringent judicial requirements. Notwithstanding these limitations, it is the risk associated with the safe handling and investigation of contaminated fatalities which is providing new challenges for mass fatality radiological imaging. Mobile multi-slice computed tomography is an alternative to these traditional modalities as it provides a greater diagnostic yield and an opportunity to address the requirements of the criminal justice system. We present a new national disaster victim/forensic identification imaging system?Fimag?which is applicable for both contaminated and non-contaminated mass fatality imaging and addresses the issues of judicial reporting. We suggest this system opens a new era in radiological diagnostics for mass fatalities.

AB  - This symposium highlights advanced cone-beam CT (CBCT) technologies in four areas of emerging application in diagnostic imaging and image-guided interventions. Each area includes research that extends the spatial, temporal, and/or contrast resolution characteristics of CBCT beyond conventional limits through advances in scanner technology, acquisition protocols, and 3D image reconstruction techniques. Dr. G. Chen (University of Wisconsin) will present on the topic: Advances in C-arm CBCT for Brain Perfusion Imaging. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, and a fraction of people having an acute ischemic stroke are suitable candidates for endovascular therapy. Critical factors that affect both the likelihood of successful revascularization and good clinical outcome are: 1) the time between stroke onset and revascularization; and 2) the ability to distinguish patients who have a small volume of irreversibly injured brain (ischemic core) and a large volume of ischemic but salvageable brain (penumbra) from patients with a large ischemic core and little or no penumbra. Therefore, ?time is brain? in the care of the stroke patients. C-arm CBCT systems widely available in angiography suites have the potential to generate non-contrast-enhanced CBCT images to exclude the presence of hemorrhage, time-resolved CBCT angiography to evaluate the site of occlusion and collaterals, and CBCT perfusion parametric images to assess the extent of the ischemic core and penumbra, thereby fulfilling the imaging requirements of a ?one-stop-shop? in the angiography suite to reduce the time between onset and revascularization therapy. The challenges and opportunities to advance CBCT technology to fully enable the one-stop-shop C-arm CBCT platform for brain imaging will be discussed. Dr. R. Fahrig (Stanford University) will present on the topic: Advances in C-arm CBCT for Cardiac Interventions. With the goal of providing functional information during cardiac interventions, significant effort has been expended to improve the quantitative accuracy of C-arm CBCT reconstructions. The challenge is to improve image quality while providing very short turnaround between data acquisition and volume data visualization. Corrections for x-ray scatter, view aliasing and patient motion that require no more than 2 iterations keep processing time short while reducing artifact. Fast, multi-sweep acquisitions can be used to permit assessment of left ventricular function, and visualization of radiofrequency lesions created to treat arrhythmias. Workflows for each imaging goal have been developed and validated against gold standard clinical CT or histology. The challenges, opportunities, and limitations of the new functional C-arm CBCT imaging techniques will be discussed. Dr. W. Zbijewski (Johns Hopkins University) will present on the topic: Advances in CBCT for Orthopaedics and Bone Health Imaging. Cone-beam CT is particularly well suited for imaging of musculoskeletal extremities. Owing to the high spatial resolution of flat-panel detectors, CBCT can surpass conventional CT in imaging tasks involving bone visualization, quantitative analysis of subchondral trabecular structure, and visualization and monitoring of subtle fractures that are common in orthopedic radiology. A dedicated CBCT platform has been developed that offers flexibility in system design and provides not only a compact configuration with improved logistics for extremities imaging but also enables novel diagnostic capabilities such as imaging of weight-bearing lower extremities in a natural stance. The design, development and clinical performance of dedicated extremities CBCT systems will be presented. Advanced capabilities for quantitative volumetric assessment of joint space morphology, dual-energy image-based quantification of bone composition, and in-vivo analysis of bone microarchitecture will be discussed, along with emerging applications in the diagnosis of arthritis and osteoporosis and assessment of novel therapies. Finally, Dr. J. Boone (UC Davis) will present on the topic: Advances in CBCT for Breast Imaging. Breast CT has been studied as an imaging tool for diagnostic breast evaluation and for potential breast cancer screening. The breast CT application lends itself to CBCT because of the small dimensions of the breast, the tapered shape of the breast towards higher cone angle, and the fact that there are no bones in the breast. The performance of various generations of breast CT scanners developed in recent years will be discussed, focusing on advances in spatial resolution and image noise characteristics. The results will also demonstrate the results of clinical trials using both computer and human observers. Learning Objectives: Understand the challenges, key technological advances, and emerging opportunities of CBCT in: 1.Brain perfusion imaging, including assessment of ischemic stroke 2.Cardiac imaging for functional assessment in cardiac interventions 3.Orthopedics imaging for evaluation of musculoskeletal trauma, arthritis, and osteoporosis 4.Breast imaging for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Work presented in this symposium includes research support by: Siemens Healthcare (Dr. Chen); NIH and Siemens Healthcare (Dr. Fahrig); NIH and Carestream Health (Dr. Zbijewski); and NIH (Dr. Boone).

Fahrig (Stanford University) will present on the topic: Advances in C-arm CBCT for Cardiac Interventions. With the goal of providing functional information during cardiac interventions, significant effort has been expended to improve the quantitative accuracy of C-arm CBCT reconstructions. The challenge is to improve image quality while providing very short turnaround between data acquisition and volume data visualization. Corrections for x-ray scatter, view aliasing and patient motion that require no more than 2 iterations keep processing time short while reducing artifact. Fast, multi-sweep acquisitions can be used to permit assessment of left ventricular function, and visualization of radiofrequency lesions created to treat arrhythmias. Workflows for each imaging goal have been developed and validated against gold standard clinical CT or histology. The challenges, opportunities, and limitations of the new functional C-arm CBCT imaging techniques will be discussed. Dr. W. Zbijewski (Johns Hopkins University) will present on the topic: Advances in CBCT for Orthopaedics and Bone Health Imaging. Cone-beam CT is particularly well suited for imaging of musculoskeletal extremities. Owing to the high spatial resolution of flat-panel detectors, CBCT can surpass conventional CT in imaging tasks involving bone visualization, quantitative analysis of subchondral trabecular structure, and visualization and monitoring of subtle fractures that are common in orthopedic radiology. A dedicated CBCT platform has been developed that offers flexibility in system design and provides not only a compact configuration with improved logistics for extremities imaging but also enables novel diagnostic capabilities such as imaging of weight-bearing lower extremities in a natural stance. The design, development and clinical performance of dedicated extremities CBCT systems will be presented. Advanced capabilities for quantitative volumetric assessment of joint space morphology, dual-energy image-based quantification of bone composition, and in-vivo analysis of bone microarchitecture will be discussed, along with emerging applications in the diagnosis of arthritis and osteoporosis and assessment of novel therapies. Finally, Dr. J. Boone (UC Davis) will present on the topic: Advances in CBCT for Breast Imaging. Breast CT has been studied as an imaging tool for diagnostic breast evaluation and for potential breast cancer screening. The breast CT application lends itself to CBCT because of the small dimensions of the breast, the tapered shape of the breast towards higher cone angle, and the fact that there are no bones in the breast. The performance of various generations of breast CT scanners developed in recent years will be discussed, focusing on advances in spatial resolution and image noise characteristics. The results will also demonstrate the results of clinical trials using both computer and human observers. Learning Objectives: Understand the challenges, key technological advances, and emerging opportunities of CBCT in: 1.Brain perfusion imaging, including assessment of ischemic stroke 2.Cardiac imaging for functional assessment in cardiac interventions 3.Orthopedics imaging for evaluation of musculoskeletal trauma, arthritis, and osteoporosis 4.Breast imaging for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Work presented in this symposium includes research support by: Siemens Healthcare (Dr. Chen); NIH and Siemens Healthcare (Dr. Fahrig); NIH and Carestream Health (Dr. Zbijewski); and NIH (Dr. Boone).

AB  - Abstract The Chinese version of the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS-C) was developed to respond to the need of Chinese-speaking individuals. The DTS is a validated self-rating scale used in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The DTS-C is translated from DTS through a two-stage translation. Subjects were drawn from a sample of 210 survivors of the 21 September 1999, Chi-Chi Earthquake. The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.97) and test?retest reliability (r = 0.88). Concurrent validity was obtained against the clinical diagnostic interview, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 at DTS-C score of 44. It showed that the sensitivity was 0.9, specificity 0.81, positive likelihood ratio 4.74, and negative likelihood ratio 0.12. The recommended stratum-specific likelihood ratios were 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05?0.20) for the score range 0?39, 4 (2.22?7.23) for the score range of 40?59, and 6.14 (3.42?11.02) for the scores above 60. In PTSD diagnosed subjects, the factor structures closely resembled the DSM-IV grouping of PTSD symptoms. The psychometric strength of DTS-C is reliable for its future use, particularly for screening for subjects with possible diagnosis of PTSD.

AB  - Abstract We have developed a magnetic resonance molecular imaging method using a novel iron-oxide contrast agent targeted towards P-selectin ? MNP-PBP (magnetic nanoparticle-P-selectin binding peptide) ? to image endothelial activation following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. MNP-PBP consists of ?1000 PBP ligands (primary sequence: GSIQPRPQIHNDGDFEEIPEEYLQ GGSSLVSVLDLEPLDAAWL) conjugated to a 50?nm diameter aminated dextran iron oxide particle. In vitro P- and E-selectin binding was assessed by competition ELISA. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male C57/BL 6 mice followed by contrast injection (MNP-PBP; MNP-NH2; Feridex; MNP-PBP-FITC) at 24?h after reperfusion and T2 magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4 T was performed. Infarction and microvasculature accumulation of contrast agent was assessed in coronal brain sections. MNP-PBP attenuated antibody binding to P-selectin by 34.8?±?1.7%. P-selectin was preferentially increased in the infarct hemisphere and MNP-PBP-FITC accumulation in the infarct hemisphere microvasculature was observed. Compared with the nontargeted iron oxide agents MNP-NH2 and Feridex, MNP-PBP showed a significantly greater T2 effect within the infarction. MR imaging of P-selectin expression with a targeted iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent may reveal early endothelial activation in stroke and other neuroinflammatory states.

AB  - Summary Ultrasound imaging has been utilized as a useful diagnostic tool in medicine and biology. It can offer real-time, non-radiative, and functional imaging in the visualization of internal body structures. In particular, various ultrasound techniques have been applied to diagnose skin diseases in dermatology. In this chapter, after the basic principles of ultrasound are introduced, ultrasound imaging systems, including ultrasound transducers, are demonstrated. Also, various applications of current ultrasound imaging techniques such as high-frequency ultrasound, ultrasound elastographic, and quantitative ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis of skin lesions are demonstrated in detail.

AB  - Objectives The current study examined shame in a clinical sample recovering from a first episode of psychosis by focusing on the contribution of different types of shame to post-psychotic trauma while controlling for current affective symptoms. Design The study used a cross-sectional correlational design. Method Fifty individuals who met the criteria for a psychotic disorder whose acute psychotic symptoms were in remission completed measures of internal and external shame associated with psychosis, general shame, post-psychotic trauma, and depression. Results Post-psychotic trauma symptoms were correlated with internal and external shame associated with psychosis and general shame. However, the relation between post-psychotic trauma and external shame associated with psychosis remained after controlling for general shame and current affective symptoms. In addition, internal shame had a stronger association with depression. Thus, internal and external shame due to psychosis had different associations with different types of post-psychotic emotional dysfunction. Conclusions The results support the importance of assessing shame as a multi-faceted construct and suggest that assessing shame directly associated with mental illness is a worthwhile endeavour. Practitioner Points Assessing different types of shame following psychosis can inform assessments, formulations, and interventions with post-psychotic trauma. Our results support the application of Compassionate Mind Therapy to psychosis. However, we did not assess self-criticism or self-reassurance. We also did not investigate the relation between specific psychotic symptoms and different types of shame.
