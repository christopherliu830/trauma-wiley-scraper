AB  - Summary A 22-year-old Friesian gelding was presented with a history of chronic, nonresolving lameness localised to the right front foot. Radiographs showed a smoothly marginated circular lucent area with a rim of increased opacity adjacent to the solar canal of the distal phalanx. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a reversed V-shaped smoothly demarcated space-occupying mass causing invagination of the solar laminae towards the solar canal arch and deformity of the adjacent surface of the distal phalanx. The mass was removed surgically and submitted for histopathology, which revealed a keratoma and periosteal fibrosis. Six weeks post-surgery the horse returned to the previous work level and 8 months follow-up showed no recurrence of keratoma. This report highlights the usefulness of MRI as a diagnostic modality for solar keratoma.

AB  - Aim In this observational study using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor, we investigated the differential effects of pathology, stage of disease, state of consciousness, and aetiology on the modifications of supra- and infra-tentorial white matter tracts and their correlations with clinical scales in paediatric patients with severe non-traumatic brain injury. Method Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) was obtained from seven children with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; five males, two females; age at event 5y; standard deviation [SD] 2y 1mo), six children in a minimally conscious state (MCS; three males, three females; age at event 5y 10mo; SD 5y), and 10 healthy children as controls(two males, eight females; age at study 10y 10mo; SD 2y 10mo). Fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were calculated for the corpus callosum, inferior, middle (MCP), and superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP). Results DT-MRI parameters from corpus callosum and SCP differed between patients and controls. MCP abnormalities were detected in patients presenting non-traumatic composite aetiology (n=4) versus those suffering from pure anoxia (n=9). The supra-tentorial compartment was more damaged (i.e. decreased fractional anisotropy and increased diffusivities) than the infra-tentorial one. Correlations were found between DT-MRI abnormalities and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. Interpretation In paediatric UWS/MCS, the severity of clinical disability correlates with white matter tract abnormalities.

AB  - Purpose Direct myelin imaging can improve the characterization of myelin-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In this study, we explore a novel method to directly image myelin using inversion recovery-prepared hybrid encoding (IR-HE) UTE MRI. Methods The IR-HE sequence uses an adiabatic inversion pulse to suppress the long T2 white matter signal, followed by 3D dual-echo HE utilizing both single point imaging and radial frequency encoding, for which the subtraction image between 2 echoes reveals the myelin signal with high contrast. To reduce scan time, it is common to obtain multiple spokes per IR. Here, we invented a novel method to improve the HE, adapted for the multi-spoke IR imaging?termed interleaved HE?for which single point imaging encoding is interleaved between radial frequency encodings near nulling point to allow more efficient IR-signal suppression. To evaluate the proposed approach, a computer simulation, myelin phantom experiment, an ex vivo experiment with a cadaveric multiple sclerosis brain, and an in vivo experiment with 8 healthy volunteers and 13 multiple sclerosis patients were performed. Results The computer simulation showed that IR-interleaved HE allows for improved contrast of myelin signal with reduced imaging artifacts. The myelin phantom experiment showed IR-interleaved HE allows direct imaging of myelin lipid with excellent suppression of water signal. In the ex vivo and in vivo experiments, the proposed method demonstrated highly specific imaging of myelin in white matter of the brain. Conclusion IR-interleaved HE allows for time-efficient, high-contrast direct myelin imaging and can detect demyelinated lesions in multiple sclerosis patients.

AB  - Hydrocephalus was diagnosed in a juvenile African Grey parrot by high-field strength (4.7-Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Excellent anatomic detail was achieved, and there was severe dilation of all ventricles. Relative obstruction was localized to the level of or beyond the outflow of the fourth ventricle. There have been several reports of hydrocephalus diagnosed postmortem in psittacines (i.e., hook-billed parrots), however, this is the first report of an antemortem diagnosis in a psittacine using high-field strength MRI.

AB  - Background Prehospital management of the traumatically injured patient has evolved significantly since the organization of emergency medical services across the United States in the 1970s. Initially focusing on the utilization of crystalloid solutions to restore shed blood volume, robust military and civilian trauma experiences led to a modern day shift towards balanced blood component and ultimately whole blood use for immediate volume replacement. In addition, prehospital transfusion or remote damage control resuscitation (RDRC) has been widely adopted. This has led to point of injury resuscitation using blood products both in the United States and abroad. Objectives This article will review the evolution of civilian and military prehospital resuscitation as well as the current practice of prehospital whole blood transfusion in the civilian trauma population in the United States. Additionally, we will provide an overview of our regional trauma system's use of whole blood with focus on the programme infrastructure, donor programme, product rotation schedule and logistical challenges. Finally, we provide three case report examples of the effective use of whole blood in our civilian emergency medical services (EMS) programs.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, disabling psychiatric disorder prevalent among civilian and military personnel in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). Current trauma-focused psychotherapies may place high emotional demands and lengthy treatment commitment that may hinder successful treatment completion for some patients. Accelerated resolution therapy (ART) is an emerging trauma-focused psychotherapy that is briefer than most current treatments. Materials and Methods This review describes the ART clinical protocol and theoretical underpinnings, its relationship to current treatments and formal established treatment guidelines and empirical research data. Also presented are new subgroup data for the use of ART among clients with PTSD and concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), and among US Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel with extensive combat-related trauma exposure. Treatment response was defined as ≥10-point reduction on the 17-item PCL-M (PTSD Checklist). Results In subgroup analyses, mean treatment with ART consisted of approximately four sessions. Among 202 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates (assuming no response for non-completers) by TBI status were as follows: no TBI (58.1%, n = 105), mild TBI (60.4%, n = 48), moderate/severe TBI (46.9%, n = 49). Among 141 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates by SOF status were as follows: non-SOF (54.3%, n = 116), SOF (60.0%, n = 25). Conclusion The ART protocol aligns closely with established first-line trauma-focused psychotherapies and clinical guidelines. It appears to provide frequent clinical relief of symptoms of PTSD in an average of four sessions among military personnel with challenging clinical presentations, including concomitant TBI and extensive operational combat-related trauma.

AB  - Summary: Background: Liver metastases are much more common than primary malignant tumours of the liver, and diagnosis is largely based on imaging findings. Thus, the radiologist plays a key role in the management of patients with suspected liver metastases by accurately detecting or excluding liver metastases. A variety of imaging techniques can be used for this purpose. ?Methods: We have reviewed the literature addressing the diagnostic yield of different imaging modalities for the detection of liver metastases. Emphasis is laid upon the preoperative evaluation of colorectal liver metastases with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. ?Results: Sonography is a widely available and low-cost examination technique, but it has limitations in the detection of metastases, with an overall sensitivity of approximately 50?%. Preliminary experience with contrast-enhanced sonography is promising, as this technique is able to depict subcentimetre lesions more accurately. The standard imaging technique for staging in patients with extrahepatic neoplasms at high risk for developing liver metastases is contrast-enhanced helical CT, with a reported sensitivity of 58???85?%. The development of multidetector array CT has recently expanded CT to the ?third dimension? by providing excellent multiplanar imaging capability. CT during arterial portography (CTAP), which has been the ?gold standard? of preoperative liver imaging, has largely been abandoned because of its invasiveness and its high rate of false positive diagnoses (13???31?%) due to tumour-like perfusion defects in the liver. MR imaging with liver-specific contrast agents has been shown to be at least as accurate as CTAP, with a sensitivity of 85???90?%. In many institutions, contrast-enhanced MR imaging has become the procedure of choice for preoperative assessment. Positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) may help in the characterization of small liver lesions and in the detection of extrahepatic spread of disease. ?Conclusions: The diagnostic strategy for assessing liver metastases must take into account (i) the histology of the primary neoplasm, (ii) the clinical situation, and (iii) the planned therapeutic procedure, thereby ensuring that the optimal radiological examination is chosen.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To review the distribution of orbital and intracranial disease in canine and feline patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist and to correlate results of MRI with pathologic conditions including neoplasia, suspected optic neuritis (ON) and orbital cellulitis. Recognized and emerging imaging techniques are reviewed. Procedure? Medical records of 79 canine and 13 feline patients were reviewed. Results? Neoplasia was diagnosed in 53/92 (57.6%) of patients. The most prevalent types of neoplasia were carcinoma (16/53, 30.1%), sarcoma (11/53, 20.8%), lymphoma (8/53, 15.1%) and presumptive meningioma (9/53, 17.0%). Carcinomas and sarcomas were characterized by bony lysis and intracranial/sinonasal extension. Lymphoma was generally unilateral, less invasive and originated from the ventromedial orbit. Intracranial masses representing presumptive meningiomas frequently exhibited a ?dural tail? sign. Diagnosis of suspected ON was made in 13 of 92 (14.1%) patients. Results of MRI in patients with suspected ON included unilateral optic nerve hyperintensity (3/13, 23.0%), bilateral optic nerve hyperintensity (1/13, 7.7%) and optic chiasmal hyperintensity (3/13, 23.0%). Seven suspected ON patients demonstrated intracranial multifocal patchy contrast enhancement (7/13, 53.8%). Diagnosis of orbital cellulitis was made in 12/92 (13.0%) patients. Conclusions? Orbital neoplasia was the most common pathologic condition detected. Essential Roentgen characteristics are helpful when diagnosing pathologic processes and providing prognoses in cases of orbital or intracranial disease. Magnetic resonance imaging comprises an important diagnostic component in cases of suspected ON. Emerging contrast and functional MRI techniques as well as SI data may increase our ability to characterize disease processes.

AB  - Summary In the current study, we investigated whether suppression can produce an amplified memory for a traumatic experience. Participants viewed a distressing film depicting a multi-fatality car accident. We broke the film down into several short clips, some of which were removed. After viewing the film, we instructed participants to (i) suppress and monitor film-related thoughts, (ii) think freely and monitor film-related thoughts or (iii) just think freely. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a recognition test. Memory distortion was comparable across conditions; however, suppression and monitoring of trauma-related thoughts removed the typical bias to falsely remember the most critical and traumatic clips of the film over the least critical clips. Our data suggest that suppression may be effective in reducing trauma-related cognitions and, therefore, does not predict a more ?amplified? memory for trauma. Instead, suppression and thought monitoring encourage an unbiased, although inaccurate, memory for trauma.Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Visualizing overall tissue architecture in three dimensions is fundamental for validating and integrating biochemical, cell biological and visual data from less complex systems such as cultured cells. Here, we describe a method to generate high-resolution three-dimensional image data of intact mouse gut tissue. Regions of highest interest lie between 50 and 200 ?m within this tissue. The quality and usefulness of three-dimensional image data of tissue with such depth is limited owing to problems associated with scattered light, photobleaching and spherical aberration. Furthermore, the highest-quality oil-immersion lenses are designed to work at a maximum distance of ≤10?15 ?m into the sample, further compounding the ability to image at high-resolution deep within tissue. We show that manipulating the refractive index of the mounting media and decreasing sample opacity greatly improves image quality such that the limiting factor for a standard, inverted multi-photon microscope is determined by the working distance of the objective as opposed to detectable fluorescence. This method negates the need for mechanical sectioning of tissue and enables the routine generation of high-quality, quantitative image data that can significantly advance our understanding of tissue architecture and physiology.

AB  - Summary This study aimed to discuss the role medical imaging has on diagnosis of musculoskeletal desmoid tumours and to describe their radiological appearances on various imaging modalities. Imaging of histologically proven cases of desmoid tumours at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne were obtained via picture archiving communication system (PACS) and then assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Suitable imagings were obtained from PACS. All imaging chosen was de-identified. Desmoid tumours can occur in many areas of the body. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of these tumours and magnetic resonance imaging has been the gold standard for imaging and is the most accurate in terms of assessing tumour margins and involvement of surrounding structures.

An RF system composed of a transverse electromagnetic transmit coil and an eight-channel receive-only array was developed for 7  T upper extremity applications. The RF system was characterized and evaluated using scattering parameters and B1+ mapping. Finite difference time domain simulations were performed to evaluate the B1+ field distribution and specific absorption rate for the forearm region of the upper extremity. High-resolution 7  T images were acquired and compared with those at 3 T. The simulation and experimental results show very good B1+ field homogeneity across the forearm. High-resolution images of musculotendinous, osseocartilaginous, and neurovascular structures in the upper extremity are presented with T1 volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination, T2 double-echo steady state, T2* susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion tensor imaging, and time-of-flight sequences. Comparison between 3  T and 7  T is shown. Intricate contextual anatomy can be delineated in synovial, fibrocartilaginous, interosseous, and intraosseous trabecular structures of the forearm, as well as palmar and digital vascular anatomy (including microvascular detail in SWI). Ultra-high-field 7  T imaging holds great potential in improving the sensitivity and specificity of upper extremity imaging, especially in wrist and hand pathology secondary to bone, ligament, nerve, vascular, and other soft or hard tissue etiology.

AB  - Objectives:? High resolution two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) difficulty in evaluation of some scrotal mass lesions is not frequent. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional ultrasound extended imaging (3D XI) in characterization of those lesions. Methods:? The study protocol had the approval of the University's review board all participants' informed consents were obtained. The study included 28 selected patients (12 testicular and 16 para-testicular mass lesions) examined by 2D US and 3D XI applications including computed multi-slice view (MSV) and multi-resolution enhanced images (XI MR). Results were correlated with histopathological findings. Results:? Two-dimensional ultrasound did not adequately characterize 28 patients out of 329 (8.5%). 3D XI interrogation was an easy procedure and distinctive of the pathological findings in 27 patients out of 28 (96.4%). The performance of XI MR with respect to characterization provided additional diagnostic information over MSV. Conclusions:? The performance of 3D XI with respect to testicular mass characterization proved better than static 2D US. Subsequently, the results of this study suggest that the routine use of 2D US in diagnosis of scrotal mass lesions should preferably be upgraded to 3D XI methods.

AB  - Surprisingly often in the psychoanalyses of chronically depressed patients, depression represents an unconscious attempt to psychically cope with unbearable psychic pain following severe traumatisation: dissociative states, a chronified psychic state of shock, a disappearance of emotions, an emptying of the self and the object relationships, as well as a disappearance of the psyche in the body are among the possible consequences. The treatment of these difficult groups of analysands can also frequently bring analysts to the limits of the endurable. Often related to this is the repeated danger of denying the trauma, and a re-traumatisation of the analysand in the analytic situation. The lecture discusses the fact that in comparison with other therapeutic approaches, psychoanalysis has a highly differentiated conceptualisation of the psychic determinants and the treatment of chronic depression at his disposal. However, in order to retain its creativity and innovation as a scientific discipline and to be thus perceived in the non-psychoanalytic world, it must constantly further develop its conceptualization by way of systematic and extra-clinical research ? as is witnessed in the insufficient conceptual account of severe traumatisation during the genesis of chronic depression. In this connection, several exemplary examples from extra-clinical studies in the sphere of psychotherapeutic research, neurobiology, epigenetics and embodied cognitive science will be accounted for. As will be treated in the final part of this paper, of no less importance are the conceptualizations in clinical research on psychoanalysis, which are based on meticulous, careful analyses of trauma reactivation in the transference, and understanding and working through them in the analytic relationship.

AB  - Abstract Objective To explore Australian psychologists' perspectives on the psychological treatment of complex posttraumatic stress disorder in young women aged 18?25?years with a history of childhood maltreatment. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 psychologists from Melbourne, Australia experienced in the provision of psychological services to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment. Data were analysed thematically. Results Two overarching themes revealed the significance of (a) the need for psychologists to establish trust with young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in the therapy context and (b) the development of trust within young women's intra and interpersonal relationships as a baseline for further growth and recovery, which is facilitated by the trust which develops within the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion Qualitative studies of this kind provide valuable insight into the experiences and opinions of psychologists who provide treatment to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in their daily psychological practices. This study revealed that according to psychologist?participants, the development and facilitation of trust and the ability to trust others is a central goal of psychological treatment for young women with complex trauma.

AB  - Abstract An acute trauma to the CNS rapidly results in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that include interleukin-1 (IL-1). We report here that the levels of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are also elevated following a corticectomy trauma injury to the mouse CNS. The delayed upregulation of MMPs compared to that for IL-1 suggests the possibility that inflammatory cytokines regulate MMP production in CNS trauma. To resolve this, we developed a method to isolate and maintain highly enriched human fetal neurons or astrocytes in culture and examined the regulation by cytokines of the activity of a subgroup of MMPs, the gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9). While both neuronal and astrocytic cultures displayed comparable MMP-2 activity, as evidenced by gelatin zymography, levels of MMP-9 were proportionately higher in neurons compared to astrocytes. Of a variety of cytokines and growth factors tested in vitro, only IL-1? was effective in increasing the neuronal expression of MMP-9. Finally, an IL-1 receptor antagonist attenuated the increase of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and abolished the injury-induced increase of MMP-9 in the mouse brain. These results implicate IL-1? as a key regulator of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and of the elevation of MMP-9 that occurs following mouse CNS trauma. J. Neurosci.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common combat injury, often through explosive blast, and produces heterogeneous brain changes due to various mechanisms of injury. It is unclear whether the vulnerability of white matter differs between blast and impact injury, and the consequences of microstructural changes on neuropsychological function are poorly understood in military TBI patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques were used to assess the neurocircuitry in 37 US service members (29 mild, 7 moderate, 1 severe; 17 blast and 20 nonblast), who sustained a TBI while deployed, compared to 14 nondeployed, military controls. High-dimensional deformable registration of MRI diffusion tensor data was followed by fiber tracking and tract-specific analysis along with region-of-interest analysis. DTI results were examined in relation to post-concussion and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The most prominent white matter microstructural injury for both blast and nonblast patients was in the frontal fibers within the fronto-striatal (corona radiata, internal capsule) and fronto-limbic circuits (fornix, cingulum), the fronto-parieto-occipital association fibers, in brainstem fibers, and in callosal fibers. Subcortical superior-inferiorly oriented tracts were more vulnerable to blast injury than nonblast injury, while direct impact force had more detrimental effects on anterior-posteriorly oriented tracts, which tended to cause heterogeneous left and right hemispheric asymmetries of white matter connectivity. The tractography using diffusion anisotropy deficits revealed the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar-cortical (CSTCC) networks, where increased post-concussion and PTSD symptoms were associated with low fractional anisotropy in the major nodes of compromised CSTCC neurocircuitry, and the consequences on cognitive function were explored as well.

AB  - Summary Despite an increasing number of case reports published using computed tomography (CT) in foals only limited data on its diagnostic utility are available. Medical and imaging records of 10 foals that had a CT examination between May 2008 and December 2010 were retrieved and studied. Three out of 10 cases were examined for orthopaedic problems, 3 were referred for medical disorders, 3 for both orthopaedic and medical problems, and one case was presented for a follow-up of an abdominal mass. In this series CT was an accurate diagnostic tool in identifying abscesses, osteomyelitis, arthritis, physitis and fractures, bone ossification defects, intracranial haematomas and sinusitis. An indication for the best medical and/or surgical approach was obtained.

AB  - Abstract Authors ? Mah J, Hatcher D Imaging is a keystone in understanding and delivery of craniofacial health care. Recent developments in imaging have brought forth many diverse technologies and approaches. This review provides the current status of methods in craniofacial imaging and discusses future needs and directions. New developments in three-dimensional dental and skeletal imaging, as well as three-dimensional facial image acquisition and animation of jaw movement and facial expression are reviewed. Visualization and convergence of the data from these technologies for construction of patient-specific models is described. Insights on how these technologies and approaches could impact research, education as well as the future of craniofacial health care will be discussed.
