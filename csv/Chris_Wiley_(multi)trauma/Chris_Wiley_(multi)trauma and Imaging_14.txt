AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Myelin water imaging (MWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provide information about myelin and axon-related brain microstructure, which can be useful for investigating normal brain development and many childhood brain disorders. While pediatric DTI atlases exist, there are no pediatric MWI atlases available for the 9-10 years old age group. As myelination and structural development occurs throughout childhood and adolescence, studies of pediatric brain pathologies must use age-specific MWI and DTI healthy control data. We created atlases of myelin water fraction (MWF) and DTI metrics for healthy children aged 9-10 years for use as normative data in pediatric neuroimaging studies. METHODS 3D-T1, DTI, and MWI scans were acquired from 20 healthy children (mean age: 9.6 years, range: 9.2-10.3 years, 4 females). ANTs and FSL registration were used to create quantitative MWF and DTI atlases. Region of interest (ROI) analysis in nine white matter regions was used to compare pediatric MWF with adult MWF values from a recent study and to investigate the correlation between pediatric MWF and DTI metrics. RESULTS Adults had significantly higher MWF than the pediatric cohort in seven of the nine white matter ROIs, but not in the genu of the corpus callosum or the cingulum. In the pediatric data, MWF correlated significantly with mean diffusivity, but not with axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, or fractional anisotropy. CONCLUSIONS Normative MWF and DTI metrics from a group of 9-10 year old healthy children provide a resource for comparison to pathologies. The age-specific atlases are ready for use in pediatric neuroimaging research and can be accessed: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pediatric-mri-myelin-diffusion/.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pancreaticoduodenal trauma (PDT) is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. In this study, contemporary trends were analysed using national data. Methods The Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 1998?2009 was queried for patients with PDT. Interventions including any operation (Any-Op) and pancreas-specific surgery (PSURG) were identified. Trends in treatment and outcomes were determined [complications, length of stay (LoS), mortality] for the Any-Op, PSURG and non-operative (Non-Op) groups. Analyses included chi-squared tests, Cochran?Armitage trend tests and logistic regression. Results A total of 27?216 patients (nationally weighted) with PDT were identified. Over time, the frequency of PDT increased by 8.3%, whereas the proportion of patients submitted to PSURG declined (from 21.7% to 19.8%; P = 0.0004) and the percentage of patients submitted to non-operative management increased (from 56.7% to 59.1%; P = 0.01). In the Non-Op group, mortality decreased from 9.7% to 8.6% (P < 0.001); morbidity and LoS remained unchanged at ?40% and ?12 days, respectively. In the PSURG group, mortality remained stable at ?15%, complications increased from 50.2% to 71.8% (P < 0.0001) and LoS remained stable at ?21 days. For all PDT patients, significant independent predictors of mortality included: the presence of combined pancreatic and duodenal injuries; penetrating trauma, and age >50 years. Having any operation (Any-Op) was associated with mortality, but PSURG was not a predictor of death. Conclusions The utilization of operations for PDT has declined without affecting mortality, but operative morbidity increased significantly over the 12 years to 2009. The development of an evidence-based approach to invasive manoeuvres and an early multidisciplinary approach involving pancreatic surgeons may improve outcomes in patients with these morbid injuries.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of the present study is to quantify utilisation of imaging for patients presenting to an ED with back pain, their characteristics and dispositions. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 1132 ED presentations for back pain to an Australian metropolitan ED in 2013 was performed. Patient demographics, rates of radiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and rates of subsequent admission and ED re-presentation were analysed. Results Patients aged 26?35?years were the largest group presenting with back pain (19.4% of presentations), with the majority being female (52.3%). Imaging was requested at 29.5% (n?=?334) of presentations (radiography n?=?297; advanced imaging n?=?63). Patients over 70?years had higher imaging rates than younger patients (49.4% vs 25.5%, P?<?0.001). Imaging was not associated with attendance during or outside office hours (29.3% vs 31.8%, P?=?0.4). Of presentations, 34.1% resulted in admission, with no association between imaging and admission (31.8% vs 36.0%, P?=?0.2) or ED re-presentation for back pain in the same year (6.5% vs 9.7%, P?=?0.09). Conclusion This study provides benchmark data on the use of imaging for back pain in an Australian ED, an area which has been largely unexplored. The rate of imaging in the ED was higher than previously reported in a General Practice setting. Consistent with guidelines, patients older than 70 were more than twice as likely to receive imaging compared to younger patients. It was beyond the scope of the current study to determine whether these images were clinically indicated and further research is required to determine if initiatives to reduce imaging in this population are warranted.

AB  - Abstract This chapter outlines the stress imaging techniques and discusses their potential clinical and research utility. Stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the stifle has been described for the purposes of evaluating meniscal integrity in cruciate ligament rupture (CR) stifles. Alternative measures of subluxation such as quantifying the distance between the proximal and distal attachment sites of the cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) may be required to compare cranio-caudal alignment between different time points or views. Evidence for the ability of tibial compression radiography to diagnose partial CR is conflicting. Nevertheless, stress radiography has been advocated to improve diagnostic accuracy by quantifying cranial tibial translation radiographically. With tibial compression radiography, the stressed views are obtained while performing the tibial compression test. The chapter describes the several devices for conducting stress radiography. The main advantage of standing radiography is that subluxation is caused by intrinsic forces occurring naturally rather than by an externally applied force.

AB  - Although uncommon, and despite the modern in diagnostic tools and therapeutic alternatives, retrohepatic and main hepatic veins injury remains associated with high mortality rate. Preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, and bullet trajectory may be a helpful sign in penetrating trauma patients. Patients and Methods? Hospital records of patients sustaining retroheptic vena cava (RHVC) injury were retrospectively reviewed as to diagnosis, associated injuries, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcome, last ten years. Results? Eight male, 17 to 45 (mean 27.5) years-old patients sustaining RHVC injury were reviewed. Mean trauma indexes for the 8 cases were: ISS 36.6, RTS 7.55 and TRISS 89.0; and for the group who died: ISS 41.6, RTS 7.18, and TRISS 80.5. Two patients had sustained blunt trauma (one died), and six had penetrating injuries (two died). The injury diagnosis was achieved during surgery in all cases. A transfixing RHV injury occurred in 4 (50% of the) patients, and was found in all the 3 patients who died. An atriocaval shunt was employed in four patients, 3 of them had with transfixing injury with two deaths. The number of associated injuries was higher in the patients who died. Overall mortality rate was 37.5%. Comments? Despite advances in image diagnosis, injuries to RHVC are frequently diagnosed during surgery. Tangential injuries were managed with direct approach and sutures, and to control blending in transfixing injuries, were managed with atriocaval shunts, before suture. Conclusion? Despite improvements in its diagnosis and management, RHVC injuries remain with a high mortality rate, mainly when transfixing, and associated with numerous associated injuries.

Nonselective computed tomography angiography with contrast medium injected peripherally via the jugular veins was used to evaluate the vascular supply to the distal limb. The use of this imaging technique demonstrated either intact or disrupted distal limb vasculature. The imaging results were verified with a positive long-term outcome in the case with a diagnosis of an intact vasculature and with histological findings of avascular necrosis in the case with a diagnosis of disrupted vasculature.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias show increasing clinical prevalence, yet our understanding of the etiology and pathobiology of disease-related neurodegeneration remains limited. In this regard, noninvasive imaging with radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) presents a unique tool for quantifying spatial and temporal changes in characteristic biological markers of brain disease and for assessing potential drug efficacy. PET radiotracers targeting different protein markers are being developed to address questions pertaining to the molecular and/or genetic heterogeneity of AD and related dementias. For example, radiotracers including [11C]-PiB and [18F]-AV-45 (Florbetapir) are being used to measure the density of A?-plaques in AD patients and to interrogate the biological mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. Our focus is on the development of novel PET imaging agents, targeting proteins beyond A?-plaques, which can be used to investigate the broader mechanism of AD pathogenesis. Here, we present the chemical basis of various radiotracers which show promise in preclinical or clinical studies for use in evaluating the phenotypic or biochemical characteristics of AD. Radiotracers for PET imaging neuroinflammation, metal ion association with A?-plaques, tau protein, cholinergic and cannabinoid receptors, and enzymes including glycogen-synthase kinase-3? and monoamine oxidase B amongst others, and their connection to AD are highlighted.

AB  - Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) has been shown to augment diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for the definition of irreversible ischemic injury. However, the complexity of cerebral structure/composition makes the kurtosis map heterogeneous, limiting the specificity of kurtosis hyperintensity to acute ischemia. We propose an Inherent COrrelation-based Normalization (ICON) analysis to suppress the intrinsic kurtosis heterogeneity for improved characterization of heterogeneous ischemic tissue injury. Fast DKI and relaxation measurements were performed on normal (n = 10) and stroke rats following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (n = 20). We evaluated the correlations between mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from the fast DKI sequence and relaxation rates R1 and R2, and found a highly significant correlation between MK and R1 (p < 0.001). We showed that ICON analysis suppressed the intrinsic kurtosis heterogeneity in normal cerebral tissue, enabling automated tissue segmentation in an animal stroke model. We found significantly different kurtosis and diffusivity lesion volumes: 147 ± 59 and 180 ± 66 mm3, respectively (p = 0.003, paired t-test). The ratio of kurtosis to diffusivity lesion volume was 84% ± 19% (p < 0.001, one-sample t-test). We found that relaxation-normalized MK (RNMK), but not MD, values were significantly different between kurtosis and diffusivity lesions (p < 0.001, analysis of variance). Our study showed that fast DKI with ICON analysis provides a promising means of demarcation of heterogeneous DWI stroke lesions.

AB  - Objective: To describe the computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging features of segmental caudal vena cava aplasia and associated vascular anomalies in dogs. Methods: A retrospective study was performed reviewing computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging archives of eight institutions for dogs with segmental caudal vena cava aplasia. Inclusion criteria included a computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging study and supportive diagnostic and follow-up information. Abdominal vessels were reviewed for size, shape, location and course (including tributaries and branches) and classified as normal, abnormal or shunt vessels. Results: Ten dogs with segmental caudal vena cava aplasia were identified. In all dogs, postrenal caval blood was shunted to either a right or a left azygos vein, with seven different angiographic patterns. Affected dogs were predominantly female (70 per cent) and young (mean 2·6 years). Additional portocaval and porto-azygos shunt vessels were identified in two cases each. Computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography depicted details of abdominal vessels including thrombus formation in one dog. Clinical Significance: Segmental caudal vena cava aplasia is a vascular congenital anomaly in the dog that can be associated with thrombosis and portosystemic shunts. Computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are excellent tools to demonstrate the complex vascular anatomy and to guide treatment planning for portosystemic shunts and thrombolytic therapy.

AB  - Abstract Multi-type maltreatment refers to the experience of more than one form of child maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect and witnessing family violence). Researchers have largely ignored the presence of other types of child abuse and neglect when examining the adjustment problems associated with a particular form of maltreatment. The association between ?multi-type maltreatment? and adjustment was explored in the current study. Retrospective data were obtained on (a) the degree to which maltreatment types co-occurred, (b) childhood family characteristics and (c) adjustment problems in adulthood in an Australian self-selected community sample (N=175). As hypothesized, a large degree of overlap was reported in the experience of the five types of maltreatment. Family characteristics?particularly family cohesion and adaptability?discriminated between respondents reporting single-type and multi-type maltreatment. Greater adjustment problems were associated with reports of a larger number of different maltreatment types. Multi-type maltreatment should be recognized as a crucial aspect of the nature and impact of child maltreatment and considered in the development of programmes for the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect.

AB  - Abstract The submission rates of feline uroliths to laboratories and the composition of uroliths have been reported in studies. The prevalence of uroliths reported on imaging findings has not been published. The objective of this retrospective study was to use imaging data to investigate the anatomical location and the prevalence of macroscopic in situ uroliths in cats. Radiographs, sonograms and imaging reports from two cohorts of cats (from New Zealand (n = 497) and the United States (n = 693)) from 2004-2013 were reviewed for the presence of in situ uroliths. Uroliths were categorized by their location in the lower or upper urinary tract. Radiographic studies were performed on 43% (212/497) of the cats from New Zealand and 50% (349/693) of the cats from the USA. Sonographic studies were performed on 57% (285/497) of the cats from New Zealand and 50% (344/693) of the cats from the USA. The total prevalence of uroliths was 3% in the New Zealand cohort and 13% in the USA cohort. Lower tract urolith prevalence in the New Zealand cohort was 2.4% (5/212) in cats ≤ 6y and 1.1% (3/285) in cats >6y. Upper tract urolith prevalence in the New Zealand cohort was 0.5% (1/212) in cats ≤ 6y and 1.8% (5/285) in cats >6y. Lower tract urolith prevalence in the United States cohort was 6.0% (11/183) in cats ≤ 6y and 2.9% (15/510) in cats >6y. Upper tract urolith prevalence in the United States cohort was 2.7% (5/183) in cats ≤ 6y and 10.2% (52/510) in cats >6y. The prevalence of uroliths in the upper tract or lower tract was low in the New Zealand cohort compared to that of cats in the USA cohort, irrespective of age category. Geographical location may be important when evaluating risk factors for feline urolithiasis.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The chronic effects of neurotrauma consortium (CENC) observational study is a multisite investigation designed to examine the long-term longitudinal effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). All participants in this initial CENC cohort had a history of deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), and/or their follow-on conflicts (Operation Freedom's Sentinel). All participants undergo extensive medical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments and either meet criteria for any lifetime mTBI or not. These assessments are integrated into six CENC core studies?Biorepository, Biostatistics, Data and Study Management, Neuroimaging, and Neuropathology. Methods The current study outlines the quantitative neuroimaging methods managed by the Neuroimaging Core using FreeSurfer automated software for image quantification. Results At this writing, 319 participants from the CENC observational study have completed all baseline assessments including the imaging protocol and tertiary data quality assurance procedures. Conclusions/Discussion The preliminary findings of this initial cohort are reported to describe how the Neuroimaging Core manages neuroimaging quantification for CENC studies.

AB  - Abstract Many US veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq have multiple physical and psychiatric problems. A major focus of research has been on determining the effects of mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), but mTBI is rarely diagnosed in the absence of co-occurring conditions such as blast exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse, etc. These potentially interactive psychological and physical conditions produce complex patterns of cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms that impede civilian reintegration and complicate efficient and effective treatment planning. The Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) has developed a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment of deployment trauma and its consequences in veterans of these wars. The prospective TRACTS longitudinal cohort study conducts state-of-the-art assessments in the domains of biomedical function, lifetime head trauma, psychological function encompassing deployment experience and lifetime exposure to traumatic events, neuropsychological function, and structural and functional neuroimaging. The TRACTS longitudinal cohort study is the first of its kind to comprehensively evaluate lifetime incidence of TBI and PTSD in these veterans, in addition to those incurred during military deployment. The protocol has begun to reveal information that will help improve understanding of the complex pathophysiology associated with co-occurring mTBI and related stress disorders.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with various neurocognitive deficits, and rapid assessment of the damage is potentially important for the prevention and treatment of these deficits. Imaging assessment of mild or moderate damage outside the primary lesion area after TBI, however, remains challenging. Magnetization transfer (MT) has clearly been underutilized in imaging the damage caused by TBI. Here, we applied the MT ratio (MTR) using sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) to study microstructural tissue damage in the thalamocortical pathway outside the primary lesion in a lateral fluid percussion injury rat model of TBI, 5 months after injury. MTR was decreased in layers VIb-IV of the barrel cortex and related subcortical areas, mainly indicating demyelination, which was verified by histology. The largest MTR change in the cortex was in layer VIb (?8.2%, pFDR = 0.01), and the largest MTR change in the subcortical areas was in the caudal-most portion of the internal capsule (?11.0%, pFDR < 0.005). These areas exhibited the greatest demyelination and substantial cellularity attributed to gliosis. Correlation analysis of group-averaged results from the subcortical areas revealed an excellent correlation of MTR with myelin (r2 = 0.94, p < 0.001), but no correlation with increased cellularity as detected by Nissl staining. Thus, MTR using SWIFT can be a valuable tool for the assessment of subtle changes after TBI in both cortical and subcortical areas.

AB  - Purpose The automated segmentation of each lung and trachea in CT scans is commonly taken as a solved problem. Indeed, existing approaches may easily fail in the presence of some abnormalities caused by a disease, trauma, or previous surgery. For robustness, we present ALTIS (implementation is available at http://lids.ic.unicamp.br/downloads) ? a fast automatic lung and trachea CT-image segmentation method that relies on image features and relative shape- and intensity-based characteristics less affected by most appearance variations of abnormal lungs and trachea. Methods ALTIS consists of a sequence of image foresting transforms (IFTs) organized in three main steps: (a) lung-and-trachea extraction, (b) seed estimation inside background, trachea, left lung, and right lung, and (c) their delineation such that each object is defined by an optimum-path forest rooted at its internal seeds. We compare ALTIS with two methods based on shape models (SOSM-S and MALF), and one algorithm based on seeded region growing (PTK). Results The experiments involve the highest number of scans found in literature ? 1255 scans, from multiple public data sets containing many anomalous cases, being only 50 normal scans used for training and 1205 scans used for testing the methods. Quantitative experiments are based on two metrics, DICE and ASSD. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the robustness of ALTIS in seed estimation. Considering the test set, the proposed method achieves an average DICE of 0.987 for both lungs and 0.898 for the trachea, whereas an average ASSD of 0.938 for the right lung, 0.856 for the left lung, and 1.316 for the trachea. These results indicate that ALTIS is statistically more accurate and considerably faster than the compared methods, being able to complete segmentation in a few seconds on modern PCs. Conclusion ALTIS is the most effective and efficient choice among the compared methods to segment left lung, right lung, and trachea in anomalous CT scans for subsequent detection, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of abnormal structures in the lung parenchyma and pleural space.

AB  - Abstract Omental cystic lymphangioma is an uncommon malformation that occurs in children. The authors report the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in a case of hemorrhagic cystic abdominal lymphangioma, which clinically mimicked a recurrent hemoperitoneum. They demonstrate the superiority of MR imaging relative to computed tomography and ultrasound in diagnosing large hemorrhagic cystic masses and differentiating them from free intraperitoneal fluid with multi-planar imaging and fluid characterization. This enables precise tumor localization and extension, aiding surgical resection.

AB  - Abstract Objective There is some speculation that an intact distal sphincter complex is of decisive importance for continence, although the external anal sphincter (EAS) is considered to be a single functional and anatomical entity. On trans-labial ultrasound (TLUS), the caudal slice at the level of the subcutaneous EAS is currently omitted from the diagnostic algorithm due to the prevalence of artefact at that level. Hence, we aim to determine the predictive value of assessment of the subcutaneous EAS for anal incontinence. Methods We analysed datasets of 463 women seen at our urogynaecological service in 2015. All underwent a standardized questionnaire including a St Mark's incontinence score (SMIS), clinical examination and 4D TLUS. Slices 1 to 7 were assessed and rated positive for a defect if the defect angle was >=30-degrees. Results While there was a highly significant association between all measures of anal incontinence (AI) and significant EAS trauma in slice 7, addition of the 7th slice to the existing 6-slice model did not improve the predictive value for AI. Conclusion As inclusion of the subcutaneous slice of the EAS on the TLUS does not seem to improve the predictive value of AI, the current methodology for EAS trauma on tomographic ultrasound can remain unchanged.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - Abstract In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of combined chlorine-35, sodium-23 and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4?Tesla, and present the first in vivo chlorine-35 images obtained by means of MRI. With the experimental setup used in this study all measurements could be done in one session without changing the setup or moving the subject. The multinuclear measurement requires a total measurement time of 2?h and provides morphological (protons) and physiological (sodium-23, chlorine-35) information in one scanning session. Chlorine-35, sodium-23 and high resolution proton images were acquired from a phantom, a healthy rat and from a rat displaying a focal cerebral infarction. Compared to the healthy tissue a signal enhancement of a factor of 2.2?±?0.2 in the chlorine-35 and a factor of 2.9?±?0.6 in the sodium-23 images is observed in the areas of infarction. Exemplary unlocalized measurement of the in vivo longitudinal and transversal relaxation time of chlorine-35 in a healthy rat showed multi-exponential behaviour. A biexponential fit revealed a fast and a slow relaxing component with T1,a?=?(1.7?±?0.4) ms, T1,b?=?(25.1?±?1.4) ms, amplitudes of A?=?0.26?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.74?±?0.02 and T2,a?=?(1.3?±?0.1) ms, T2,b?=?(11.8?±?1.1) ms, A?=?0.64?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.36?±?0.02. Combined proton, sodium-23 and chlorine-35 MRI may provide a new approach for non-invasive studies of ionic regulatory processes under physiological and pathological conditions in vivo.
