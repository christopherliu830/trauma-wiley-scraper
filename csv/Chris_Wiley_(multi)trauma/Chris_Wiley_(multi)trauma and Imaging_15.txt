AB  - Abstract In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of combined chlorine-35, sodium-23 and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4?Tesla, and present the first in vivo chlorine-35 images obtained by means of MRI. With the experimental setup used in this study all measurements could be done in one session without changing the setup or moving the subject. The multinuclear measurement requires a total measurement time of 2?h and provides morphological (protons) and physiological (sodium-23, chlorine-35) information in one scanning session. Chlorine-35, sodium-23 and high resolution proton images were acquired from a phantom, a healthy rat and from a rat displaying a focal cerebral infarction. Compared to the healthy tissue a signal enhancement of a factor of 2.2?±?0.2 in the chlorine-35 and a factor of 2.9?±?0.6 in the sodium-23 images is observed in the areas of infarction. Exemplary unlocalized measurement of the in vivo longitudinal and transversal relaxation time of chlorine-35 in a healthy rat showed multi-exponential behaviour. A biexponential fit revealed a fast and a slow relaxing component with T1,a?=?(1.7?±?0.4) ms, T1,b?=?(25.1?±?1.4) ms, amplitudes of A?=?0.26?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.74?±?0.02 and T2,a?=?(1.3?±?0.1) ms, T2,b?=?(11.8?±?1.1) ms, A?=?0.64?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.36?±?0.02. Combined proton, sodium-23 and chlorine-35 MRI may provide a new approach for non-invasive studies of ionic regulatory processes under physiological and pathological conditions in vivo.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Innovations are necessary to accommodate the increasing demands on emergency departments whilst maintaining a high level of patient care and safety. Radiographer Preliminary Image Evaluation (PIE) is one such innovation. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of radiographer PIE in clinical practice within an emergency department over 12 months. Methods A total of 6290 radiographic examinations were reviewed from 15 January 2016 to 15 January 2017. The range of adult and paediatric examinations incorporated in the review included the appendicular and axial skeleton including the chest and abdomen. Each examination was compared to the radiologist's report this allowed calculated mean sensitivity and specificity values to indicate if the radiographer's PIE was of a true negative/positive or false negative/positive value. Cases of no PIE participation or series? marked as unsure for pathology by the radiographer were also recorded. This allowed mean sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy to be calculated. Results The study reported a mean ± 95% confidence level (standard deviation) for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, no participation and unsure of 71.1% ± 2.4% (6.1), 98.4% ± 0.04% (0.9), 92.0% ± 0.68% (1.9), 5.1% (1.6) and 3.6% (0.14) respectively. Conclusions This study has demonstrated that the participating radiographers provided a consistent PIE service while maintaining a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy. This form of image interpretation can complement an emergency referrer's diagnosis when a radiologist's report is unavailable at the time of patient treatment. PIE promotes a reliable enhancement of the radiographer's role with the multi-disciplinary team.

AB  - Abstract Limb salvage in fungal osteomyelitis of the post-traumatic lower extremity represents a difficult clinical problem requiring aggressive management. We report lower extremity salvage by radical bony debridement, free tissue transfer, distraction osteogenesis with bone-docking, and a novel antifungal regimen in a clinical setting of infection with Scedosporium inflatum, historically requiring amputation in 100% of cases. We treated Scedosporium inflatum osteomyelitis of the tibia and calcaneus with radical debridement of infected bone, free partial medial rectus abdominis muscle flap coverage, transport distraction osteogenesis, and combination voriconazole/terbinafine chemotherapy, a novel antifungal regimen. We achieved successful control of the infection, limb salvage, and an excellent functional outcome through aggressive debridement of infected bone and soft tissue, elimination of dead space within the bony defect, the robust perfusion provided by the free flap, the hypervascular state induced by distraction osteogenesis, and the synergism of the novel antifungal regimen. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To identify and review evidence relating to the measurement properties of published multi-item outcome measures for the conservative management of lateral ligament injuries of the ankle. Methods? Systematic literature searches were used to identify measures, which were then assessed against pre-defined criteria relating to development, item content, reliability, validity and responsiveness. Results? Seven disease-specific measures of ankle status [Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool, Clinical Trauma Severity Score, Composite Inversion Injury Scale, Kaikkonen Functional Scale (KFS), Karlsson Ankle Function Score (KAFS), Olerud and Molander Ankle Score (OMAS), and the Point System] and two generic measures of health (McGill Pain Questionnaire, Sickness Impact Profile) met the review inclusion criteria. While all measures had been used in acute injuries, only two had also been applied during later stages of recovery (>6?months). The studies covered a comprehensive range of graded ligament injuries. Expert opinion dominated item generation for all measures. All measures lack evidence of test-retest or internal consistency reliability in patients with ankle sprain. Several measures were assessed for validity through comparison with other measures, but there was limited evidence of construct validity and no formal assessment of responsiveness for any measure. Conclusion? The disappointing lack of evidence for measurement properties suggests that any measure should be used with caution until appropriate evidence is provided. On the basis of limited evidence, the KFS offers the most promising approach to a combined clinician- and patient-assessment of ankle function, and the KAFS or OMAS if a patient-assessed evaluation of function is required.

AB  - Abstract: The methods adopted in the appraisal of the trauma of three communities after different disasters in the South Pacific are described and discussed. The outcome affirms the need for non-indigenous clinicians to be ready to adjust their concepts and methods to suit the cultural frameworks they encounter when they are invited abroad, and for local health professionals to be ready to share their knowledge and skills with their collegues from abroad. The outcome, it is argued, should improve the quality of service provided at all stages of disaster recovery, and still enable questions to be raised about matters of fundamental concern ? such as the power of religious belief and of social justice in the process of healing. These questions were found to be of particular importance in the context of the South Pacific cultures.

AB  - Summary Magnetic resonance imaging provides detailed visualisation, identification and extent assessment of many anal disorders. While many studies are performed in the evaluation of malignant processes such as anorectal carcinoma, the primary focus of this pictorial review is benign lesions, which involve the anal canal and perianal spaces. This pictorial review will illustrate the MRI appearances of a variety of benign conditions, which predominantly affect the anal canal, including abscess, fistulae, lipomas, developmental cysts and inflammatory conditions. MRI aids in the identification and characterisation of these abnormalities, of coexisting complications and differentiation from other perineal abnormalities. This pictorial review highlights the spectrum of non-malignant processes involving the perianal region.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

AB  - Abstract Drug addiction is a chronic brain disorder with no proven effective cure. Assessing both structural and functional brain alterations by using multi-modal, rather than purely unimodal imaging techniques, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying addiction, which in turn may facilitate future treatment strategies. However, this type of research remains scarce in the literature. We acquired multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging from 20 cocaine-addicted individuals and 19 age-matched controls. Compared with controls, cocaine addicts showed a multi-modal hypo-status with (1) decreased brain tissue volume in the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); (2) hypo-perfusion in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, right temporal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and (3) reduced irregularity of resting state activity in the OFC and limbic areas, as well as the cingulate, visual and parietal cortices. In the cocaine-addicted brain, larger tissue volume in the medial OFC, anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum and smaller insular tissue volume were associated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Decreased perfusion in the amygdala and insula was also correlated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Tissue volume, perfusion, and brain entropy in the insula and prefrontal cortex, all showed a trend of negative correlation with drug craving scores. The three modalities showed voxel-wise correlation in various brain regions, and combining them improved patient versus control brain classification accuracy. These results, for the first time, demonstrate a comprehensive cocaine-dependence and craving-related hypo-status regarding the tissue volume, perfusion and resting brain irregularity in the cocaine-addicted brain.

AB  - Purpose To design and validate a radiofrequency (RF) array coil for cervical spinal cord imaging at 7T. Methods A 19-channel receive array with a four-channel transmit array was developed on a close-fitting coil former at 7T. Transmit efficiency and specific absorption rate were evaluated in a B1+ mapping study and an electromagnetic model. Receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise amplification for parallel imaging were evaluated and compared with a commercial 3T 19-channel head?neck array and a 7T four-channel spine array. The performance of the array was qualitatively demonstrated in human volunteers using high-resolution imaging (down to 300 ?m in-plane). Results The transmit and receive arrays showed good bench performance. The SNR was approximately 4.2-fold higher in the 7T receive array at the location of the cord with respect to the 3T coil. The g-factor results showed an additional acceleration was possible with the 7T array. In vivo imaging was feasible and showed high SNR and tissue contrast. Conclusion The highly parallel transmit and receive arrays were demonstrated to be fit for spinal cord imaging at 7T. The high sensitivity of the receive coil combined with ultra-high field will likely improve investigations of microstructure and tissue segmentation in the healthy and pathological spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how photovoice action research (PVAR) aimed at addressing gender-based violence (GBV) also responds to trauma resulting from GBV. I conducted a content analysis of 17 publications that use PVAR to address GBV to assess for how the PVAR projects also treat trauma symptoms. Briere and Scott's (2015) philosophical approach to trauma therapy is the conceptual framework for data analysis. I developed a priori codes aligned with the philosophical approach and deductively applied them to the data: (a) intrinsic processing; (b) respect, positive regard, and compassion; (c) hope; and (d) the pain paradox. The results reveal how data from the 17 PVAR studies correspond with the 4 philosophical concepts. Practical and research recommendations include using and evaluating PVAR as a tool to treat trauma and contribute to trauma treatment research with underrepresented communities.

AB  - Abstract Imaging should only be undertaken if it is likely to influence patient management. The dose of ionising radiation to the patient should be considered. Requesting the appropriate imaging method requires an understanding of the pathological process. Plain x-ray should still generally be the first imaging technique; exceptions include some forms of superficial tendinopathy, in which ultrasound may be more appropriate, and situations where radiation exposure is contraindicated, such as in a pregnant patient. The cost of the examination to the patient and the community should also be considered (eg, ultrasound v magnetic resonance imaging).

AB  - Summary Emergency cricothyrotomy is a common feature in all difficult airway algorithms. It is the final step following a ?can't intubate, can't oxygenate? scenario. It is rarely performed and has a significant failure rate. There is variation in the reported size of the cricothyroid membrane, especially across population groups. Procedural failure may result from attempting to pass a device with too large an external diameter through the cricothyroid membrane. We aimed to determine the maximum height of the cricothyroid membrane in a UK trauma population. Electronic callipers were used to measure the maximum height of the cricothyroid membrane on 482 reformatted trauma computed tomography scans, 377 (78.2%) of which were in male patients. The mean (SD) height of the cricothyroid membrane, as independently measured by two radiologists, was 7.89 (2.21) mm and 7.88 (2.22) mm in male patients, and 6.00 (1.76) mm and 5.92 (1.71) mm in female patients. The presence of concurrent tracheal intubation or cervical spine immobilisation was found not to have a significant effect on cricothyroid membrane height. The cricothyroid membrane height in the study population was much smaller than that previously reported. Practitioners encountering patients who may require an emergency surgical airway should be aware of these data. Rescue airway equipment with variety of external diameters should be immediately available.

AB  - In this paper we review the current status of intravascular ultrasound. Data from qualitative and quantitative studies is presented. Our experimental findings and those of other investigators are reviewed. Intravascular ultrasound has been shown to delineate normal and abnormal arterial morphology as well as to identify and differentiate fibrous, lipid-rich, calcified plaques and complicated plaques. Quantitative studies show strong correlations between ultrasound and histology for lumen area, wall thickness, and plaque area. In vivo studies from our experimental work and clinical laboratory as well as the work of other researchers is presented. This data supports the potential of ultrasound imaging for guidance of intravascular intervention. The potential advantages and limitations of this new technology are discussed. This methodology shows promise for the assessment of the extent and severity of atherosclerosis, monitoring its progression and regression and guiding intravascular plaque ablation technologies.

AB  - Abstract Alterations in cerebrovascular function are evident acutely in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), although less is known about their chronic effects. Adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe TBI have been reported to demonstrate diffuse activation throughout the brain during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Because fMRI is a measure related to blood flow, it is possible that any deficits in blood flow may alter activation. An arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion sequence was performed on seven adolescents with chronic moderate to severe TBI and seven typically developing (TD) adolescents during the same session in which they had performed a social cognition task during fMRI. In the TD group, prefrontal CBF was positively related to prefrontal activation and negatively related to non-prefrontal, posterior, brain activation. This relationship was not seen in the TBI group, who demonstrated a greater positive relationship between prefrontal CBF and non-prefrontal activation than the TD group. An analysis of CBF data independent of fMRI showed reduced CBF in the right non-prefrontal region (p < .055) in the TBI group. To understand any role reduced CBF may play in diffuse extra-activation, we then related the right non-prefrontal CBF to activation. CBF in the right non-prefrontal region in the TD group was positively associated with prefrontal activation, suggesting an interactive role of non-prefrontal and prefrontal blood flow throughout the right hemisphere in healthy brains. However, the TBI group demonstrated a positive association with activation constrained to the right non-prefrontal region. These data suggest a relationship between impaired non-prefrontal CBF and the presence of non-prefrontal extra-activation, where the region with more limited blood flow is associated with activation limited to that region. In a secondary analysis, pathology associated with hyperintensities on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging over the whole brain was related to whole brain activation, revealing a negative relationship between lesion volume and frontal activation, and a positive relationship between lesion volume and posterior activation. These preliminary data, albeit collected with small sample sizes, suggest that reduced non-prefrontal CBF, and possibly pathological tissue associated with T2-hyperintensities, may provide contributions to the diffuse, primarily posterior extra-activation observed in adolescents following moderate to severe TBI.

AB  - Abstract Scaphoid fractures are the most common fractures of the carpus, accounting for 79% of all carpal fractures. Early diagnosis of scaphoid fractures is imperative owing to potential complications following the fracture, including non-union, avascular necrosis, carpal instability and osteoarthritis. Plain radiography remains the initial imaging modality to assess scaphoid fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is excellent in the detection of clinically suspected, but initially radiographically negative, scaphoid fractures. Cost-effectiveness analysis studies have demonstrated MRI is effective in this setting. Gadolinium enhanced MRI has been shown to be superior to unenhanced MRI in the detection of avascular necrosis. Computerized tomography scan is the preferred modality to assess the intricacies of scaphoid fracture, including fracture location and deformity, as well as union status. This review paper explores the recent advances in imaging of the scaphoid, with reference also to avascular necrosis and non-union following a scaphoid fracture.

AB  - Abstract Use of ceiling-mounted radiographic equipment in an emergency room for management of the multiply injured patient is described. The protocol of the Advanced Trauma and Life Support manual is followed and three plain radiographs (lateral cervical spine, anteroposterior views of the chest and pelvis) are obtained by the radiographers, who are members of the trauma team. Abnormalities were diagnosed on 7 per cent of the cervical radiographs, 31 per cent of the chest and 28 per cent of the pelvis in 108 patients during the first year of use. With full integration of the radiographers into the trauma team these three initial films are obtained within 10 min. Subsequent films can be taken of skeletal injuries found clinically or incidentally on the first three plain radiographs. It is recommended that all emergency rooms should have a ceiling-mounted radiographic unit with an automatic daylight processor to provide the best service for patients with major trauma.
