AB  - Abstract A low-cost 3D printed model has been introduced into the oral and maxillofacial surgery teaching program of undergraduate students to improve education and mechanical comprehension of craniofacial trauma. Steps of the 3D printed haptic model building process are listed. 3D printed models of facial fractures were obtained from Data Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data. Computed Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) freeware was used to create new fractures on the standard tessellation language (STL) file. 3D printed haptic model appears to be an efficient low-cost support for craniofacial trauma education of undergraduate students.

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

AB  - Abstract Use of ceiling-mounted radiographic equipment in an emergency room for management of the multiply injured patient is described. The protocol of the Advanced Trauma and Life Support manual is followed and three plain radiographs (lateral cervical spine, anteroposterior views of the chest and pelvis) are obtained by the radiographers, who are members of the trauma team. Abnormalities were diagnosed on 7 per cent of the cervical radiographs, 31 per cent of the chest and 28 per cent of the pelvis in 108 patients during the first year of use. With full integration of the radiographers into the trauma team these three initial films are obtained within 10 min. Subsequent films can be taken of skeletal injuries found clinically or incidentally on the first three plain radiographs. It is recommended that all emergency rooms should have a ceiling-mounted radiographic unit with an automatic daylight processor to provide the best service for patients with major trauma.

AB  - Summary The axilla is often included on mammography, ultrasound (US), CT and MRI. Axillary masses can arise from any of the tissue components present in this region including breast parenchyma. Aetiologies include: lymphadenopathy due to inflammation, malignancy and degenerative causes; soft tissue tumours such as haemangioma, lymphangioma, peripheral nerve sheath tumours and lipomas; post-surgical complications such as seroma, lymphocoele and haematoma; lesions arising in accessory breast tissue such as fibroadenoma and carcinoma. Some of these entities have distinctive imaging appearances knowledge of which can be helpful in suggesting the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Several anaesthetic drugs have demonstrated antibacterial properties in vitro. Anaesthetics can primarily affect the cell wall of both susceptible and multi-resistant bacteria. They may also have a synergistic effect with conventional antibiotics through an unknown mechanism. We present three cases of a chronic venous ulcer infected by multi-resistant bacteria refractory to conventional systemic antibiotics, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment with topical sevoflurane was performed for 1 month without systemic antibiotics. Patients with an MRSA infection showed progressive improvement with negative culture at the end of the treatment. Multi-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infection persisted at the end of treatment with positive culture. The local adverse events were mild and transient, including heat, pruritus and erythema. Topical sevoflurane may have an antibacterial effect on sensitive and multi-resistant strains. It can allow more complete surgical cleaning, leaving a cleaner wound with less fibrin and necrotic tissue. This decreases the bacterial colonisation and therefore the infectious risk, the bad smell and the exudation. The simultaneous use of conventional antibiotics and topical sevoflurane can have a synergistic antimicrobial effect.

AB  - We present a theoretical overview and a performance evaluation of a novel -sampling technique for multidetector row CT (MDCT), relying on a periodic motion of the focal spot in the longitudinal direction (-flying focal spot) to double the number of simultaneously acquired slices. The -flying focal spot technique has been implemented in a recently introduced MDCT scanner. Using collimation, this scanner acquires 64 overlapping 0.6 mm slices per rotation in its spiral (helical) mode of operation, with the goal of improved longitudinal resolution and reduction of spiral artifacts. The longitudinal sampling distance at isocenter is 0.3 mm. We discuss in detail the impact of the -flying focal spot technique on image reconstruction. We present measurements of spiral slice sensitivity profiles (SSPs) and of longitudinal resolution, both in the isocenter and off-center. We evaluate the pitch dependence of the image noise measured in a centered 20 cm water phantom. To investigate spiral image quality we present images of an anthropomorphic thorax phantom and patient scans. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the spiral SSPs shows only minor variations as a function of the pitch, measured values differ by less than 0.15 mm from the nominal values 0.6, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2 mm. The measured FWHM of the smallest slice ranges between 0.66 and 0.68 mm at isocenter, except for pitch 0.55 (0.72 mm). In a centered -resolution phantom, bar patterns up to can be visualized independent of the pitch, corresponding to 0.33 mm longitudinal resolution. 100 mm off-center, bar patterns up to are visible, corresponding to an object size of 0.36 mm that can be resolved in the direction. Image noise for constant effective mAs is almost independent of the pitch. Measured values show a variation of less than 7% as a function of the pitch, which demonstrates correct utilization of the applied radiation dose at any pitch. The product of image noise and square root of the slice width (FWHM of the respective SSP) is the same constant for all slices except 0.6 mm. For the thinnest slice, relative image noise is increased by 17%. Spiral windmill-type artifacts are effectively suppressed with the -flying focal spot technique, which has the potential to maintain a low artifact level up to pitch 1.5, in this way increasing the maximum volume coverage speed that can be clinically used.

AB  - Summary Recent major technological advances in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have enabled the accurate, noninvasive detection and characterization of hepatic lesions. Due to its relative lower cost, availability and widespread distribution, CT is often the primary imaging modality in the initial evaluation of the liver. However, with comparatively superior lesion-to-liver contrast, ability to utilize hepatocyte-specific contrast agents, and lack of ionizing radiation, MRI is realizing an increasingly greater role in this regard. For assessment of the gallbladder and biliary system, ultrasound (US) remains a basic modality for the prompt diagnosis of stones and acute inflammatory or obstructing processes. Advanced CT & MR techniques are utilized for evaluating equivocal US findings, oncologic staging, preoperative planning and post-operative complications. This chapter reviews the discriminating imaging features of commonly encountered hepatobiliary pathology at cross-sectional imaging.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: To date, few reports exist comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) for imaging of the equine distal limb, yet clinicians are required to decide which modality to use regularly. Objectives: To report and compare anatomic visualisation scores obtained for CT, contrast enhanced CT (CECT) and standing low-field MRI (LFMRI) in the equine foot. Hypothesis: Anatomic visualisation score discrepancies would exist between CT, CECT and LFMRI. Methods: Images of 22 lame horses (31 limbs) undergoing both CT and LFMRI of the foot were reviewed. When available, CECT images were reviewed. The deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) was categorised into proximal to distal levels (A?D), structures were assigned visualisation scores (Grades 0?3) and technique comparisons were made using the paired marginal homogeneity test. Results: Computed tomography and LFMRI had similar visibility scores for the navicular bone, middle phalanx, DDFT-B, collateral ligaments of the distal interphalangeal joint and collateral sesamoidean ligament of the navicular bone. The proximal and distal phalanx had lower visibility scores with LFMRI. The distal DDFT (C?D), distal sesamoidean impar ligament and synovial structures had higher scores with LFMRI. Contrast enhanced CT lowered DDFT and collateral sesamoidean ligament scores and raised distal interphalangeal synovium CT visualisation scores. Conclusions and potential relevance: Visualisation scores differ depending on imaging technique and anatomic structure of interest. This information increases our understanding of the limitations of CT, CECT and LFMRI to visualise anatomy in clinical cases.

AB  - The serotonergic system plays a key modulatory role in the brain and is the target for many drug treatments for brain disorders either through reuptake blockade or via interactions at the 14 subtypes of 5-HT receptors. This review provides the history and current status of radioligands used for positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging of human brain serotonin (5-HT) receptors, the 5-HT transporter (SERT), and 5-HT synthesis rate. Currently available radioligands for in vivo brain imaging of the 5-HT system in humans include antagonists for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT4 receptors, and for SERT. Here we describe the evolution of these radioligands, along with the attempts made to develop radioligands for additional serotonergic targets. We describe the properties needed for a radioligand to become successful and the main caveats. The success of a PET or SPECT radioligand can ultimately be assessed by its frequency of use, its utility in humans, and the number of research sites using it relative to its invention date, and so these aspects are also covered. In conclusion, the development of PET and SPECT radioligands to image serotonergic targets is of high interest, and successful evaluation in humans is leading to invaluable insight into normal and abnormal brain function, emphasizing the need for continued development of both SPECT and PET radioligands for human brain imaging. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) is a serious and life-threatening condition. Many diagnostic procedures and tests are being used to detect the site of bleeding with different success rates. The aim of our study is to prospectively evaluate accuracy of 64-slice multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) in the diagnosis of lower AGIB. Methods: Between September 2007 and January 2009, patients with presumed lower AGIB were referred to the radiology department of our institution for 64-slice MDCT examination as part of the investigation for the lower AGIB. Any abnormalities to account for bleeding, such as tumours, bowel wall enhancement and increased intraluminal density, were recorded. Results: Out of 139 patients with AGIB that were admitted to our casualty department, 27 patients (19 men and 8 women) in the age range of 24?88?years (mean age, 56?years) were suspected to have lower AGIB. Sixty-four-slice MDCT was performed and considered positive for bleeding in 19 (70%) cases, and in all the cases, the bleeding source was indentified in the arterial phase, showing a focal dense wall enhancement in 8 (42%) cases, circumferential wall enhancement in 4 (22%) cases and progressive increasing intraluminal density in 7 (36%) cases. The venous phase scan showed increased dispersion of the contrast within the lumen as an additional clue for active extravasation in 15 (79%) out of the 19 cases. Delayed 5-min scanning showed the same findings as venous phase in all the 19 positive cases and failed to depict any additional findings in the eight cases that were negative on arterial or venous phases. Conclusion: The study supports the high accuracy of 64-slice MDCT in locating the site of AGIB in patients thought to have a distal source of bleeding. Its accuracy in clinically proximal bleeding is not clear from this study, but MDCT is capable of showing such sources.

AB  - A standardized trauma was inflicted to the lateral side of the calf muscle of 12 New Zealand rabbits, creating a muscle hematoma without external bleeding. The acute hematoma was evaluated within 3 h with radionuclide imaging of red blood cells labelled with 99mTc pertechnetate, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results were compared with the total volume of the hematomas as calculated from histological preparations of each injured muscle. Scintigraphy and T2-weighted MRI accurately detected all hematomas but the calculated volume did not significantly correlate with histology. T1-weighted MRI did not detect the hematomas. Ultrasonography detected all hematomas and also accurately evaluated the volume. In conclusion, scintigraphy, MR imaging and ultrasonography are all sensitive enough to detect an acute muscle injury, but in this investigation only ultrasonography accurately quantified the volume of the hematoma.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation in Bernese mountain dogs. Methods: Seven Bernese mountain dogs (four males and three females) were diagnosed with cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation by magnetic resonance imaging. The following data were evaluated retrospectively: (1) abnormalities of the cervical vertebral column and spinal cord, (2) spinal cord compression, (3) intervertebral disc degeneration and herniation, (4) severity of clinical signs pretreatment and after treatment, (5) type of treatment and (6) outcome. Results: Spin echo T1-weighted and T2-weighted images disclosed multi-level, extradural compressive spinal cord lesions (ventral, dorsolateral or both) spanning from intervertebral disc spaces C3-4 to C6-7. In all seven dogs, T2-weighted images disclosed one or more intramedullary hyperintensities associated with extradural spinal cord compression. Surgery was performed in five dogs. Two dogs were managed medically. The prognosis for surgical or conservative management in Bernese mountain dogs was similar to cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation in other breeds. Clinical Significance: Cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation is an important differential diagnosis for young to middle-aged Bernese mountain dogs with a C1-5 or C6-T2 neuroanatomic localisation. Dorsolateral spinal cord compression associated with articular process hypertrophy was the most common feature of cervical vertebral malformation-malarticulation in the seven Bernese mountain dogs evaluated.

AB  - Objective To describe the bacterial bio-burden of open-treated wounds and make comparisons with bite wounds. Design Retrospective multicentre study. Sample Microbial culture between 2011 and 2013 from open-treated wounds in dogs and cats (initiation of therapy n=88, follow-up n=52) were compared to those from bite wounds (n=184). Procedures Bacteria were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by two accredited laboratories. Results In total, 77/88 (88%) of open-treated wounds yielded positive bacterial cultures at the beginning of treatment, decreasing to 27/52 (52%) during treatment. Upon initial evaluation, 42/88 (48 %) of open-treated wounds were considered infected with multi-drug-resistant bacteria, with a drop to 22/52 (41%) during therapy. Bite wounds yielded fewer positive cultures 88/184 (48%) with only 11/182 (6%) being affected by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Bacteria found most commonly in open-treated wounds were Enterococcus subspecies, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusion The bacterial populations of open-treated wounds differed markedly from the bite wounds. The high incidence of multi-drug-resistant strains in open wounds highlights the need for alternatives to antibiotics.

AB  - Objectives To describe the clinical presentation, MRI findings and outcome in dogs with eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin. Materials and Methods Dogs were included in this retrospective study if they had complete medical records, complete neurological examination, MR imaging, cerebellomedullary cerebrospinal fluid sample consistent with eosinophilic pleocytosis and negative infectious disease testing. Results Eleven dogs were included with a median age of 22·0?months (range 7·6 to 92·0?months). Nine breeds were represented. Neurological abnormalities included obtundation (n=10), menace response deficits (n=9), proprioceptive deficits (n=7), ataxia (n=7) and seizures (n=2). Neuroanatomical localisation was multi-focal (n=4), central vestibular system (n=4), diffuse forebrain (n=2) or left trigeminal/facial nerves (n=1). Seven dogs had peripheral eosinophilia. Ten dogs had bilateral symmetrical lesions affecting the cortical grey matter, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuating inversion recovery images and iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images with associated meningeal contrast enhancement. MRI findings were consistent with diffuse meningitis and atrophy or necrosis of cortical grey matter. One dog had increased contrast uptake in the left trigeminal nerve. Ten dogs receiving corticosteroids survived to discharge, with seven also receiving cytarabine arabinoside. Median survival time was 762?days. Clinical Significance Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affects younger larger-breed dogs, with the majority having suspected diffuse cerebrocortical meningitis and cortical (polio)encephalitis, which can be identified on MRI. Response to immunosuppressive treatment is good in the medium to long term, although further studies are required in this area.

AB  - Objective To investigate the ability of medical infrared imaging to differentiate between normal canine elbows and those with abnormal elbows (elbow dysplasia). Study Design Prospective cohort study. Animals Dogs with normal (n?=?15) and abnormal (n?=?14) elbows. Methods Infrared imaging was performed on all dogs and data analyzed via descriptive statistics and image pattern analysis software. Animals with elbow dysplasia had arthroscopic procedures to confirm the presence of elbow disease. Results Computer recognition pattern analysis was up to 100% correct in identifying abnormal elbows and normal elbows, with the medial images most consistent. The caudal, lateral, and cranial images correctly identified 83?100% abnormal elbows. The caudal and lateral images correctly identified 83% normal elbows. A significant difference in temperature was found between normal and abnormal elbows for the cranial full region of interest, lateral images, and each quadrant. Conclusion Medical infrared imaging was able to correctly identify known abnormal and known normal elbows in dogs.

AB  - Abstract We applied dual-flex coils in a phased-array configuration to obtain high resolution MR images of the bilateral hips and compared the image quality with non-phased-array imaging. Multiple fast spin-echo images of both hips were obtained in a single acquisition. Two consecutive acquisitions with and without phased-array capability were performed in 22 hips and a fluid-filled phantom. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) enhancement values were calculated. Subjective image analysis was also obtained from three independent reviewers. High quality MR images were obtained using dual-array coils with a S/N enhancement value of 1.40 for a phantom and 1.83 to 2.22 for subject hips. On subjective analysis, the dual array enhanced delineation of the acetabular labrum, articular cartilage, and retained fluid. The dual array may be of diagnostic value with a higher S/N enhancement and subjective superiority of the images obtained.
