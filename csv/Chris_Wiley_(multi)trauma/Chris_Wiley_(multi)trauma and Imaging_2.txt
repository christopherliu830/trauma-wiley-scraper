AB  - Background Limited data Exists ? on the Australian epidemiology of renal trauma, with very few studies published in the literature. The authors aim to detail the trends of renal trauma in the coastal city of the Gold Coast. Methods Retrospective data collection yielded 81 patients who sustained renal trauma from our 3-year period. Data included information on demographics, mechanism, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade, presence of haematuria, associated injuries, management, and complications. Results Male patients accounted for 83% (n = 67) of cases, and the average age of all injuries was 36 years. Low-grade AAST Grade I?III injuries comprised of 76% (n = 62) of injuries, AAST Grade IV contributed to 20% (n = 16) and 4% (n = 3) of injuries were AAST Grade V. The most common mechanism of injury was road accidents accounting for 35% (n = 28) followed by fall-related injuries (26%, n = 21). Other mechanisms included sport-related (13.5%, n = 11), non-motorized bicycle injuries (8.5%, n = 7), alleged assault (8.5%, n = 7), pedestrian injuries (5%, n = 4) and horse-related injuries (2%, n = 2). Ninety-six percent (n = 78) of kidney injuries were managed conservatively. Of the patients requiring intervention, all were AAST Grade V kidney injuries. Conclusion Males accounted for the majority of renal trauma cases, similar to the 3:1 ratio of male-to-female injuries found in other studies. In line with other studies, renal trauma reviewed on the Gold Coast also revealed road trauma as the leading cause, closely followed by falls. The majority of high-grade renal trauma was managed conservatively.

AB  - Aim? Whole-body multislice CT-Scanning (MSCT) has become the primary imaging device in many European and North American trauma centres. We aim to present a new standardised protocol that has lead to a markedly improved diagnostic managment in an Australian metropolitan trauma centre. Methods? Based on growing evidence in the literature the MSCT is used as the primary imaging tool in severely injured patients and is routinely performed after completion of primary and secondary survey. The routine protocol consists of a non-contrast head and cervical spine CT, followed by a contrast chest, abdomen and pelvic CT. Apart from an initial chest X-Ray, routine X-ray trauma series are not performed anymore. The criteria for this whole-body MSCT are strictly limited to patients that required trauma team activation and can be sufficiently stabilised in the emergency room. Results? This adapted diagnostic algorithm has shown to be very fast and efficient. The average duration of initial management can be reduced significantly, in addition the number of initially missed injuries is markedly reduced. Conclusions? Primary whole-body MSCT has become a valuable diagnostic tool in the emergency management of severe trauma. A strictly followed protocol has been shown to be crucial to avoid overuse, in terms of radiation as well as exposing the unstable patient to an unnecessary high risk.

AB  - Abstract:? In this paper I explore the concept of forgiveness as a response to gross human rights violations. I present a conceptual examination of the effects of massive trauma in relation to what I refer to as the ?unfinished business? of trauma. Using a psychoanalytic framework, I consider the process of ?bearing witness? about trauma and examine how this process opens up the possibility of reciprocal expressions of empathy between victim and perpetrator. I then argue that, in this context of trauma testimony and witnessing, empathy is essential for the development of remorse on the part of perpetrators, and of forgiveness on the part of victims. Using a case study from South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) I clarify the relationship between empathy and forgiveness, and show how the restorative model of the TRC can open up an ethical space and create the possibility of transformation for victims, perpetrators and bystanders. In my conclusion I suggest that forgiveness in politics is the only action that holds promise for the repair of brokenness in post-conflict societies, particularly if, as in South Africa, victims have to live together with perpetrators and beneficiaries in the same country.

AB  - Summary This chapter begins with an introduction of the anatomy of the ankle and foot. Appropriateness criteria for imaging foot and ankle trauma are then discussed. The ankle and foot are anatomically distinct from each other and therefore radiographic evaluation of each is different from the other. Standard ankle radiographs include anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and mortise view, and foot radiographs include AP, lateral, and oblique views. Computed Tomography (CT) is used for pre-operative planning in patients with complex distal tibial and malleolar fractures, tarsal fractures and Lisfranc fracture-dislocations. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is indicated in assessment of radiographically occult stress and insufficiency fractures. In the setting of foot and ankle trauma, ultrasound is often performed to evaluate the Achilles tendon for the presence and severity of a tear. The key to interpreting ankle and foot radiographs is familiarity with normal anatomy and injury patterns that may involve the ankle and foot.

AB  - Summary Musculoskeletal imaging has advanced leaps and bounds from the time Roentgen utilized X-rays to obtain a plain radiograph in 1895. This chapter outlines the modalities commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging, including plain radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound (US). It discusses the applications of the above modalities in the diagnosis and management of traumatic injuries, infection, arthritis, and tumors. Plain radiography is a two-dimensional depiction of three-dimensional structures and as such, evaluation of complex areas such as the foot, pelvis, and spine can be suboptimal. CT is also useful for assessment of nontraumatic pathologies like arthritis. MRI is one of the more commonly used imaging modalities in musculoskeletal imaging. US is also useful in dynamic assessment of tendons, ligaments, and joints. Imaging plays a vital role in assessment of musculoskeletal trauma. Musculoskeletal tumors comprise benign and malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the peripheral vascular trauma. The presence of a vascular ?hard sign? is highly specific for major vascular injury and mandates operative exploration, however, absence of hard signs does not reliably exclude injury. In contrast, the ?soft signs? of vascular injury does not reliably predict major vascular trauma. It is generally accepted that in the absence of hard signs, patients with a normal peripheral vascular examination does not require further investigation regardless of the presence of soft signs. The arterial pressure index (API) has gained acceptance in some trauma centers as a useful tool in the evaluation of peripheral vascular trauma. While duplex ultrasonography is non-invasive, it is less sensitive in the diagnosis of peripheral vascular trauma than angiography and requires the presence of a trained ultrasonographer, who may not be available at all times.

AB  - Purpose To introduce novel acquisition and postprocessing approaches for susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) to remove background field inhomogeneity artifacts in both magnitude and phase data. Methods The proposed method acquires three echoes in a three-dimensional gradient echo (GRE) sequence, with a field compensation gradient (z-shim gradient) applied to the third echo. The artifacts in the magnitude data are compensated by signal estimation from all three echoes. The artifacts in phase signals are removed by modeling the background phase distortions using Gaussians. The method was applied in vivo and compared with conventional SWI. Results The method successfully compensates for background field inhomogeneity artifacts in magnitude and phase images, and demonstrated improved SWI images. In particular, vessels in frontal lobe, which were not observed in conventional SWI, were identified in the proposed method. Conclusion The new method improves image quality in SWI by restoring signal in the frontal and temporal regions. Magn Reson Med 72:452?458, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This chapter provides an evidence-based discussion of the rehabilitation of the orthopaedic and trauma patient and the specific role of the nurse. This includes a critical application of research to approaches to rehabilitation, where robust evidence exists. The benefits of transdisciplinary team working are explored where nurses and therapists share and expand their collective repertoire of skills and underpinning knowledge.

AB  - Aim.? The aim of this ethnographic study was to explore the culture of a trauma team in relation to human factors. Background.? Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death in the first four decades of life in the western world. Evidence suggests that the initial assessment and resuscitation of trauma victims is most successfully carried out by an organized trauma team. Most trauma teams use Advanced Trauma Life Support principles which focus on rapid assessment and management of the patient's injuries. Similarly, most trauma education focuses on Advanced Trauma Life Support principles, concentrating firmly on the patient's physical status. Nevertheless, contemporary literature about emergency teams suggests that human factors, such as communication and interprofessional relationships, can affect the team's performance regardless of how clinically skilled the team members are. Method.? Focused ethnography was used to explore the culture of a trauma team in one teaching hospital. Six periods of observation were undertaken followed by 11 semi-structured interviews with purposively chosen key personnel. Data from transcripts of the observation field notes and interviews were analysed using open coding, followed by formation of categories resulting in the emergence of six central categories. Results.? Findings suggest that leadership, role competence, conflict, communication, the environment and the status of the patient all influence the culture of the trauma team. Interpretation of these categories suggests that trauma team education should include human factor considerations such as leadership skills, team management, interprofessional teamwork, conflict resolution and communication strategies. Relevance for clinical practice.? The findings suggest that support systems for role development of junior team leaders should be formalized. The proven airline industry techniques of Crew Resource Management, focusing on teamwork and effective communication, could be implemented into continuing professional development for trauma teams to engender collaboration and interprofessional practice.

AB  - Purpose To propose a susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) method by combining a magnitude image with a quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) -based weighting factor thereby providing an alternative contrast compared with magnitude image, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and QSM. Methods A three-dimensional multi-echo gradient echo sequence is used to obtain the data. The QSM was transformed to a susceptibility mask that varies in amplitude between zero and unity. This mask was multiplied several times with the original magnitude image to create alternative contrasts between tissues with different susceptibilities. A temporal domain denoising method to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio was further applied. Optimal reconstruction processes of the SMWI were determined from simulations. Results Temporal domain denoising enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio, especially at late echoes without spatial artifacts. From phantom simulations, the optimal number of multiplication and threshold values was chosen. Reconstructed SMWI created different contrasts based on its weighting factors made from paramagnetic or diamagnetic susceptibility tissue and provided an excellent delineation of microhemorrhage without blooming artifacts typically caused by the nonlocal property of phase. Conclusion SMWI presents an alternative contrast for susceptibility-based imaging. The validity of this method was demonstrated using in vivo data. This proposed method together with denoising allows high-quality reconstruction of susceptibility-weighted image of human brain in vivo.

AB  - Summary Imaging in trauma patients has dramatically evolved since the advent of computed tomography (CT), particularly multidetector CT (MDCT) technology. Axial MDCT images of the body can be acquired in seconds and shown any plane, allowing immediate viewing and interpreting. These factors make CT an invaluable means to detect many injuries not previously visible by any other noninvasive imaging techniques. Potentially subtle, but significant, thoracic injuries such as pneumothorax, haemothorax, aortic injury, sternal and spinal fractures can be detected on MDCT easily. In this article, the author will discuss the use of MDCT in the diagnosis of various thoracic injuries.

AB  - Objective To review the guidelines released in the last decade by several organisations for the optimal evaluation and management of genitourinary injuries (renal, ureteric, bladder, urethral and genital). Methods This is a review of the genitourinary trauma guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), and renal trauma guidelines from the SociÃ©tÃ© Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). Results Most recommendations are guided by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) organ injury severity system. Grade A evidence is rare in genitourinary trauma, and most recommendations are based on Grade B or C evidence. The findings of the most recent urological trauma guidelines are summarised. All guidelines recommend conservative management for low-grade injuries. The major difference is for haemodynamically stable patients who have high-grade renal trauma; the SIU guidelines recommend exploratory laparotomy, the EAU guidelines recommend renal exploration only if the injury is vascular, and the AUA guidelines recommend initial conservative management. Conclusion There is generally consensus among the three guidelines. Recommendations are based on observational or retrospective studies, as well as clinical principles and expert opinions. Multi-institutional collaborative research can improve the quality of evidence and direct more effective evaluation and management of urological trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Patient outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly variable. The underlying pathophysiology of this is poorly understood, but inflammation is potentially an important factor. Microglia orchestrate many aspects of this response. Their activation can be studied in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C](R)PK11195 (PK). In this study, we investigate whether an inflammatory response to TBI persists, and whether this response relates to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive function. Methods: Ten patients, studied at least 11 months after moderate to severe TBI, underwent PK PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging (including diffusion tensor imaging). PK binding potentials were calculated in and around the site of focal brain damage, and in selected distant and subcortical brain regions. Standardized neuropsychological tests were administered. Results: PK binding was significantly raised in the thalami, putamen, occipital cortices, and posterior limb of the internal capsules after TBI. There was no increase in PK binding at the original site of focal brain injury. High PK binding in the thalamus was associated with more severe cognitive impairment, although binding was not correlated with either the time since the injury or the extent of structural brain damage. Interpretation: We demonstrate that increased microglial activation can be present up to 17 years after TBI. This suggests that TBI triggers a chronic inflammatory response particularly in subcortical regions. This highlights the importance of considering the response to TBI as evolving over time and suggests interventions may be beneficial for longer intervals after trauma than previously assumed.

AB  - Abstract The deleterious impact of concomitant muscle injury on fracture healing and limb function is commonly considered part of the natural sequela of orthopedic trauma. Recent reports suggest that heightened inflammation in the surrounding traumatized musculature is a primary determinant of fracture healing. Relatedly, there are emerging potential therapeutic approaches for severe muscle trauma (e.g., volumetric muscle loss [VML] injury), such as autologous minced muscle grafts (1Â mm3 pieces of muscle; GRAFT), that can partially prevent chronic functional deficits and appear to have an immunomodulatory effect within VML injured muscle. The primary goal of this study was to determine if repair of VML injury with GRAFT rescues impaired fracture healing and improves the strength of the traumatized muscle in a male Lewis rat model of tibia open fracture. The most salient findings of the study were: (1) tibialis anterior (TA) muscle repair with GRAFT improved endogenous healing of fractured tibia and improved the functional outcome of muscle regeneration; (2) GRAFT repair attenuated the monocyte/macrophage (CD45+CDllb+) and T lymphocyte (CD3+) response to VML injury; (3) TA muscle protein concentrations of MCP1, IL-10, and IGF-1 were augmented in a proregenerative manner by GRAFT repair; (4) VML injury concomitant with osteotomy induced a heightened systemic presence of alarmins (e.g., soluble RAGE) and leukocytes (e.g., monocytes), and depressed IGF-1 concentration, which GRAFT repair ameliorated. Collectively, these data indicate that repair of VML injury with a regenerative therapy can modulate the inflammatory and regenerative phenotype of the treated muscle and in association improve musculoskeletal healing.

AB  - Objective. To report our experience in the assessment of splenic trauma with contrast-coded sonography and a second-generation contrast medium. Methods. From January to May 2002, 120 patients were studied with sonography for suspected splenic trauma. Twenty-five were selected for further imaging because of sonographic findings positive for splenic injury, findings positive for peritoneal fluid only, indeterminate findings, and negative findings with high clinical or laboratory suspicion. These patients underwent contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography. Results. Among the 25 patients studied, 6 had no spleen trauma at initial and follow-up evaluation. One patient had a hypoperfused spleen without parenchymal damage, and 18 had splenic injuries; these 19 patients were considered positive. Hemoperitoneum was identified by sonography, contrast-enhanced sonography, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography in 74% of the 19 positive cases. Perisplenic clots were recognized in 58% of the cases by computed tomography and in 42% by baseline and enhanced sonography. Splenic infarctions were found in 11% of cases by contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography; none was found by unenhanced sonography. Parenchymal traumatic lesions were identified in 12 of 18 patients with splenic injuries by unenhanced sonography, in 17 cases by contrast-enhanced sonography, and in all 18 cases by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. A minimal splenic lesion was found in the single patient with a false-negative contrast-enhanced sonographic finding. Contrast-enhanced sonography correlated appreciably better than unenhanced sonography in detecting injuries and in estimating their extent. Findings undetectable on unenhanced sonography were also noted: splenic hypoperfusion in 11% of positive cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography, contrast medium pooling in 21% of cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography, and contrast extravasation in 11% of cases on computed tomography and 5% on contrast-enhanced sonography. Conclusions. Contrast-enhanced sonography is a promising tool in the assessment of splenic trauma. In institutions where sonography is used as the initial procedure, this technique may increase its effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Volumetric studies on deep gray matter structures in bipolar disorder (BP) have reported contrasting results. Childhood trauma, a relevant environmental stressor for BP, could account for the variability of the results, modulating differences in the amygdala and hippocampus in patients with BP compared with healthy controls (HC). Our study aimed to test this hypothesis. Methods We assessed 105 outpatients, diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) or bipolar disorder type II (BP-II) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria, and 113 HC subjects. History of childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was performed on all subjects and volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus were measured using FreeSurfer. Results Patients with BP showed a global reduction of deep gray matter volumes compared to HCs. However, childhood trauma modulated the impact of the diagnosis specifically on the amygdala and hippocampus. Childhood trauma was associated with bilateral decreased volumes in HCs and increased volumes in patients with BP. Conclusions The results suggest that childhood trauma may have a different effect in health and disease on volumes of gray matter in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are brain areas specifically involved in response to stress and emotion processing.
