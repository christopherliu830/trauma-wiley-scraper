AB  - The MRI community is using quantitative mapping techniques to complement qualitative imaging. For quantitative imaging to reach its full potential, it is necessary to analyze measurements across systems and longitudinally. Clinical use of quantitative imaging can be facilitated through adoption and use of a standard system phantom, a calibration/standard reference object, to assess the performance of an MRI machine. The International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine AdHoc Committee on Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance was established in February 2007 to facilitate the expansion of MRI as a mainstream modality for multi-institutional measurements, including, among other things, multicenter trials. The goal of the Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee was to provide a framework to ensure that quantitative measures derived from MR data are comparable over time, between subjects, between sites, and between vendors. This paper, written by members of the Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee, reviews standardization attempts and then details the need, requirements, and implementation plan for a standard system phantom for quantitative MRI. In addition, application-specific phantoms and implementation of quantitative MRI are reviewed. Magn Reson Med 79:48?61, 2018. ? 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

AB  - Abstract This article shows that re-normalizing the interpolation kernel for a constant integral can make a significant improvement in performance of sinc interpolation methods. A comparison was performed between standard and re-normalized sinc kernels of various sizes using data from four commonly used magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequences. Standard rotations were performed and compared with a ?gold standard? data set generated by use of a large (13???13???13) sinc kernel. Measurements of systematic pixel intensity offset error and variance of generated residuals were used to estimate resultant interpolation error. Theoretical estimates of the consequent savings in computation time were compared with the measured time required for each algorithm and with the automated image registration (AIR) program. The use of a small (5???5???5) re-normalized kernel produced relative errors comparable to those in the gold standard data set, allowing saving in computation time of up to 30 times in comparison with standard sinc interpolation. This approach brings the implementation of MR volume re-slicing much closer to the demands of a clinical environment. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 1999;10:582?588. ? 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Lateral condylar (LC) fractures of the third metacarpus (McIII) are a common reason for euthanasia in racehorses, and may be the result of repetitive overloading or cumulative pathological change. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows monitoring of bone and cartilage to detect pathological and adaptive changes that may be precursors of fracture. Objectives: To describe bone and cartilage MRI features in the distal condyles of McIII of Thoroughbred racehorses, with and without condylar fracture. Hypotheses: 1) A greater degree of bone and cartilage adaptation or pathology will be seen in fractured McIIIs compared with their respective contralateral McIIIs. 2) Contralateral McIIIs will have a greater degree of bone and cartilage adaptation or pathology than McIIIs from control horses that did not sustain a LC fracture. Methods: The McIIIs from 96 horses subjected to euthanasia at racecourses were divided into 3 groups: Group 1: nonfractured bones from horses without LC fracture; Group 2: nonfractured bones from horses with unilateral LC fracture; and Group 3: fractured bones from horses with unilateral LC fracture. The MR images were examined and graded for bone and cartilage changes. Results: Nine percent of Group 1 (n = 9) and 11% of Group 2 bones (n = 5) had incomplete LC fractures. Focal palmar necrosis was most frequently detected in bones from Group 1 (12%) compared with Groups 2 (9%) and 3 (4%). The prevalence of bone and/or cartilage abnormalities tended to increase from Group 1 to Group 2 to Group 3. Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging is able to detect cartilage and bone changes that may be associated with LC fracture. There was no significant difference in bone/cartilage changes between bones from Groups 1 and 2, despite increased pathology in Group 2 bones. Potential relevance: Periodic monitoring of bone and/or cartilage changes in distal McIII of Thoroughbred racehorses may help to prevent catastrophic LC fractures.

AB  - In January of 1995 a massive earthquake struck the city of Kobe, Japan. This article examines how this event became an opportunity for extending global networks of the science and medicine of trauma. The article is based on ethnographic research in Kobe and Los Angeles with psychiatrists who responded to the earthquake in its immediate aftermath. Three aspects of the process are examined: 1) changes in psychiatric institutions that were ongoing at the time of the earthquake, 2) the place of psychiatry in Japanese cultural self-criticism, and 3) the particular technologies for identifying and treating trauma. Globalization in this case cannot be seen as an imposition of Western cultural forms, but rather an ongoing process that reproduces differences between cultures as particular elements travel between them.

AB  - A 3Â·5-month-old papillon puppy was brought to our clinic with chief complaints of progressive quadriparesis, ataxia and head tremor. Lesions in the cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord were suspected on the basis of a neurological examination. No abnormality was found in a clinicopathological examination or on magnetic resonance imaging. On the basis of these results differential diagnoses including an inflammatory disease, a degenerative condition or a storage disorder were considered. Subsequently, the signs progressed and glossoplegia and dysphagia developed at six months of age. At a second magnetic resonance imaging, severe atrophy of the entire brain was found. After these examinations, the puppy was euthanased and histopathologically diagnosed with neuroaxonal dystrophy. Because magnetic resonance imaging detected abnormal features that were characteristic of neuroaxonal dystrophy in this case, we speculate that magnetic resonance imaging can assist in the pre-mortem diagnosis of this disease.

AB  - Summary Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of equine stifle disorders is challenging. We describe a routine technique for low-field stifle MRI under general anaesthesia in clinical cases and report the main findings. We hypothesised that MRI can be safely and routinely performed and portray bone and soft-tissue pathology. In this retrospective study, medical records of 76 stifles with positive response to intra-articular anaesthesia without abnormalities on conventional diagnostic imagingÂ were reviewed for breed, age, gender, MRI anaesthesia time and findings. Under anaesthesia, limbs were extended in a rotating MR gantry. Different sequences in several planes were acquired in an average time of 62Â min. In all horses, the stifle examinations were successful and complete. Typical MRI lesions included bone marrow lesions, osseous cyst-like lesions, cruciate desmopathy, meniscal tearing or a combination thereof. Retrospective reviewing confirmed that initial radiographic and ultrasonographic images failed to identify theseÂ lesions. Surgically accessible lesions were confirmed in arthroscopy if exploration was indicated. However, MRI was useful to estimate extent of cruciate and meniscal pathology as well as bone marrow lesions and bone cystic-like lesions more thoroughly. Our protocol allows for routine stifle MRI, independent of breed, age and gender. Based on our preliminary results, low-field stifle MRI is safe and can delineate bone and soft-tissue pathology. Low-field MRI appears to be a promising approach for better understanding stifle pathology and thus treatment and prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a new 3 Tesla (T) high-resolution trabecular bone (TB) imaging technique at two resolution regimens in terms of serial reproducibility and sensitivity. Materials and Methods: The left distal tibial metaphysis of seven healthy volunteers was imaged at three time-points using a FLASE (fast large-angle spin-echo) pulse sequence at 137 ? 137 ? 410 ?m3 and (160 ?m)3 voxel sizes. Image artifacts, motion degradation, and serial image volume misalignments were controlled to maximize reproducibility of image-derived measures of scale, topology, orientation in terms of structural anisotropy, and finite-element derived Young's and shear moduli. Coefficients of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for structural and mechanical parameters were evaluated as measures of reproducibility and reliability. The ability of structural and mechanical parameters to distinguish between subjects was tested by analysis of variance. Results: Reproducibility was generally higher in the anisotropic data (CVs 1?5% versus 1?9% for isotropic images). Anisotropic voxel size yielded greater measurement reliability (ICCs 0.75?0.99, mean = 0.92 versus 0.62?0.99, mean = 0.86) and better discrimination of the seven subjects (75% versus 50% of the possible comparisons were significantly different [P < 0.05]) except for measures of structural anisotropy and topology. Isotropic resolution improved detection of structural orientation and permitted visualization of small perforations in longitudinal trabecular plates not detected at anisotropic resolution. Conclusion: Improved image acquisition and processing techniques enhance reproducibility of structural and mechanical parameters derived from high-resolution MRI of metaphyseal bone in the distal tibia.

AB  - Abstract Background The Virtopsy project, a multi-disciplinary project that involves forensic science, diagnostic imaging, computer science, automation technology, telematics and biomechanics, aims to develop new techniques to improve the outcome of forensic investigations. This paper presents a new approach in the field of minimally invasive virtual autopsy for a versatile robotic system that is able to perform three-dimensional (3D) surface scans as well as post mortem image-guided soft tissue biopsies. Methods The system consists of an industrial six-axis robot with additional extensions (i.e. a linear axis to increase working space, a tool-changing system and a dedicated safety system), a multi-slice CT scanner with equipment for angiography, a digital photogrammetry and 3D optical surface-scanning system, a 3D tracking system, and a biopsy end effector for automatic needle placement. A wax phantom was developed for biopsy accuracy tests. Results Surface scanning times were significantly reduced (scanning times cut in half, calibration three times faster). The biopsy module worked with an accuracy of 3.2 mm. Discussion Using the Virtobot, the surface-scanning procedure could be standardized and accelerated. The biopsy module is accurate enough for use in biopsies in a forensic setting. Conclusion The Virtobot can be utilized for several independent tasks in the field of forensic medicine, and is sufficiently versatile to be adapted to different tasks in the future.

AB  - Abstract Successful treatment of cancer patients requires balancing of the dose, timing, and type of therapeutic regimen. Detection of increased cell death may serve as a predictor of the eventual therapeutic success. Imaging of cell death may thus lead to early identification of treatment responders and nonresponders, and to ?patient-tailored therapy.? Cell death in organs and tissues of the human body can be visualized, using positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography, although unsolved problems remain concerning target selection, tracer pharmacokinetics, target-to-nontarget ratio, and spatial and temporal resolution of the scans. Phosphatidylserine exposure by dying cells has been the most extensively studied imaging target. However, visualization of this process with radiolabeled Annexin A5 has not become routine in the clinical setting. Classification of death modes is no longer based only on cell morphology but also on biochemistry, and apoptosis is no longer found to be the preponderant mechanism of cell death after antitumor therapy, as was earlier believed. These conceptual changes have affected radiochemical efforts. Novel probes targeting changes in membrane permeability, cytoplasmic pH, mitochondrial membrane potential, or caspase activation have recently been explored. In this review, we discuss molecular changes in tumors which can be targeted to visualize cell death and we propose promising biomarkers for future exploration.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Purpose:? To establish the diagnostic role of imaging by ultrasound for the diagnosis of uveal effusion syndrome. Methods:? Using ultrasonic imaging features as the main criteria for evaluation, the recorded data from 16 patients with presumed uveal effusion seen between 1994 and 2000 were reviewed and analysed for clinical manifestations and current diagnostic suggestions. Eventually, as cumulating experience suggested that ultrasound is capable of indicating uveal effusion, the study set-up became in part more prospective. Results:? The two main ultrasonic features found were: (1) extended multi-layered detachment patterns by B-scan, often kinetically mobile; (2) a spongy oedematous ciliary body region, often with interstitial lacunae, as demonstrated by high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy (50 Mhz). Conclusions:? In patients with visual loss and ambiguous detachment-like fundus pathology, ultrasonic features are often of practical guidance for diagnosing uveal effusion syndrome.

AB  - The orbit is made up of seven bones, of which, the inferior wall is most vulnerable to injury and the lateral wall, the least common. In assessing facial trauma, it is crucial to include a comprehensive examination and to manage the orbital fractures accordingly. Orbital floor fracture may present with enophthalmos, diplopia and inferior orbital neuropathy. The infra-orbital rim may show a step-off deformity. Full ophthalmologic evaluation is important to rule out optic nerve neuropathy, retinal bleed, and corneal abrasion. Fracture extending to the superior orbital fissure is known as the superior orbital fissure syndrome, often presented with third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves dysfunction. Orbital roof fracture may involve the frontal lobe and frontal sinus. Fracture involving the naso-orbital ethmoid complex may present with CSF leak, diplopia, displaced medial canthus and nasal fracture. High-resolution 1.5mm CT scans is most useful in the aid of diagnosis in addition to tomography. Displaced fractures should be corrected surgically before bony union. Two examples of complex orbital fractures will be presented, illustrating the importance of a multi-surgical team approach to achieve the optimum results.

AB  - Abstract:? Sending young children to boarding school may be considered a particularly British form of child abuse and social control. The trauma of the rupture with home may be followed by other ordeals such as emotional deprivation and, in extreme cases, physical and sexual abuse. The taboo on expressing emotion, which is common in such institutions, may lead to an encapsulation of the self. Consequently, the needs of the distressed child/self remain active, but unconscious, within the adult. This maybe disguised by an armoured, and very often socially successful, persona. The psychological interplay, between these two facets of the personality, may be detrimental to intimate relationships. In clinical practice the emotional conflict between a desire for intimacy and anticipated exile comes to the fore. Three examples demonstrate how within the transference this may lead to a dependent and erotic atmosphere, which abruptly changes to sever all connection. Changes in the frame, breaks in analysis, and confessions of emotional need are all points at which vigilance is required if such disturbance in analysis is not to end in its abrupt termination.

AB  - Summary The vast majority of infants born with congenital heart disease now survive well into adulthood. Improved longevity has exposed patients to alternative sources of morbidity and mortality, of which arrhythmias figure prominently. While in some instances, supraventricular arrhythmias are intrinsic to the congenital heart defect, they predominantly arise as a consequence of corrective surgery where patches, baffles, conduits and suture lines intermix with fibrosis and hypertrophy to create the substrate for focal and macroreentrant tachycardias. An improved understanding of arrhythmia substrates has paralleled technological advances in imaging, three-dimensional mapping, and lesion creation such that catheter ablation has become an indispensable therapeutic modality for supraventricular arrhythmias in congenital heart disease. However, such advances are not a substitute for a clear understanding of anatomical complexities, potential variations in the location and susceptibility to injury of the sinus and atrioventricular nodes, challenges related to vascular and intra-cardiac access, and anticipated arrhythmia substrates. It is the purpose of this chapter to focus on imaging, mapping, and ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias in various common forms of congenital heart disease.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Abstract Aim? Adequate colonic imaging is generally an invasive procedure with attendant risks, particularly perforation. Endoscopy, barium enema and computed tomographic colonography (CTC) are the main techniques for investigating patients with symptoms of, or screening for, colorectal cancer. The potential complications of these investigations have to be weighed against the benefits. This article reviews the literature on the incidence, presentation and management of iatrogenic colonic perforation at colonic imaging. Method? A literature review of relevant studies was undertaken using PubMed, Cochrane library and personal archives of references. Manual cross-referencing was performed, and relevant references from selected articles were reviewed. Studies reporting complications of endoscopy, barium enema and CT colonography were included in this review. Results? Twenty-four studies were identified comprising 640 433 colonoscopies, with iatrogenic perforation recorded in 585 patients (0.06%). The reported perforation rate with double-contrast barium enema was between 0.02 and 0.24%. Serious complications with CTC were infrequent, though nine perforations were reported in a case series of 24?365 patients (0.036%) undergoing CTC. Conclusion? Perforation remains an infrequent and almost certainly under-reported, complication of all colonic imaging modalities. Risk awareness, early diagnosis and active management of iatrogenic perforation minimizes an adverse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Cell-specific imaging has been proposed to increase the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for tissue analysis. The hypothezis of the present work was that following intravenous injection of ultra-small particle iron oxide, a contrast agent that accumulates in mononuclear phagocyte cells, macrophages with iron burden would be detectable by MRI within the central nervous system at sites of inflammatory cellular activity. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats (in which intense macrophage activity results from both hematogenous macrophages and activated microglia), lesions have been seen by MRI as low signal intensities related to magnetic susceptibility effects induced by iron particles. Electron microscopy has revealed the presence of such particles within the cytoplasm of cells that had the morphological aspect of macrophages. Macrophage activity imaging might increase MRI capability with regard to the in vivo pathophysiological aspects of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and might help in therapeutic trials in the numerous CNS diseases in which macrophages are involved.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this review is to highlight the major imaging characteristics of the main soft-tissue sarcoma histotypes observed in the group ?Sarcomi? of the Istituto Oncologico Veneto in the last 5 years. A literature review was performed using PubMed and textbooks. Radiological imaging can guide the diagnosis for the subset of lesions that have typical clinical and imaging features. Soft-tissue tumors are common in clinical practice and a systematic clinical and imaging approach may guide the diagnosis. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2013;37:791?804. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Data about the predictive value of quantitative diffusion-weighted MRI in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is lacking. This study aimed to determine if specific apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds could be determined that correlate with outcome in moderate-severe TBI. METHODS This retrospective observational study investigated patients with moderate-severe TBI. MRIs obtained post-injury days 1-13 were analyzed. MRIs were obtained on a 1.5T scanner; 20-23 contiguous diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sections with a spin-echo echo planar imaging DWI 256?256 reconstructed matrix; field of view 24?24 cm; slice thickness/gap of 5/1.5 or 5/2.5 mm. The ADC value of each brain tissue voxel was determined. The percentage of voxels below different ADC thresholds was calculated and correlated with outcome. A good outcome was defined as discharge to home or a rehabilitation facility. RESULTS Seventy-six patients were analyzed. Thirty-five patients (46%) had a good outcome. The timing of MRI scans did not differ between groups, but the mean age did (42Â±18 years vs. 56Â±19 years, p<.01, good vs. poor outcome). Patients with poor outcome had significantly higher percentage of brain volume with ADC < 400?10-6 mm2/second (.85Â±.67% vs. .60Â±.29%, poor vs. good outcome, p<.05). Using a ROC curve analysis and Youden's index, an ADC <400?10-6 mm2/second in â¥.49% of brain was 85% sensitive and 46% specific for poor outcome (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative MRI offers additional prognostic information in acute TBI. A whole brain tissue ADC threshold of <400?10-6 mm2/second in â¥.49% of brain may be a novel prognostic biomarker.

AB  - Summary The important role of molar teeth in the dentition mainly consists in their contribution to mastication, because they carry a considerable part of the occlusal load. This chapter reveals how the posterior position of molars makes them less accessible for cleaning, whether it may be self-performed or carried out by a dental professional. This fact, combined with the unique anatomy of molars, poses a challenge for all dentists focusing on molar retention. The evolution of more than one root sets molars apart from the rest of the dentition: in multi-rooted teeth the enamel organ expands with projections of Hertwig's root sheath. Aetiological factors interact with the anatomical factors and may lead to periodontal destruction and attachment loss in molars, and thus result in a furcation defect. It can be concluded that special care needs to be taken when placing restorations, and overhangs need to be diagnosed and removed as early as possible.

AB  - Abstract In 2007, heritage agencies in the United Kingdom commemorated the bicentenary of the abolition of the British transatlantic slave trade. How, and in what ways, did the commemorations take place? Who were the audiences and what were the stories? To what extent and in what way did they ensure multicultural inclusivity? This paper argues that the commemorations were hampered by lack of expertise, confusion in objectives, and failure to acknowledge contestation. However, the fact that it took place at all broke a barrier, and the issue of European involvement in the slave trade is now on the public agenda as a consequence. I will suggest that issues of government support and funding proved central to how the story was told and whose stories were told. On this basis I will suggest that the 2007 commemorations are instructive as we develop the means of interpreting historical trauma within a multicultural society.

AB  - Synthesis of a contrast agent for biomedical imaging is of great interest where magnetic nanoparticles are concerned, because of the strong influence of particle size on transverse relaxivity. In the present study, biocompatible magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts, followed by surface adsorption with reduced dextran. The synthesized nanoparticles were spherical in shape, and 12?Â±?2?nm in size as measured using transmission electron microscopy; this was corroborated with results from X-ray diffraction and dynamic light scattering studies. The nanoparticles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior, superior T2 relaxation rate and high relaxivities (r1?=?18.4?Â±?0.3, r2?=?90.5?Â±?0.8?s?1 mM?1, at 7?T). MR image analysis of animals before and after magnetic nanoparticle administration revealed that the signal intensity of tumor imaging, specific organ imaging and whole body imaging can be clearly distinguished, due to the strong relaxation properties of these nanoparticles. Very low concentrations (3.0?mg Fe/kg body weight) of iron oxides are sufficient for early detection of tumors, and also have a clear distinction in pre- and post-enhancement of contrast in organs and body imaging. Many investigators have demonstrated high relaxivities of magnetic nanoparticles at superparamagnetic iron oxide level above 50?nm, but this investigation presents a satisfactory, ultrasmall, superparamagnetic and high transverse relaxivity negative contrast agent for diagnosis in pre-clinical studies.
