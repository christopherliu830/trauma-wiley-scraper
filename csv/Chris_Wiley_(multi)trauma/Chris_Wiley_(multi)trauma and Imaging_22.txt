AB  - Abstract Objective Examination of the skin barrier repair/wound healing process using a living skin equivalent (LSE) model and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to identify lipids directly involved as potential biomarkers. These biomarkers may be used to determine whether an in vivo wound is going to heal for example if infected. Methods An in vitro LSE model was wounded with a scalpel blade and assessed at day 4 post-wounding by histology and MALDI-MSI. Samples were sectioned at wound site and were either formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for histology or snapped frozen (FF) for MSI analysis. Results The combination of using an in vitro wounded skin model with MSI allowed the identification of lipids involved in the skin barrier repair/wound healing process. The technique was able to highlight lipids directly in the wound site and distinguish differences in lipid distribution between the epidermis and wound site. Conclusion This novel method of coupling an in vitro LSE with MSI allowed in-depth molecular analysis of the skin barrier repair/wound healing process. The technique allowed the identification of lipids directly involved in the skin barrier repair/wound healing process, indicating these biomarkers may be potentially be used within the clinic. These biomarkers will help to determine, which stage of the skin barrier repair/wound healing process the wound is in to provide the best treatment.

AB  - Objectives To report the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging features, treatments and outcomes of canine vertebral chondrosarcoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective review of medical records of dogs with confirmed vertebral chondrosarcoma and magnetic resonance imaging of the lesions, from four different veterinary referral institutions. Results A total of six dogs were included in this report. In all cases, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lobulated mass involving the dorsal vertebral compartment, markedly hyperintense with few foci of hypointensity on T2-weighted images, iso to hypointense on T1-weighted images with contrast enhancement after gadolinium administration. Intralesional surgical resection was performed in three dogs and medical management in one, two dogs were euthanased and all lesions were submitted for histopathology. Magnetic resonance imaging findings correlated with histological findings of a low tumour grade. Rapid clinical improvement was noted after surgery but two of three dogs had local regrowth. Clinical Significance Chondrosarcomas show local aggressiveness and resistance to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and so prognosis depends on feasibility of en bloc resection. Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in establishing a presumptive diagnosis and prognosis based on the feasibility of surgical resection.

AB  - Abstract Studies on human patients and animal models of disease have shown that disruptions in prenatal and early postnatal brain development are a root cause of mental retardation. Since proper brain development is achieved by a strict spatiotemporal control of neurogenesis, cell migration, and patterning of synapses, abnormalities in one or more of these events during prenatal development can lead to cognitive dysfunction after birth. Many of underlying causes of mental retardation must therefore be studied in developing brains. To aid in this research, live imaging using laser scanning microscopy (LSM) has recently allowed neuroscientists to delve deeply into the complex three-dimensional environment of the living brain to record dynamic cellular events over time. This review will highlight recent examples of how LSM is being applied to elucidate both normal and abnormal cortical development. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MRDD Research Reviews 2005;11:303?316.

The study sought to support the development of profiles and criteria that may be used to formulate Advanced Scopes of Practice for the profession. It commenced in 2011, following on from initial research that occurred between 2005 and 2008 investigating role development and a possible career structure for medical radiation technologists (MRTs) in New Zealand (NZ). Methods The study sought to support the development of profiles and criteria that could be used to develop Advanced Scopes of Practice for the profession through inviting 12 specialist medical imaging groups in NZ to participate in a survey. Results Findings showed strong agreement on potential profiles and on generic criteria within them; however, there was less agreement on specific skills criteria within specialist areas. Conclusions The authors recommend that one Advanced Scope of Practice be developed for Medical Imaging, with the establishment of generic and specialist criteria. Systems for approval of the overall criteria package for any individual Advanced Practitioner (AP) profile, audit and continuing professional development requirements need to be established by the Medical Radiation Technologists Board (MRTB) to meet the local needs of clinical departments. It is further recommended that the NZIMRT and MRTB promote and support the need for an AP pathway for medical imaging in NZ.

AB  - Summary Multidetector-row computed tomographic contrast angiography (MDCTA) is routinely employed to investigate vascular masses in human patients but, to date, the use of this technique to investigate an aneurysmal mass has not been reported in an equine case. The potential of MDCTA to investigate a right-sided parapharyngeal mass in a 6-week-old Thoroughbred foal was therefore investigated. A 4-slice helical computed tomography scanner was used on a superficial, firm, ovoid mass yielding arterial blood on fine needle aspiration. MDCTA enabled identification of the vessels involved thus assisting in forming a diagnosis based on the morphology of the lesion and aided surgical planning. Histology confirmed the presence of mural thrombus and calcification within the smooth muscle wall consistent with a true aneurysm. MDCTA provided additional information to conventional imaging in this case of vascular masses of the head and neck. The technique therefore has the potential to improve diagnosis and assist in the management of such lesions.

AB  - Objectives: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in veterinary practice and, in some centres, is part of the diagnostic work-up of small animals with nasal disease. However, there are no published studies which critically evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging for this purpose. The purpose of this work was to assess the changes seen using magnetic resonance imaging and to compare them with radiography. Methods: The study included 12 dogs that had undergone both radiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the nasal cavity and had a histopathological diagnosis of malignant nasal neoplasia. Two pairs of board-certified radiologists scored the radiographs and the MRI scans, evaluating 10 signs of abnormality using a simple scoring system. Magnetic resonance imaging features were described in detail, and radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging scores for each sign as well as total scores were compared. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging often showed that the tumour was more extensive than it had appeared on radiography but occasionally showed that radiographs had overestimated its size. Although radiography was reliable for assessment of the presence and size of a mass and for the extent of turbinate destruction, it usually failed to show occlusion of the major airway passages that were evident on magnetic resonance imaging. Extension of the tumour into the opposite nasal cavity, frontal sinus, orbit and cranial cavity was shown much better on magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical Significance: Minor but significant extension beyond the nasal cavity, which is important for treatment planning and prognosis, requires magnetic resonance imaging for demonstration, although radiography shows major changes reliably.

AB  - SUMMARY Calcium plays a central role as a second messenger in plant and fungal cells and as such is involved in controlling numerous biological processes. Direct demonstration of signal-response coupling via Ca2+ requires the measurement and localization of changes in cytosolic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, during these processes in living cells. In recent years this has become possible with the introduction of a range of fluorescent dyes (e.g. Indo-1 Fura-2 and Fluo-3) which have a high affinity and selectivity for free Ca2+. When used with recently developed microscope technologies (e.g. fluorescence ratio imaging or confocal scanning laser microscopy), subcellular localization and precise quantification of [Ca2+]i dynamics in single cells can be achieved. This review describes the principles of [Ca2+]i imaging and measurement using fluorescent dyes, the equipment required to do it, the problems with botanical material and how they are being overcome, future developments for this approach in plant cell biology, and an entirely different strategy for the imaging and measurement of [Ca2+]i involving genetic transformation with the aequorin gene.

AB  - Background Patients with traumatic bladder rupture frequently have associated pelvic fracture. With increasing numbers of pelvic fractures fixed internally, there are concerns that conservative management of bladder rupture may increase the risk of pelvic metalware infection. This study aims to determine if operative repair of bladder rupture in comparison to conservative management with catheter drainage alone is associated with a lower rate of infection of internal fixation device for concurrent pelvic fracture. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of level IV evidence. From July 2001 through June 2013, 45 multi-trauma patients at a level 1 trauma centre were identified to have sustained bladder rupture with concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation. Clinicopathological data were extracted from the TraumaNET database, medical records and health-coding database. Patients were stratified into two retrospective cohorts, management with surgical repair and management with catheter drainage alone. Fischer's exact test was used to determine whether the rate of pelvic metalware infection was different in the two cohorts. Results Of the 45 patients, 13 had intraperitoneal bladder rupture, 28 had extraperitoneal bladder rupture and four had combined intra-extraperitoneal bladder rupture. The median age for this cohort was 31. Bladder rupture was surgically repaired in 36 patients and managed conservatively with catheter drainage in nine patients. The rate of pelvic internal fixation device infection was lower in patients managed with surgical repair compared with conservative management (5.6% versus 33.3%, P = 0.047). Conclusion Operative repair of bladder rupture is associated with a lower rate of pelvic orthopaedic hardware infection in the presence of concurrent pelvic fracture requiring internal fixation.

AB  - Abstract Quantum dot (QD) contrast-enhanced molecular imaging has potential for early cancer detection and image guided treatment, but there is a lack of quantitative image contrast data to determine optimum QD administered doses, affecting the feasibility, risk and cost of such procedures, especially in vivo. Vascular fluorescence contrast-enhanced imaging is performed on nude mice bearing dorsal skinfold window chambers, injected with 4 different QD solutions emitting in the visible and near infrared. Linear relationships are observed among the vascular contrast, injected contrast agent volume, and QD concentration in blood. Due primarily to differential light absorption by blood, the vasculature is optimally visualized when exciting in the 435?480 nm region in 81% of the cases (89 out of 110 regions of interest in 22 window chambers). The threshold dose, defined here as the quantity of injected nanoparticles required to yield a vascular target-to-autofluorescence ratio of 2, varies from 10.6 to 0.15 pmol g?1 depending on the QD emission wavelength. The wavelength optimization maximum and broadband gain, defined as the ratio of threshold doses estimated for optimal and suboptimal (worst wavelength or broadband) spectral illumination, has average values of 4.5 and 1.9, respectively. This study demonstrates, for the first time, optimized QD imaging in vivo. It also proposes and validates a theoretical framework for QD dose estimation and quantifies the effects of blood absorption, QD emission wavelength, and vessel diameter relative to the threshold dose.

AB  - Abstract Objective Despite mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounting for 80% of head injury diagnoses, recognition of individuals at risk of cognitive dysfunction remains a challenge in the acute setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential role for computerised cognitive testing as part of a complete ED head injury assessment. Methods mTBI patients (n =?36) who incurred a head injury within 24?h of presentation to the ED were compared to trauma controls (n = 20) and healthy controls (n =?20) on tests assessing reaction time, speed and attention, episodic memory, working memory and executive functioning. Testing occurred during their visit to the ED at a mean of 12?h post-injury for mTBI and 9.4?h for trauma controls. These tasks were part of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery iPad application. Healthy controls were tested in both a quiet environment and the ED to investigate the potential effects of noise and distraction on neurocognitive function. Results Reaction time was significantly slower in the mTBI group compared to trauma patients (P =?0.015) and healthy controls (P =?0.011), and deficits were also seen in working memory compared to healthy controls (P?≤?0.001) and in executive functioning (P =?0.021 and P <?0.001) compared to trauma and healthy controls. Performances in the control group did not differ between testing environments. Conclusion Computerised neurocognitive testing in the ED is feasible and can be utilised to detect deficits in cognitive performance in the mTBI population as part of a routine head injury assessment.

AB  - Summary The use of contrast media in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing in horses. These contrast-enhanced imaging techniques provide improved tissue delineation and evaluation, thereby expanding diagnostic capabilities. While generally considered safe, not all contrast media exhibit the same safety profiles. The safety of contrast media use and descriptions of adverse events occurring in horses are sparsely reported. This review summarises the reported evidence of contrast media use and adverse events that occur in horses, with added contribution from other veterinary species and studies in man for comparison. This comprehensive data set empowers equine clinicians to develop use and monitoring strategies when working with contrast media. Finally, it summarises the current state-of-the-art and highlights the potential applications of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for assessment of diseased or injured equine tissues, as well as (patho)physiological processes.

Methods Thirty-one patients underwent wedge resection of BBs (29 unilateral and 2 bilateral) for PSP from January 2010 to January 2013. Two observers assessed the presence and locations of BBs independently using high-resolution CT (HRCT) and routine CT reconstruction, and compared the sensitivities of each reconstruction method for BB detection using operative findings as a standard reference. In addition, the number of BBs in each CT image set was recorded and inter-observer agreements were evaluated. Results Sensitivity for the detection of BBs was significantly better for HRCT than routine CT (97.0% vs. 63.6% for observer 1 and 94.0% vs. 57.6% for observer 2, respectively, both P-values?<?0.001). On a per-bleb and a per-bulla basis, inter-observer agreements regarding BBs by HRCT were good and very good (k?=?0.66 and 0.94, respectively) and superior to those determined by routine CT (k?=?0.59 and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion Different slice thickness reconstructions influence the diagnostic efficacy of MDCT for the detection of BBs in patients with PSP. High-resolution thin slice CT reconstruction was found to have a significantly greater sensitivity than routine thicker slice thickness reconstruction for the detection of BBs.

Reliability and inter-observer agreement were excellent (correlation coefficients r?>?0.99.). This method is accurate and reliable. It shows promise for reducing radiation dose to the paediatric population at large by replacing measurements based on radiographs or computed tomography.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to explore the meanings and implications of dangerous memories in two different sites of past traumatic memories: one in Israel and the other in Cyprus. Dangerous memories are defined as those memories that are disruptive to the status quo, that is, the hegemonic culture of strengthening and perpetuating existing group-based identities. Our effort is to outline some insights from this endeavor?insights that may help educators recognize the potential of dangerous memories to ease pain and offer hope. First, a discussion on memory, history and identity sets the ground for discussing the meaning and significance of dangerous memories in the history curriculum. Next, we narrate two stories from our longitudinal ethnographic studies on trauma and memory in Israel and Cyprus; these stories are interpreted through the lens of dangerous memories and their workings in relation to the hegemonic powers that aim to sustain collective memories. The two different stories suggest that collective memories of historical trauma are not simply ?transmitted? in any simple way down the generations?although there are powerful workings that support this transmission. Rather, there seems to be much ambivalence in the workings of memories that under some circumstances may create openings for new identities. The final section discusses the possibilities of developing a pedagogy of dangerous memories by highlighting educational implications that focus on the notion of creating new solidarities without forgetting past traumas. This last section employs dangerous memories as a critical category for pedagogy in the context of our general concern about the implications of memory, history and identity in educational contexts.
