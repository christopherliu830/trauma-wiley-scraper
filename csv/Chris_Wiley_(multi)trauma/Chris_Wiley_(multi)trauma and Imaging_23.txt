AB  - Purpose Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an approach to characterizing the non-Gaussian fraction of water diffusion in biological tissue. However, DKI is highly susceptible to the low signal-to-noise ratio of diffusion-weighted images, causing low precision and a significant bias due to Rician noise distribution. Here, we evaluate precision and bias using weighted linear least squares fitting of different acquisition schemes including several multishell schemes, a diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) scheme, as well as a compressed sensing reconstruction of undersampled DSI scheme. Methods Monte Carlo simulations were performed to study the three-dimensional distribution of the apparent kurtosis coefficient (AKC). Experimental data were acquired from one healthy volunteer with multiple repetitions, using the same acquisition schemes as for the simulations. Results The angular distribution of the bias and precision were very inhomogeneous. While axial kurtosis was significantly overestimated, radial kurtosis was underestimated. The precision of radial kurtosis was up to 10-fold lower than axial kurtosis. Conclusion The noise bias behavior of DKI is highly complex and can cause overestimation as well as underestimation of the AKC even within one voxel. The acquisition scheme with three shells, suggested by Poot et al, provided overall the best performance.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in young individuals worldwide. However, the understanding of TBI at secondary phase remained obscure, and more knowledge of the pathophysiology of TBI is necessary. In this study, we examined the influence of bone fracture (BF) on TBI and investigated whether blocking high mobility group 1 (HMGB1) protein, an inflammatory mediator, could be effective to alleviate TBI. We found neurological severity was significantly increased by BF at 4 days post-TBI with longer removal time of adhesive tape and higher percentage of left turn in the corner test compared to TBI treatment alone. Additionally, higher brain lesion volume and severer brain oedema in TBI + BF mice supports the negative effect of BF on TBI. HMGB1 level was significantly stimulated by BF, suggesting the important role of HMGB1 in the development of secondary TBI. Notably, ablation of HMGB1 significantly reduced this negative influence of BF on TBI. These results suggest that HMGB1 can be massively induced by the systemic immune activation triggered by BF, which in turn aggravates inflammation. Blocking HMGB1 reduced the inflammatory effect of BF and therefore helps lessen the severity of secondary TBI. In conclusion, these results provided the evidence that anti-HMGB1 may be an effective and feasible method to alleviate TBI.

AB  - Abstract Translocator protein (TSPO) is a biomarker of neuroinflammation, which is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases and has been exploited as a positron emission tomography (PET) target. Carbon-11-labelled PK11195 remains the most applied agent for imaging TSPO, despite its short-lived isotope and low brain permeability. Second-generation radiotracers show variance in affinity amongst subjects (low-, mixed-, and high-affinity binders) caused by the genetic polymorphism (rs6971) of the TSPO gene. To overcome these limitations, a new structural scaffold was explored based on the TSPO pharmacophore, and the analogue with a low-affinity binder/high-affinity binder (LAB/HAB) ratio similar (1.2 vs. 1.3) to that of (R)-[11C]PK11195 was investigated. The synthesis of the reference compound was accomplished in six steps and 9?% overall yield, and the precursor was prepared in eight steps and 8?% overall yield. The chiral separation of the reference and precursor compounds was performed using supercritical fluid chromatography with >95?%?ee. The absolute configuration was determined by circular dichroism. Optimisation of reaction conditions for manual radiolabelling revealed acetonitrile as a preferred solvent at 100?°C. Automation of this radiolabelling method provided R and S enantiomers in respective 21.3±16.7 and 25.6±7.1?% decay-corrected yields and molar activities of 55.8±35.6 and 63.5±39.5?GBq??mol?1 (n=3). Injection of the racemic analogue into a healthy rat confirmed passage through the blood?brain barrier.

AB  - Objective The identification of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among natural disaster survivors is remarkably challenging, and there are no reliable objective signatures that can be used to assist clinical diagnosis and optimize treatment. The current study aimed to establish a neurobiological signature of PTSD from the connectivity of large-scale brain networks and clarify the brain network mechanisms of PTSD. Methods We examined fifty-seven unmedicated survivors with chronic PTSD and 59 matched trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We extracted the node-to-network connectivity and obtained a feature vector with a dimensionality of 864 (108 nodes ? 8 networks) to represent each subject?s functional connectivity (FC) profile. Multivariate pattern analysis with a relevance vector machine was then used to distinguish PTSD patients from TEHCs. Results We achieved a promising diagnostic accuracy of 89.2% in distinguishing PTSD patients from TEHCs. The most heavily weighted connections for PTSD classification were among the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VIS), somatomotor network, limbic network, and dorsal attention network (DAN). The strength of the anticorrelation of FC between the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in DMN and the VIS and DAN was associated with the severity of PTSD. Conclusions This study achieved relatively high accuracy in classifying PTSD patients vs. TEHCs at the individual level. This performance demonstrates that rs-fMRI-derived multivariate classification based on large-scale brain networks can provide potential signatures both to facilitate clinical diagnosis and to clarify the underlying brain network mechanisms of PTSD caused by natural disasters.

AB  - Abstract Histopathological studies have suggested that spontaneous degeneration of knee menisci predisposes to symptomatic tears. We used magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to study noninvasively 20 patients with documented meniscal tears in one knee but asymptomatic contralateral knees, 18 normal controls, and 15 patients with symptomatic nonmeniscal knee disorders. A scoring system for MR signal changes was developed, and differences between the three groups were tested for significance by a multivariate analysis of covariance. MR signal changes in the menisci begin at around 30 years of age, progress with age, occur in both men and women, and occur in subjects who are inactive as well as those who undergo habitual knee stress exercises. Most subjects with documented meniscal tears in one knee have MR signals in the asymptomatic contralateral knee that reflect a more advanced degree of meniscal degeneration than in age-comparable normal controls or patients with nonmeniscal knee disorders. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, weight, and sex, the mean scores in the asymptomatic knee of patients with meniscal disease are significantly higher than those of normal controls (p = 0.021) and nonmeniscal disease patients (p = 0.019). These results document the occurrence of age-dependent degeneration within knee menisci, and support the hypothesis that a segment of the population has pre-existing meniscal degeneration predisposing them to traumatic or spontaneous meniscal tears.

AB  - A case of idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in a six-month-old male Maremma shepherd dog is reported. The dog was referred with a four month history of progressive weakness and depression with loss of trained habits. Tendency to recumbency, disorientation, visual impairment, bilaterally decreased menace response and hindlimb conscious proprioception deficits were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse hypointense signal involving the cerebral grey matter with enlargement of the cerebral sulci on T1-weighted and fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences consistent with a diffuse necrosis or atrophy of the cortical grey matter. Histological examination revealed severe inflammatory infiltration mainly composed of eosinophils and macrophages in the subarachnoid space and in the superficial layer of the cerebral cortex where parenchymal rarefaction and necrosis of neurones were also evident. No parasites, cysts or fungi were detected, and an immunologically mediated disorder was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging may represent a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis from other inflammatory brain diseases of young dogs.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the complex fiber orientations and 3D collagen fiber network of knee joint connective tissues, including ligaments, muscle, articular cartilage, and meniscus using high spatial and angular resolution diffusion imaging. Methods Two rat knee joints were scanned using a modified 3D diffusion-weighted spin echo pulse sequence with the isotropic spatial resolution of 45 ?m at 9.4T. The b values varied from 250 to 1250 s/mm2 with 31 diffusion encoding directions for 1 rat knee. The b value was fixed to 1000 s/mm2 with 147 diffusion encoding directions for the second knee. Both the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model and generalized Q-sampling imaging (GQI) method were used to investigate the fiber orientation distributions and tractography with the validation of polarized light microscopy. Results To better resolve the crossing fibers, the b value should be great than or equal to 1000 s/mm2. The tractography results were comparable between the DTI model and GQI method in ligament and muscle. However, the tractography exhibited apparent difference between DTI and GQI in connective tissues with more complex collagen fibers network, such as cartilage and meniscus. In articular cartilage, there were numerous crossing fibers found in superficial zone and transitional zone. Tractography generated with GQI also resulted in more intact tracts in articular cartilage than DTI. Conclusion High-resolution diffusion imaging with GQI method can trace the complex collagen fiber orientations and architectures of the knee joint at microscopic resolution.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to determine whether DTI changes in the brain induced by a thoracic spinal cord injury are sensitive to varying severity of spinal contusion in rats. Methods A control, mild, moderate, or severe contusion injury was administered over the eighth thoracic vertebral level in 32 Sprague-Dawley rats. At 11 weeks postinjury, ex vivo DTI of the brain was performed on a 9.4T Bruker scanner using a pulsed gradient spin-echo sequence. Results Mean water diffusion in the internal capsule regions of the brain and pyramid locations of the brainstem were correlated with motor function (r2?=?0.55). Additionally, there were significant differences between injury severity groups for mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy at regions associated with the corticospinal tract (P?=?0.05). Conclusion These results indicate that DTI is sensitive to changes in brain tissue as a consequence of thoracic SCI. J. MAGN. RESON. IMAGING 2016;43:63?74.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disease where functional and structural abnormalities of small blood vessels prevail. Recently, transient ischemic attacks, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhages have been reported as primary consequence of vascular central nervous system affection in systemic sclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered to be the most sensitive diagnostic technique for detecting symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions in the brain in cases of multifocal diseases. Objective:? Evaluate brain changes in patients with systemic sclerosis using MRI. Patients and methods:? Thirty female patients with systemic sclerosis aged 27?61?years, with disease duration of 1?9?years and with no history of other systemic disease or cerebrovascular accidents, were enrolled. An age-matched female control group of 30 clinically normal subjects, underwent brain MR examination. Results:? Central nervous system involvement in the form of white matter hyperintense foci of variable sizes were found in significantly abundant forms in systemic sclerosis patients on MR evaluation than in the age-related control group, signifying a form of central nervous system vasculopathy. Such foci showed no definite correlation with disease duration, yet they showed significant correlation to severity of peripheral vascular disease, headaches, fainting attacks and depression in the group under study. Conclusion:? Asymptomatic as well as symptomatic central nervous system ischemic vasculopathy is not uncommon in systemic sclerosis patients and MRI is considered a sensitive noninvasive screening tool for early detection of CNS involvement in patients with systemic sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the long-term outcome of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and pericardectomy for treatment of chylothorax in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Thirty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods Dogs were included if they had undergone a VATS TDL and pericardectomy and had at least 1-year follow-up or had died within 1 postoperative year. Medical records were evaluated, and recorded data included clinicopathological and diagnostic imaging results, surgical findings, complications, conversion rates, and long-term resolution and recurrence rates. Results Thirty-nine dogs met the inclusion criteria. Two dogs died intraoperatively; 1 was euthanized after severe restrictive pleuritis was diagnosed intraoperatively, and 1 underwent ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest during pericardectomy and could not be resuscitated. Conversion to an open approach was required in 1 of 39 (3%) dogs for TDL and 4 of 36 (11%) dogs for pericardectomy. Overall follow-up time was median 38 months (range, 3-115). Resolution of pleural effusion occurred in 35 of 37 (95%) dogs that survived the perioperative period. Late recurrence of pleural effusion was seen at 12, 12, and 19 months postoperatively in 3 of 35 (9%) dogs that survived the perioperative period and in which chylothorax had initially resolved. Conclusion Successful long-term resolution of chylothorax was seen in a high proportion of dogs that underwent VATS TDL and pericardectomy, although late recurrence was sometimes seen. Clinical significance Video-assisted thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation and pericardectomy are highly successful in dogs with chylothorax. Future studies should evaluate whether pericardectomy is required in dogs without evidence of pericardial disease.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: No previous study compares computed tomography (CT), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and standing low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LFMRI) to detect lesions in horses with lameness localised to the foot. This study will help clinicians understand the limitations of these techniques. Objectives: To determine if CT, CECT and LFMRI would identify lesions within the distal limb and document discrepancies with lesion distribution and lesion classification. Methods: Lesions in specific structures identified on CT and MR images of feet (31 limbs) from the same horse were reviewed and compared. Distributions of lesions were compared using a Chi-squared test and techniques analysed using the paired marginal homogeneity test for concordance. Results: Lesions of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) were most common and CT/CECT identified more lesions than LFMRI. Deep digital flexor tendon lesions seen on LFMRI only were frequently distal to the proximal extent of the distal sesamoid and DDFT lesions seen on CT/CECT only were frequently proximal to the distal sesamoid. Lesions identified on LFMRI only were core (23.3%) or splits (43.3%), whereas lesions identified only on CT were abrasions (29.8%), core (15.8%), enlargement (15.8%) or mineralisation (12.3%). Contrast-enhanced CT improved lesion identification at the DDFT insertion compared to CT and resulted in distal sesamoidean impar ligament and collateral sesamoidean ligament vascular enhancement in 75% of cases. Low-field MRI and CT/CECT failed to identify soft tissue mineralisation and bone oedema, respectively. Conclusions and potential relevance: Multiple lesions are detected with CT, CECT and LFMRI but there is variability in lesion detection and classification. LFMRI centred only on the podotrochlear apparatus may fail to identify lesions of the pastern or soft tissue mineralisation. Computed tomography may fail to identify DDFT lesions distal to the proximal border of the distal sesamoid.

AB  - It is well established that connection and support are associated with supporting recovery from eating disorders whereas isolation and feeling misunderstood can be barriers to change. While the consumer and recovery movements have long advocated for treatments that go beyond symptom reduction alone to include factors such as connection with others, there are few treatments that are designed to target these directly for young people with eating disorders and their families. In 2014 the Sydney Children's Hospital Network Eating Disorder Service at The Children's Hospital at Westmead introduced multi-family therapy (MFT), the first program of its kind in Australia, with a primary aim being to increase solidarity and support for families in addition to helping promote eating disorder recovery more broadly. Rooted in the principles of family therapy for anorexia nervosa, MFT generally brings together six to eight families for a four-consecutive day workshop followed by six single follow-up workshops over the course of six months. This paper reviews the current literature available on MFT, describes its introduction at a specialist tertiary eating disorder service in Australia, explores preliminary feedback from families, and discusses the importance of creating solidarity for families affected by eating disorders.

AB  - In recent years, local activists in the Global North and South have been organizing to improve degraded and abandoned spaces in marginalized neighborhoods by creating parks, playgrounds, urban farms, or community gardens. This paper integrates existing knowledge on urban place attachment and sense of community with scholarship on environmental justice in order to understand the role of place attachment in environmental mobilization in distressed neighborhoods across political systems and urbanization contexts. It examines the different forms of connections that activists develop and express toward neighborhoods with long-time substandard environmental conditions and how their experience of the neighborhood shapes their engagement in environmental revitalization projects. This comparison of three neighborhoods in Barcelona, Boston, and Havana shows that activists in all three places intend for their environmental endeavors to express grief at the loss of community, fears of erasure, and emotional connection and feelings of responsibility to place.

AB  - A cat with a history of seizures and clinical suspicion of forebrain disorder underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging. A space-occupying lesion was identified in the left temporal lobe. The mass was surgically removed, and cytological, histological and immunohistochemical examinations documented the presence of Toxoplasma gondii. A definitive diagnosis of an intracranial T gondii granuloma was made. The cat was treated with clindamycin and phenobarbital and the seizures did not recur. After 10 months, a second magnetic resonance imaging showed severe brain atrophy, but T gondii granuloma recurrence was not noted. Twenty-one months after surgery, the cat?s condition deteriorated, and another magnetic resonance imaging showed a presumptive recurrence of T gondii granuloma. In cats, T gondii granuloma must be considered as a differential diagnosis even when only a single intracranial mass is present. Cytology and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in making a definitive diagnosis and to follow the evolution of the lesion.

AB  - Abstract In the last 15 years there has been a relative explosion in the number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and developments related to cerebral perfusion. Given the variety of perfusion methods available, it is often difficult to decide which technique would be best for a particular clinical question or patient. In this review article we discuss the more common techniques, review how they are performed, and summarize the optimal technique or techniques for a variety of clinical situations. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Purpose It is well known that pathological changes in tissue alter its mechanical properties. This holds also true for brain tissue. In case of the brain, however, obtaining information about these properties is hard due to the surrounding cranial bone. In this paper a novel technique to create an imaging contrast based on the aforementioned properties is presented. Methods The method is based on an excitation of the brain induced by a short fall. The response of the brain tissue is measured using a motion sensitive MRI sequence. Results The new method is tested by measurements on phantom material as well as on healthy volunteers. In a proof of principle experiment the capability of the approach to identify local alterations in the mechanical properties is shown by means of measurements on meningioma patients. Conclusion The presented results show the feasibility of the novel method. Even in this early state of the proposed method, comparisons of measurements on meningioma patients with intraoperative palpation suggest that meningioma tissue responds differently to the excitation depending on their mechanical properties.
