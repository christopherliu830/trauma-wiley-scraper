AB  - Purpose It is well known that pathological changes in tissue alter its mechanical properties. This holds also true for brain tissue. In case of the brain, however, obtaining information about these properties is hard due to the surrounding cranial bone. In this paper a novel technique to create an imaging contrast based on the aforementioned properties is presented. Methods The method is based on an excitation of the brain induced by a short fall. The response of the brain tissue is measured using a motion sensitive MRI sequence. Results The new method is tested by measurements on phantom material as well as on healthy volunteers. In a proof of principle experiment the capability of the approach to identify local alterations in the mechanical properties is shown by means of measurements on meningioma patients. Conclusion The presented results show the feasibility of the novel method. Even in this early state of the proposed method, comparisons of measurements on meningioma patients with intraoperative palpation suggest that meningioma tissue responds differently to the excitation depending on their mechanical properties.

AB  - Serial MRI facilitates the in vivo analysis of the intra- and intersubject evolution of traumatic brain injury lesions. Despite the availability of MRI, the natural history of experimental focal contusion lesions in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) rat model has not been well described. We performed CCI on rats and MRI during the acute to chronic stages of cerebral injury to investigate the time course of changes in the brain. Female Wistar rats underwent CCI of their left motor cortex with a flat impact tip driven by an electromagnetic piston. In vivo MRI was performed at 7?T serially over 6?weeks post-CCI. The appearances of CCI-induced lesions and lesion-associated cortical volumes were variable on MRI, with the percentage change in cortical volume of the CCI ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side ranging from 18% within 2?h of injury on day 0 to a peak of 35% on day 1, and a trough of ?28% by week 5/6, with an average standard deviation of ±14% at any given time point. In contrast, the percentage change in cortical volume of the ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side in control rats was not significant (1?±?2%). Hemorrhagic conversion within and surrounding the CCI lesion occurred between days 2 and 9 in 45% of rats, with no hemorrhage noted on the initial scan. Furthermore, hemorrhage and hemosiderin within the lesion were positive for Prussian blue and highly autofluorescent on histological examination. Although some variation in injuries may be technique related, the divergence of similar lesions between initial and final scans demonstrates the inherent biological variability of the CCI rat model.

AB  - Abstract Background With an aging population increasing presentations of cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can be expected to old age services. While progress has been made in recent years in relation to the understanding and development of aetiological theories, classification, assessment and management strategies and protocols in the adult population, similar advances have lagged behind for the elderly. Aims To review the adult literature regarding PTSD and discuss how this might apply to an elderly population. An attempt is made to highlight a better awareness of the field of psychological trauma in the elderly in the hope of stimulating debate and research. Method A review of the adult literature is conducted relating to classification, aetiology, demographic features, vulnerability, assessment, clinical management including psychotherapy and medications and how these may apply to the elderly. Results Little has been published in this field that directly relates to the elderly. The adult literature allows insight into understanding how PTSD may present in the elderly, and how they may be managed. Conclusions Further specific research is needed in the elderly in order to facilitate a better understanding of PTSD that present in this unique population. This will lead to better clinical assessment, management and treatment provision. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background In the era of frequent head-to-pelvis computed tomography (CT) for adult blunt trauma evaluation, we sought to update teachings regarding aortic injury by determining 1) the incidence of aortic injury; 2) the proportion of patients with isolated aortic injury (without other concomitant thoracic injury); 3) the clinical implications of aortic injury (hospital mortality, length of stay [LOS], and rate of surgical interventions); and 4) the screening value of traditional risk factors/markers (such as high-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on chest x-ray [CXR]) for aortic injury, compared to newer criteria from the recently developed NEXUS Chest CT decision instrument (DI). Methods We conducted a preplanned analysis of patients prospectively enrolled in the NEXUS Chest studies at 10 Level I trauma centers with the following inclusion criteria: age > 14 years, blunt trauma within 6 hours of ED presentation, and receiving chest imaging during ED trauma evaluation. Results Of 24,010 enrolled subjects, 42 (0.17%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13% to 0.24%) had aortic injury. Most patients (79%, 95% CI = 64% to 88%) had an associated thoracic injury, with rib fractures, pneumothorax/hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion occurring most frequently. Compared to patients without aortic injury this cohort had similar mortality (9.5%, 95% CI = 3.8% to 22.1% vs. 5.8%, 95% CI = 5.4% to 6.3%), longer median hospital LOS (11 days vs. 3 days, p < 0.01), and higher median Injury Severity Score (29 vs. 5, p < 0.001). High-energy mechanism and widened mediastinum on CXR had low sensitivity for aortic injury (76% [95% CI = 62% to 87%] and 33% [95% CI = 21% to 49%], respectively), compared to the NEXUS Chest CT DI (sensitivity 100% [95% CI = 92% to 100%]). Conclusions Aortic injury is rare in adult ED blunt trauma patients who survive to receive imaging. Most ED aortic injury patients have associated thoracic injuries and survive to hospital discharge. Widened mediastinum on CXR and high-energy mechanism have relatively low screening sensitivity for aortic injury, but the NEXUS Chest DI detected all cases.

AB  - Abstract Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a severe systemic disorder developing apparently exclusively in patients in advanced renal failure who receive a gadolinium chelate contrast-enhancing agent for magnetic resonance imaging. Some other apparent risk factors have been identified but their status remains uncertain. Physicians are frequently confronted with patients at risk of NSF who need imaging. An approach to planning imaging in patients at risk to develop NSF is outlined.

AB  - Purpose: To compare calculated effective doses for pediatric CT exams using the new and old ICRP recommendations. Methods and Materials: A total of 178 pediatric patients who underwent trauma CT studies were analyzed retrospectively. Subjects were divided into 6 groups according to the type of exams performed, ranging from only a head scan to a full body assessment (head/face/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis). Two versions of ImPACT software (ImPACT CT, version 0.99x & 1.0) were used to analyze study data and extract the effective dose: the older version used ICRP-60 to calculate effective doses whereas ImPACT 1.0 used ICRP-103 recommendations. The correction factors for pediatrics, which are included in spreadsheet, were applied to obtain the equivalent pediatric effective dose. A paired student's t-test was used with significance threshold set at 0.01. Results: Pediatric effective doses using ICRP 103 were found to be significantly different from those calculated with ICRP 60 (p < 0.01) for the following scan groups: head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis, head/chest/abdomen/pelvis, head/neck, head/face, and head only. The difference in effective doses of full body group (head/face/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis) was not found to be significant (p = 0.035).Conclusion: Our analysis showed that the calculated effective doses from CT studies using the newer ICRP 103 differed significantly from the old ICRP recommendations. The only scans which did not exhibit significant difference (p>0.01) were when face scans were included in the ?full body? scan. This is probably due to the fact that the new tissue weighting factors of face organs did not change significantly from ICRP-60. However, when only a head and face scans were performed, the difference was found to be highly significant most likely because of the inclusion of the brain and salivary glands, which accounted for a larger contribution of the received doses from head than face scan, in the new ICRP weighting factors.

AB  - Summary Determining truth is an essential part of many human interactions and endeavors. Unfortunately, lying and deception are common in society, and generally difficult to identify. A scientific, objective means of distinguishing truth from lies would have profound implications for the legal system as well as for society as a whole. The traditional polygraph is fraught with problems, and is typically excluded from court proceedings. In the last decade, researchers have developed functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques that suggest the possibility of accurately identifying the neural activation patterns associated with lying. However, at present many questions about the feasibility of these techniques for real-world use remain, and it would be premature to allow their use in court.

Outcome A 70-year-old male showed infarctions in the cerebellum bilaterally and the right hypothalamus on the sixth day after an injury with no fracture of the cervical spine, and bilateral dissection of the vertebral arteries was diagnosed. A 74-year-old male showed infarctions in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery 2 days after injury with fractures of the cervical spine (C2 and C3) and was diagnosed as having artery-to-artery embolism based on dissection of the right vertebral artery. Conclusion Head and neck injury is a very common presentation in the emergency department. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography is an effective screening imaging method for vertebral artery dissection that should be carried out on arrival in every patient with fracture of the cervical spine, and even considered in doubtful cases with no fracture.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study The microbiota plays a key role in health and disease. Probiotics are a potential way to therapeutically modify the intestinal microbiota and prevent disease. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotics on the bacterial microbiota of foals during and after administration. Study design Randomised placebo controlled field trial. Methods Thirty-eight healthy neonatal foals enrolled in a previous study were selected. The foals had received a multi-strain probiotic (four Lactobacillus spp. 3?4 ? 103 colony-forming units (cfu)/g each, Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis, 1 ? 103?4 cfu/g) or placebo once daily for 3 weeks. A total of 3 faecal samples were collected from each foal at 2-week intervals and assessed via metagenomic sequencing. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare data between treatment groups. Results There were no changes on the phylum, order or class level between treatment groups at any age (all P>0.05) but some significant changes in relative abundance of families. Probiotic administration did not result in an increased relative abundance of lactobacilli or bifidobacteria at any age (Lactobacillus: P = 0.9, P = 0.1 and P = 0.2, Bifidobacterium: P = 0.3, P = 0.6 and P = 0.1 for Weeks 2, 4 and 6, respectively). Lactobacillus was enriched in the probiotic group at Week 6 on LEfSe analysis (linear discriminant analysis score 0.34, P = 0 .02). There was no effect on alpha diversity (all P>0.2) or community structure when parsimony and unifrac analysis were applied (all P>0.6). Conclusions There were limited effects of probiotic treatment on the bacterial microbiota of foals. The studied probiotic based on lactobacilli and bifidobacteria has a limited potential for therapeutic modification of the gastrointestinal microbiota.

AB  - Introduction: The use of preprocedural CT or MR imaging to generate patient-specific cardiac anatomy greatly facilitates catheter ablation of the left atrium and pulmonary veins (LA-PVs) to treat atrial fibrillation (AF). This report details the accuracy and utility of an intraprocedural means to generate 3-D volumetric renderings of the LA-PV anatomy: contrast-enhanced rotational X-ray angiography (3DRA). Methods and Results: Preprocedural CT or MR imaging and intraprocedural rotational angiography was performed in 42 patients undergoing AF ablation procedures. Initially, pulmonary artery (PA) bolus-chase contrast injections were performed (20 mL, 20 mL/s) to establish pulmonary transit time and cardiac isocentering. Depending on cardiac size, either a single PA injection (80?100 mL, 20 mL/s) or two separate dedicated left/right PA branch injections were performed (60 mL each, 20 mL/s). For the latter, the two volumes of the left/right portions of the LA-PVs were registered and fused. LA-PV 3DRA images were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison with CT/MR images. The majority of the 3DRA acquisitions (71%) were deemed at least ?useful? in delineating the LA-PV anatomy. The LA appendage was delineated in 57% of the cases. A blinded quantitative comparison of PV ostial diameters resulted in an absolute difference of only 2.7 ± 2.3 mm, 2.2 ± 1.8 mm, 2.4 ± 2.2 mm, and 2.2 ± 2.3 mm for the left-superior, left-inferior, right-superior, and right-inferior PVs, respectively. The feasibility for registering the 3DRA image with real-time electroanatomical mapping was also demonstrated. Conclusion: Intraprocedural contrast-enhanced rotational angiography provides volumetric 3-D images of the LA-PVs of comparable diagnostic value to dedicated preprocedural CT/MR imaging.

AB  - Summary The collagen fibre network is an important part of extracellular matrix (ECM) on trabecular bone surface. The geometry features of the network can provide us insights into its physical and physiological properties. However, previous researches have not focused on the geometry and the quantitative description of the collagen fibre network on trabecular bone surface. In this study,we developed a procedure to quantitatively describe the network and verified the validity of the procedure. The experiment proceeds as follow. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to acquire submicron resolution images of the trabecular surface. Then, an image analysing procedure was built to extract important parameters, including, fibre orientation, fibre density, fibre width, fibre crossing numbers, the number of holes formed by fibre s, and the area of holes from AFM images. In order to verify the validity of the parameters extracted by image analysing methods, we adopted two other methods, which are statistical geometry model and computer simulation, to calculate those same parameters and check the consistency of the three methods? results. Statistical tests indicate that there is no significant difference between three groups. We conclude that, (a) the ECM on trabecular surface mainly consists of random collagen fibre network with oriented fibres; (b) our method based on image analysing can be used to characterize quantitative geometry features of the collagen fibre network effectively. This method may provide a basis for quantitative investigating the architecture and function of collagen fibre network.

AB  - Abstract Therapeutic approaches to cerebral edema require an understanding of both the magnitude and location of changes in brain water content. It is desirable to have a sensitive, accurate means of measuring brain water noninvasively so that effective therapies for cerebral edema in stroke, head trauma, and other conditions can be investigated. In this work, a three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging technique that is able to provide both spin density and T1 simultaneously is described. This method was used to quantitate regional changes in brain water content in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Brain water contents estimated from both relative spin density and relative T1 measurements made in vivo were compared with ex vivo measurements of relative tissue water content based on the wet-dry technique. Correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.98 were obtained between the wet-dry measurements and magnetic resonance measurements of T1 and spin density, respectively. Notably, the slope of the relationship between T1 and tissue water content changed dramatically after the injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent while precontrast and postcontrast spin density measurements remained essentially invariant. In addition, a plot of absolute spin density (obtained by normalizing spin density from agar gelatin phantoms of different water contents to the spin density of a sample of 100% water) was linearly related to wet-dry measurements with a slope of 0.99 (R2 = 0.99).

AB  - Purpose Inversion recovery-based UTE (IR-UTE) sequences have been proposed to directly image myelin with extremely short (~0.3 ms). In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of complex echo subtraction to improve 3D IR-UTE imaging of myelin in white matter of the brain in vivo. Methods In IR-UTE imaging, long T2 components in white matter (i.e., water) are suppressed using an adiabatic inversion recovery preparation pulse. Dual echo UTE data acquisition and magnitude echo subtraction are used to suppress the residual white matter and gray matter signals, providing high myelin contrast. Complex echo subtraction may further improve the myelin contrast by reducing the residual long T2 water signal contamination caused by regional T1 variations. To verify the efficacy of the complex subtraction technique, in vivo experiments were performed with 5 non-symptomatic healthy volunteers and 5 multiple sclerosis patients on a 3T clinical MR system. Signal enhancement between the complex subtraction and the magnitude subtraction was introduced to evaluate the improvement. Results The complex subtraction improved myelin contrast over the magnitude subtraction in both healthy and patient groups, with more fine myelin structures being revealed. The foci of the demyelinated lesion were more clearly detected by complex subtraction. An average signal enhancement of up to 135.9% was achieved with the complex subtraction over the magnitude subtraction. Conclusion The complex echo subtraction improves 3D IR-UTE morphologic imaging of myelin in white matter of the brain.

AB  - The success of a robust vertebrate inflammatory response is in part because of the migratory potential of its haematopoietic components. Once these cells converge at an inflammatory site, they interact with each other as well as non-immune tissues and infectious agents to help manage both the scale and the duration of any ensuing response. Exactly how these blood cells, that constitute the innate and adaptive immune systems, contribute to such immune responses remain largely unknown. Traditionally, assessing these contributions relied upon histological analysis of fixed tissue sections complemented with in vitro dynamic data. Although informative, translating results from these studies into the multicellular whole-animal setting remain difficult. Recently, non-invasive live imaging of the immune system in animal models is providing significant insights into how immune cells function within their intact natural environment. Although the majority of these studies have been conducted within mice, another vertebrate, the zebrafish Danio rerio is being recognized as an ideal platform for non-invasive live imaging applications. The optical transparency, rapid development, genetic tractability and highly conserved innate and adaptive immune systems of this well-established developmental model have been exploited in a number of recent studies evaluating the immunocompetence of fluorescently tagged blood cells. In addition, similar live imaging studies are helping to dissect the ontogeny of blood-cell development by tracking various haematopoietic precursor cells to assess their contribution to different blood lineages. This review will examine some recent advances that have helped D. rerio emerge as a live imaging platform as well as its potential to offer valuable insights into the genetics behind diseases associated with immune cell dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents a tentative understanding of the characteristics of the extreme traumas, elsewhere called ?complex PTSD?, that some refugees and asylum-seekers bring into therapy. It suggests that these kinds of traumas suffered during adulthood may involve a disintegration of the self and a loss of ?psychic skin?. This conceptualization is derived from the treatment of a refugee who survived multiple extreme traumas and with whom efforts were made in therapy to identify a complex methodology making use of supplementary therapeutic tools in addition to individual psychotherapy. The case demonstrates how the disintegration of self implies not only a deep somato-psychic dissociation, but also a loss of intrapsychic and interpersonal space. In the treatment this was worked through via repetition of the victim-aggressor dynamics at multiple levels. In the end, the therapeutic context was structured like a set of concentric layers, creating a ?bandage? over the patient's wounds whilst his ?psychic skin? was able to regenerate. The conditions triggered by extreme traumas in refugees challenge some of the cornerstones of individual psychoanalytic technique, as well as the idea that individual therapy may be thought of as existing in an environmental vacuum.

AB  - Objectives To compare the progression-free survival of dogs with high-grade T-cell lymphoma treated with either a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone-based or a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine chemotherapy protocol. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, cases were selected based on histologic or cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma, T-cell phenotype, hypercalcaemia, or both, and no previous chemotherapy for lymphoma. Treatment was not randomly allocated. Results Seventy-three dogs were included in this study: 50 in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 23 in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. The median progression-free survival was 133?days for dogs in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 97?days for dogs in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. When golden retrievers (n?=?16) were evaluated ?separately, progression-free survival was longer in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone versus mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine treatment group (median PFS 154?days versus 70.5 days, respectively). Clinical Significance The progression-free survival time for dogs with multi-centric T-cell lymphoma treated with a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine protocol was similar to that of dogs treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Further studies, including those evaluating golden retrievers separately, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) and T2 mapping are accurate techniques for measuring cartilage thickness in the metacarpus3/metatarsus3 (Mc3/Mt3) of Thoroughbred racehorses. Twenty-four Mc3/Mt3 cadaver specimens were acquired from six healthy racehorses. Cartilage thickness was measured from postintra-articular Gd-DTPA2? images acquired using short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and proton density weighted (PDw) sequences, and compared with cartilage thickness measured from corresponding histologic images. Two observers performed each histologic measurement twice at three different sites, with measurement times spaced at least 5 days apart. Histologic cartilage thickness was measured at each of the three sites from the articular surface to the bone?cartilage interface, and from the articular surface to the mineralized cartilage interface (tidemark). Intra-observer repeatability was good to moderate for dGEMRIC where Mc3/Mt3 cartilage was not in contact with the proximal phalanx. Where the Mc3/Mt3 cartilage was in contact with the proximal phalanx cartilage, dGEMRIC STIR and T2 mapping PDw cartilage thicknesses of Mc3/Mt3 could not be measured reliably. When measured from the articular surface to the bone?cartilage interface, histologic cartilage thickness did not differ from STIR or PDw cartilage thickness at the site where the Mc3/Mt3 cartilage surface was separated from the proximal phalanx cartilage (P > 0.05). Findings indicated that dGEMRIC STIR and T2 mapping PDw are accurate techniques for measuring Mc3/Mt3 cartilage thickness at locations where the cartilage is not in direct contact with the proximal phalanx cartilage.
